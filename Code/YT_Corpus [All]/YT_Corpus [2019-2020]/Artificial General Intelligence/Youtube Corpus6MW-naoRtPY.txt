 hey everyone hope you had a beautiful day first of all happy Dussehra to all of yours and you families guys so welcome to this live session by Intellipaat my name is Anirudh Rao and I'll be walking you through a session on how you can start your carrier and artificial intelligence guys we will keep the video very concise and dippity and go about understanding what it takes to have one of the best carriers out there guys before we begin make sure you hit that subscribe button and the bell icon so that you are notified at all times so without further ado let's begin by checking out the agenda for this session so we'll quickly start out by having an introduction to artificial intelligence second we can check out the current trends that we have with respect to artificial intelligence around us third we can check out what are the steps to actually become an artificial intelligence engineer and fourth something very interesting we can check out the salaries of an artificial intelligence or engineer we can check out the jobs that are available in the market and so much more guys so make sure you stay tuned till the end and on that note or we can quickly start out by having an introduction to artificial intelligence so what do you think is artificial intelligence guys I think whenever someone talks about artificial intelligence or this is what we pretty much discuss right so artificial intelligence has been so certainly integrated into our lives that we don't even notice it anymore or there was a time before when people used to say artificial intelligence is the future guys think about it we are in that future right now artificial intelligence is already here it is no more ahead in the future or any of those talks but to give you an example right so I have my phone right next to me a my iPhone right next to me so if I go ahead and say hey Siri right now that is artificial intelligence picking it up and then Siri will pretty much open up and you know if I say whether she is going to give me the wether and so much more the most important reason or we are here in this session is to find out the career path that we can take as artificial intelligence engineers guys so you might have heard the statement artificial intelligence is the best carrier path of this decade so can we validate that sure that's the pretty much you know that's the goal of the session today and artificial intelligence has the biggest community ever so strong statement right it has the biggest community ever so how what is this community about how can we engage in this community how can we make a beautiful carrier that we love we love coding so we can pretty much have a career entirely based on what we love right artificial intelligence is this amazing thing that will be walking you through today nice so coming to the formal definition of what is artificial intelligence this is the definition you will pretty much pick up every time you see an artificial intelligence case so it consists of the theory it consists of the development which you know revolve around computer systems and these systems are expected to do tasks very easily as human humans do it it may be something such as you know or requiring human intelligence to do it I mean we be programming it for that it will be pretty much having visual perception let's say face detection speech recognition decision-making you can expect a computer which runs on zeros and ones to make a decision for you and these decisions are so huge sometime they are mission critical guys so you can have a decision either to abort or continue with our say say something like a rocket launch right so imagine all these people sitting on the rocket and they're sitting on tons of oxygen fuel right so they're taking off and there's something wrong with the system so you need to have something there with that computer which is working at those harsh conditions telling them either they need to continue it so or not so decision making from a very simple true/false statement all the way it will taking man to the moon or you know man to Mars so much more and computers right here can do it for us we are already living in that age and then think of translations between languages right now let me give you a very nice example of translation between languages so a couple of months back I was actually during the Russia and I do not know Russian I am I am a native Indian so I do not know Russian you need to know about this very beautiful app called as google translate we pretty much Google it out but then we do not have the app with us so as soon as you go over and install that app it has analysis it will just be such nicely put you just need to or you know pretty much go about just scanning and opening up your camera and just showing or Russian text and in real time this Russian text is converted to English for you so with Russia again couple of places where there is absolutely zero English so then you can pretty much talk to your phone in English it will convert it to Russian and then talk to the Russian for you I'm just giving you a very good example of AI in which I practically used so think about it I mean it's just one but then I can give you n number of you know situations and reason as a developer or as a end user that artificial intelligence has helped me so much and it's so much fun to work with as well I pretty much love working with anything data science anything artificial intelligence so on that note of where is all this love for artificial intelligence coming from the first thing to answer that is we need to know what a trending right now guys so here I have a chart from Forbes calm and this is pretty much sure giving us the revenues that artificial intelligence is creating for all of the enterprise applications right so this is a worldwide chart this goes all the way from 2016 and it has been predicted about six years from now which is 2025 and do note that all the numbers that you see on your screen are on millions of US dollars guys so look at the revenue we generated in twenty sixteen it's around or 357 million dollars just go to 2025 and look at the project it's cause it's thirty one thousand two hundred million US dollars so this is the market for artificial intelligence guys so you might be wondering how true the prediction is guys well it's forbes.com they are the most accurate now in a prediction no system on the market right now and I would tossed it I would trust this wholely guys and if you look at the chart it is unreal it is an exponential increase so we going within like what five years let's say 2016 to 2021 we went from 350 all the way of seven thousand seven hundred million dollars if this is the jump for the next five years think about think about the future guys think about ten years from now twenty five think think about twenty thirty five and so much more right now artificial intelligence is the biggest boon there is and hey guys I've been through a couple of surveys as well so as per these surveys pretty much what is the best carrier you can have is artificial intelligence so everywhere people say I am an artificial intelligence engineer I am having fun you know I am working or with my day job which I absolutely love and then work with and I'm being paid for it as well so so this is the word which goes around when it comes to artificial intelligence guys so or what do you guys think about it probably take take just a couple of seconds ahead to the live chat and let me know what you guys are you know think about artificial intelligence on the whole I am sure that every one of our viewers your have so many queries about artificial intelligence right so this entire word has this sort of curiosity which is wrapping around now and as it generates this sort of curiosity around it and every time even even whenever I have general conversations with people respect or with respect to artificial intelligence the conversation always ends in such a way that we are still left flabbergasted regarding wait how can I start a career and this is sounds amazing so pretty much I talk with a lot of management people you know I have a couple of friends who are all you know who work on the management sides for human resource people and they are interested they were like oh damn I need to do something about this so if it can bring a management person to the technical side then I'm sure you guys are you know that there is some magic going on here that will keep us interested guys so here is another row very interesting or a chart that I got from Scopus.com so this is the number of papers which are annually published so these are formal papers which get published in journals Oh somewhere around 2000 this year 2000 so there we had let's say around I would I ball it and say around 3000 papers are being published every year around the world or with respect to artificial intelligence and then just look at 2015 and I mean this is an older chart that that graph is this is going through the roof all the time so 2015 we had like what almost 20,000 people and I'm sure at somewhere around 35 over 40,000 people right now guys so what do you need to observe is this amazing incline when it comes to the number of technical papers that are being published so people want to get out there people want to learn people want to create their own thing and then publish a paper there is no other beautiful thing in this world and just giving your own technical paper knowing that you have something in your name and you know that can be a very nice bragging right that'll help the community and at the end of the day we are here to make the world a better place right so with respect to artificial intelligence come on you guys can do it it is an amazing simple concept ill be walking you through this in this entire session so take away as much as you can and I'm hoping this helps you all guys so you might have you might be students out here you know you might have students right now who might be having the question of how many papers get published can i publish a paper okay sure you can learning is everything and go for it so on that note I want to just give a just of how this entire career path will work guys so with respect to the first step that you'll pretty much be doing is again you start with education right so education is the foundation to everything you start out by learning about artificial intelligence you just know the definition now you need to know what artificial intelligence is how you can go over I mean it's a very big ocean it's a very vast ocean that you know if you can pretty much it's about this you know if you know swimming then you can go swimming in this entire ocean and you'll never run out of stamina day so that's that's a good analogy here so firstly you have to go about learning about artificial intelligence knowing where it is used so with every solution to a problem you need the problem right first you need to have a problem around which you can give a solution finding out that problem is the most challenging part about learning anything new or let it be deep learning let it be big data  it'll be machine learning anything so you need this new problem to be created or something that exists in the society that you can go on indulge yourself in and solve it right so learning about artificial intelligence is a very prime step that will help you do this secondly walk on projects and getting certified let me talk about working on projects so artificial intelligence or any such technological concepts or you know very importantly pretty much you should go about starting with you just getting your hands dirty guys so any amount of theory you keep learning you keep learning you pretty much might not go anywhere I mean I'm just talking to you with respect to you know my experience of getting into AI but then and the first I said remember the first moment I walked on my first Python project which was which was related vaguely related to artificial intelligence and I was taken aback you learned so much when you get your hands dirty with core and you can understand better you can relate better with respect to theory you cannot do much you understand what you see on your screen but within me get your hands on your projects you can change up the code you can play around you can have an entire playground around you where you can pretty much do anything if the program is asking you or to show apples or something you can ask your bananas come on so much the freedom is always there with respect to artificial intelligence guys and then after you get your hands working on projects the next important thing is to get certified this so to put yourself out in the market you need to work on projects that you've shown people that you've worked and then you get certified in the same by a reputed organization to know that you have actually put in the work done these projects on your own and you've established yourself in this market so you'll be selling yourself really or better with respect to this step three is very simple after you've done all of this you can kick-start your artificial intelligence carrier very simple by heading to all of the job trend sites and then I'll just be walking you through all of these steps or in a very expansive way in just about our slides from now so this is the question that you're supposed to be having right now in your mind guys so it's okay so hey I narrow that following you throughout this life session so how do I start with artificial intelligence so people are always stuck with how they can always start guys you might be a person who's you know getting out of college in college or you just might be a 50 year old person who's very interested to do something anymore now with respect to all of that let me help you to get on the fastest path to or you know get you ready for the industry to probably you might be just to find out more about artificial intelligence just to say it your curiosity or you are here for you know a hardcore experience of how you can start your career and actually make lots of money with it so how do we you know go about starting an artificial intelligence carrier guys oh the foundation that you need to know is again artificial intelligence is a lot of maths and a lot of code as well so the first important thing is you need to know a little bit of statistics a little bit of math using the statistics and math with respect to coding because the computer needs to understand we understand it very simply but then you need the computer to understand it right and then you need to mix all of these with respect to logic and you have to give this cognitive process to your machine where it can start understanding and doing stuff on its own so so that's really cool sounds very interesting right I mean even after all of these years of experience with respect to artificial intelligence every time I come to or you know take a session for the nascent learners this just holds me back so much right I love it guys so again the journey of artificial intelligence which always start with data science again well you don't need the entire working of data science for your artificial intelligence are same but then you will need certain basics case you will need to know languages such as R you need to know Python these will eventually help you to build all of the models that you will require later on so you might not have heard of the designation and artificial intelligence engineer guys so here are some of the very common or designations that you might not have known first it's the intelligence designer so an artificial intelligence engineer can also be called as an intelligence designer they can be called as data curators cognitive copywriters you know AI interaction designers so to say it your curiosity you can head to any of the job portals that anyway be walking you through a very famous job portal you can go there this type this in as your keyword and you will realize there are thousands of jobs for these keywords thousands guys it's not hundreds it's not you know tens of jobs it's thousands of jobs it's everywhere around the world so at this point of time you need to know that if you have the skills required for it people are willing to pay any amount and people are willing to relocate you to any part of the world to have you on board and it went to work with them guys anyway stay tuned until the end so I'll be walking you through all of the job opportunities and coming to the main goal of this session so what are the five steps that help you become an artificial intelligence engineer let's break it down into very simple terms so that everyone here can take away something from your the first step is to know all of these terms so you need to know that there is a programming language called R which exists we have Python again we have SQL structured query languages we have tableau so instead of being mixed out on all of these various sources you know hunting for or learning tutorials from here they're everywhere just stick to ones or structured sanitized portal which will teach you everything from scratch you need to know R is of a programming language again Python is one of the most amazing programming languages in my opinion I mean R is again very good but my personal preference is to Python but then you might be a person who is a hardcore fan of R as well then you need to know what SQL is you need to know what databases are how you can store your data how you can pull out your data from databases manipulate your data and then have your machine do it for you we can do it very quickly by you know writing something called as a query for our SQL or tables and databases but then your machine should do it for you and it has to pick up you know all of the data and everything as well that is very important again tableau is pretty much used to visualize all of your data you know give you very good graphs make it look very interesting at the end because see are usually 70% of the time I can tell you that a result of an artificial intelligence program is just numbers it will say 70% accuracy of detecting an apple in your image sure it sounds very simple but I mean you have complex use cases to see numbers all the time really doesn't make sense or let's say you have to explain it to your pure explain to your higher-ups or explain it to a nascent learner who has absolutely no idea what you're talking about but then if you are very nice-looking graphs there we of you have something very nice and interesting very colorful to look at and they'll be like whoa yeah now I understand right so we can all relate to this with respect to any aspect of our life just not artificial intelligence so on that note we have covered the first step we need to know all these technologies that exist the guys next step to step two is all about mathematics guys you might be wondering hey you know I'm not you know I'm not very good at mathematics what do I still have a chance for a carrier guys absolutely if you're here to train you just for this you'll be learning or I mean you need linear algebra you need probability unique statistics you need calculus you need graphs here you need to know optimization you need to know so much more but at the same time do not be taken aback in case you are not familiar with any of these because then these are very fancy terms but then when you break it down to they're simple now you know simple terms these are something these are concepts which are extremely easy to work with easy to understand so even a nascent learner can start up can understand everything that you know every single term that I've put up on my screen and start working with it directly guys so once you've covered the math part of it then it's very simple you can just have you know you can pretty much put it side by side with respect to the code and then have your code and math work along mix up very nicely gel with each other and then give you a very fine result guys so step one was knowing that a couple of programming languages are required step two was knowing that the math is required for this and then step three is a very interesting a so step three is knowing when you have your hands dirty on code and all of the logic and techniques that you need step three is very important because this is where you need to practice everything you need to go on testing yourself to know where you are with respect to practice I would suggest we just go to a couple of communities and then start showing your core there talk to people talk to subject matter experts talk to fellow developers fellow peers fellow learners this tell them what you're doing pretty much this is the most friendly community I have been a part of all my life and I can tell you that with full confidence case you can participate in Kaggle challenges and coming back to the communities we at Intellipaat have this amazing community just search for intellipaat community it and you will find us we have thousands of questions being posted by thousands of subject matter experts we have thousands of learners coming there on a daily basis answering their questions you know we have a general chat there as well so we can pretty much find out what's going on in the industry what is trending so at the end of the day I've seen a lot of Millennials chase down trends and guess what even the fortune 500 companies are doing this so knowing hunting for what's trending learning on it working on it practicing on it is very important guys so testing yourself with all of these you know being a part of community or knowing that let's say you just started your first or the algorithm learning with respect to artificial intelligence keep testing yourself on that get better at it work step by step and you will have a paved a very nice path for your artificial intelligence carrier race so that brings us to step four after you've learned got your hands dirty or pretty much you know have your testing done have your practicing done all of that to sell yourself to the world now you would always need a certification guys you will need a certification from a well-known organization that can vouch for you watch on behalf of you telling that telling the world that you have actually done work on this and then you pretty much have the skills that's required to directly get into the market and start working guys here is a sample course certificate or certification certificate that I have from Intellipaat or we have worked with IBM on this course and then I'll be anyway walking you through this entire thing in just a couple of minutes from now but then having a certificate like this having an authentic genuine certificate like this will help you sell yourself to the big guys guys so let's say you want to work at Facebook Google all these big places they pretty much pick you up and give you preference over someone who might not have a certification step four again is getting your certifications knowing that pretty much you know all the people around the world require you guys so or coming to Step five Step five is the important part of this the session where you actually go about selling yourself go to indeed.com go to naukari.com just tell people around the world that you are there your certification and this pretty much start your carrier way so let me quickly you know just open up ah the indeed website and I've just search for artificial intelligence out here so all you need to go is indeed.com slash you in the search artificial intelligence you are take a look at the average salary on the left hand side $70,000 $90,000 $100,000 hundred fifteen thousand hundred twenty-five thousand dollars guys we have almost two thousand or six hundred jobs which will offered you one hundred and twenty five thousand dollar or US dollars per annum and then your full-time jobs you have internships your contracts them guys the absolute location you can turn it to pretty much your city state or your zip code as well so here's the top things which comes up so again you can be your research scientist and artificial intelligence or you can be an automation you can have a very good internship with respect to Guardian life then you can you know have a summer or this thing as well internship as well artificial intelligence scientist artificial intelligence consultant at Accenture and Chicago guys the opportunities are endless out here anyway we'll be back to all of the people who are hiring just before that I need to tell you how the artificial intelligence concept is changing the world days so let's quickly jump to the next slide of how artificial intelligence is a revolution in this world we live in the first important point that you need to know at this point of time is that the arrival of artificial intelligence and the other concept the beautiful concept of machine learning has changed entirely the way businesses work so there was this time before where all of these were looked into the future so let's say there was a business meeting in a very big fortune finite company let's say ten fifteen years back they would have this person who would have the analysis for the next ten years and he would say hey ten years from now we will have implemented artificial intelligence in our business and we'll be running based on that I can tell you that guy was right because from then ten years till now we are using artificial intelligence on a day to day basis sometimes we don't even realize you know how artificial intelligence is being used and at the end of the day it has created a plethora of job opportunities in the market guys I just showed you right you have four these divisions of 15,000 job opportunities around the world again I want to make this very clear to you guys if you have the skills required you will be hired regardless of your place regardless of the salary you ask if you just have the skills which is required then people are hiring people are interested in you just go for it just learn everything master everything pick up a certification and at the end of it you will become an artificial intelligence engineer guys so you need to acquire the skill sets to demonstrate to the world that you know you have the mastery in the language guys so coming to the concept of how it actually changed the world the first important thing I think is sad BOTS right so here I am iPhone right next to me so I can pretty much say I can open up the Google assistant again this is a native Google platform then you have katana from Microsoft or if City series again a chatbot from the people at Apple then we have big speed for our Samsung users as well I mean or we might have our buyers read some people might like Siri some people might like katana and some people pretty much sure might like Google assistant as well hey look as soon as I said City my phone just woke up so again thinking about this guy's everything I am a fan of all four of these to be honest because it is very hard to come up with the chat board and makes your life so much easier I can just say hey Siri how's the weather right now pretty much I can say hey Siri set the alarm for me you know set a calendar so watch my 12 p.m. meeting doing tomorrow is that person turning up Siri can find out everything for you and Google assistant has something called as Auto responders right now as well so let's say you don't want to know I don't pretty much you're busy or you don't want to pick up a call Google assistant can pick up the call for you answer on behalf of you saying like this is what happening we'll just call you back later or something not not the regular Ortelli caller raw assistance we had before it can pretty much find out that you're in an office you're in a meeting and then you can pretty much inform your the person who's conducting you all of that this will do it automatically as well go down again for all his Windows users again I pretty much use a lot of Cortana when I'm working on my Windows machine again series a part of my daily life in app because I pretty much move about with my iPhone everywhere that's my business phone I carry so again sorry is a very important part of my daily life bigsby I use it for four months per say but not exactly a lot but then Bixby is beautiful Bixby also gets a voice right now so all these sad bots are helping you in your daily lives every single day UVU might not even know it you'll just be predictive text for example you go to Google and you're just entering a couple of 4x and it predicts what you will X may later as well and not just that if there are some fellow coders your we can pretty much already know that you know as soon as you let's say you've pretty much opened up microsoft.net framework and your visual studio and you're working on dotnet you can have your cold otto credited for you we can have python which predicts our code for us and then just makes your life so much simpler and artificial intelligence is right there and the second thing i can vote for sanders in terms of finance guys so I used to I used to be a trader before and I should do some very high-speed trading sessions and I know now that artificial is an artificial intelligence has come into the picture it makes high-speed trading sessions so much easier because with respect to pattern recognition again as even an expert in financial trading and all of these trading sessions you just look at it and sure you get a lot of information if you are a professional but then if you have a machine which can look at right from the origin of the stock let's say in 2000 and then bring you a predictive model all the way till 2019 you can have a very fair idea and you can have an upper hand with respect to others of how your stock will do whether you'll make money that they lose money that day sure stock market is very unpredictable but having that extra step and having a very high level of surety there will again help you very much guys it can predict as well so pattern recognition is with it being you know all these years of how the just talk and or share has traded and then with prediction you can tell pretty much here this is what the price might be in 2021 2022 so you can build your entire portfolio based on that this has already been implemented this is the right there you can pretty much you know had to Google and just start searching for these and you will get a lot of searches for these guys so people are there people are using it and Finance and the next very important thing of how artificial intelligence is changing the world around us as well to healthcare guys healthcare is extremely important in the world we live in right so I was just reading about this very interesting blog a couple of months back and it said that there was a very you know there was a revolutionary or detection with respect to all the programmers which happened where they say that they found out they can find out breast cancer very early even its nascent stages people can find it out and they can find out if it's benign which means harmless they can find out if it's malignant which means you know it's a very harmful cancer cell and this has never been done before and they say that your chances of surviving these cancer gets up to by sixty percent sixty percent is a huge number and when you're talking about all these you know probabilities with respect to medicine you you get ten twenty percent max right so they're giving you 60 percent of chances saying hey this is what your cancer cells are and come on guys so if you can relate to this I mean 60 70 percent of positive rates saying this is what is happening this is what is not happening and then all of these right so that's one very interesting thing I loved it I loved it I think it was about two weeks ago I read it and I was taken aback I just saw left an email to the developers as well asking them more you know if I could contribute in any way to that so that was really beautiful and then the next thing is tracking daily health case so we all wear our fitbit's we all wear our smartwatches we have for a couple of watches from Samsung we have an Apple watch and so much more right it will track your daily health it'll pretty much it'll remind you when you should drink water how much amount of what you should drink all the calories you've bought it will even tell you the route you took to office it will tell you if you have ran through her office I mean sure you can do that it'll tell you your morning run evening run your walking how much you can enter the calories that you're eating it will calculate how much calories you've poured it will start tracking your sleep cycles it'll do so much more for us guys and coming to the next thing is promoting welfare right again good health is good for everyone promoting welfare with respect to artificial intelligence using health care is again very important aspect here guys so in insist here's a very simple AI landscape that I have for you guys so from the left to the right is the amount of sophistication it takes to build all of these and we have the mass adaptation from down to up on the e y-axis chatbots again our mass and operators I already told you they use natural language processing and pretty much we go use our chat box every day and then personal assistants against serial X are so much more I can say hey Alexa turn on the lights and pretty much the lights are on before you go home you can turn on the heater before you even wake up so as soon as you wake up your water is ready and so much more then you have teh by Microsoft we have automated insights which uses machine learning NLP it works with structured data and then you have alpha go alpha goes pretty basically a game which is player and alphago pretty much beat the the world champion at this game so many times and pretty much you have trained the game to beat the master of the game that's so cool to learn then you have deep dream again deep dream is basically taking in all of the images of the world and then performing analysis on it we have autopilot by Tesla we have cars which can drive around ours and we know we do not need a cab driver anymore to you know pretty much or drivers around the world and there was a time when people used to say we will have automated cars and we already have automated cars just add in a couple of for in most of the world it's a it's sort of illegal to have a self-driving car just now and Google has been working on this for 10 years and over that I guess so knowing that the technology exists one is sure for everything there are certain constraints which hold us back but in knowing that something like this exists we using it as amazing then you have Einstein Einstein again contains all the collects all the pictures from the world makes sense of it learn something new gives us predictive analysis and so much more and then we have Watson Watson is by IBM and these guys have pretty much put put out Watson for everything from a very simple image classifier all the way till law what happens if we put man on Mars and then they pretty much perform analysis on something that complex as well so they pretty much use the continuous learning algorithms which comes under DPA and they pretty much use machine learning speech processing and so much more so who are the big names in artificial intelligence we're talking about all these big names pretty much right so what goes on to this there again we're all familiar with Amazon Amazon is a huge player giant probably the biggest in the world right now and they're invested in their consumer side and they pretty much now trying to bring in artificial intelligence for us as well the first important thing is alexa alexa is amazon's brainchild and they're pretty much use the artificial intelligence there to give us very good insights about how you can make your life easier with a machine around you and then Amazon Web Services you know these are pretty much a set of machine learning programs which are already trained on artificial intelligence services so this has helped a lot guys so AWS has so many clients guys they're more than 10,000 customers Simmons is their customers Netflix is a customer standard NFL NASA guys you tell me and they are the customer of AWS and I can sort of guarantee you that again predictive or advertisements as well and coming to Apple Apple again they have been acquiring all of these artificial intelligence startups that they can pretty much get their hands on because they are pretty much worth 2 1 trillion so think about it's alright they are a very critical part of our ecosystem right now I mean Apple is the biggest company observant comes to technology and they know that artificial intelligence is the future so they're pretty much acquiring all of the startups and they've worked extremely hard on developing products it's our city you know so much more now they have the tool called create it's a machine learning tool which the Mac OS and the iOS developers can basically use or you know to take our training courses for their apps and start building perhaps for them as well coming to Facebook we all use Facebook right so just couple of minutes before the session I was just hanging out a couple of for again machine learning and artificial intelligence groups on Facebook and resistor communicating with the people out there and then everyone who works at Facebook I have a couple of close friends who work here they say artificial intelligence will be enormous ly powerful in the future I sort of tell them that they stand corrected here because artificial intelligence is already enormously powerful right now we just need to make put it to very good use right so they have this research group or it's called as fa ir so facebook artificial intelligence research group and they say that they are extremely committed into you know looking at more into machine intelligence developing how new technologies can provide people with better ways to communicate and so much more they have developed pie tortoises again a Python API which is useful neural networks and this stands right and competition with our biggest competitor which is Google and therefore are they offensive Louis so on that note coming to Google again this is the largest most important artificial intelligence company on this list and it is the most obvious type because over the past couple of years by Mountain View we mean Google so they have created no fewer than you know twelve new AI companies so they have launched 12 new companies they made the most important purchase of four hundred million dollars and this was deep mind deep mind is again like alphago I pretty much saw is the board game which goes about playing the ego champion again and there's Google Spencer flow I am sure at least 80% of the people here know what tensorflow is and then enough tensorflow is free for all right it's been or free for a couple of couple of for yours now and then at the end of the day tensor AI chip project again for machine learning you can do machine learning on the go learn on it work on it create your new projects and so much more and Google is the biggest name or when it comes to that guys so quickly walking you through all the skill sets that takes to be an artificial intelligence program well firstly advanced programming concepts yes case you gonna need Python you're gonna need are even need SAS and so much more and worry not if you don't know this we are right here to teach you then you need good database proficiencies well you need to know how data is stored what a semi structured data what a structured data how you can go on working with this data and making your life better as well so then the next thing is machine learning algorithms you need to teach your machine how it can do the work for you it will learn every day every minute every iteration with respect to what you do and then go on to try doing it itself as well how cool is that and then you have dashboarding capabilities again knowing that all this data can be put and or put into a very nice form where everyone can see it and make sense out of it is amazing and the last making taking analytics out of the data is the best thing ever from you guys so knowing that you have certain useless data being converted into amazingly useful formation putting all these information in a really beautiful way to look at and making sense out of this I am sold race with respect to artificial intelligence your so let me quickly walk you through a couple of artificial intelligence job descriptions sure it's a job requirement from Simmons and these guys are the responsibilities you are again operate all around machine learning and artificial intelligence you know you'll be supporting automation orchestration of workflow across various cloud services as well again you pretty much enjoy working in agile devops environments you will be developing tool tool sets you'll be working with respect to automation will be working with respect to artificial intelligence you will keep yourself up to date with cutting-edge technologies by participating in conference sharing knowledge is best practices with the team look at that even a company as huge as cements it's pretty much expecting you as an artificial intelligence to stay up to date with all of your cutting-edge technologies they're out there on that note again here is another a quick job description from Highmark health so these guys say you need to be absolutely rigorous in terms of gathering your data or having good analytical skills having good synthesis skills and you will have to require experience with data visualization such as tableau you need power bi bi is basically business intelligence and then you need to know statistic packages you need to know all tricks you need your sass you need to have strong SQL skills as I just told you at the beginning you need to note error rate I you need to know Hadoop you need to know artificial intelligence with respect to Python Java and so much more look at these job requirements guys it sounds so fancy yet they are so reachable at the same time and your job requirement from Amazon so we'll be assisting customers by delivering their entire end-to-end project with respect to machine learning and deep learning as well you'll be using frameworks such as MX net cafe to or tensorflow

be working with everyone to give your machine that amount of that it can work by itself and make all of our jobs or very much easy this and this light is what you majority of you guys are waiting for right what is the average salary of an artificial intelligence you know engineer guys so 120 American thousand American dollars 120 thousand dollars in American it's pretty much the median salary of an artificial intelligence engineer again you have a data analyst who owns about seventy thousand dollars and a data engineer who owns about $95,000 and look at the fancy numbers out here they are reachable they are reachable you have internships for beginners you have junior roles for beginners you have job opportunities for intermediate people Andy and at the end of the day you know you have professional law your professional level sessions for your raw people your workforce who want to be trained and artificial intelligence who want to know more about it and get paid for it amazingly well as well guys so on that note who is hiring in India guys Yunus is desiring fractal law or fact ill analytics is hiring iBM is hiring Ernst and Young ey is hiring Edgewater is hiring music - hiring all as hiring right cool Siemens true color every one of these companies that we thought might never require artificial intelligence are hiring guys so let's say all are right there a cab company that can provide a company they will use artificial intelligence and pretty much they can know where the customers are coming from what is the hot spot in the city where they need to put more cabs what is the shortest route that you can know they they work with Google basically on the Maps API what is the shortest route the cab can take this again can help the environment as well they started carpooling so carpooling will again help more people come into which is one car and move around this again is a very good environmental factor as well and it saves a lot of money for Olas it's a lot of money for the people who are using it again mu sigma are the very good analytics company oracle the biggest network company probably simmons trueCaller even two color ones artificial intelligence these days guys and all these guys are actively hiring for an artificial intelligence engineers too so keep in the loop know what they're hiring for and go for it guys and for the rest of the world instantly I was hiring LinkedIn is hiring printers desiring why bur whatsapp Evernote people at Google basically working on Android Twitter our tumblr WeChat Facebook I'm just like to name all these companies YouTube is hiring Vimeo is hiring Amazon is hiring all these guys are always there in the market I am so astounded by whenever I you know go for our job site and start looking for

forever with us and you get so much more so we have a couple of course advisors up so again David Callaghan is pretty much a hyper ledger and the Big Data Solutions Architect and then so much more so about the course will be checking out artificial intelligence domain how data science is helping us importance of pipes and efficient design of machine learning SAS tools for analytics working with tableau ms excel calculations are statistics let me just quickly walk you through our raw index case so we have data science with our we have will be learning about Python you'll be learning about everything about there is to know about machine learning guys look at this so pretty much you'll set up everything from the basics pandas introduction supervised learning classification to regression decision tree random forests need come on it goes on and on right you'll come to know the products that we'll be working on as well you'll be learning artificial intelligence deep learning with tensorflow again look at look at all of these things that you will be exposed to and knowing that you pretty much can do something on your own is amazing right we'll be learning SAS excel tableau and so much more less at the end of it let's say around 23 weeks with the instructor-led training you can become a certified artificial intelligence engineer who has a accredited certificate by IBM and you can pretty much use this and this is recognized in all the big companies Cisco Congress and music magenta tex aware sony ericsson and so much more as well guys so pretty much you will gonna need a certification you can pretty much click on the link in the description box below right now to check out a master staining program and then you will be all your way to become an artificial intelligence engineers guys so I'll be amazed to see most of you down there and on this note thank you so much for attending this live session I hope you have a beautiful day ahead if you have any queries we are
