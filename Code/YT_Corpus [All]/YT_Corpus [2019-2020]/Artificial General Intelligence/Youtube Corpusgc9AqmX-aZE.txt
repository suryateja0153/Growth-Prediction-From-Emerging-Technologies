 artificial intelligence yeah pros and cons we've heard people talk about the great benefits we've heard about disrupting and changing and leaving us all in a jobless society we've heard autonomous weapons or a disaster yeah where do you fall on the on your vision of we're in artificial intelligence is going to go and also some of the I think some of the more cautionary ounces and benefits that well and you mentioned a few things there each of those is worth visiting because they're different I think autonomous weapons are extremely scary I think it's a big and you'd by the way do not need general AI so right now the things that we know how to do you would you should think of those things of what is called narrow AI things like machine vision and so on to build incredibly scary autonomous weapons you do not need general AI the techniques that we already know and understand are perfectly adequate and these weapons some of the ideas that people have these weapons are in fact very scary and so I don't know what the solution that but smart people need to be thinking about that doing a lot of R&D is there is there a kind of you know multi it would have to be a big treaty like the Geneva Convention or something that would help regulate these weapons because you they're actually they have a lot of issues so that one I think is genuinely scary the idea that there's going to be a general AI Overlord that subjugates us or kills us all I think is not something to worry about I think that is overhyped I I'm first of all we don't know we're nowhere close to knowing how to build a general AI something that could set its own objectives we have no idea it wouldn't even it's not even hardly it's not even a valid research area we're so we're so far back on that one so that's a I think that's a very long-term prospect that it could even happen but second of all I think it's unlikely that such a thing first instincts would be to exterminate us as it seems though it seems surprising to me maybe employers much more likely it will help us you know because we know we're perfectly capable of hurting ourselves so you know maybe we could use some help so I'm optimistic about that one and certainly don't think we need to worry about it today and then the jobless you know is are we gonna say I going to put everybody out of work I am not worried about this I find the people who all of us I include myself we are so unimaginative about what future jobs are going to look like and what they're going to be you know if I took you back in time a hundred years when everyone almost everyone was a farmer and I told you know we're having we're at some big farming convention or something and I say in the year 2018 there is going to be a job occupation called massage therapist they would not have believed you and in fact I was telling this story to a friend they said Jeff forget massage therapist there are dog psychiatrists and I went I would probably find one on Amazigh wouldn't look that up on the Internet sure enough you can easily hire a psychiatrist for your dog and so what you know there is where we we humans like to do things and we like to be productive and we will figure out things to do and we will use these tools to make ourselves more powerful and and in fact what I predict is that jobs will get more engaging yes because you have to remember you know a lot of the jobs today are are quite routine they are not necessarily anybody's as I said before career or calling and so I predict that because of artificial intelligence and its ability to automate certain tasks that in the past were impossible to automate not only will we have a much wealthier civilization but that the quality of work will go up very significantly and that a higher fraction of people will have callings and careers relative to today so on Big Ideas artificial intelligence is something that I think has captured the imagination of Washington and probably the rest of the country in world what is what is Amazon's approach to artificial intelligence well this is artificial intelligent official intelligence this is it is a renaissance it is a golden age we are now solving problems with machine learning and artificial intelligence that were you know kind of in the realm of science fiction for the last several decades and natural language understanding machine vision problems it really is it is an amazing Renaissance and for decades AI researchers kind of struggled and made very very slow progress and over the last 10 years it you know it looks like one of those s curves you're just making a lot of progress for a rapidly over the last ten years the machine learning and AI is a horizontal enabling layer it will empower and improve every business every work of a government organization every philanthropy every basically there's no institution in the world that cannot be improved with machine learning so the Amazon you know some of the things we're doing are super obvious so they're kind of superficially obvious and they're and they're interesting and they're cool and you should pay attention to I'm thinking about things like Alexa and echo you know our voice assistant I thinking about our autonomous primary delivery drones those things use a trim amount of machine learning machine vision systems natural language understanding and a bunch of other techniques and those but those are kind of the showy ones and I would say a lot of the value that we're getting from machine learning is actually happening you know kind of beneath the surface and it is things like improved search results improved product recommendations for customers improve forecasting for inventory management and and and literally hundreds of other things beneath the surface and then I'd say the most exciting thing that I think we're working on in machine learning is that we are determined to through Amazon Web Services where we have all these customers who are corporations and software developers to make these advanced techniques accessible to every organization even if they don't have kind of the current class of expertise that's required right now deploying these techniques for your particular institutions problems is difficult it takes a lot of expertise and so you have to go compete for the very best PhDs in machine learning and get them and it's it's difficult for a lot of organizations to win those competitions and so we're in a great position because of the success of Amazon Web Services to be able to put energy into making those techniques easy and accessible and so we're determined to do though I think we can build a great business doing that for ourselves and it would be incredibly enabling for organizations that want to use these these sophisticated technologies to improve their own organizations
