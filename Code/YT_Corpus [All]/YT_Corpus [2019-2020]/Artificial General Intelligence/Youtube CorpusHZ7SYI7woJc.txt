 the idea of artificial intelligence can be traced back to the work of Alan Turing carried out in the Second World War Alan Turing is widely regarded as having a highly significant role in pioneering the development of computer science and artificial intelligence during the Second World War Turing and colleagues created an automating machine for breaking secret codes known as the bombe this machine could find the solution to code breaking problems in minutes tasks that we're taking humans weeks to complete the bomb could effectively do something that no human could the bomb was a moment when it became possible to speculate on the limits of what machines could do Turing's work on the bombe influenced his thinking on the possibilities that computing may have for the future in 1947 during a public lecture Turing gave what is thought to be the first mention of computer intelligence saying what we want is a machine that can learn from experience in 1950 Turing wrote a paper entitled computer Machinery and intelligence where he began posing the question can machines think it is from this paper that the Turing test derives Turing begins by speculating with the question can machines think but in the end goes on to say that's a very difficult question to answer because it's very tricky to find thinking or even how to measure thinking so instead of attempting to answer that question can machines think he chose to replace the question with something he called the imitation game where it was asked if a machine could convincingly imitate a human this game eventually evolved into what we now think of as the Turing test get more from the Open University check out the links on screen now
