 Hello everyone and welcome to Learnaholic India. In today's session we are going to see applications of artificial intelligence. so the topics that we are going to cover in today's session are types of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence related trends and technologies and applications of artificial intelligence. So without wasting a time we'll start with overview of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is the simulation of one intelligence processes by machines especially computer system this possesses includes learning reasoning and self correction some of the applications of artificial intelligence include expert system speech recognition and machine vision artificial intelligence is advancing dramatically it is already transforming our world socially, economically and politically Artificial intelligence was coined by John McCarthy an American computer scientist in 1956 at The Dartmouth Conference where the discipline was born. today it is an umbrella term that encompasses everything from robotic process automation with actual robotics artificial intelligence can perform tasks such as identifying patterns in the data more efficiently than humans enabling businesses to gain more insight out of their data now let's move to types of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence can be classified in several ways the first classifies the artificial intelligence as either weak artificial intelligence or strong artificial intelligence weak artificial intelligence also known as narrow artificial intelligence it is an AI system that designed and trained for a specific type of task strong artificial intelligence is known as artificial general intelligence is an AI system with generalized one cognitive abilities so that when presented with unfamiliar tasks it has enough intelligence to find a solution artificial intelligence is categorized into the four types these are as follows type 1- reactive machines it is an example of Deep Blue, and IBM chess program that can identify pieces on the chessboard and can make predictions accordingly but the major fault with this is that it has no memory and cannot use the past experiences to inform future ones it also analyzes possible moves of its own and its opponent deep blue and AlphaGO designed for nano purposes and cannot easily be applied to any other solution the next type is limited memory this artificial intelligence system can uses the past experiences to inform the future decisions most of the decision-making function in the autonomous vehicles have been designed in this way the next type is theory of mind this is a psychology term which refers to the understanding like the other have in their own benefits and intentions that impact the decision they make the fourth type is self awareness in this category AI system have the sense of self have consciousness machine with self-awareness understand their current state and can use information to infer what others are feeling now let's move to the artificial intelligence technologies the market for artificial intelligence technologies is flourishing artificial intelligence involves a variety of technologies and tools some of the recent technologies are as follows natural language generation it is a tool that produces text from the computer data currently used in customer service report generation and summarizing the business intelligence insights. Next is speech recognition it transcribes and transforms human speech into a format useful for computer application presently used is interactive voice response system and mobile applications next is virtual agent it is a computer-generated animated artificial intelligence virtual character that serves as an online customer service representative it leads an intelligent conversation with the users response to their question and performs adequate nonverbal behavior the next is machine learning it provides algorithms API and training toolkits data as well as computing power to design train and deploy the models into the application processes and other machines the next is deep learning platform a special type of machine learning consists of artificial neural network with multiple abstraction layer it is currently used in the pattern recognition and classifications application supported by very large datasets the next AI related technology is biometrics it uses methods for unique recognition of human based upon one or more intrinsic physical or behavior traits in computer science particularly biometric is used as a form of identity access management and access control it is also used to identify individuals in group that are under the surveillance currently used in market research the next is robotic process automation using a script and other methods to automating one action to support efficient business processes it is currently used where it is inefficient for human to execute a task the next technology is text analytics and natural language processing NLP uses and support text analytics by facilitating the understanding of sentence structure and meaning sentiment and intent to statistical and machine learning methods currently used in fraud detection and security a wide range of automated assistance and application for mining unstructured data. now let's see the applications of artificial intelligence first artificial intelligence in healthcare companies are applying machine learning to make better and faster diagnosis than humans one of the best-known technologies is IBM's Watson it understand the natural language and can respond to the questions asked of it the system mines patient's data and other available data sources from hypotheses which is then present with a confidence score schema. AI is a study realizes to emulate human intelligence into computer technology that could assist both the doctor and the patients in various ways such as by providing a laboratory for examination by devising a novel tool to support decision-making and research by integrating the activities in medical software and cognitive science by offering a Content rich discipline for the future scientific medical communities secondly artificial intelligence in business robotic process automation is being applied to highly repetitive tasks normally performed by humans machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and CRM that is customer relationship management platform to uncover the information on how to better serve customers Chatbots have already been incorporated into websites and e companies to provide an immediate service to the customers automation of job positions have also become a talking point among the academic and IT consultancies. the third is artificial intelligence in education it automates Grading giving the educators more time it can also access students and adapts to their needs helping them work at their own pace the fourth application is artificial intelligence in autonomous vehicles just like the human self-driving cars needs to have sensors to understand the world around them and brain to collect the processes and choose the specific actions based on the information gathered autonomous vehicles are with advanced tools to gather the information including long-range radar cameras and LIDAR each of these technologies are used in different capacities and each collects the different information the next application of AI is for robotics it allows us to address the challenges in taking care of an aging populations and allow much longer in between dependence it will drastically reduce maybe even bring down traffic accidents by days as well as enable the disaster response for the in danger situation for example the nuclear meltdown and the Fukushima power plant the next is cyborg technology one of the main limitation of being human it's simply our own bodies and green researcher thinks that in the future we will able to operate ourselves with computers and enhance many of our natural abilities in future predictive analytics and artificial intelligence could play an even more fundamental role in content creation and also in the software fields open source information and artificial intelligence collection will provide opportunities for global technological parity and the technology of artificial yet become the future in all the domains of health environment public safety and the secure thank you for watching today's session if you are new to this channel then subscribe to Learnaholic India and don't forget to click on the bell icon for the latest video updates if you liked today's video then like it share it with your friends also if you have any query then please comment below you can also follow us on Facebook Twitter and Instagram the social media links are given in a description remember one thing sharing of knowledge is gaining of knowledge that's it for today stay tuned for next video thank you!!!
