 we are back for another edition looking at teams again so your bad ass business mindset I'm Dana ferrant and we're looking at teams managing them coordinating them getting them to actually work for you so kind of backing up the train a little bit we're gonna look at hiring the right people okay so I find especially in the coaching consulting world you're dealing with a lot of people virtually and hiring somebody virtually is actually a lot different than hiring them in person when you get somebody in person in front of you you can have this dance this interaction and you know kind of an assessment of who's who what what but when you're doing it virtually sometimes you only have a video conference or maybe it's only a phone call or maybe it's only through email so what I'd suggest in particular I'm gonna focus in on if you're hiring virtual teams from like overseas let's say you work in North America which is who I primarily work with you work in North America and you're gonna hire somebody in the Philippines or India or you know those countries where your dollar goes further you can still pay them a living wage and they're happy you're happy okay so you're gonna need to manage your expectations and you're gonna have to train yourself first and foremost on how what it is that you want you've got to get really really really clear about exactly what you want done in that job and exactly the type of person that you're looking for okay and once you get super clear about what you're looking for then you can itemize it out and put it out pretender on any of the many many sites that are available for finding virtual help and now when you get into training though it's also the same thing in the beginning you've got to give them smaller amounts than you would if they were in person because if they're right there in person and they're working on the job you can kind of like look over their shoulder and you know hold their hand a little bit but when you're working virtually you kind of have to give people small nuggets little bits oversee it because I got to send it back and you have to have that expectation that you're going to spend that time you know working with them so this is the mindset piece of it is that you need to give yourself space that when you hire some buddy they're not immediately going to be in your brain knowing what you want seeing your vision living your brand so give it some space give it some time but with the right coordination of asking for exactly what you want and nurturing that person in a way that makes sense you can have an amazing team on board and creating those raving fans out of your employees as well as your customers I'm dative ferrant and this is your badass business mindset ready to wrap your business up with ease manage your team like a badass leader head over to book Dana dot I am
