 Hey guys welcome back to my channel it's Dat Le in today's video i'm going to be going over how to grow your business by outsourcing and hiring a virtual assistant as always subscribe to the channel and hit that notification bell for new updates for new videos that i post every week all right let's get into it so when do you want to start thinking about hiring help you want to do this as soon as possible you want to really start planning from day one because it's very hard and inefficient to try to do everything yourself so even if you're not in a financial position to do so yet you are in a position where you can start planning and setting milestones for you so once you reach a certain milestone for your business you can really start getting help and hiring these day-to-day activities that require someone's time but they're not high value activities so for example if you're doing something that's more project-based like one-offs um i would recommend just outsourcing that um to you know like a designer or like a virtual assistant that's more just like you know on a project-based manner whereas if you're doing things that are like an operational everyday activity like customer service making sure emails are getting responded to uh vendors being communicated to you wanna hire someone for a row you want to hire an administrative assistant operations manager depending on what you can afford at that time so again when you hire help you're not only offloading a lot of your activities you're getting an extra 40 hours of production from a different person so you really want to start thinking about making that investment into human capital whereas if you hire this person they're going to give you that much increase in production and that much more value into your business so that you can do other things to grow and scale your production make sure you know how much your time is worth so as you're growing and as your business is evolving any repetitive small entry-level tasks you don't want to be spending all your time doing these things answering emails taking customer support inquiries things like that can be delegated to a va very simply and when you're looking at you know how much you're billing clients for or how much your business is generating for you on a per hour basis if if you're getting stuck doing these you know minute small things it's way better to delegate to someone else for you to be able to free your time to be planning on growing and putting these new pieces in place for you to take your business to the next level so really understand how much your time is worth and if it's not you know high level activity make sure you delegate it so where are some of the best places to find virtual assistants and platforms to outsource your activities for anytime you're looking to hire a fold like a full-time or a part-time employee i recommend online jobs.ph uh there's a lot of great talent in the philippines a lot of them are educated um and you can find pretty much everything that you need to help manage your business and to offload certain activities to anything that's outsourced kind of more project based i would recommend 99 designs for design work there's upwork as well uh freelance and then also fiverr so these are just more kind of like one-offs you need like a sales script done or you need this uh this image down to this banner done so check those out i'll link them in the description below and yeah those are just some great places to find talent and the biggest thing that you can you're gonna have to do is just make sure you vet uh all the candidates and make sure everything is clear as you negotiate um you know if you're doing a project base what you're looking to get at the end of the project and set the right expectations from the very beginning so as you're looking through all these different websites and platforms and you start you're starting to you know create your job description and your job posting for what it is that you actually need one tip in your job description is make sure that you you know write about the type of character you're looking for what your company is about what your culture is like but also you know put distinct instructions within your job description so for example let's just say reply to this ad with a subject a headline saying rockstar a position or something like that and what that does it just makes sure that like anyone that you're vetting because you'll get a lot of candidates apply for your position and you want to spend your the least amount of your time betting people so what i mean by that is if you go through every single application there's going to be a lot of bad applicants so you want to start putting like these small instructions um so that it weeds people out so for example if you're getting 20 to 30 applicants and only five have a distinct um subject in the headline that you requested then you know this these five people actually read your full job description and you can just you know not waste your time because as you're looking to hire talent it does require a lot of just betting just going through the weeds to find the best candidate so that's one of the best ways to ensure that you know you're just not spending time looking at every single uh candidate because it does take a lot of time and the better you do at actually betting the person from the very beginning the less headache you're gonna have on the back end has to be a better fit for you and your business so the interview process as you're narrowing down the candidates and you're making them jump through hoops and what you want to do is you want to make sure that like the candidates that you have except for like your your interviews what you want to do is you want to set up multiple rounds of interviews because it's very easy for a lot of these guys to just jump on a quick interview over skype or over zoom and it's your job and your responsibility to make sure that you know you see these people and you make sure that they are actually someone that's going to work out long term for your business because if you don't do a very good job now betting them and making them jump through hoops to to know that they're right fit and they to know that they're actually be a you know a revenue generating piece for your business it's going to bite you in the ass and it's a super annoying to having to rehire repost and go through the whole cycle again so making sure that you're really uh doing a good job interviewing again what i recommend doing is multiple interviews make make them have different tasks and assignments uh from individual interview that way you can start to see hey like do they have the skill set the ability to do what you need them to do for that role and i always look for like you five the five c's for me so i look for you know are they able to communicate that's gonna be important written as well as uh being able to speak super important as you know as you're delegating as you're talking to them and reviewing things having someone with great english is a huge benefit um also are they confident do they come off confident in their abilities is this someone you can trust is this someone that's going to be with you long term and also are they competent can they even do the work that you need them to do so that is just you know three or three of the things that you want to just you really start to look for in every single movie you want to see if there's any red flags that might think might show you otherwise um do these people have the core values that that that you can see them work working together within your business and also like do they have do they have the right um really do they have the right culture or their culture fit for your business because that's huge as well as you're adding you know new more uh team members down the road people that are a culture fit it's super important as again you're building a team and you're building um you know a group of people that you want to perform at a high level and if they don't fit culturally it could actually uh be a negative for the rest of your team so make sure that again the interviewing process is super important and make sure you higher slow and you fire fast some of the best tools that you can use to manage your your vas are slack slack is great for just team communication it's super quick you can transfer files and it's just a great way to start building different channels for different activities that you don't have to go back and forth with email i would recommend dropbox is good dropbox is good to share files it's a great place to store all of the things that you guys have done and it's it's a good place to just you know store things that's off your computer lastpass is great as well lastpass is get to just share passwords with your employees and as you know they move on or they don't need that those credentials anymore you can just take them off the uh being able to access those particular websites paypal is also very good paypal is a good way to pay your employees trello is also good it's just a free project management software and google drive is also really good in google docs all three things again that you can share with your team it's just easy to access information back and forth because as you're doing these different activities you want to make sure that it's easy for you to communicate keep a record of all the things you've done and also manage how the va is actually doing and how their performance is affecting your business and seeing the their results and their stats you can go back and audit and see you know what you need to do better in terms of managing them how can you support them better and how can they be a you know how can they be better for your business so that you guys are growing some of the best practices um would be one making sure that you understand how good the english is get them to do some written exercises for you some tests so you can see the ability to communicate through through words and also getting them to read your job description out loud this ensures that you hear them speak out loud you can understand and see what their tone is like but also you're able to start asking them to explain to you what the description is for your job that just ensures to you that they understand exactly what the role is make sure also that you ask and you ensure that they have good internet um especially if you're you know working in something that's high-paced e-commerce you want to make sure that during interviews or during zoom meetings or weekly calls you want to make sure that you're not wasting any time with laggy internet it's just a huge pain in the ass and it's also you know you just lose a lot of productivity also you know start off a little bit lower than um what you what you want to hire them for for your monthly rate and get them to prove to you that they're worth that much so for example if you're you want to hire someone for 700 give them a probation period within the first 30 days where you're just paying them maybe 450 500 and as they get proficient with the job after a month they'll get that 700 um per month that that you agreed on and you guys negotiated also make sure that you set hard lines from the very beginning uh this way that ensures that hey if you're late three times or if you don't you know show three times you're fired a lot of times you there's a lot of things going on in the philippines and good help is hard to find you'll get a lot of people that you think are really really good and they turn out to be really flaky and sometimes on the flip side you get some people that you don't think they're going to be that great but they turn out to be a huge help and like they're trying to be a rock star so it's just really good to you know practice some of these things as you're getting more used to hiring va's all right guys so you know hope that helps in terms of just growing your business uh you know through outsourcing and through hiring virtual assistants it is a huge help you don't want to be a one-man army you want to you know really build a group of people that are able to to really go out there and serve your customers at the end of the day if you don't have any customers you got no business so you want to be always thinking about how do i add more revenue to the bottom line how do i want to add profits to my pocket and the only way to really do that is to be really good at managing other people and building a team let me know in the comment comments below uh you know what are some of the things you're struggling with in terms of deciding when to hire or what activities to outsource and again join the facebook group we're growing you know new members every week it's great to see and i'll see you guys in the next video
