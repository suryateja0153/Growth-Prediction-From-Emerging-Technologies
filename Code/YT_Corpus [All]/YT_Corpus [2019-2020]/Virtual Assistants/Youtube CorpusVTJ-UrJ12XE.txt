 if you could have an extra 20 hours a month to work on your business for only 60 bucks would you take this deal now this is a common-sense question that I think we all know the answer to but in today's video I'm going to be discussing how I use virtual assistants really help me scale my business what tasks I delegate to them and more importantly how I decide on these tasks since my business and jobs are always evolving now before I hired my first person I had all of these assumptions that I had to be making all of this money before it would be worth my time to do this but I think you're going to see by the end of the video that this is just not the case [Music] what's going on everyone thank you so much for your time it is the most valuable thing that we have and today I'm gonna be showing you how to get more of your time back now one of the biggest mistakes I see people making when I'm talking to people and that I was guilty of making for the longest time was just not hiring someone to do these small mundane tasks that you see throughout the course of your day now when I first started working for myself that first year back in 2017 was probably one of the most frustrating points in my entire life I was setting these weekly goals and when the week ended and I was analyzing to see how far I came I wasn't even close to accomplishing it and so when I was analyzing my tasks I was seeing that I was not accomplishing even a fraction of what I was supposed to do and that's because I had all of these small tasks that were taking up my time and just because they're small doesn't mean that they're not important these had to be done but what was happening here was I built myself a work prison so I was working 12 to 15 hours a day and more or less busy work I wasn't accomplishing anything and if I were to take a step back everything was going to come crumbling down so this is a terrible spot to be and I was in it and I see some people that currently are so hopefully this can help you out now what I do want to say is this is not a video talking exactly about the hiring process or where I find or what methods I really use to find these workers really quickly I do use online jobs at pH to find my employees and I do have an affiliate for them and then description below so if you do want to support this channel feel free to use that link and if I do see that you use it you can take up a 30-minute call with me which I usually charge for but let's say you don't even want to do that I give out a one-hour call to someone who likes and comments on every single video and I'm gonna give out two calls this video either one of you two people reach out to me on social media I would love to set something up now I want to talk about some tasks that I actually assigned to my virtual assistants today and here's the thing okay I want you to take away the theory from this because when I was an accounting class I remember my professor would always say Chris there's so many different types of accounting out there but what I want you to know is the theory and this can be the same way for this you could be a woodworker or a dog photographer but the theory will be the same I guarantee that there will be something in that job or whatever job that you're currently doing you might be a musician or whatever it is that you do that you can outsource a fraction of that to help you focus on more important things so that's why I'm going to be sharing to you my tasks now I do have two people on my team and these two people there's usually some kind of underlying big project that goes on so these bigger projects are you know they're always gonna be doing you know two to three hours a day but then there are just some tasks that pop up that no matter what they have to do and so task number one for that was I have these two accounts that we need to fill out forms for and these two accounts it's quite a bit of paperwork and it would probably take about 45 minutes to an hour so I decided I'm going to forward this over to my BA I told him hey this needs done by tomorrow you have all my information fill it out send it back to me so that alone right there save me one hour today which doesn't sound like a lot but it gets better so another task that kind of popped up was there's a trade show coming up it's a very large trade show that ASD and there's hundreds and hundreds of suppliers and it can get kind of overwhelming with okay where do you want to go what routes do you want to stop at etc so what I had them do was I had him vet the suppliers based on criteria I gave him and he made an excel sheet with all their information so it came out to be about a hundred and twenty out of the seven hundred eight hundred suppliers that were going to be at this trade show so that alone it took about two to three days and it was about two to three hours per day now that alone saved me about six to eight hours in total and the last thing I had him do which took another two days about two to three hours a day was sending out emails what an email template I sent to set up appointments and I knew that all these suppliers weren't going to respond to the email but I knew that once the emails were sent the people that do respond I can handle it from there that was probably another four to six hours in total that I saved this week so this week alone not counting the product research and other larger projects I have these VA s doing I have saved you know at least 10 to 12 hours of just things that popped up right and it's kind of like a game the more you practice doing it the better you get at it the more you get in the habit of thinking what can i outsource the better you will become and maybe you're a natural at it maybe you will be able to do this right away to outsource things but it took me a while to get to the point where just something would come my way and I could just think okay I need to send this over to my virtual assistant right now and this could be even said about nine to five now this may vary among career and different types of jobs but in my last job in my personal experience my last corporate job I had I've worked in the purchasing department for a hospital and I had to make sure I'm several hospitals heart surgery departments had the right product going into heart surgery and I was behind a computer all day and just thinking back on that job I know for a fact there were two three maybe four small aspects of that job I probably could have outsourced and you know it may not sound like a lot but that my employer saw and that made them think wow this guy's absolutely crushing it let's give him a pay raise or a pay bump I'm not saying that I wanted that but it could have led to that so I'm gonna go ahead and close out here with what are you guys currently wanting to outsource let me know in the description below this was a shorter video but I thought it was just something that needed to be said kind of a fun topic but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this one and I will definitely see you next time thank you for joining me hey everyone I just launched a discord group which is
