 [Music] you might have heard about Google cloud functions which makes it possible to write simple single purpose code that scales automatically and runs in response to events you might also be wondering does it work with go cloud functions recently announced support for Python 37 and no D and today we're excited to show you the newly released go support for cloud functions let's get started go cloud functions come in two distinct types HTTP functions and background functions let's take a look at an HTTP function first HTTP functions run when they receive a request and they return a response the function signature follows the HTTP handler func interface from the ghost standard library meaning that you can use the wide variety of go HTTP middleware right out of the box now let's deploy it we give our function the name hello specify the entry point F and add the trigger HTTP flag once it's deployed your command line will show the URL you used to trigger the function just copy that in your browser to test it and with that we've just employed our first go cloud function next let's take a look at a background function while an HTTP function responds to a request a back run function responds to an event let's write a function that triggers every time a cloud storage buckets contents change here's what our function looks like it receives a cloud storage event and logs the file and bucket name deployments function is just like deploying an HTTP function we give our function a name specify the entry point and specify the event type and resource that originates event now with all the setup complete this function will fire every time a new file is added to our bucket don't forget to create the cloud storage bucket before deploying your function now the test this just use a web UI and upload a file to your bucket we've only shown a very small piece of what's possible with go cloud functions with cloud functions you don't have to worry about server management you only pay for what you use and your functions scale automatically in response to demand best of all you're using the familiar building blocks of go functions using go cloud functions you can build mobile or IOT backends virtual assistants or chat BOTS do real-time file processing or integrate with third-party services just to name a few what's best though is that it's incredibly easy to get started by writing a small function and go and then building it up from there we hope you give a go cloud function to try I'm you know Compton and I'm Angela let us know how it goes by leaving questions or comments in the section below reach out to us on Twitter and don't forget to subscribe to the Google cloud platform YouTube channel for more go buddies see you next time thanks for watching
