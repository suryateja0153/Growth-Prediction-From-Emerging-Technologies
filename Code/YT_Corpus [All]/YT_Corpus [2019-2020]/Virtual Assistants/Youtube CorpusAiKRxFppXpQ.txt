 Hey everybody, welcome to another episode of Candid Convos I'm here today with my guy   one of my good friends Jonathan Arias, dude happy for you and your success, that's right let's get   it today man I know I got to bring the energy today, I got to bring the volume I won't do   it justice if I introduce you so tell us more about you and what you do. First of all, let's go! man I'm an attorney and I'm in these streets man, here in Miami I run a firm called The Onyx   Group but more than that I'm an entrepreneur so like Brett, I am a businessman who   became an attorney versus an attorney who became a businessman and so   I have lots of things on my plate  and on the docket that are going to come but   grow my business big time and so I'm blessed to be here man. Man gotta put yourself out there and   take risks and that has led you to some of the more cool things you're doing but   before we get off topic too much you had a law firm here in Miami and then you moved because   you know, your wife once supported you and now you're supporting your wife   to another country, medical school, and you were basically forced to go virtual and now I think   it's probably the best thing you ever did so tell us about that journey and let's get into dealing   with virtual employees. Sure, yeah man so it's funny because I grew up in Homestead   and I would be here and I'd be like man I wanna, like can I please not live here anymore because   we'd be out partying and be like yeah y'all that joke was crazy it was crazy   I was like yeah, and it was like yeah, and then yeah and then by the time you're like in   color ridge color it was color range at the time it's like everything's dark and it's just like   you finally get home and I was like yeah I guess it was cool but you're just so far from everything   so then we're like man we want to move into the city so we finally get a spot in Coral   Gables, you remember this Brett, yeah and literally where I'm unpacking boxes literally the first   weekend we're there my wife is like she's praying and she's like hey I think God is leading me to   med school and the school, men American University of Antigua has a relationship with FIU   they're having a seminar this morning and so I don't think it was a coincidence I think it was a   you know a God thing and because how often do they come maybe once-twice a year and it happened   to be the morning like a few hours later she ends up going and right then that was the first   time, where I'm like man like, are we about to move to Antigua? You know, and I'm literally unpacking   boxes the first weekend we're there this is like March by July she's gone and then fast   forward a little bit more by November  first, we're gone, I'm gone with my kids so   March was the first time where I'm like okay, I really gotta start thinking about this thing   like if this really happens and fast forward it did happen but here's the thing, Brett, man I   wanted to start my business like that from day one and old habits die hard bro and it's like   we everybody does this man we know we should be delegating or we know we should be building a   certain way and we don't man we, old habits die hard it's the whole man I'll just do it myself   you know it'll go faster to go easier if I do this myself so I had you know I had done that with to   an extent, building things so that they could run virtually to an extent like like my thing   was I would always scan and shred records like I would go into other attorney's offices   and they had a wall of filing cabinets I said I'm not going to have that you know and all   my systems were online so that I could access them from anywhere but there were things like   going to court that I was still doing there were things like you know my client meeting me that I   was still doing so I had from March until November  that's about eight months to really be like okay   everything that requires me I gotta  make sure that I get rid of it and so I   ended up taking a few trips to Antigua to beta test what I had set up during that time but once November came it was sink or swim and I was able to set it up using the virtual   staffing that I have through you guys  several contract attorneys,   several even like paralegal type people  like notaries, I use their office when I'm here   and if a client has to bring some physical document to me they'll bring it to that office   then that notary will scan it upload it for me and they all work in conjunction with my virtual   staffing so I don't even a lot of time know that this stuff is going on but it just happens and   that's the beauty of it so all that led me to say man this is where it's at so I'm   in Antigua, right? My first week there walking on the beach which is right behind my house   so I walk out and there's a beach and I'm like man this is freaking dope like I'm walking on the   beach right now and work is getting done and I'm like man people probably want this and so it led   me to the book The Underwear Millionaire which I'm in the process of writing and Covid I'm, I took a little pause to see how Covid plays out because I can't there's nothing like   a biography and they're reading somebody's biography and they have so much life left   and it's like well you know what about this stuff you know I love about that's my favorite genre of   literature and I just read Andre Iguodala's biography but I'm like man he has he's not even   retired yet I'm like I'm reading his biography it seems like not the best move so I took   a little pause because of Covid but basically the premise of the story is man how do we trade   time for, instead of trading time for  money how do we trade money for money basically.   Got it, that's interesting. Creating systems using money to create more money because money   is an infinite resource theoretically  but time we're all hard-capped at 24.   it doesn't matter what your bill rate is Brett, what my bill rate is we're hard-capped at   24 and in our industry we go off of time we bill for time with the billable hour oh   you know whether you're it's a K Street  attorney in Washington DC and they're getting   650, 700 an hour they cannot work more than 24 hours a day where there was little me starting   off making I don't know 300 an hour or whatever my bill rate was back then I'm still hard-capped You can pay someone else to work 10 hours a day or eight hours a day right so that's your   theory you're trading money for money right.  Versus time for money and that's what  is about. I know I'm totally with you one of our phrases here, trademark   phrases: Delegate your way to freedom. I think most  people know my story and how I was not successful   early on and I had to learn how to give up control and that was the only way to grow   I would have imagined though that having like living in another country and running a business   would have been nearly impossible but now with Coronavirus you know my law firm has 23 employees   since March 16th we've all been in different locations so it doesn't matter if I'm still   in Miami or if I'm in Antarctica or wherever I'm using technology to run a business and the   same thing that Get Staffed Up we don't have an office anymore we're 100% virtual   we've got 12 and about to be 16, 17 of our own employees in other countries and   that's now the name of the game and you know so tell us about that your experience you're   in a whole other country, your law firm runs and does business and gets clients in Miami and South   Florida right, and then you deal with employees that are all over the map so tell us a little bit   more about that how does that work. Yeah man, so the most beautiful thing is that my clients don't even   know that I'm not there so that's the beautiful thing because you don't want to get through this   to a point where it becomes a disadvantage to you you just want to be hey, I'm one of the   options, matter of fact I'm the best option because of the service I provide but you don't want that   to be you know something that messes you up down the line but man the other beautiful thing is   when you set it up so that so the way I've set it up is so that my virtual staffer does intake   and so man one of the best feelings Brett, and I posted in the GJ group is when my my staffer took an intake call she basically diagnosed with what it was because we get   that kind of case all the time as an eviction case she ran it by me to make sure it's cool   and I was like yeah sure thumbs up but not even thinking about it and then basically took the   payment and I didn't do anything and we got we retained the client, our client retained us   we got a client out of it and so man it's it took iteration Brett to get to that point so   so going through it over and over again and seeing where the gaps, where the gaps were in   the system and then and then now the other issue is in terms of execution so I figured out intake,   first let's get the money in the door  because I could do the work from over there as   long as I have an internet connection but that's not it alone because underwear entrepreneurs   have freedom of geography and they have freedom of time which is the most important thing   because so I could be virtual but still be working 23 hours a day that's not real freedom.   Exactly, exactly. And so the issue is  then that was the first step the next step is   how do I leverage virtual talent and contract attorneys to then be on   the tactical side and actually execute the work and so that was the second step and   now I'm getting a second staffer to help with that in addition to getting contract attorneys   that build me at a lower rate and then even getting one on a monthly rate   so that she'll navigate all of our eviction cases and so that's how it played out for me.   And every law firm's different every setup is different and I just kind of want to point out   for example, at Get Staffed Up we do Clerical VA's, Administrative VA's, and Marketing VA's we're   not doing, we do have a bankruptcy paralegal program now but we're not doing attorneys I   mean we're not running your whole law firm we're providing you know the entry-level   essential people, you're still going to have to figure out though how to run your other systems   and deal with the contract attorneys, the remote attorneys, and paralegals and as you grow   administrators you know you know C-Suite officers etc, but all that can be done   remotely and I think that's the biggest thing is we used to have this conversation where we   were trying to explain that it can be done remotely but now because of Covid-19   everyone has was forced to do it remotely and that's kind of what's been neat for us   and it's good to hear from you because you went through all this before the world had to so   you're ahead of the curve you had to go virtual and you did it and you came up with systems   and you hire people and one hiring leads to the next and you're 100% virtual and people can   learn a lot from you so looking forward to your book, looking forward to some of the other things   real quick, tell us the type of law and how we can reach you. Yeah man so I do civil litigation  shouts out to the Trembly Law Firm they give me lots of referrals which is great, mostly I work   on landlord-tenant law so that's my niche area but I do all types of civil litigation   and that was the main thing, what was your other question bro? How do we reach you? How do we find you if we need it? Yeah, so you can find us at theonyxgrouplegal.com and   The Onyx Group on all the socials, also look out for something we're gonna be launching   either next week or in a few weeks it's called Eviction University so we do evictions for people   and I'm really excited about this because this falls, it falls in line with being an underwear   entrepreneur because I have freedom of geography but the freedom of time if I'm still doing work   for clients then I'm still handcuffed so Eviction University is going to be a course   where we're going to teach ten landlords how to do their own evictions and the beauty with that   Brett, as you know when you're doing online courses man people could buy that at 2am while you're   sleeping, yeah and so man that's going to be big and that's going to launch in probably   next week or the week after and yeah man we're going to we're really about this life so.   Making moves continue to inspire me to not rest on my laurels that's for sure because   every day people are are out there  doing good things and it just motivates   you know, you motivate me and that's why you surround yourself with other people that   you know that make moves and take action and get things done because it just it's cyclical man   and then and then we all get ideas from each other and then we all help each other grow so thank you   so much john for joining us today on Candid Convos, looking forward to seeing more from you good luck   on the launch of the Eviction University and the book and everything else dude thanks so much for joining us!
