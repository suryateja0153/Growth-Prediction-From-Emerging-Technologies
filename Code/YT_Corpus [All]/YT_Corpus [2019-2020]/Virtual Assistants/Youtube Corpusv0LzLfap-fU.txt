bell to be notified when i post a new episode of free moment tv right here each and every tuesday running a business is a lot of work and two of the tasks that can feel never ending to a business owner managing your email and your calendar your clients get a lot of emails every single day and they just can't keep up that's why they're hiring you to help them manage that inbox and keep it under control while still making sure that their customers get the answers and service they need in a timely manner and speaking of time managing a calendar is not easy or intuitive for everyone your clients are counting on you to help them make the most of their time so that they can work effectively so today i'm going to show you what you need to know to impress your clients and make yourself invaluable as a virtual assistant before we dive in though i have a quick question for you have you ever managed a client's inbox or calendar before let me know down in the comments below communication expectations and boundaries these right here are your three keys to success as a virtual assistant and soon you'll see why now i preach extreme communication for a reason everything starts with clear communication and that means you have to find out how your client wants to receive information for example you might have an awesome color coding system that you love to use on calendars to mark out dedicated work time meetings and project deadlines but if your client isn't a visual person and prefers to have that information written out as a daily or weekly agenda you need to know that maybe your client prefers not to look at a calendar layout at all and wants a daily text listing the tasks she's supposed to work on and when her calls are on the other hand maybe your color coding system is perfect for helping your client easily switch between family time work priorities and upcoming deadlines if you don't communicate you won't know and maybe your client has no clue what will be most effective and wants you to come up with these ideas and that's okay don't be afraid to try different things and see what's most effective just be sure to communicate what you're doing at the outset so that your client understands what's happening and everyone's expectations are clear now when you're managing a calendar you also want to have some solid processes in place for example when someone schedules a meeting with your client do you follow up and confirm that the meeting is happening sure you might have an automated reminder in place but is it working if you're experiencing a slew of no-shows should the process be adjusted maybe for certain types of calls you need to personally reach out and verify that the meeting is still taking place again you'll communicate with your client and set expectations accordingly remember an automation can work just fine without you it's the personal touch that you can add that makes you extremely valuable to your clients if you can find out ahead of time that a meeting needs to be rescheduled you can protect your client's workflow and help her save her time and energy for where it's needed most over time you can help your client even more perhaps by suggesting that she designates specific calendar times for deep work and limit calls that interrupt her flow to one or two days of the week and then of course there's email management at first you might just want to track the email that's coming in how much are you handling on a daily basis and how much time does it take up knowing this information is critical because that way you can set expectations with your client for example after you've tracked things for a few days you can say with confidence that you can handle about 50 emails every hour or whatever you're doing over time you'll probably notice that you're getting a lot of the same types of questions and you can start building out templates to reply to those emails on your clients behalf that way you'll save time because you'll have a ready to go answer you can plug in but you can still provide the kind of personal touch that simply can't be recreated by an automation or bot by taking the time to work with your client and build out templates you'll create an amazing customer experience that runs smoothly and makes it easy for you to handle a large volume of email in a short amount of time when you have a working system in place you'll also be able to set clear expectations for customers for example they'll know that they can expect or reply within two business days or whatever you and your client decide and of course we can't forget about boundaries when you're managing a client's email and calendar they might want to be instantly responsive or available 24 7 but guess who's in charge of setting your boundaries you are that means that you need to clearly communicate your boundaries to your client like when you're available how quickly you'll respond and so on once you've set those expectations you need to stick to them so if you say you're going to reply within two hours during eight to four be sure to do that on the flip side if you say you're not going to reply on the weekend make sure you stick to that too if you don't you can't blame your client when he keeps reaching out for weekend support because you're the person who taught him that that was okay if you struggle a bit with boundaries you might want to check out this video it's important to have boundaries and really stick to them you need to know when you're going to work and when you're not going to work and then you need to enforce that schedule for yourself okay mama now you know exactly what you need to do to be a rock star va and tame the email monster plus keep your client on
