so first question what got you in the real estate well I started out in real estate right out of college but I really I yes I've got 13 years of real estate experience but I started in commercial real estate I always assumed I would be in real estate I think it was because my dad he actually was a CPA and a college professor and he always said if he could do it over again he would have gotten into real estate really yes okay so that was always ingrained in my head so it was like this is something growing up that like I would just be in real estate and I went with it so I started out in commercial real estate very corporate corporate world I worked like the eight to five grind but what got me into investment real estate I got started in house flipping and I got started because I wanted more freedom of my schedule I had just had my daughter and yeah it became a mom and I realized that it was really hard to juggle corporate life and also your newborn baby yeah so I wanted to just be self-employed and I really honestly would have done anything at that point and it just happened to be that house flipping was an option so so I wanna take a step back here because you mentioned you know commercial like I saw you worked as very Venice mm-hmm which is a big outfit you know it's not a small you know it's not a it's not a mom mom and pop you know commercial brokerage so great you started there my understanding in order to get started commercial is you need the hammer at the phones yes so is that what you had to do yes so my like first day for a first month it was like they give you this big book of landlords like and these are industrial retail or office landlord building owners you would have the like building like a little small picture the address owner's name or LLC name and the phone number and it was like go ahead start dialing so I had to get really good on the phones and in fact I was really good I learned some secrets and tricks just from that experience alone that I take with me today with my seller negotiations yeah so I think that's really relevant right because yeah I mean it was just this commercial real estate thing but you have to grind to survive and you were there for how long I did commercial real estate now this was in the recession so I started out in leasing office industrial retail buildings and then I got a really cool opportunity with Subway restaurants and franchise development so I I did that for a little bit and then I actually got a job with the Irvine Company which was a big that's a major landlord if you guys are familiar with the city of Irvine they basically own like every piece of land there okay so I got into construction management and with that job as well so I bounced around in commercial real estate probably I would say four or five years it was right after right after call a little bit in college it started out with an internship and then right after college until I started my house flipping business yeah and I started flipping houses while I was working at the Irvine Company so I was doing both at the same time for about a year okay so let's talk about your first flip like how did you come across first flip okay so this was awesome this was like right after this was right after the recession so we're let's take you back to 2012 okay I my brother was flipping houses I told him man I love your schedules awesome I need to do what you're doing because I have this little baby at home and she hardly even knows who I am because she spends more time with the babysitter then she does meet her own mother yeah so my brother he actually gave me some education back then it used to come in CDs okay this is like before Rizzo cou it used to come in to see these CDs and I popped him in my car and I would listen to them on my morning commute I deep toven to education for like a week and I learned the basics of Direct Mail yeah and that was my first seller marketing method so I started sending sellers letters and I was targeting just specific cities like in Orange County I really didn't know a whole lot about what I was doing but at this time it was actually pretty easy to get a deal there was still a lot of seller distress because we were just coming out of a recession well not a lot of people are buying yeah yes like what like 2011-12 when was this 20 2012 2012 yeah yeah so I mean there was still a ton of seller distress so I landed my first deal it was a condo in Laguna Niguel and it was literally could not have bought it the better a better time because right when I bought it the markets started going up so as we held it the property went up like 10% right which is a benefit I got the benefit you literally I was it was the best it was the best so that it was a condo we fixed it up put it back on the market flipped it I did it I did it with my brother so the first two deals I did I partnered with my brother and then I went on my own from that point and in that those was both of those deals were actually two caught they were condos both happen to be in Laguna Niguel and they both were $60,000 paydays each of them Wow yeah so I mean you could imagine I was like oh my god this business is so easy of course yeah TV numbers were actually real but they were back then they were and I was like oh my god this is like so easy like I just literally made more money because at the time in my corporate job I was making like 55 thousand a year really yeah I mean with no way as a client Hey well it wasn't it I worked for Subway but then at this point I was working for the Irvine Company was just a salary job this is still out of a recession so like the it was hard to get like a salary job so you made as much in one year once each of those deals correct now I split them with my brother sure so at this point I had I said I will quit my corporate job when I have a full year salary in savings so it took me a year to flip those two deals at this point I had my second baby on the way so I went on maternity leave I had my second daughter and then I didn't go back to work because I had the money in savings to be able to do so very cool so I was on my high horse at that time so you said it was easy were there any challenges yes see right when I quit my job so I quit my job I'm thinking oh my gosh this is so easy well it what happened was Direct Mail became like a thing you know there's like this podcast called bigger pockets and people are talking about Direct Mail and all of a sudden everybody's doing direct mail in my area and the deals were trying up I was having sellers say oh yeah I get like 3/4 these postcards a week and I'm going to play like I'm not the only one sending these now but it's going on so the deals started drying up and I it started to get scary it started to get we're a couple months would go by and I wouldn't be able to get a flip deal and then it was like four months would go by and I wouldn't have a deal in the pipe and at that point I was getting really worried that maybe this isn't a sustainable business yeah yeah so that's that was my start and it was it started hi I was on my high horse at first and then you know I got a reality check well I think that happens to some people right I think this industry you know there's a little bit of luck involved right so you can have 20 people take the same amount of action 18 of them will have any action right and then two of them will hit homeruns and then they have this mindset okay I've got it I figured it out and then probably one of those who will actually make it I I couldn't agree with you more and I would add to that that it's luck in location yeah because where I was was the problem I was there was no short of hard work over here it was just I was in a very competitive market and I came to that realization actually a couple years later and we could talk more about that later but that's kind of where the start came from well this so you're talking about the deal start drying up right so two months ago by four months ago by four had a deal how long did you you said in a couple years that you're just writing this out with direct mail only to like only just around here is only in Orange County I so then I started expanding so then I thought okay well Orange County this is this is getting to art so I started widening the net I started I started from LA even like North LA my my furthest deal was a place called Rose Monde and it was two and a half hours away from my home so that was like my first experience with like virtual and clear out to the Inland Empire so that would be like Riverside and San Bernardino County so my net was huge I mean to get to like to get to a seller meeting it would take me like three hours out of my day to do it one seller meeting it was crazy well that's fascinating because I I have a theory right one of them it one of the reasons why all the I buyers and everyone else starts in Phoenix and why there's so many freaking gurus here is that it takes literally 40 minutes to get to any part of town yeah right like doesn't matter where you are takes you 40 minutes just get to other part is how whereas in LA or Orange County depending on the time depending on the day it could take you 25 minutes it could take you three hours yeah and so so that was my suspicion as to why you know it you don't have as many big operations in Southern California so you did this and they eventually transitioned then into is this when you transition into virtual or what what happened what how did you get to virtual from here so my my decision to go full virtual I had hemmed and hawed about this decision for quite a while I it really started with a lot of frustration so I was you know doing everything that these gurus and my educators were saying I was a part of high-level masterminds I was going to seminars I was you know writing the education train that a lot of people do right and but I was so frustrated I would go and I would see these other people closing you know five deals a month no big deal I would see people that had way less experience than me at this point at this point maybe I have three years into this game and there are newbies like you know in their sixth month of the business already at like a pipeline of five deals a month and I'm going what that what am I doing wrong so it wasn't until I went to a seminar in Nashville then I remember it was like this just pushed me over the edge I was sitting and not like I had more experience than everybody there it was about maybe 20 people in the room and there were so many people that had under a years experience that were already you know closing like five deals a month regularly and I look around and at first I was like I had this inferiority complex like gosh is it because I don't know maybe because I'm a tired mom and I just can't put as much in it am I not working hard enough I started like I was attacking myself personally and when I sat in that room with those people and I asked I started getting really deep with them how many hours do you work a day how many seller leads do you get how many offers do you make a week when I I realized that there's really only a few things that you need to measure it's how many leads how many offers do you make how many contracts are you getting how many deals are closing those four things when I asked all those people in that room I realized that my numbers were way higher I needed way more leads to get to that end result of the closed deal so that's why I was exhausted that's why I wasn't closing that many deals it was that was like that moment where I realized oh it's not me it's where I live yeah okay God it makes sense for sure right in Southern California and you know I was a camera who was telling me this story but it was a shun Thierry he was doing webinar and he was going over his metrics he was talking with the KPI it's just like we talked about you know how many leads do you need to have an appointment have any appointment to a contract how many contracts to close and he was sharing his metrics and like there was laughter on the phone on the webinar he's like what are you guys laughing he's like how does it take like 80 people to have one contract right cuz for us that's what we need to do Southern California may be more competitive but in the Midwest people are friendlier we got another buddy Eric sage and he was saying and we were in a mastermind and he said like the reason why he loves in Birmingham like here we call somebody and they're like get the f off why are you calling me I'm tired of this crap and he's gone Birmingham like this isn't it but we hope you find him it's so true when you talk to it I'll tell you if you really want to get laid out talk to a California seller yeah they hold they will chew you up and spit you out right so I was used to that so going to you know these Midwest markets that I'm in was I mean a delight speaking of those sellers compared to what I was used to so you go this isn't Nashville right that was my first virtual market oh so you started wholesaling in Nashville I actually started building houses in Nashville that was my first virtual endeavor Wow tell me about that so okay so I was it the Nashville story is started with the seminar that I went to that got me so frustrated that I said okay I need to figure out maybe I need to diversify so not all my eggs are in one basket so to speak that one basket being Southern California so while I was at now in Nashville I pulled up a bunch of cash sales in the area and I just drove around for a day when I was driving around I noticed that all the cash sales that were like six months earlier were like these brand new homes I was really confused I thought this is like a brand new home this could not have been a flip and then I realized there was out likely these old homes getting knocked down and new homes being built in their place and there was like if there was maybe one house they'd knock him down to build two so I'd never seen anything like this is this does not really happen in California maybe in the beach cities so I was like what is this so I saw a construction site on the side of the road I saw a guy out there I pulled over and I was akru the project manager here on this job he was like yeah I own a development company I was like oh so like what's going on in this neighborhood like what is all this and he we just started talking and a cool conversation turned into us looking at homes that he's building in the neighborhood I looked at like I went on a seller meeting with him I went on like three tours looking at these new homes he built and at the end of it I was like I want to work with you yeah so I told him find me a deal I'll find the money you'll be my contractor he was the Builder at the time and you know let's do this so he actually got me together with a wholesaler and I bought my first piece of land from that wholesaler I believe this was 2015 and we built two homes in its place and then I did it again on the same street yeah so that was my first like virtual endeavor was actually just ground-up construction and how did that go it went really well actually I would argue that ground-up construction is much easier than flipping because with a new home with ground up I mean there's nothing they can really lie about it's in the for your first bid is what you see is what you get I mean unless you change your materials Midway for the most part like the contractor should have budgeted for everything and you shouldn't have any change or any surprises no surprises but with a flip you're gonna have change orders and especially a virtual flip with the contractor that knows you're not there you're gonna see lots of change orders yeah so right so are you still doing that or what's the story now so after a while I started I tried flipping homes in Nashville didn't like flipping liked building much better then I started just wholesaling in Nashville Nashville was just hot at this time okay Nashville was poppin so I stayed there for a bit but Nashville's started getting so competitive what happened was I was having a very difficult time being virtual in Nashville because I couldn't see what was going on on that street so like I would use direct seller marketing a seller would call me and I would make an offer based off of just what I could see on Google Earth and what comps I could pull but what I don't realize is that maybe like next door there's house being knocked down and the seller can take my offer and then walk to that Builder and go hey I want to sell mine too what would you offer me and of course that guy's gonna beat me he's in front of the seller he can kind of probably be a little bit more flexible with this pricing because he's already got a job on the same street so I kept getting outbid yeah and after a while I was like this is just there's got to be easier markets to do virtually so I decided to try a different type of market and this is really important when you're virtual there are different types of markets a lot of people don't realize this a lot of like my students they they don't realize that there's different end plays in every market and some are better than others if you are virtual I would argue that landlord markets are better for virtual investors so I I wanted to get into a more sort of balanced market and so that took me to the Midwest you know and now I run a volume wholesaling business in the Midwest and primarily we're selling rental properties to multi-unit landlord investors so why is rental a better exit strategy for virtual wholesaling I would say one is the repair situation that typically with a rental the end buyer is know going to really repair the house too much they're gonna make it rent ready so the repair number is fairly low and it's very easy to estimate it estimate also a lot of these rental markets like the the houses you basically are paying based off the rent that they support so it's easier to comp it's just easier I would say in those ways also the price points being lower I would argue that an easy way to tell if a market is going to be like easier or harder you know that's such a relative term are you competitive everybody says my mortgage so competitive like go to California I'll tell you what competitive is yeah the easiest way to see is just go look like at the average house price I type in insert city or insert County average house price Zillow and Zillow has like every city in there and it's like if you see that it's above like two hundred seventy five thousand dollars you're probably gonna see that it's more competitive because it's a more desirable area yeah so I like the more Midwestern like rental market type markets because there the price point is lower so it's a little bit less competitive yeah so how do you determine like you said you want to go after the rental markets there's plenty of rental markets right how do you figure out which one's the right one honestly there's there's amazing places in the United States to invest everybody goes to like the major metros a lot of like the students that I speak with and people that are interested they it's like they all want to be in the same places and I try to steer them away because there are so many great rental markets I would pick an area with strong values you you don't really want I mean I personally don't want to play around in a $50,000 or lower territory I want to see that the average house prices are at least 120 hundred thirty thousand and then to maybe two hundred and seventy five thousand yeah so if you pick a market that you're in that sweet spot and the rents look in the same area and figure out what the rents are a lot of people like the 1% rule if it matches if you can make a 1% rent to price work in that area I would say that could be a really great rental market but as far as what is a good virtual market which I think is like the the real question I always tell everybody you want to search for the the proven strategy or the proof-of-concept this is what I say so what does that even mean that means asking around and seeing you know are other people successful in doing what you are trying to do in this market it's that simple go online go to bigger pockets go to your group say insert city here anybody wholesaling houses I have a question see how many people raise their hand I am I am how many deals are you doing right see if there's successful people if if they are six if there are a good amount of people that you can network with that are successful the idea is well if they can do it so can I absolutely absolutely so well one question I have then is that we're talking about these other markets is do you have in lower priced market all right cuz we say you know California's competitive because the high prices and one of the reasons why is because you have larger margins so you know for us we target 15k in Phoenix and I think a lot of part of the country the targeting you know 10 to 15 K is there a fee that you're targeting in these areas or is it the same you know what I've noticed is it's not so much a dollar it's a percentage so what I've typically noticed is the wholesale fees are typically 10% of the end the end price or the final sale price so if you sell it to your landlord buyer for $100,000 I would hope your minimum is that you're getting is 10,000 right so I've personally noticed it's more of a percentage versus like an amount okay so you don't worry if you go in these markets that your your fee is gonna get compressed no and I think it's a misnomer with California I mean a lot of people say oh but you get these big fees well not necessarily because what if you have a bunch of other investors that bit up the price and there's no wholesale fee yeah which is quite frankly most of the time in these cellar like direct to seller leads that you're gonna get in a la market la OC you're gonna have that these sellers got 15 other cash offers that they can weigh yours against and now the wholesale fee is zero yes I was in the conversation chamber closest Olympics and I was seeing you know what they were talking about and they were saying like in California that the amount the offers you need to make in California there's just no room for mistakes there's no room for like you know a Cove it happens you're just screwed right like like okay well you know our fee went from 15 to 3 we're still gonna survive but man like there's just so freakin tight I don't know how anyone you know they will survive with that kind of stress they become Realtors that's that honestly like a lot of the rooms that we're doing all sellers in wholesalers and the flippers they become real leaders during this time and then if we you know if we see an adjustment they'll go back into flipping okay gotcha so someone that's you know listening right now and they said okay well I want to give virtual a shot realistically you know why I'm it takes it back what would someone need to do like they're listening to the show they're getting beat up in their markets let's say they're in Phoenix LA Seattle right where it's just more competitive Denver there all right I want I'm gonna give virtual a shot what are the first few steps they need to take well I would say the first step is that they need to put in their mind and make that decision 100% that that is what they are gonna it's gonna go all in they've got to go all in you can't have you can't have these this the decision okay like you have to go all in you have to make the decision that and that you fully believe that the amount of effort that it is going to take for you to wholesale houses virtually is going to be actually less effort easier than wholesaling in your backyard for me I was able to do that it took a lot of like it is supporting evidence I was asking phoning friends asking people you know that we're in other markets and see how much effort they were made and by effort I mean how many seller leads do you have to talk to to get a deal after a while I had the evidence that okay it's gonna be easier if I go to a Midwestern market versus Southern California so the first thing is make that decision and then from there you want to pick a market and I think I you know I said it earlier look for the proving concept there's a lot of people like they they want to like analyze this like they want to pull the cash sales to the ratio of the population because if there's if it's love if it's like higher then that means that it would be less competitive like I mean there's all these matrix and that's going too far into it they're going you're going way too deep guys because that actually does not work that does not necessarily mean it's less competitive or more yeah a lot it like for example they'll say oh well there's only like 200 absentee owned purchases in the last six months and the population is a million to me that's crap like that's not good that means that there's for some reason and buyers aren't buying there so there you want to be careful with those kind of numbers instead look for the proving concept that's when you want to go network go to your you know your page go to you know bigger pockets wholesaling Inc all of the big you know groups and network and find these different areas that people are doing well in and search for the proven concept um once you pick your territory you know then it's gangbusters you know you can do your drug to seller marketing I mean everything works virtually mm-hmm you know people say was the best marketing technique virtually was very cuz I was my next question yeah I mean what's the next marketing technique okay what's the best one well they all work there's no difference you just have to get really good at the phone and I would say that maybe that was back in my old spare even s days of being handed a book of phone numbers that I got really good at you know talking to sellers on the phone I think I'm pretty good at talking in general it's a life life commitment towards being good at talking yeah alright so let's go through some questions here looks like we don't have as many questions as normal so mr. hull wants to know was raising capital difficult I don't I guess probably for the flippin intended are developing in Tennessee how was that process of convincing everyone you were gonna start developing you know what I already had the capital invested I'd already done enough flips with them locally so they knew I was good for it they knew that like I I pay my investors back before I pay myself and I I never not pay an investor back you know my investors know that so it wasn't that hard but I think in general the broader question is like is raising capital difficult I would say you know it's a mindset thing it is if you think it is but honestly there's a lot of high net worth individuals that are dying to make the type of interest rates that real estate investors can offer on an asset that is a tangible asset that they can tie a trustee to that's secured that's secured absolutely yeah exactly I mean this is it's crazy I mean people go nuts for this kind of deal um let's see what else is there yeah so actually a couple these guys are Nashville so they know exactly what you're talking about so Daniel Moore wants to know what how much do you spend on marketing so monthly marketing spend you know why okay i so i now lump in like all of my expenses because we are so it's not direct mail as the game anymore for me it's more of your cold calling it's more of your mass texting which include its people like I need people to cold call and I need people to text message and I also have like acquisition managers disposition managers so it's hard to quantify I mean I would say maybe at least at least twelve to fifteen thousand in marketing and I also I do online I do some web SEO Facebook so I would say at least fifteen yeah right for you right so what if someone wants to get started what kind of budget they'll be looking at honestly I think it depends on what kind of budget you have there's you know the beating the bushes down-and-dirty don't have a marketing budget - you do have some money in the bank and you can do it obviously it's great to be on that right side but not everybody is as fortunate I didn't have that kind of money in fact I started I had no money when I got started I started with a credit card I literally like how to call visa and like increase my limit and that was like my that was my marketing budget that was my investment so I know what it's like to start from nothing and you could what's amazing is like with cold calling you don't have to have a lot of money you just have to have the money to buy a list and pay for an auto dialer that's helpful so really I mean it depends on that's depends on how big your list is I mean you know for a thousand dollars fifteen hundred bucks you could get a pretty big list that'll keep you busy for a couple months all right and one thing I put this here forgot to mention this but you know I was doing my research on yeah and I met you last year right we met at the batch office you came in to do Brandt's Brent Daniels ttp podcast right and so I remember you know you seem like he came out of nowhere you know but then as I was doing my research and I was finding out actually Lauren's been working really hard for very long time in fact you were on BiggerPockets not too long like four years ago maybe five years ago yeah but I think the point here is you know for some of the people that are frustrated that it takes how long it takes to get successful how long it takes get in traction so I just want to emphasize you know it seemed to me like he came out of nowhere but you've been at this for a very long time yes I have I always say in this business I mean you serve I used to get so frustrated at like the people that I would hear on these podcasts they'd be like oh how did you get started they're like well like I read bit Rich Dad Poor Dad and then like I decided I was gonna send some direct mail and then six months later I've closed 15 deals and now I'm like making $100,000 a month like that was not me I was like the total turtle like it's I I was a slow mover I did the best I could I I did work at this every single day and I improved every single day but it was not easy for me I've been at this eight years a lot of people don't realize that but I've been doing this for eight years and I always say you know there are the it there is this like perception that I came out of nowhere but that's that isn't true there's a lot of people that do come out of nowhere and I always say the term bright stars burn out the fastest and sometime in our business it's it's easy to like kind of feel inferior when you're you know you compare yourself yeah I know because I did that a lot and I know that probably a lot of the audience like they compare themselves why am I not as good as Jack Smith and Indianapolis and it's like well because your situation is probably completely different than that guy and that Jackson Earth might just be a bright star who is gonna burn out half of what he's saying might might not even be true so you really have to just you know pay attention to what you're doing every day and that's that's what I tried to do every time I got those negative thoughts a feeling inferior I had to remind myself that I'm on my own journey and so yeah I mean it's it's been a wild ride yeah but I think it's important point you know I'm glad you are able to you know extrapolate on it and you know control what you control right control the controllables don't worry about what everyone else is doing just control what you can control and I think that's a big part here so you're acquiring virtually so you say Co calling Direct Mail texting how are you moving the properties well right now how we're pretty dialed in where we're at so I have the boots on ground that are my boots on ground I don't JV partner anymore and when I say JV joint-venture I mean or work with like Co wholesalers I now we are the co wholesaler actually like now people go to us even though we're virtual we have the better buyers lists now great you know we're we're like really dialed in to the two territories that were in but to start I would say everybody should start by co-working with a co wholesaler or a joy venture partner I call them JV partners so you might hear me throw that slang around I recommend starting that way don't try to do it all yourself don't try to do what I'm doing now when you get started in a virtual market that is like the biggest mistake that people make and they fail and then they say virtual doesn't work and it's because you didn't know how to move that property right gotcha so you build your own buyers list we did but at first we started with JV partners so we did that for a while I would say our we worked with JB's for I don't know I mean at least our first 10 deals and then we tapered it off because the buyers started you know we worked on our buyers list on the side and there's there's some technicalities there that you know I can get into but it's super mikro but we built our buyers list on the side and then we started marketing our deals you know with the JV partner and it was just this organic process then it turned into now we have our boots on ground we don't really need to share our fees anymore right and I think that's just a natural evolution for every wholesaler regardless of whether you're virtual or not yeah Jason Toledo wants to know what's the best strategy for closing at a title company or attorney when your whole selling remotely so are there any different challenges when you're host selling virtually versus locally you know you want to find the the wholesaler friendly title company and the best way to do that is working with your JV partner your JV partner should have the title company that they use and then you start piggybacking off of it and then that's your title company that you use makes a little sense league wants to know what is your why in this business besides the money you know honestly it's funny I think having a monetary why is like the most useless Y that you can have I mean I've tried putting like monetary goals up on my vision board and it's like those are just numbers like they don't mean anything I don't feel like they impact me as much or maybe they just don't like resignate in my brain because they're just irrelevant numbers instead for me it's like this fear of having to get a job like I have like my I got in this business because I was you know a new mom and my daughter she from she literally from six weeks old was at a daycare from seven o'clock in the morning to six o'clock at night and I still remember like she's like five months old and I'm picking her up and she's clinging to the daycare provider sobbing because she is actually more used to the daycare provider than me and that was a bad day I say that's probably more than why that was the Y so right so the Y is my kids now my kids are now six and nine so they recognize me when I think they know who I am now my own baby like did not know who I was that's how hard it was to juggle corporate life and I have that in me like if you don't make this business work if you don't work get up and work today and make money you're gonna have to get a job and then your kids are gonna have to sit at daycare and I just imagine them like Little Orphan Annie's like just and take care of like like eating crackers and like home alone I don't know I like this like this like big like fear of getting a job and that's my why's my kids it really is just it's my kids and having that work-life balance as a mother and I'm a single mother so that's that adds a whole other thing of like being in control of my schedules really helped with managing you know my custody schedule and being a single mom yeah so that's my wife well I think you can see it as well right and just the fact that you're your handle is this mom flips yes yeah yeah so well that's good I mean you're very clear on it which is something you know I think most people would would kill for honestly to have clarity on their why so tack Thompson wants to know how long will it take to get his first deal virtually so let's just assume he's at zero how long with someone at zero take to get the first deal virtually you know I think it depends on the person because it depends on how much you let analysis paralysis get to you what I notice there's this like evolution of you know the students that I coach where they're all gung-ho and they go through my modules and then they freak out like they just get in his analysis paralysis and that that I had it depends on how long you want to sit there and overanalyze your business plan I recommend analyzing your business for about a week but I could see people they get really stuck in this so anytime I see people stuck for about a couple weeks and I'm like okay why haven't you done any seller marketing then I'm I start you know putting their feet to the fire a little bit my call them out like hey you're you're overanalyzing this thing yeah you got to go so if you can if if I could cut that analysis paralysis to like a one-week I I've seen students get where they get their first contract in 60 days and they're closing in 90 that's about the average for the student that does not spend four months over analyzing and that makes total sense this there's procrastination or perfection it really kills a lot of businesses even though even outside of wholesale just a lot of businesses it dies I mean I always say perfectionism is actually another word for procrastination or per analysis paralysis is really procrastination it's really just their excuse to not doing the thing they're afraid of because they're perfecting their business plan or they're making sure they really you know their CRM is really dialed in and you know they have the perfect lists I know it pains me every time I see it - mm-hmm you see it a lot unfortunately you do Ricky Miller wants to know would you say in a virtual market making offers and properties is there something you'd recommend on I guess the process of making offers over the phone honestly yeah I have I am like really I'm like religious about seller conversations I have my own script in my own negotiation techniques and I've honed them in from years and years of thousands of sellers that I've spoken with I am a very like I'm a people-pleaser I'm non confrontational I was that newer investor non-confrontational I am non-confrontational I'm surprised I am a people pleaser you'll see I'm very likeable like me by the end of this no I definitely I didn't I was that newer investor that was scared to offend seller with a lowball offer I hated it so I found ways to deliver offers in the most like non confrontational just easin into it and the first thing that I would say that I do and this is not just virtual I mean this is just giving good phone okay you guys should all do this and it doesn't matter if this is virtual or not the first thing that I do is I just make sure you know that the seller likes me like that's number one is just be friendly and don't talk about price upfront there is this book and I never can remember the name I think the author should have came up with a better name cuz it's not very memorable but it talks about like the croc brain and like how somebody remembers this book of read it it's like red and white thinks about pitch anything I think it's one pitch anything and it talks about like how okay you're like surprising a seller out of the blue cold calling or texting them and they are like on the defense okay that's their croc brain it's very primal think of like a crocodile and they're like gonna bite your head off okay they're they're very like unsure of who you are so that is not a time in that first conversation to discuss something as personal as price or at home that is I don't know like a lot of people make that mistake well they make that mistake because the sellers ask for their price yes and I mean if they's if they flat out ask I say you know I need to know more about the home and then I start going into the conversation right in the first conversations I just want the seller to like me that's it and I tell my acquisitions people they just need to like you they need to know your name you need to know their name what their plans for the home was why they're selling why what their dog's name is that's barking in the background and what breed like I want you to develop some kind of like rapport that you can put in the database and our CRM that you can then go back to so if it's like oh I you know how was that trip you went on you know that you said how was that I don't know how was your cruise or whatever you know like something that you can draw back on in the next conversation because the next conversation is when their guards gonna be down a little bit Authority like you from the first one built rapport build rapport now you're gonna talk about price so that's how I recommend it is get them to like you first you want to go back come up with an offer price and I like to develop I like to offer more in a price range versus I'm gonna offer you $75,000 for your home instead I like to say it looks like investors are buying homes in this area for between I don't know maybe sixty five to seventy eight thousand does that sound about right and then if it does if the seller bulks that that I kind of I test their reaction to that if the seller sounds offended then I say well look at you know okay well let me let me just show you a couple comps because maybe I did something wrong maybe I messed up did you see that house on one two three Main Street it's sold for sixty sixty eight and then there's and that's where you start pulling out your comps to support your narrative now it's well don't shoot the messenger it's not my fault that your neighbors sold their house for sixty eight thousand yeah and then at this point now they're mad at the neighbor they're not mad at you and you're on their team right so that's how I like to get to the price well I like the part where you said maybe I missed something right maybe I messed up let me look let's look at these properties together where as a team here yep let's look at scrappy together what did I miss I always say that maybe I messed up yeah I love it it's great Daniel mark has another question what metrics are using to target sellers I don't really understand a question maybe you do I'm not sure either are you talking like seller marketing at least our marketing is my god yeah Daniel clarify that question okay Marcus Mac what lists are you pulling from okay so let's talk maybe what are my favorite lists you know I so I am the laziest when it comes to these niche lists I don't like pulling niche lists they're a pain I don't want to go to the courthouse I'm not you're not gonna see me like it's going to a courthouse okay yeah for a city good tabula list I like your basic vacant list I like a tax lien to a tax delinquent or tax lien list stacked with absentee as well so they have to be an absentee owner that has a tax lien and then I just love the absentee owner list that's like my all day that's I think that's a very big hole selling Inc thing like just just keep it simple you guys like I mean honestly I like I gotta think you don't ever thinking I've gotten a code enforcement less it was junk like I've got no deals from that list I was like this and I was doing probates forever probe eats junk never did never did one probate got screamed at all the time why would you do something so negative do you don't need that negativity in your life Joey word asks if you is there one virtual market that you think is especially right to jump into right now is there one that you maybe have your eye for like a third market no there's so many great markets you guys and you guys if I tell you like one market do you know how many people how big is your audience how many people are gonna listen to this we typically get about 7,000 people okay so 7,000 people at least 10% are gonna go to like that market so I'm gonna go get go to uric spill Ohio perfectly valid point Tracy Jenny's wants to know is there a population that you say it has to have at least this many people yeah you definitely don't want to I say this word funny rule you don't want markets that are too small you don't want like farm towns you don't want like the Appalachian Mountains or anything like that you I would say at least 250,000 population I've heard some people say 150 is okay I I don't well I take that back I do there's one area a 150,000 population and then the county next so it has 150 as well so you can kind of do something like that where it's like in the county there's maybe 150 and then there's a neighboring County that's really good that you can draw from if you kind of max out that county right yeah so you just don't want anything too small and Annie Clifford appreciates the story because he feels like his first year there's a lot of focus not as much activities let's see Adrienne Nez give you some love definitely the real deal thanks Adrienne Jason Toledo when J being remotely how did you protect yourself other than using a knee JB your assignment contracts that's and that's an interesting point because I recommend everyone JV with a contract huh but I've never used a contract for a JV I don't either I know I'm in this thing where it's like you should do this but then in reality I'm like I don't do it well if I have a problem I'm gonna call Jamil oh yeah I'm gonna call pace and like what the hell happened here yeah exactly like I mean for me it's like the JB's that I've used have a reputation relationship a relation in debate like where I could easily call like they you know other people recommended them to me they know people so if they did you know if there was any funny business you know you could kind of out them you could black get them blacklisted a little bit you know so so face is here so he commented so you know it's funny pace and I we had a deal that we were doing together yeah and something went kind of crazy not his fault right like the end buyer and we had to have he said you know we had to have a principal come to the principal's office conversation I guess it wants to know what so what what are the two markets that you're in I mean Oklahoma City and Tulsa Oklahoma don't go there do you know how many people I tell that out loud and then you guys are all like Oklahoma's the the virtual market there's a lot of virtual markets you know actually I've talked to some people I was back at um and in Dallas and we live so March of nineteen I was talking some people know like Oklahoma is amazing that there's no competition there I think that's probably changed unless you're an amateur there's a ton of competition it's my fall because I go in these podcasts and Toby brought me know and then everybody's own coma it's actually pretty competitive especially with the cold calling in the texting right for sure and it's and I know a couple of the people down there as well it's it's not as easy as it as I had heard a couple years ago yeah and there's actually I mean there's I tested out like smaller markets like I said there was one I was like testing out for Hunt because I just mainly for my students a hundred and fifty thousand population amazing amazing like I was like okay so I got a make it's it's a market that I'm just dipping into and I need a higher before I get distracted on it I need to hire more people because you can't you don't want in your operation oh I'm gonna go to a new territory now everybody's spread thin you have to hire someone to handle the new territory that's another thing people make a mistake as they go they haven't even mastered their one whole sit there one virtual market and they already want to go to three yeah and I'm like no no no my kid then you need three people like you need someone managing that market yeah they're they're like little babies well another thing to it with too small of a market you know what we found in our program is if you buy you could buy the entire area very quickly yeah all the data mm-hmm yeah you run out and it's just like okay what's next so I think that's something to be careful of I think this is a softball question I think you and I had the same answer here but what are your thoughts on paying for mentorship I think that paying for mentor mentorship if you can afford it is absolutely the way to go so I personally paid for mentorship it all eight years every I constantly still to this day I have a coach I think every business owner any business you know any entrepreneur should have a coach when you go with a coaching program you you are shortening your learning curve so like you could go to YouTube University and what I see with YouTube University is it gives you vision but it doesn't give you direction so what happens is that people start getting excited and they get all these ideas in their head and it's like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna drive four dollars and cold call and text and like they're going like all over the place works with a program like for me I can only speak for myself I gave you a road map road map I'm like here step 1 step 2 step 3 step 4 in like any time I see my students like squirrel I'm like that stop doing that like and I'll I'll be honest with them like you are you're doing that shiny object thing again like get back on the path so with mentorship you are shortening your learning curve you're getting direction and vision as well yeah so it's very powerful and I don't know very many people that are successful wholesalers that did not pay into their education right oh you have to you have to I think that one of the other things too you kind of hit it on the vision is the clarity the amount of confidence you get being able to hey Lauren here's what I'm thinking and use like that's a great idea it's like no that's stupid exactly and I mean I obviously like I don't hold back and I can be a little like know that that's really dumb like don't do that you know and I will I will be honest with my students one thing you know I I noticed that with my students it's not even following the direction that's the problem it's more of there's usually a fear-based or an emotional kind of component that is stopping them from progressing so I like to say that the part that really my coaching really pays for itself is me getting you past that emotional or fear-based mindset so a lot of my students I can make a perfect examples I had this guy who was terrified of talking to sellers I mean he was so scared like I could feel like hidden like shaking like through the phone when he was telling me this fear he was terrified of just doing a basic seller qualifying call he wouldn't do it and we sat on the phone on a Saturday and I just told him like what's the worst that can happen I mean I was like a therapist like what's the worst that can happen you're not doing anything illegal what can they do they hang up on you well what if I don't know what to say hang up on them and say that you lost reception it's like prank calling yeah I mean maybe like it was the best thing ever to be stuck in a cubicle when I was like 21 years old at spare even ask with a phone book because that was awkward like that was very awkward like being 21 picking up the phone calling these old landlords that lived its amazing experience it's amazing relevant experience what we do it is it is and it was very awkward people could hear me talk like I was in an office like they could hear what I'm saying I sound so like I didn't know what I was talking about you know and so I think like just having that like level of embarrassment was so good for me and I think that that was what that student was going through he was just so like shy to talk to the sellers yeah he got over it and had his first contract in like ten days after that Saturday session with me and it was like the best like ever I was so proud of him yeah and so yeah it's all about like breaking through and that's the coaching I think the coaching helps you break through those fears absolutely that's what you're getting out of it Francisco asks a really great question so you know you started slowing your core you had a great jumpstart but then you kind of slowed down has some challenges what made you stick around honestly I'm not a quitter I don't give up on anything like I'm really really stubborn and I think that that is sometimes it's a great thing sometimes I don't quit things fast enough so I do have that issue it's it's like a double-edged sword like I I am persistent and I will persevere but I also sometimes am guilty of not quitting on people fast enough I'm quitting on employees fast enough quitting on ideas that aren't working fast enough I mean that happens to me as well so it really was I put it in my head I refused to give up and I still I refuse to give up yeah and I think that people ask me like what is the most common trait or characteristics we see from everyone that's on the show and that's the one it's that grit that persistence like I will not die right yeah this is gonna happen it's not an option yeah so I love it and then action REI asks how do you vet a mentor that's a really good question so I think the word that comes to me is perspective you want to have a mentor that has the same perspective as you so this brings me back to my when I was getting started and the mentors that I had many of them gave me really bad advice because they did not have the perspective because they did not live in Southern California and they had no idea what I was going through they were telling me we'll just send more direct mail like yeah when I spent $10,000 this month that Direct Mail Navin got paid back like that is really bad advice and that's because they were taking their their world Midwest perspective to California they had no business giving me advice no offense but that you know so you want to search for a mentor that has the same perspective so is this mentor does this mentor have experience in a landlords market if your market is more of a landlord's market like does he or she have that experience in it yeah cool you know does she live in if your virtual if you're like me you know you live in a high price area like Seattle California New York like you want somebody that has that experience of like yeah I live in a high price area and I have to do it virtually but I think also the most important is the market that they're in like I can speak for myself I have developer market flipper market and landlord it's all three I've done them all if you are talking to a mentor and they only have like a landlord market experience it's they're not gonna have the same perspective yeah and they might give you bad advice all right I think that's a great point pace wants to know what book you're reading right now the road less stupid it's an amazing sight oh good I love it I I picked that up a few months ago and I haven't been that excited about a book Susan ever split the difference how same it well I've not read never split the difference was the same like I'm really I love that one that one and the atomic habits was pretty good but now this one is yeah I'm gonna have to read this multiple times me too no I'm not done yet but I love it and I love the term dumb tax I mean I can't describe like what what I've done many times in my life like paid dumb taxes and those dumb taxes are expensive they are we're not like a small percentage oh yeah I mean no they aren't I I tell people with in virtual like a lot of people that try to go virtual they pay a lot of dumb taxes I mean these are like five figure mistakes that people make because they don't get a JV partner and they want to do it all themselves and in their first deal in a market that they don't have they have five buyers on their buyers list like Donna do it all myself and keep all my profits like all of what zero cuz you didn't know how to move the house like just for everyone is listening to clarify dumb tax is the unforced unnecessary mistakes that we make because because we just didn't think more clearly and they cost a lot of money cost they call it a dumb - yeah absolutely so many I've made them alright so we already talked to answer these questions Annie says hi hey Annie I'll see you tomorrow I guess the last question I only can answer here is people want to know how much is your program I can't answer that but I can give you the link or Steve did you want to include you have the link that's right of course the link is the link rate cool so we answer a lot of questions so right now what is your biggest ruggle I mean Co vid was pretty pretty much a legit struggle for me I would say that's like everybody's legit struggle and it's not with business it was more of having my kids home hey if you guys I don't know if anybody'd notice I was supposed to be on this like three months ago and co vid because my kids got kicked out of school I had a postponed this but I would say now I'm in a coaching role and I'm running my business and I have my two girls that are my number one priority and I think that I am struggling a little bit with the work-life balance I don't want my kids to go to the wayside of my career and as a female as a mom like this is and not just this is not a female male issue but as a you know a mom a father mother father when you get a new job a new career although it's an amazing opportunity and I I love what I'm doing I am in that period of like I want to still make sure that I'm giving my kids everything that I was able to give them so time blocking it has been a challenge for me and I totally understand that because for a long time I was really good you know I was working 30 or 35 hours a week right right all these business is going but you know kids are first but man with theirs even as an entrepreneur we keep adding more things to our plate and now there's that struggle for me too so I appreciate you sharing that what did you superpower I would say my superpower I've done so much direct to seller marketing in eight years it's all I've ever done and speaking Niko she ating deals directly with sellers so sales and seller negotiation everything direct to seller is that's all I know sounds like you enjoy it well it's just all I know so yeah but I mean to be honest I don't talk to sellers I train people now - I don't I haven't talked to a seller in years I mean I've always had him I've had annoying this for at least five years I've been doing this for very long but I train them how did you run it so yeah awesome so I want to think about last sauce you want to leave the listeners with I'll make a couple quick announcements guys so we had our workshop well last night we talked about on the show was three months ago so we had a workshop in April got cancelled so we're gonna be doing it right now we're looking in July 10th 11th 12th and the phoenicians so if you guys are interested go to disruptors comm and next week we've got Kody Barton who basically made pace like pace was nobody until he started working at Kody so we have a Kody Barton here next week talking about scaling so last thoughts well gosh I think I would want to leave you I don't want to leave you guys with the impression that this was always easy for me and that I was this overnight success I am the definition of a turtle I did not have this quick luck with this business and not everybody does so I don't want anyone to be discouraged if you don't have that like quick you know overnight success thing with real estate wholesaling investing and whatnot I I truly believe that part of where I'm at today was a compilation and the compound effect my habits throughout these eight years every day I worked every day I listened to something that I would read maybe a chapter sometimes I don't have time for a chapter I'd read a paragraph or you're listening to a podcast real quick and I always worked I worked at it I made good choices and I have good habits and I think that that compilation over eight years is where you know why I'm here um you know today so yeah maybe I wasn't an overnight success and that doesn't I truly though enjoyed the journey and I think that anybody who's not in you know you're frustrated aw why why didn't I read Rich Dad Poor Dad and then all of a sudden I'm closing all the money just fell on me you know I'm not that successful guy but a girl you know and it's not everybody is I certainly wasn't and but make good choices have good habits work on your habits and try to improve those habits every you know every day and you will eventually get there if you don't give up yeah I think that's a great message so if somebody wanted to get ahold of you how would they get hold of you well I would say following me on Instagram my handle is this mom flips I'm sure we can put that in the show notes um if you guys are interested in the virtual investing mastery program you have a link that you'll be sharing I think those are the best ways to get a hold me also we can share my email we want to do it's more in at this mom flips comm there you go that's her why that's it alright so guys thank you for watching thank you for accommodating with the craziness finally making him onto the show Thank You thanks a lot guys yeah see we thought let's make disruptors you
