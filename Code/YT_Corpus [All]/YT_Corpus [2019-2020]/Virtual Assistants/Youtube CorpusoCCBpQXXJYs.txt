 All right, hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of Candid Convos and today we have a very   special guest her name is Christina Previte and,  Christina and I know each other from different   organizations but she also has a podcast which  I want to ask her a lot about it's really cool   and it's like her branding is phenomenal  and I was honored to be a guest on that podcast   and so I'm excited to talk to her about that a very cool growing divorce firm   in New Jersey as well and just a lot of cool things going on here so you know the other   thing Christina is this is October and it's breast cancer awareness month and what we wanted to do   in October was really highlight some kick-ass female entrepreneurs and lawpreneurs and so   the timing is really great to have you on I know that was an okay introduction so, please   give us more of the detail and tell us more about  the firm and about you and about your podcast.   Thank you, well thank you for inviting me I appreciate it, and thank you for acknowledging   breast cancer awareness month and I think you did a great introduction, so basically I'm the CEO   and co-owner of New Jersey Divorce Solutions in New Jersey it's a law firm that focuses   exclusively on divorce and family law and we do also have a podcast called "the divorce happy hour"  podcast so we try to make a little light  of some of the subject matter, it's not just   specifically divorce topics that we talk about but  it's really anything that might be relevant from   someone who's either thinking about a divorce  or going through one or who has been through   a divorce because you still have some issues  that come up from time to time so we do talk   about specific divorce issues like how alimony is  calculated or what you're entitled to in terms   of property distribution but we talk about other  things too like estate planning or what to do when   it comes time to sell your house or recently with  coronavirus we've been talking more about issues   related to homeschooling so you know when you're  going through a divorce it's not just the divorce   but it's so many other things that really touch  your life so we like to focus on those things too.   Tell us about virtual staffing so our audience here is mostly lawyers Get Staffed Up we   as we say liberate lawyers with incredible virtual assistants offshore or international   and you know this thing has I think been great because the feedback we get and our growth   I guess speaks for itself we've just been able to work with so many really fun mostly attorneys   some non-attorneys you know if it's a service business it's really the same thing but our niche   is law firms and attorneys and you're one of those people you signed on for one   and then within a few months, you sign up for another I know you have Emma and Regina on the   team look this is not a perfect thing it's not like we're gonna find you one person they're gonna   be with you the next hundred years and they're never gonna have a day off and they're never gonna   have an issue it's still staffing, right?  employees will always be the biggest challenge for   any business that being said I you know you obviously signed up for number two because it   worked it's working for you so but I'll let you tell us you know tell us about   your experience and what you've learned and what you would you know tell other people yeah so   we've had a really great experience with virtual assistants and I will say I think the   hardest part about it if you don't have a virtual assistant yet is just wrapping your brain   around the idea of having it because we're so accustomed as law firm owners and other offices   where you there's a typical office environment we can't really wrap our brains around it I think   that's really a mindset issue right I hate when people say well this is how we've always done it   but that's sort of the attitude is especially with law offices that that's how we've always   done it so I couldn't even conceive of not having an office with all the furniture and the people   you know coming in every day working nine to five and myself even going to the office every day   but I will say one of the blessings of Covid is that I think we've all realized that you can   do it, you can work virtually and, you can do it well and actually maybe even more efficiently   than before but I started to kind of pick up on this even before Covid, even before the quarantine   experience because we were having trouble with hiring we it was definitely our Achilles heel   it was the one thing that just seemed to elude us and I think a lot of business owners have   that issue because there's no magic to hiring somebody you know you can do everything that   all the coaches and business management people tell you to do right have numerous interviews   and have different people interview them and do these various personality tests but   at the end of the day, you don't really know who is going to work out so I started thinking about   after having not having good luck with hiring I did start to become more open to virtual staffing   the most obvious reason is because  there's a huge saving financially   you know we can get a virtual assistant for probably a third of the cost that it would cost   us to hire someone in person just because we have to hire someone in New Jersey and have payroll   taxes and all of that so that was one issue but then when we actually hired somebody we found that   it worked out very well not having them in the office that I had the same accessibility to them   maybe even better than I would if they  were actually in the office so once I   was able to actually wrap my brain around  that and give myself the opportunity to have   that experience I found that it worked really great and so great that I hired another one   and both experiences have been really wonderful I literally do not have anything negative to say   I really don't and I'm not just saying  that because I'm on your YouTube channel   it's worked out so beautifully that I  can't believe that I didn't do it sooner   and I would invite people if especially if you're having hiring issues to think outside the box and   consider having a virtual assistant I can't think of any downside I really can't that's really   that's really nice of you to say before the coronavirus and by the way it seems like   people just call it Covid-19 like we're losing the word coronavirus I don't know just kind of an   observation but we used to have to do exactly what you said it's the mindset we would have to   educate people and I always think of Shark Tank when they want an investor and someone's like it's   going to take 10 million dollars to educate  the public on this new idea or this issue   we were having to say there is something called virtual staffing you can hire people   and make people really think about it and without painting too broad of a stroke people get set in their ways like you  said we've always done this it's comfort   you know there's really not a lot of growth so the older the attorney I'm just like putting back   facts the less likely they are to really engage in a big change and really shake things up because   you know as my dad I was he's like well you know if I was younger but now you know I'm retired and   I can't really you know be risky with my money etcetera and to a certain extent that's true   so it was like constantly like we were  probably having much better success with   the younger attorneys but after Covid-19 all of a sudden it's like oh wait a minute   now everyone needs to hire virtually and we've, I mean our company has grown by 35 percent   just in the past six months. Wow!, that's amazing so you were ahead of the curve. Yes, I wish   it would be fun to say like we knew  what was coming and no we got lucky I mean there   was we saw a need and we and we started the company in about you know January 2018   and it was growing it was still doing really well but it's just gone to another level   and so. I beg to differ with you brett though I think you were ahead of the curve because you saw   the value of having virtual assistants you saw that it could work long before a lot of other   people did long before I did so I do think that you were ahead of the curve I think it's only   because of coronavirus or Covid whatever the name is now, I think a lot of people have now   caught up on an accelerated basis maybe faster than they ordinarily would have   just because of necessity because we've had to be virtual, so I do think that you were ahead of   the curve you recognize the value of that sooner than a lot of other people. That's   true but kind of like you your reaction was I wish had known about this or thought about it sooner   my reaction because I started my law firm in 2011 and again this really didn't hit my radar until   late 2017 it was like man there was this better way the whole time and I never knew about it and   that's why I'm so bullish on sharing what we're doing because I was the guy that that didn't   want to hire because I couldn't afford it and if I had learned about this option I think I would be   you know exponentially ahead of where I am now and that kind of to another point when you talk   about the cost savings, some people you know aren't  you guys taking jobs away from people in the   United States my argument is twofold one I think we're improving the global economy you me everyone   who's engaging in this we're improving the global economy which has good effects on the entire world   especially with crazy immigration issues and two people don't understand about small business   our margins are not so big where we're just you know you start a business you hire one attorney   and now you're driving a Lamborghini and flying a helicopter right so yeah let's not be   so stressed and we can grow our firm with more affordable help that will get us to a   place more quickly where we are hiring more people in-house it's not just it doesn't have to be one   or the other in fact you know we work with a lot of people at 100 virtual now that's fine   but they're also mixing in U.S. virtual  staff members because you know the paralegals   that is if anyone ever solves that like  like if we could do virtual paralegals oh my gosh   this would be a billion-dollar company because.  Or virtual attorneys would be even better   Well yeah especially if they were if they  if they came at a cost reduction right   yes that's the challenge so but anyway I appreciate you saying that so now we don't have to   educate people we just basically look do you want to work with us or not and it really pushed us   it saved us 10 years I think it would have taken 10 years to get the amount of like   buying and acceptance that we got because of Covid.  Oh! absolutely, I agree you know that's why I say   it's one of the blessings that came from Covid we actually went completely virtual we got rid   of our office space, saved a significant amount of money and just various expenses connected with   that I would also say that I'm a better people manager an office manager working virtual than I   was before because I didn't want, I wanted to work from home, all the time and it was really hard to   really be there for my staff and see what was going on in the office all the time if I wasn't   there all the time so the only way that you can really handle that is either to be there all the   time or hire other staff to be there all the time like an office manager or a firm administrator   so I forget what book this came from maybe you know because I know you like to read a lot of   business management books but there's the saying that if you can solve one problem it can solve   a lot of other problems so I have felt like going virtual for us has solved a lot of other   problems one of them being just managing the staff because now I can do that virtually.   yeah that, well tell us about that first of  all I don't know the book on top of my head that   would have made me feel great. Sorry I didn't mean to put you on the spot. No, that's okay    You can't know everything but I think  tell us about so at Get Staffed Up we have a   very structured meeting rhythm where we have our department meetings our leadership team meetings   and it has provided and there's still flexibility but it has put a structure around us being able   to solve problems and act quickly which because we're growing so quickly we need to be able to do   but tell us your method for being able  to manage your people virtually because   people think how am I going to do that but here you're saying you're better now virtually. Well we   have regular morning huddles so we do all of us just convene via zoom actually we're using   Microsoft Teams now and just to check-in you know remind everybody that we all still work together   give us some face time with each other we don't necessarily have to talk about business per   se sometimes it's casual it's like water cooler talk just to kind of keep morale up and keep   that report going and we, I will say if there is anything negative about having a virtual assistant   the only thing that I could think of is we do like to get together at least once a month and   and get everybody together for lunch so we can have some contact with each other in person   just just to talk you know just to kind of keep like I said keep that rapport and we can't do that   with the virtual assistants so you know that's a minor issue but it would be nice to be able   to include them a little bit but we do include the virtual assistants in the huddles so they sort of   feel like they're getting to know everybody even if they're not working directly with those people   we're actually going to start  implementing one-on-one coaching sessions   with each of our employees, I have a business partner so you know we don't have an identical   rapport with each employee so sometimes I'll do it alone with a staff member or John will   do it alone with a staff member just to find out you know not just what their professional   goals are and how work is doing because they won't always tell you that they're not always   as forthcoming because I think they try to tell you what they think the right answer is right   like if you say how's work going I think they sort of feel like they have to give a positive response   but that doesn't help us grow and change and make things better for them because at the end   of the day happy employees do good work and they stay so making them happy isn't always about what   they're doing at work it could be about personal goals that they have and if there's something   in their personal lives that we could help them with that's going to make them happier whatever   that maybe if it's getting them coaching or training on something or giving more time   off or giving them a stipend for some something else that they want to do outside of work   then that helps us too it helps us keep them happy so I'm this is still a work in progress for us   we used to do this a lot more when we were in the office now we have to actually make more of an   effort to just carve out the time for it and come up with some creative ideas so it's still a work   in progress but that's really what we're trying to do is not just kind of treat them like they're in   an assembly line but treat them like people that you know have needs personal and professional and   try to really stay attuned to that and you know, make sure that we're helping them with that   yeah it's wonderful to hear you say  that because it's absolutely possible to   build a really good culture even with virtual staff by doing the things that you just said   and not treating people like they're far away behind a computer making them feel like they're   part of a team meaning they're a person that's cared about by who they're working with and for   so that's all really uh helpful and wonderful to hear you say that so how do we tell people how   to find your blog and find your, you know your website we got a lot of people in Florida that   they hear from us so maybe they need somebody in  in Jersey and just you know contact information   Thank you!
