 so in this week's video I want to show you how you can quickly find items to buy on Amazon FBA hope you can all see is the same strategy of how to find out in just a bundle and sell these same bundle items on eBay as well as your own website if you have your own website this strategy also works really well with drop shipping I also want to quickly explain why battling rocks if you're nearby Amazon FBA import or your dropship seller or all five now the great thing about this strategy is it's really simple and very easy to replicate which means if you have one or more low-cost virtual assistants working for you they can use this same strategy to find exactly which items to bundle you know anyone's been following me long enough knows that everything I do and teach must be easy to duplicate or replicate so it can be outsourced to low cost overseas virtual assistants if you want to build a business that works without you you need to avoid complicated procedures that only you can do now if you're a business that runs completely without you every task must be able to be outsourced this bubbling strategy is very easy to outsource ok let's start with why bubbling rocks and let's start with Amazon every item on Amazon has an S in number with a barcode Assam which is short for Amazon standard identification number now the Assin is a 10 character alphanumeric unique identifier we just assigned by Amazon and also Amazon's partners now the reason I'm talking about asset numbers is if a knight on Amazon has had a lot of sales and a lot of reviews it can be very difficult to start selling that same item if you're on the ground floor and you've never sold but I'm ever before the sellers showing in the buy box on Amazon might have already sold the same item five hundred plus times so if you choose to sell that same item it can often take some time to and again momentum and if you're listening to appear high in the search results so instead or as well as competing against other sellers an extremely effective method is simply create a brand new product with a brand new acin number and this new product is the same product but with a bundled product and the great thing is Amazon shows you exactly which products for you to bundle let's say you're selling this coffee and espresso maker if you look at this item on Amazon if you scroll down to the bottom of the listing Amazon shows you frequently bought together it's frequently bought together is absolute gold Amazon is telling you exactly what buyers are choosing to purchase with this item these need items that you can bundle you can also use the same information and bundle the same items on eBay and your own website if you've got your own website and you can do this same battling with it's on amazon FBA or drop shipping now this normally leads to the next question of how do I get these Islands bundled from my supplier and shipped to an Amazon warehouse of course you know life is really easy if the same supplier can supply both items but you know that's not the case what we do is get supplier a to send their product to supplier B we then get supply it be to put item a and item B in a plain brown box and then simply stick a barcode on it which has you new Amazon asking number now most suppliers I have it do this and they normally don't charge much extra for doing it yeah that's all this strategy requires me to supply is a plain cardboard box and a sticky label which they can print out from their laser printer now you can either get your supply to printing out the sticky label or you can print them out yourself and you know send em to your supplier and one supply B has put the two items in the colored box and slap a stick on it which has them in the acid number in barcode these can now be shipped straight to an Amazon warehouse if you're selling on Amazon FBA when you do this strategy of sending arms from supply a display it be to keep the shipping costs down try to always ship the lightest item to supply it be in other words item a is always the lightest in item B is the heaviest if you drop shipping try to always use bundle items which come from one supplier now you can of course use items from different dropship supplies but you know this really jacks the price up is now you need to pate lots of shipping and also obviously creases that workload is you're now using two suppliers for each sale you know that one item you know that's all for this week please scroll down leave me a comment below until next week lists more sell more this is Neil Waterhouse
