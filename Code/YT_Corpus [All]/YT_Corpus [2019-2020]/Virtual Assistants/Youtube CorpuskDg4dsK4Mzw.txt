 Thanks Fiona! Like you really added a good personal touch It makes us feel important to be invited for lunch and we're so privileged and we're so thankful to have a CEO like you where else can you find a CEO who wants to dine with us Like you don't get to see that a lot I mean you don't get to see a lot of that here you know You're one of a kind And bless you for that I guess everybody is happy to be with you I'm happy to be with GO-VA Looking forward to greater heights for GO-VA Cause the only way to go From now on going on to the IT Park Is to go up That's where we're going
