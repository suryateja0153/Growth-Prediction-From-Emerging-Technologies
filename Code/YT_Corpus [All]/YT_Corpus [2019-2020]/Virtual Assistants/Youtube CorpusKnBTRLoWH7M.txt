 okay can you talk about how you structure it from a people perspective on your internal team what do you use internal staff for I know they're all remote what do you use bas for what are freelancers give the audience a good picture of that structure yeah so I am in Kalamazoo Michigan yes it really exists is halfway between Chicago and countersue that's right all right I was gonna say you see more Yankees jerseys around here than you do Tigers jerseys but yeah most people have no idea where it is and you know ten years ago we would have had to been in LA or New York one of the big centers but what I saw with my last company is that as much as I love this place not everybody loves it right now I can't find the talent here nor can I reach out to a customer you know we've got customers in Australia we've got them in Asia in the Middle East I can't tell them oh sorry we're shut down today you know we got ten inches of snow in Kalamazoo right that's not their problem nor do they understand what snow is some of them so with that you know we needed to have a global team in order to serve a global audience and the flexibility that's given us you know I can't I can't tell somebody that you know our office is only open from 9:00 to 5:00 East Coast time that's ridiculous when you're when you're serving this so I always said that I wanted to find the best people I could and to me work now is what you do not where you go so we look at that and say if it is a key integral part to our business you know the our account managers that deal with the the clients all the time our relationship managers that deal with the podcast hosts all the time those are key internal functions that we keep within our team but it's hard to grow a team it's hard to scale a team and I don't I would much rather leverage what you've done Nathan and on other things you know we call them our overnight Angels I can give assignments to your team that my team needs during the day and you guys will do them overnight it's just like magic or there's things like research there's things like graphic design other things like that that there are people that are much better than us at that and it's not our key area why wouldn't I outsource that so to me it's much much more scalable with that the other thing that I didn't have totally appreciate with the remote team was the flexibility that it gave the team - and we have some people that are working for us just because they like that flexibility you know I can think of one one team member that her mom got sick and she had to move back home for three months well she had a job she would have had to leave that job we had another team member that came to me and said my spouse just got this great job offer you know in the Olympic Peninsula and can I move there and take the job well Nathan I'm not the most worldly guy I'm like oh that's fine that's no problem how far is Greece ahead is that like what five or six hours ahead east East Coast time and she she's like no the Olympic Peninsula of Washington and I'm like oh that's easy you know you could have moved there and I wouldn't have known the difference it's really you know work is what we do not where we go and I think the VA is are perfect for the for the pocket industry I mean I use them to get on a lot smaller podcast we use you guys for more bigger ones you can use them for sales and more Kings for leads on the client side finding experts finding coaches different stuff like that if you're if you're a hoax reaching out to people all those stuff that just take up way too much time as an entrepreneur if you can come up with a good system and process for it and keep in mind it is one of those things where it's trial and error it's split testing it's building the process better and better over time the A's are perfect for it what do you agree oh and I I would totally agree and I would say build the process and then also copy the process right you don't have to start something form from scratch and one of the things I love about your team is they've worked with other people they've they've got processes they know what works already and so I remember you were a master of this before you'd go to a meeting you'd be reaching out to people on LinkedIn connecting with them all the rest of that and I'm like I could do that same thing and so now I've got a process and every time I go to a meeting you know I reach out to Jane on your team and say hey this is the meeting I'm going to here's the list of people that are going to be there here's the list of speakers you know could you reach out for me and at least make that contact and you know it's the the first time there's a little bit of work to it but boy after that it's just it's magic you sleep and the work happens completely agree so we have a Facebook group called outsourcing masters if anyone's listening feel free to join the group and one of the posts that I had recently was all about using vas for lead generation so I try to network with new people every day I try to join new groups to be a part of new community reach out to different influencers and I create these sheets over time of my hit list we're always adding to it it could be people I meet at conferences or maybe I'm at a conference with them and I don't get a chance to meet with them and they all get added to a database and when I wake up every morning I have a list of people to contact so I just go through I have a list of what groups to join I have a list of what kora links to post up in so it's all very organized and over time if you're doing that stuff day in and day out your network grows your business grows your audience grows and there's a lot of creative ways you can do it once you come up with a good system I love how you say that - because you want to work with people that just don't take direction but also help empower you and so it's like when people say well how many people do you have on the team how many people work for you sometimes I think well the question is this how many people do I work for and I love that one you know somebody comes and says hey this is what you need to do today I don't have to think about it those are the high-level tasks that are important so I think it's it it's not a control it's a delegation and empowerment model let's talk about the podcast industry where do you see it's going because I have to be honest with you I people been telling me for years to start a podcast and when it was I thought it was at its peak a few years ago I was on like entrepreneur on fires on all these podcasts like alright this is great this is awesome but are we at the peak does the world really need more podcasts but
