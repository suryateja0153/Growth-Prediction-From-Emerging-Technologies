 if you would like our virtual assistants to screen calls for you you will need to add each person who may need to take a call in the control panel you will need to set their extension number name position and the conditions for when the virtual assistant should screen the call or attempt to put the call through for example you might want all sales related leads put through to your sales manager John Smith on extension 200 if the virtual assistant puts the call through to an extension but there is nobody there to take the call the virtual assistant will then take a message on behalf of the user
