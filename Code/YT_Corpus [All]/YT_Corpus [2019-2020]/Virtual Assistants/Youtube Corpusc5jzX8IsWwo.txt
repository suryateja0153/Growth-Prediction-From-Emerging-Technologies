 So one of the things that people often think about when they're working with virtual assistants is the cultural differences what's it like to work with people from another country well we're going to get some firsthand feedback from Karla right now So what about the cultural differences now Karla you've worked with loads of different cultures but predominantly Americans how was that is are they really very different to Filipino culture well with my experience you know it's it's a lot different working with people from outside even my experience with North Americans because they tend to be very direct you know with us Filipinos sweet tend to how to call this meet around the bush sometimes if not most of the time have you had any Australian clients, I haven't as of yet they're really direct to the point but anyway we're talking about North American clients and they are very direct especially when giving instructions to us and they redirect with the things that they want to get from us with the results and I think it's it's kind of pro it's a pro is sometimes it could also be a con especially with us I'm Filipino sometimes especially where not when you're not used to it and when they tend to become direct sometimes it feels kind of offensive at times but what I like about it like what I said is that things are easy to get done because they're ready because of the fact that everything is being given to you direct straight at the point no sugarcoating so yeah that's interesting that you say sometimes it can kind of seem a little bit offensive so if you're a North American we're not saying you're offensive it's just compared to Filipino culture and that's that's very common with a lot of cultures around the world and I work with a lot of Thai staff for example and you know they're much more so shy personality and if you're very direct they kind of war you know yeah yeah so how do you cope with that what about because you're a team leader here what when you get new virtual assistants and they're not used to working with people like behind does it does it happen like in their first couple of days ago well yeah it happens with my experience well I've been in this industry since forever I guess since 2008 for almost a decade now for over a decade now the first few months has been how they call it overwhelming it was very difficult for me because it felt like they were bashing me when in fact they were not actually it's just them being them okay so probably with the new virtual assistants not really used to that kind of culture I would really suggest letting them watch videos yeah culture so this is what you do is a looting later yeah watch them the cultural difference of videos it helps give them a bit of a background um let them hear on calls no that's what we used to do calls from um North Americans so they get a gist of how they talk over the phone how direct they are yeah but also let them know that it's just about the job or the business not a small thing yeah they don't know each other so these clients don't know us so probably they're attacking or they're saying something different or they're saying something as offensive it's not really against you not against us probably just about the service but of course it's normal okay but no that's that's interesting and I find that I don't originate I'm English but now Australian for the last 25 years I find when I visit visit England people say well you know you're kind of really abrupt because that's that's what Australians are like you know I go to into a business meeting and it's you know it's a couple of pleasantries and then straight to the point where as you know in other cultures we have to spend a few minutes you know chilling and so on so yeah so if you're living in North America or you know you're working in a culture like that maybe just be aware that out because I say our because Australian to the same soak our sort of very direct approach can seem a little bit overwhelming for people in the Philippines so how do you how do you overcome that any said because I don't want people to be watching this and thinking what do I have to treat them like in cotton wool or something it's not it's just understanding that the cultures are all bit different underpants yeah so basically with incoming of virtual assistants or what I used to call agents before it's it will take time to be honest it doesn't happen yeah but it's more reassuring them again and again that with these with this cultural difference between yeah cultural difference it takes time mmm and it takes understanding of course that need to address as well and so we have to learn that yeah we learn to adapt to the kind of culture that they have in order for us to be able to relate well and communicate well yeah and deal better with our clients because if we do have that understanding because we don't understand we're trying to understand their culture we will be able to give them a better service wow that's true yeah and I can remember I mean I only started working with virtual assistants about seven years ago but I tend to sort of go into things with researching and so on so I'd research that and I've done some research and all the things that can go wrong when you first have a virtual assistant and I'll put that in another video but I just made sure that I started off really slowly with my first video I made some very clear instructions and we'll do another video about communication but I think it's always good with Anu to provide come written instructions guides I used to do a lot of videos and video capture so that you know if we're being really abrupt and quite quick in our communication they might miss something so I do it using things like Jing and Camtasia or I'd I do a screen capture and say hey look this is how you put my travel or that kind of stuff so they can refer to it but yeah yeah and I found very quickly then you know if you build that rapport that the relationships really good yes so I should say you're running our one of our night shifts at the moment yes and we were talking the other day about you know different hours of work and things so actually that's the topic of another discussion what's it like you know working with different time zones and things but you've been working night shift for a long time and yeah yeah yeah so but it was about 10 years or something well yeah this is five in the morning so you know yeah but hey Carla I really appreciate the tips on some of the cultural differences and we were picking on North Americans but yeah it could be applied to any culture you just have to be sensitive to that and if you want any more tips on working with virtual assistants you need to hit the subscribe button make
