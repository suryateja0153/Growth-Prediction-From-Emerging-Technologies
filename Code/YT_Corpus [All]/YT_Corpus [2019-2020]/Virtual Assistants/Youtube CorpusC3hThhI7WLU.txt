research most virtual assistants have web research skills and most clients look or prefer virtual assistants with web research skills because at some point in your project clients will definitely ask you to conduct research whether simple or complicated always make sure that you get your information from credible or reliable sources so make sure to check out the following okay number one the author or the writer you can check out the writer or the author on other social media platforms just to see if they have social proof or they really know what they're talking about next is date of course it's always best to gather information from most recently published articles or those recently updated information usually when you go to a blog or an article you will see that it's updated a few months ago or on a certain date so you can grab those things just a little pro tip please don't settle on all on the search results that you see on the first page of google because to be honest with you you will still get some credible and reliable sources on the next pages next is of course you have to be keyword specific with your research what do i mean by this use long tail keywords when you do research not just the general type of keywords let's say gyms in USA make sure to be as specific as possible so that google will narrow down the results for you and it will be easier for you to get the information that you really need for example gyms in Florida with pool you will get the most relevant information next is of course you can also validate the information by also checking out other articles don't settle for one source you can always check out other articles websites and blogs just to make sure that you're getting enough information that you can present to your clients so
