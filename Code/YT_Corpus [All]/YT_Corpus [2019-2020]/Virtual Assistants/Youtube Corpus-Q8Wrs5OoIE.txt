 and today I want to talk about something that can sometimes sometimes people can have strong ideas about and yeah what I've learnt Hey Naren here from positively sorted today I want to talk about something that can and sometimes people can have strong ideas about and that is using a virtual assistant that is local and Australian versus or in your own country versus a Filipino or other super cheap sort of offshore virtual system yeah so I know some people can have super strong ideas about yep just use like the super cheap why would you use you pay more and some people are like you need to employ people locally and support support your local community and I actually think there's a time and a place for both this is based on my I've used both and yeah so absolutely there's a time and a place they're both so local virtual assistants and staff in general obviously have a better knowledge of language and our culture and the way we work and the way things get done they've got more local experience and some businesses need that local knowledge of locations and yeah what's what's happening locally there in the same time zone most of the time sometimes it's it's hard to say with that without offending some people but sometimes local people and not necessarily all but there's just better at taking initiatives and project managing using I hate to say it but a bit more common sense sometimes and they're always always going to be a higher cost just because we have that higher cost of living our most basic hourly rate is always going to be more expensive than someone in the Philippines say so the benefits of using an offshore virtual assistant is that they obviously they that's cheaper there to have a lower cost of living than us they're good at following existing processes if it's something that's repetitive process driven they'll do that no problems at all so if it's something that you've got fleshed out of step by step this is what needs to happen when and it's something that's regular ongoing that yeah it's it's awesome for that the question about supporting people that work here locally and supporting local people and people said that to me when I hired my Filipino Louise so and I call her Filipino Louise because I've had my Filipino VA first her name was Louise and then when I switched to a local my first local VA her name is Louise's also it kind of gets complicated but so but for me when I was first starting out and needing needing more hours of support I couldn't actually afford the prices of a local VA so the hours that I wanted so this allowed me I hope hiring hiring someone that was a lot cheaper overseas allowed me to actually do that and grow and get to the point where I could hire somebody locally so if I hadn't have been able to do that I might not have gotten to the point where I was hiring someone locally and then I wasn't supporting anybody so I think it was a good thing for me and it's a good thing in certain situations so I got to the point where I needed an extra level of support like I I was having to manage what needed to be done too too much so it's that whole like she my Filipino Louise was awesome at the regular this is what needs to be done when but as as my business grew I had more different varying things that I need help with in and it was getting too hard for me to manage so but back to supporting somebody locally the way I saw it the way I see it is people are people no matter where they live so we all need to support our families and get by it doesn't matter what bit of ground you leave home to me so in my small budget that I had at the time make could make a huge difference to to that family in that place because yeah that even though it was a tiny amount to me it was actually a decent income fit for her so I saw that as a win so that other benefits with someone in the Philippines as compared to here on the east coast of Australia there was only two hours time difference and a lot of the time they're happy to start earlier I think it was earlier for her so that she's starting at 9 o'clock went on study the English is really great and we communicated by Skype every day so it was it wasn't like there was a huge difference they were sort of always talking and always chatting online so communication wasn't a problem and half the time even though they had typhoons and all sorts of stuff of that at the time her internet was actually faster than mines like though that sort of there's no issues with any of that stuff so and I'm sort of jumping all over the place a little bit but yeah my back to the main point is using that cheaper option was super beneficial to me at the time when I was just getting started and what I found was which worked out well for me was I was I spoken to a couple of clients along the way both of the two that I'm thinking of still working with and they had worked with Filipino VJs and found it all too hard there's too much going backwards and forwards having to explain everything to the nth degree so what I ended up doing at the time was sort of saying I've I've got my Filipino v8 and I'll explain all that for you so you just give me what you want to do I'll be the middleman and and I'll get get it done whether I do it or or my VA does it you don't need to worry about how it actually gets done so that was my sort of advantage and and the advantage of a local more highly skilled VA so yeah these days all all three of my team members they myself are all local and it it does it all is a lot easier so when you can afford it I totally believe that local is better even though we costs a little bit more you kind of get what you pay for so if you can afford to pay that bit more of an hourly rate you kind of got a up sometimes it's you paying a higher hourly rate but something might get done in an hour where is for the cheaper earlier right it might take a few hours and more of your time going backwards and forwards managing like getting them to fix things that aren't right the first time and all that stuff so that's my ramble on that topic I yeah definitely there is a time and place for both it's just what stage you're at and how ya weighing up if you need to save money but ya spend you've got the time to to manage it or if you just need done and don't need to don't have time to manage it and can't afford to to pay for it so let me know what you think have you tried offshore V ace and what has your experience been or have you worked with just local people and how have you found it or are you tossing up between them and I hope this video has maybe given you some insight into my experiences alright top TC [Music]
