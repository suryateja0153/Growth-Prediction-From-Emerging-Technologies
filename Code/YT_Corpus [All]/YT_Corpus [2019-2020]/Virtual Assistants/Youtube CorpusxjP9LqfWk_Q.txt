 So in this video I'm talking with Nathan Hirsch - Nathan started selling on Amazon way back in 2008 and then in 2015 he started a platform called free up which is for hiring virtual assistants V A's remote workers to work in your business and Nathan really is the master of vie A's and outsourcing so that is what we really dive in in this video you know what is the power of this compared to just hiring locally how can you use remote workers to scale your business and how he used VA s to scale up free up which he grew huge and then sold the business really really impressive so we get into that and overall yeah just all things outsourcing which is something one of the keys that you really need to know to not only build a big business but to remove yourself and really allow the freedom that you're really trying to build a business for this is the key for that so there's a lot in this video I hope you get value out of it please do feed the algorithm by putting comments down below smash the like button subscribe to this channel by the way there will be links in the description to the things that we mentioned so yeah here is my conversation with Nathan old Nathan how's it going going great man how are you doing pretty well thanks for thanks for coming on the channel I'm really excited to talk to you all things outsourcing yeah should be fun there's nothing I like talking about more than outsourcing it and scaling businesses yeah absolutely from from the outside you just seem to be the absolute master of this I mean even just you know setting up something like this interview it's like vs and you've really got you've really got everything everything nailed down here so so I'm talking to I'm talking to the right person so I'm excited first thing I kind of want to get into is for for people that just don't even really understand the the power of EA's you know like what what makes us different from just hiring you know what is that secret like magic sauce of VA s that makes it so special yeah it just gives you a lot of flexibility as a business owner and I mean going back 20 years ago you had to hire people full-time in your town or the towns around you you may be needed in office more overhead and now you just have pure flexibility I mean when I started my new venture outsource school and before I even got going I hired a bookkeeper for five hours a month so not even five hours a week just five hours a month she's in the Philippines she knows us bookkeeping she cost me like five to seven bucks an hour so 25 to 30 bucks a month and right there I'm on top of my books from day one it's one less thing I have to worry about I understand my numbers and then my next hire gets to be a 10-hour week VA that works 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. I think you met her when we scheduled this podcast and she just gives me a head start to every single day where she clears out my inbox I get going on my most productive thing right away when I wake up and he's scheduling any podcasting she handles for me we set rules so I don't do more than one podcast a day or X amount of phone calls and she knows hey I workout during this time so it keeps me focused and productive and it kind of shifts my hours from repetitive day-to-day tasks up until or move towards revenue-generating expansion sales and you can do that without committing full-time what you can do at project-based part-time eventually full-time with with free up we had 35 full-time bas but you have the flexibility to do it however you want yeah that's awesome I mean it seems like you have it such that you kind of just you show up to your own life like you have these things just like happening and it's like oh I'm doing this at this time and maybe you didn't even have the mental bandwidth of remembering that because it's just kind of kind of all laid out for you yeah exactly and you you let you like tweak and experiment with things because I feel like too many people are in the mindset they they follow some course or some guru and it's like this is how you do it like follow it this exact way and we both know that that's just not how real life works there's a certain amount of experimenting with going on podcasts and lead generation or Facebook ads or really all parts of your business and having the flexibility of not just VA s but also freelancers remote agencies remote consultants just that ability to try different things and see what works and doesn't work for your business gives you a huge competitive advantage to someone who's just hiring everyone full-time in their town yeah I mean there's just a huge arbitrage of of price I mean that's definitely one of like the biggest Appeals that just makes it wildly enticing and so I know you have a huge background in Amazon originally and a lot of free up free up started with servicing AM so and a lot of my audience is Amazon so like what what do you see as kind of like for those Amazon people what are the first roles that usually get pushed onto V A's and and if you can even give maybe rough rates of what people might expect for say like a general Amazon VA or somebody that is doing you know customer service what do you what have you seen kind of as the most common practices yes so as a baseline Before we jump into that there's three different levels of people that you can hire you got followers you got doers and you got experts so followers when I say VA I'm talking about followers 5 to 10 bucks an hour non-us they're there to follow your system your process if you have a system for sourcing if you have a system for customer service they might have 5 years of Amazon customer service experience but the way you do customer service is gonna be different than someone else so they're there to follow your systems your process then you got the doers the specialists there in that 10 to 30 range they do the same thing every single day eight hours a day 10 hours 10 hours a day whatever it is and they could be graphic designers they could be photographers they could be Amazon Lister's but you're not teaching someone how to do Amazon images they already know how to do that but they're not consulting with you either and then you've got the high level people the consultants that could be 30 bucks an hour they could be a thousand bucks an hour high-level straight they could be strategist freelancers coaches agencies they come in with their own systems their own processes you're not teaching them how to do it they're not following your directions and I think a key part of being an Amazon seller because we both know that Amazon the amount that you can learn is endless right you can just take courses forever and still not know everything plus it's constantly changing you have to focus on what you're good at are you really good at sourcing are you really good at writing listing are you really good at PPC figure out what your core competency is and figure out how you can become great at what you're good at and then figure out hey what are the processes that I'm doing every day that I've come up with a system for that I can hire those followers and that five to $10 an hour range and what are the things that I'm not good at that I just don't want to take six months to learn how to do and hire experts or specialists to do the listings to run your PPC whatever that ends up being so I mean I can give ballpark pricing if it's lower level stuff mate like sourcing you're gonna be in that five to seven range if it's more higher level customer service or team leaders it might be a dollar to more if you're talking about those VA s but the higher level stuff that you don't know how to do that can be more project-based or more higher pricing yeah I think it's super important to clarify that because a lot of people have you know maybe a slightly unrealistic expectation that they could hire somebody for a few bucks an hour and just be like grow my business you know and just kind of throw them in but it's more about at least an even my experience with VA is it's more about well actually no I was gonna say it's more about only doing the things that I tell them exactly to do but I've also hired for like you know video editing or stuff that I don't know how to do but yeah I mean I think for the most part people at probably their first hire is more likely to be kind of on like here's how we do customer service like say this do this do you log in here like you're you have to like really really lay that stuff out and and SOPs or something I'll hope to touch on later for sure if we have time but one thing I want to definitely ask you is what is your own hiring process and how how are you vetting people and making sure that you're getting the right VA plugged in yeah so first of all I'm now applying to free up which is a little bit weird but I get all my bas and all my freelancers from free up I mean cut and I got asked this question last night actually they're like alright like do I go out and hire five people do I go one by one and and I can only speak for how I do it in my business partner Conor so we we talk it out we decide what our next hire should be we kind of have a rough two to three month plan but that planet is ever-evolving it's changing things come up that change the priorities of hire and we usually go one at a time or divide and conquer where he hired for his thing and he's training them and I'm hired for my thing and I'm either training them or working with them depending on their level so I'm really going one by one hiring one at a time there are situations that are exceptions to that like for example with free up customer service was blowing up around year three and we were really short on customer service reps so I hired six customer service reps at the same time and when you hire six customer service reps you kind of assume maybe one doesn't work out maybe you hire an extra one but it can also lead to issues because when we went to promote those customer service raps or make one of them a team leader or an assistant team leader it was a little weird because I all started on like the same day it was it wasn't something we couldn't overcome but those are just things you have to think about if you don't go in that order one by one so for us it's all about creating the SOP I have what would I call my 90-day rule where for the first month I'm throwing stuff against the wall I'll see what's working see what's not working by the end of that first month I have a good idea of what's not working start to create that SOP create that job posting where does that rule look like what does a set up for that rule look like is it part-time full-time flexible fixed schedule what are the skill sets they need by the end of that second month that I have really fine-tuned the process I've hired someone and then I'm spending that third month not only training them but giving them ownership of the task so that they can take the SOP over and keep it updated from there and I think that's something that not a lot of people do and that's something that really helped us when we went to sell free-up because the buyers are doing their due diligence they're saying how does billing work how does customer service work and we have all these 30 to 50 page SOPs that we've slowly built over time but Connor and I didn't just constantly make all these SOPs I'll play dated the the VA is did and they kept them up to date at all times and we could quickly say hey here's exactly how our billing process works step by step who does it and it's a yeah yeah that's incredible that's a that's a question I have you kind of just already answered but like obviously you were planning all that leading up to the free to the sale of free up which by the way congrats that's incredible so did you learn even more of the value of that through the sale of it because you were obviously doing all this stuff but like in the actual process of due diligence and selling like did you were there any areas that you realize where you could have put more attention into or areas that you may be like over put attention into yeah good question and without diving too deep into stuff that I probably can't share I mean the the SOP is that I think we did very well and it wasn't like we were planning to sell it all along we weren't one of our clients reached out to us to acquire us but we built it to self in the beginning and very similar to what we did on outsourced cool now like we're not even close to selling it were 60 days 90 days in and we don't really have plans to sell it but at the same time we're building the SOPs we're building systems and processes not just to make it sellable but also so the business runs without me and I think that's really all I heard for four years with free up is like why are you making yourself the face of the company like you're not gonna be able to sell it if you do that and my counter-argument to that which I ended up being true is hey someone else can always come in with a bigger marketing budget a better marketing plan a different lead plan make someone else the face of the company like that's very easy to replace and make better than what I'm doing there's a lot of smarter people in the world than me when it comes to the lead generation side but the systems in the process is they ran without me that day to day the customer service the billing is social media so I think building those processes were important I think that now with future companies I think are one lesson was yeah that make yourself a little less of the face I think that's something that I'll probably do on on future companies although I'm still going on podcasts and stuff like that but I think SOP wise had team-wise those are the things that really helped us during the sale I mean we we had a good structure for that that we're gonna carry over that same blueprint to future businesses yeah that's awesome yeah like it sounds like obviously V A's were such a huge part of of growing free up itself which is really interesting because it's like also for placing V A's and it's it's kind of like meta in a way right so how how like tactically were VA is used to to grow free up like I know you I know you have this getting on podcasting system was was that the core the core growth and and V A's were part of that or were there other things no I mean that wasn't the core thing that was one thing and we have a course now called the podcast outreach formula where we lay out exactly how I do it to this day I wake up every day to a list of podcasts to go on but the cool thing about free up and again one of the reasons that we were able to sell it was that we had leads coming in from all directions it wasn't just podcast and if I stopped going on podcast no one signs up for free up it is a combination of our organic marketing strategy that was entirely backed by VA s and that's kind of what we're working on now is building out these courses for Outdoor School on that playbook and the having an affiliate program is key it's the baseline for everything every busy should have it so with free op we offered fifty cents for every hour that we build forever to someone that you referred to us so that was the baseline it's on our site we tell everyone about it we mentioned a podcaster you mentioned it to partners and clients when I taught bees to take phone calls they had to mention at the end of every phone call so that's the that's the baseline we talked about getting on podcast so no matter what business you're in you should be getting on a podcast a week easily great way to get in front of thousands of your ideal customers your businesses if you're an Amazon seller you can still do it let's say that you're selling like bar bar glasses or something which is a terrible example but you can go on podcast and that our talk to drinkers that talk to people that are really into making mixed drinks like you can find relevant part podcasts that get in front of on your community you get to network with host people that are in your space it's good for backlinks it's good for SEO if you have a website outside of Amazon you could start building your own list then we went with a partner so we put out our own content but we also went to Amazon software companies like helium 10 seller labs and we said hey you didn't you don't provide vs and freelancers we don't provide Amazon software let's partner you blasts us to your last vice versa guest blog post vice versa and all this was organized by VA so every six months our VA would reach out and say hey what do you want to do together this quarter or this half year and and we'd set something up and you can do the same thing b2c finding people that are in your industry that your customers will look up to and then also going after micro influencers and and people that have followings of your ideal customer and using a VA to do research do lead generation we're launching this course called the lead generation formula that teaches you how to do that and yeah there's a certain amount of failure and rejection like any type of sales but over time you start working with these micro influencers and so it's not one thing they all kind of go to other things there's also a lot of networking involved but the the affiliate program could lead to a partnership the partnership could lead to a podcast that podcasts could lead to someone checking out your content like it all kind of goes together but creating that organic blueprint that only complements what you're doing on Amazon and only complements what you're doing in paid ads is really the key to growing your business long term and all can be done with VA yeah that makes a lot of sense I mean it so much of that sounds familiar to what we hear in just the Amazon seller space as well you know the more you're diversified across platforms the more you're taking sales on different areas I mean the more the more valuable your business is overall and that obviously that same thing sort of applied to free up and even even with the sale of that and the fact that it's all powered by ivas makes it makes it even cooler how many how many VA is was free up up to at the time or at the time of the sale up at least or now internally 35 full-time VA is in about ten part time wow that's cool how many how many Nathan Hersh VA is are they like on you right now I would be actually did a video on it for people that want to check out me on Facebook or LinkedIn I interviewed her eat her so people could see what it's like in the day-to-day of working with me which is not easy but with with the free up I thought of doing that yeah I had I so I pretty much took our team leaders for customer service and they would handle like my stuff so I really had two people that were doing my scheduling and stuff like that okay cool that's awesome one thing to kind of zoom back into a detail of VA s um probably the one of the main concerns I'll hear from people when I'm talking to them about VA s is kind of like that how you establish that trust of sensitive login information you know seeing seeing money sing bank account seeing passwords all of all of like that problem or even even just how you trust them to report their hours can you give some sort of outline on how how you how to structure that properly yeah and in my opinion people are completely focused on the wrong thing there if you're focused on getting over billed by three hours a week like an extra 15 bucks instead of focused on taking your three hours and moving in toward sales and expansion and marketing and sales like you're just focusing on the wrong things and I mean for me my stance has always been there's always going to be a risk right like hiring is risky being an entrepreneur is risky that there's nothing I can do to make that risk zero but if you want to scale your business hiring is the only way and if you get da's on let's say free up for example they care a lot more about staying on the free up platform it's really hard to get in they want to stay there they want to provide for their family they want to keep a job with you long term they care a lot more about that then they do about stealing your information and 99.9 percent of the time what are they even gonna do with that information that they don't want to be an entrepreneur they're not like if they steal your credit card you're gonna file a charge back like there's things that prevent most of those things I've never actually seen an Amazon seller get blocked by letting a VA into their account with the the right user permissions I know that's a rumor that that's gone around and I think the over billing of hours and this is one reason that I don't use time doctor or anything like that it only takes so long before you catch it right like someone can only work for me a week or two and if I put systems in place and I i have team leaders eventually an assistant team leaders they catch it even before I catch it so from for me to that's nice so look at for me to look at like their screens every single weekend and add that to my schedule is just a total waste of time you have to set up processes where they're they're either getting the work done or they're not getting the work done it's very black and white and and from there you're building the trust and the relationship ya know that that's huge and it's important for people to realize that most most anything you know whether it's seller central on Amazon or even a even a bank account you can mostly suck these services are set up for user permissions where you can only let people access certain things there's always sort of like ways to protect against that and for me also like with my main VA I don't I don't track anything and if he's added a couple hours here and there you know I've still it's still been fantastic and what people might not even think about is that you know it's not gonna be like you versus them and like you're the boss and you have to like kind of try to like fight with them it usually kind of becomes they're part of the team and they're kind of like a friend and they want to stick with it the way you said you know they don't want to lose their job they don't want to do something like most likely if they're happy with it they're not looking to do those things and I'm sure there's crazy cases where stuff happens but I I would I fully agree is I think that concern is is wildly overblown so I don't track either yeah and here's a great example what I do is we talked to the VA so we get them to buy into the long-term vision of the company and we make it so it's just really not worth their while to try to gyp us so try to over bill us to try to do that and and I mean a perfect example is we had to fire a VA which doesn't happen often like a year before we sold free up when we sold free up the people that were teen leaders that were making over 20 bucks an hour we took five hundred thousand dollars from the sale and gave it to our team in the Philippines to thank them for their awesome work and like that person who tried to steal five hours it wasn't really worth it for him in the end so and when we tell people that we're like hey okay your rates gonna go up as a business grows we're gonna increase your irresponsibility the opportunities are gonna increase and and we're gonna take care of you and when people when VA is actually feel that most of the time they're not they're gonna look at trying to scam you or trying to to pull a fast one over you it's just not worth it in the long run yeah a hundred percent it it's it's in everyone's best interest to just make this a mutually beneficial thing I you know you would never think that with employees of a company in the US like oh it's the employee trying to steal like you know the take over the company or something like that it just it's usually it's usually not really a concern so right um I definitely do want to get into some of the details of what you're doing with outsource school but I first have like a general business question for you because so you've gone from Amazon you know mega mega Amazon seller to then rolling that in to free up and then going from that experience and then starting this new project of outsource school so my general question is how how do you make as just you as the entrepreneur how do you make the decision of this is the next project this is the next phase like I always have a running list of all my best business ideas and things but what makes you actually like pull the trigger on know like this is the new project and this is where I'm going full speed ahead now it's funny I know I talked a lot of entrepreneurs and they're like oh every time I see same things it's like a business and I'm like riding in and all these ideas I feel like I've had like two ideas yes ever like be an Amazon seller I got it in 2008 before anyone anyone else was doing it I figured out figured out drop before was even called obviously a good idea at that time and then free up was it was something started on the side that was an idea and I took off and I'm not sure just because businesses I create are gonna blow up like there's that's just not how businesses work so for me I tend to very focus on one thing and I tend to I'm a very short-term thinker I tend to not focus on like the five-year plan the 10-year plan my business partner Connors much more long-term he's doing that but I'm much more focused on what's working what's not working what's the feedback is there actually a market for this and with free up it was something that we we got it out there with less than five thousand dollars we we didn't do a like a crazy game plan we took it to market and we just tweaked and adjusted and built it so I think for whatever reason and call it weird which I'm sure all entrepreneurs are weird on some level but that's just kind of how I've gone about it and it's more it's a lot of conversations like when we sold free up Connor and aya are sitting there helping with the transition for 90 days and for the first week they needed this a lot the second week they needed us last and it gets it decreases from there and so we start having conversations hey do we want to get into real estate do we want to go into a new industry do we want to stay into the VA space is there a market for outsource cool and we eventually thought of that and so I told just constantly evolving conversations and decisions and ends and tweaks yeah so it sounds it seems like you went from the sale of free up clearing to pretty quickly like this is the next idea like I remember seeing the Facebook posts of like oh potentially being outsourced cool so it makes it's such a logical step and it makes perfect sense I was just kind of also curious you know like how did you just said it's like that and not starting like just who knows what next cuz that's the I'm always like you know bubbling up these ideas and it's like oh should I just do this crazy other thing or so so outsource cool for the example we people started reaching out to us and said hey like can you teach us how to use the A's and so we came up with what do we want to teach people for us what's important is interviewing onboarding training and managing that's the fundamental so we launched the course cracking the VA code and our mentality was hey it's gonna take us 60 days to create this course it's not like we're gonna have to work 80 hours a week on it we're gonna work hard on it we're gonna make it good but it's not gonna be something that just like drives us into the ground mentally and if we launch it and people hate it like we just sold free up we'll move on to something else like we'll refund every one make sure everyone's happy no one's mad at us and we move forward and people like it then we can build a business off of that so I I try to focus on a lot of like low-risk high-reward situations like with amazon drop shipping if i listed products on amazon and i didn't sell for drop shipping and buy any inventory i didn't really spend any money low-risk high-reward same thing with starting free up worst-case scenario I lose five thousand dollars at low risk high rewards so I kind of look it out so her school has the same thing and we launched this course people liked it we decided to launch these mini courses on how to hire VH for different things and recently we changed it into a membership so anyone who buys our main course gets a one-year membership and gets access to all our other courses so you kind of have that idea you get it out there you see the feedback and then you continue to tweak involve the business model very similar to like what we did it free up yeah that's awesome yeah I love the idea of you know testing business models without you know crazy crazy investment and you know a platform is a great example of that obviously like you personal brand course information that's a great a great example of that the the podcasting thing is something that I probably I probably need myself it sounds like and and I'm hearing great things about the core out outsource school from a lot of people so it seems like you guys are off to an incredible start what what kind of comes what do people get with like the main outsource cool package if people might be interested yeah so you can buy the mini courses separately like if you already know V A's and you just want the podcast outreach formula you can buy that but if you buy cracking the VA code you get one year of every other course that we come out with thank Connor and I are gonna be rolling out courses we have new ones coming out this week that the partnership playbook we mentioned content partnerships so watch you through how to run that with the VA and really everything we did we have the lead generation formula coming out I just started writing the scripts today of the new bookkeeping formula that how to hire bookkeepers which i think is really important so we've got plans to roll out a lot of these but we're also going to bring in top experts because there's people out there in the world that know how to hire V ace for things that I don't know how to do and Connor don't know how to do so we're gonna be bringing experts to teach those courses as well so for a year you get all that content we're not a hundred percent sure sure what renewing will be look like will look like after that although on us to provide enough value to make it worth renewing you also get a year support if you have questions let's say you watch how to interview a VA and our cracking of the a course you interview a VA something comes up you don't know if it's good or bad we're there to support you for anyone that knows me from free up customer service is really my thing we want to make it a very high level of support and then you also get to join our community we just hired someone to be our community experience manager the title doesn't matter but she's gonna be building out the membership back in and make sure the customer journeys there and and people that have a lot of value and I think the cool thing about being a part of outsourced school early just like being a part of free up early is we want to hear your feedback what can we do to make this membership better what courses can we make that value what can we do to make our support better whatever it is so we're really excited for that no that sounds awesome it's you guys are clearly doing it right and I think investing in learning about VA s and and and V as themselves is one of these biggest ROI things so I definitely think VA s and this in general is something that people should really take seriously and really learn so yeah I'll have a link in the description to outsource school so people
