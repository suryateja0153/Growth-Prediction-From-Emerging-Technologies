mostly see Rockstar Virtual Assistant All Around Virtual Assistant General VIrtual Assistant Superstar Virtual Assistant You can also add that -- Social Media Strategist it depends on your skills Summary of skills this is about your expertise and taks you can do Skills to sell to your clients Skills that they can hire you for On the right side is a guide in bullets let's have an actual example Tell us what you're good at it can be at building Shopify Store Web development you can also say you're an SEO expert or Amazon listing or Amazon product research basic skills or specialized skills

Google Ads Facebook Ads if you know how to do it you add it to your summary of skills Facebook Ads Email campaigns You add types of skills there or the skills that you have Tells us some of your important work experience add a brief work experience here the most important one another example, I manage a company website for 3 years and so on and so forth that's for web developers if you're a virtual assistant add your experience from other company on how long it lasted and the tasks you do tell them why they should hire you just like a normal interview if you're managing a website or if you have a port folio as a graphic designer I suggest to add it in your summary of skills too so you're client will see if they like your work I added our KumitaOnline PH as an actual sample of website that I created but it's not required if they're asking to describe your skills it's better to add a portfolio as an actual sample of your work For salary, if you're a beginner do not set high rate if you're an expert, and your skills are worth the price you'll add you can price a little bit high like $100 per month If you're an expert web developer, or a really good grapphic designer You can add $100 per month as price it's up to you depends on how much does your skill worth they said that most freelancers has a minimum $3 but it's still up to you depends if you want lower than $3 it's your choice but it's better if it's $3 per hour that's the standard for experience, it can be 3 yrs Social Media marketing 3 years as a virtual assistant 2 years as a content writer it's up to you Emplyment status, mine is just freelancing since I have clients already if you don't have clients or any other job, number of hours you want to work in a week, mine is 10 hours per week For full-timers, like virtual assistants customer support that's 30 to 40 hours per week they needed full time workers for that but it still depends on your availability but those are what most clients look for when hiring a virtual assistant they mostly need full-time but some are also looking for part-time only If you have your own website it's better for your portfolio even your blog it's better to have one but if there's none, it's still fine Check on yes, I'm willing to use timeproof there are clients here that requires you to use timeproof this is a sample of timeproof Just click on Start when you're starting to work and stop working once you're done it takes screenshot too not all clients require this it depends on the client it can also be other timeproof other time tracker Click on Done once you're finish The ones we set up earlier like the skills, you can still change them Tell us your skills you can still change these after registering you can always update that Tell us your skills Skills you can do skills that you can sell to clients here at OLJ for office and admin virtual assistant put 5 star if you're really good at that 4 start if you're an expert do not disregard this just add 3 star if that's the truth don't tell that your 5 star in appointment setting if you don't have any experience or you just have 5 months experience that's where the clients are also basing If the client is looking for a really expert that doesn't need to be trained anymore then you added 5 start but you're not really an expereinced one you can get kicked out or be reported to OLJ be honest on skills to add here on the bottom part, put your experience and the number of years For example, I have 6 years experience as an appointment setter here, you add the tools or software that you used in that previous experience For example, being a virtual assistant it can be Asana or Trello as project management tool Google docs, Google sheets, you can also add that Even if you added 4 nad 5 stars here you can still go to other skills if you have other skills that's in this category for example, you're a VA before but you're still good at advertising -- Youtube ads Instagram Ads, Facebook Ads add that if you're good at that you can be 3 star or 5 star add that too the describe your experience here and the tools that you're using you can also have experience as a customer
