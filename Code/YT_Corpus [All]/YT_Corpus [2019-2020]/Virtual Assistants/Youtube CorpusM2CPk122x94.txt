 So why I think an agency is ideal one call to the right company and you're done and that's because a properly trained virtual assistant service is going to be specific to what you need in our industry your virtual assistant is going to have the support they need you know obviously the training will be taken care of we'll be able to keep them accountable and keep them working and busy because that's another thing about hiring a freelancer is if you don't keep them working they probably won't be able to you know keep working for you so chances are you're going to lose them just you know to somebody that can give them more hours so when you have an agency usually we've got you know a good amount of clients and different kinds of tasks where we can help fill in those hours so that you know they can stay happy and and not go to you know to a different agency or or find something else and thus leave the business on our back with you know the back with their workload the other thing that kind of made reference to a little while ago is that just because you know we've done this so much when I say we I mean you know virtual assistant agencies we've done the hiring we've seen the red flags we are really keen on looking at a virtual assistant you know within a couple of days and going there's already red flags there this is not going to work for that business owner and so because we can watch out for those things many times we can spot them quicker than the maid service owner can and a phone call saying hey you know what Lee I already have some concerned about this virtual assistant can we do something else before we get to you know deep knee-deep in the relationship and do we make mistakes oh absolutely I already told you about one mistake that we made but again because we're hiring and we're training all the time we're getting you know really really good at honing in on all of those skills to bring the maid service owner right VA
