 Hey guys! Welcome back to another episode  of Candid Convos today I'm with MJ Granados   and or Granados I should probably  pronounce it a little more   accurately good friend one of our Get Staffed  Up clients and a really growing fastly growing   business owner, law firm owner here in Miami so MJ  tell us more about you and the law firm Well thank   you for having me Brett we are a business  and real estate firm in Miami Florida and we   help investors and business owners protect  their investment doing it proactively   and sometimes reactively but mainly just being  a source for them and making sure that they   feel that they're protecting their business and  growing and moving forward so they can get back to   doing what they do best in their business. Awesome  now now I know you guys have a concept right?   A family office if I'm saying that correctly so tell us more about that. How does that work?   That is an area that we are going to launch and  it's based on our general counsel concept   where my law partner Christina she was  in-house for many many years and I am from   my background my parents are entrepreneurs and  have had many businesses so we have gotten our   experiences and we help we get into the  into our clients business and we learn   what they're not only what their legal matters  are but what their goals where they want to be   what are the risks that they're  willing to take and from that approach   we help put together systems and procedures  to prevent any legal gaps that they have   or just continue growing and trying to meet  those goals so from that general   counsel service came the idea of growing a  family office or an outsourced family office to   be shared with other families in which we take a family that has different legal needs whether it's   just investments and maybe some criminal  law or whatever it is that each family has   and we are the management of that legal branch of  the family office so it's a concept that we are   looking to launch later this year but it hasn't. We have some clients in beta testing but it's not   one of our practice areas that we're offering to everyone just yet. Got it! but the concept   is so cool in other words it's I mean let's be honest these are probably wealthier families with   investments business interests trust and they need a sort of central go-to management office law firm   for their businesses. Right and the same way that we go into a business and we look at   what their goals are and what the risk tolerance is the same way that we would approach that   affluent family, we go in there and knowing what is their specific needs maybe they have kids that   have that get into trouble and they want to help them out or whatever each family has their own   things right or if they are big into real estate investments so we would help them with the title   side and the due diligence and coordinating with the realtors and their financial advisors and   whatnot so each family is different their goals are different and that's the same thing that we   that we do for a general counsel client so yeah no that's very cool! okay so we're talking oh I mean Get Staffed Up right, we're a virtual staffing company for law firms, and what   we're hoping to do is share some insight with people that you know are either thinking about   adding virtual employees. I mean quite frankly if post-Covid-19 you're not then I don't know maybe   maybe you missed a message but like you know we were all forced to go virtual and you were ahead   of the curve though you've been a client with us for a while now and tell us about what   helped you make that decision to have somebody work for you full-time who was not in your office   and then maybe some things you've learned. So we have been a client for over a year now   and Hector is our staffer and he's our marketing assistant and over a year ago we saw a need for   bringing our digital marketing in-house and we wanted someone that could dedicate their time   and learn about our company and what it is that we want to do what areas we want to grow and apply   some of the things that we've learned along the way so we realized that we wanted someone in-house   didn't really have the experience in hiring a marketing assistant we didn't have the budget   for what it cost to hire a marketing assistant in Miami because Miami has very high salaries   especially if they see that our office is in Brickell usually their eyes open a little bit more   so we wanted we had that need and we reached get stuffed up because your  company is amazing how it's tailored to attorneys and the marketing assistant as soon as I had my   intro call you guys were able to find a candidate that met the requirements of what we needed and   he speaks Spanish perfectly because we have a lot of Spanish-speaking clients and he speaks   English very well and he has also been able to grow with us he's been implementing a lot   of marketing ideas that we've thrown at him that he wasn't familiar with picked up   a lot of things along the way and with just a little bit of training of things that he   hasn't done he's been able to launch click funnel campaigns and do a lot of tracking and follow up   and we even brought him he was a really big team player I loved this about him that we were really slow at I think it was the end of last year, no it was the middle of last year, and we   needed him. We had to let someone go not because we were slow but because of the things that   didn't work out and we had a gap on the person that was answering the phones and we asked him   to start answering our phones and even though it's not his job description with no problem he   started helping us with that task so he was he is a really big team player so you guys choose your   people very carefully quality employee and by bringing him in it actually gave him   exposure to more of the clients that call and what their needs are and his marketing like he   was able to target the right like even more precise so it was actually a blessing in disguise   so he's great you mentioned a few things that I wanted to touch upon the first is that   I think people have a misconception when you have a team member who's in a different part   of the world or even a different part of the city is you know we're just going to call them when we   need them and we're not going to include them on meetings we're not going to include them in team   activities but you guys have really you know treated your virtual assistant or staffer   like a full-on team member of your firm because they are it's full he's full-time he works just   for you and so you know just the mistake that we see people make is not having your virtual team   members part of the rest of your team in meetings and emails and fun firm type things so   that's one and another thing I wanted to point out is when you're when you have employees with   additional capacity they can cover from one another and when you have the right types of   people team players then they can pick up slack so just to point out, for example, you know   price structures have gone up a little bit but for you, I believe for less than 2 000 a   month you had somebody basically doing marketing and a receptionist and I did look I just want to   point that out because it's, and you mentioned the high salaries in Miami and kind of my story   which I've talked about is there is a girl  I wish she was still a team member. love her to   death still a good friend but she was a marketing coordinator here in Miami and had a very high   salary and it was my fault I couldn't figure out a return on investment based on the activities that   I was having her do because not only you have the salary then you have the overhead, the parking, the   meals, the office all of those things that come with it and so when you have somebody at a much   much lower price point who is is and you mentioned they're going to be raw these are not people that   have done 10 years for another law firm or the, you know, you wouldn't be able to find them for   example so there's going to be a training and an acclimation period you're going to teach them   but you suddenly have the financial sort of wherewithal uncertainty to just breathe and   say okay let's try a bunch of things lets's try marketing campaigns because we've got someone   full time for a price point I'm. I still get  people that offer what they would call social   media management for as much and even a little more then you can get someone from us full-time 40   hours a week working on all of the marketing things that you need to get done and other   companies stateside will basically save for two grand a month I'll do your social media management   what does that mean? a few posts here and there it's just not the same so what we're   able to find you know business owners like you guys it's just really rewarding in that aspect   Our weekly team meetings he attends them we have marketing meetings that a few of us attend and he   he hosts them posts them and it's just  it's not like it's someone that is   like you were saying you just reach them whenever you need something it's someone that is   full-time and on-call and working constantly I can see him in our system doing an accomplishing   task and assigning things so it's great yeah I mean that that's really awesome to   hear but if somebody's listening let's give them some tidbits I mean what is your meeting rhythm for example with your staffer do you check-in every morning do you just kind of let   him do his thing do you have scorecards reports you know how do you guys manage it. Okay so we   meet as a team every Monday afternoon and he logs  in and he does only part of it because he's not   part of the legal meeting that goes afterward so he meets with the whole team we do an activity   and then he logs off then we also have at the end of the week we have a marketing meeting with   him that he's hosting that he has his agenda for that we share through our software he, that's   how we communicate we also have a task management system that we assign each other tasks so I see   him every time that he's working something pop up or if he's commenting on something that   he needs some follow like a follow-up for me like he does that we also if I'm in the middle of like   recording a video or doing some marketing thing and I have a question I just dial his extension   but the things that are scheduled are  those two meetings per week and then I also talk   to him every quarter where we just check in I see where he's at his level of happiness what goals   he wants to reach for the next quarter we talk about his yearly goals his five-year goals and see   where we're at from the last time that we talked that's awesome yeah I mean you guys are really   doing it the right way in terms of how often it's just about right I and I tell people   that say well how do I know what they're doing all the time say look if you know what every person   in your business is doing all the time you're not running your business the right way respectfully I   mean let's say somebody your marketing coordinator, secretary somebody was right down the hall from   you or the next office are you standing  over their shoulder at all hours of the day   watching them I mean now you're not delegating you're just micromanaging and hounding people   so it's not that much different than as  you grow your business you have to and  we have the term delegate your way to freedom if you're ever going to not be miserable and not go   crazy you have to continually give things away to free up your time to do the things that are   a higher and better use of your time which means you can't always know what everyone else is doing   just get reports get the feedback you know monitor them and have scorecards and   check-ins but you just can't micromanage  and it's that makes it easier when they're   virtual frankly right and if you have the right systems and you have certain responsibilities   that they have to accomplish every so often and you have a good task management system   you will see them and they're passionate and they love what they're doing and you're   you're trying to help them meet  those personal professional financial   goals that they want then you will see them he works like at what would be his 3 a.m   just trying to get like doing things that he's passionate about like building a funnel that he   didn't know how to build or like trying something new and it's just it's you see it if he's happy   he's going to work he was going to take a day off and then he said you know what I actually want to   build this out more so I'm not going to take the day off it's like okay it's then I mean if you   think about it this guy's doing it right if you're going to move anywhere and sleep all day it's   Spain right you're going to just siesta all-day and then he's gonna work in the night and people   are still gonna be up when he's done at 3am anyway man he's living the life what are we doing   exactly oh shoot well yeah so we ship a lot of phones our clients do down to their staffer   in Mexico and South America wherever we are but that's the first time I've heard somebody   hand delivering it so I like that it worked out well MJ tell everyone who is listening   across the country listening, I mean what do we have mostly our distribution   list is Florida attorneys but just in case  tell everybody if they need to contact you   for you know a type of law because again most of who are communicating with their attorneys   how do we find you how do we reach you if you have a need for this or if you know of someone that has   that is buying or selling their business that is buying or selling an interest in a business   that needs a contract reviewed or has templates  to be built for their company or in the real   estate area if you have a commercial property or residential property that you're buying or selling   you need due diligence done and making sure that you are buying what you think you're buying   if you have any of those needs that's what we're here for we like to simplify our client's lives   hence the name Simply Legal simplifying complex legal matters that's our job they can reach us   at in our website, it's www.simplylegalgroup.com  and our Facebook it's simplylegal305   and our twitter is Simply Legal Law and our Instagram is Simply Legal.
