 hey it's Alexander Vidkun so have you noticed that a lot of people they spend lots of time their business doing menial tasks that are repetitive and as a business owner you may not want to keep doing it you may not want to keep doing menial repetitive tasks because there are other things you could be doing that are a less bring leads less to burn out in the long term and just make more money for your business so things you should be doing versus things you shouldn't be doing in short so in this video I'm going to show you exactly how to outsource to virtual assistants how to find virtual assistants and hire them that are smart and can do the job better than what you could have done yourself and who improved the processes right so many people don't know this but you can actually hire people that are smarter than yourself to do tasks and because they keep doing the tasks they get better at a tasks then you were because you were doing 20 30 tasks whereas they they can focus on three to seven tasks instead of 20 tasks and that means they specialize more in your business and they get better at these tasks and then they come up with all these improvements that you may have not noticed yourself because you were the business owner you're just dealing with too much right how do we solve this how do we find virtual assistants in 2019 that are smart want to work for a reasonable amount of money and do a great job and potentially even overqualified so you can keep teaching them and they can learn other things in your business and get better at other things in your business and take over other things in your business that you won't have to do in the future and if you won't have to do them in the future that means that you can do the things that you love and the things that make more money your business the reason I decided to share this because I've noticed many of the traditional let's say hiring processes that online marketers and online business owners use they no longer work like they used to for example we used to go on up work and you just get like 200 applicants for something and you're just like oh well now you and you maybe your application is good enough but can you do it cheaper that doesn't really work anymore these days you need to put in a little bit more effort when you're hiring and you need to use the carrot method more than the stick method you need to give you more than you used to give and you can't be as efficient like you used to be in terms of denying people jobs and stuff like that that's because they have many opportunities days like people understand that they can get jobs in life freelancers know that they can get clients very easily and they know what to market prices it's being put all over the internet because the job websites the freelancing websites they tell them you should charge higher you should charge higher you should charge higher so it's harder to get those cheaper people that are smart to work for a reasonable amount of money it's getting harder and harder because they're getting too many opportunities so how do you get around this how do you fix this as an entree to notice because this directly affects your bottom line directly affects how much money your business makes that's basically what's been happening over the last few years been more standardized people have gotten better better at hiring and if you don't get better at hiring yourself you will not be able to keep up you'll be using these old outdated techniques and not really get the results that we used to get with ten percent of the effort right so you need to put in a little bit more effort in better areas of hiring to get the same results or better as a few years ago right so here's how I do it there is an up work obviously so if you go on up work these days you're not gonna get to 200 applicants anymore but you can still for certain things if it's the offer is good and you're paying good enough amount of money you know like I would pay below average but you know nothing crazy and if you hire in certain countries where the salaries are lower you can still get good deals and up work can still post it up work you can tell people to apply via you know talk to you on skype do the standard method of giving them a one-day test on one week test to see if they're doing well you can test them for attitude by asking how their previous jobs went how they quit why they quit you can do all these things right and you should do these things right but up work may not be the best solution these days it's a great solution for billing it's a great solution for invoicing if you're hiring people and tracking their hours it's a great solution for that it's a great solution for finding certain types of freelancers but it's not good for everything it's not good for volume it's not good for a large volume of people that you may want to hire for 2 to $9 an hour like it used to be right that's what up work used to be you could even hire people for $1 an hour in their countries that was a lot of money everyone's happy right now it's a little bit harder to do that there are other ways of doing it that can achieve the goal or you can keep doing up work but pay you know six to twenty-five dollars an hour so it's more money but people are more qualified now they work more efficiently but it is more expensive so it's harder to make a profit on that outside of up work there are jobs like online jobs at pH where you can get people for two hundred to one thousand dollars per month or whatever the equivalent of that is like two to whatever like seven eight dollars an hour basically that's what you can get people for in online jobs at pH the advantage of online jobs with pH is again it's cheaper but if the disadvantage is it may speak good English that's also the Venge disadvantage is you do get applicants you don't get two hundred applicants like used to but you get like 20 30 40 applicants but they are in the Philippines and only in the Philippines so it's if the timezone does not correspond with your working hours it's hard to communicate with them and you need to understand their culture really well to be able to communicate with them effectively otherwise you have problems problems of communication which you may not want to learn how to deal with because that's a lot of work from your ends and yes you do save a few dollars per hour on hiring someone but it's a lot of work so online jobs duh pH great site has advantages has disadvantages what I like using these days however is not only jobs with pH not so much and not so much up work but I like to use a different website so what I figured out is locally if you do local hiring internationally from online right but you do local hiring that tends to work better now here's what I mean by that all these people are on these advanced freelancer platforms they're becoming more educated partially thanks to people like myself and they know how to charge right there they're online they know stuff whereas if you can find people that may not know oldest thing all the things that they know cuz they're looking locally for jobs you can still get the same deals as you were getting four years ago when things were easy so here's what to do you go to a website called job board find your calm and this is an aggregate website of all the tiring boards worldwide and you go in countries like Serbia Poland and so on you hire locally in Eastern Europe or in other countries depending on your needs you know I have a guy a client he hires in Syria now because he wants people to speak Dutch whereas he doesn't want to pay the local Dutch salaries so he goes and hire in Suriname right but most people they want to hire English speakers they don't have these strict language requirements right if he German you can hire in Bosnia as well for example right it can hire at a fraction of a salary someone who would live in Germany for example but let's say this is not the most important thing the most important thing is volume and the most important thing is to hire people who speak English well enough and you want to hire engineers you want to hire designers whatever you want to hire you could hire it up and you go to job board finder calm you look for the best local job websites with the best score on job board finder calm and then you figure out a hadees' job websites work for example I'm hiring right now in Serbia doesn't matter which website I chose it just chose I don't even remember the name is just the best ranked website in Serbia for job word finder calm and I basically posted a job similar to what I posted up work and I'm getting just these great applicants like engineers and so on create smart people with lots of international experience they know English and I posted that I wanted hired in remotely so I'm getting people who can work remotely have good computers good internet speed and so on so what's happening is I'm getting these smart people they don't want like crazy amounts of money because they're they're not like all professional and freelancers they're more like I want a job that pays a little bit better than locally in Serbia but at the same time I'm looking for an opportunity to work internationally that's what I'm really interested in and I'm a smart person they're smart people right that they're saying I'm a smart person who wants to learn to work online to work internationally with international companies where I can learn so they're more inclined to be a players who want to work hard and not get paid thousands and thousands of dollars because they're in Serbia where salaries are like two hundred to six seven hundred dollars per month which is good it's very good there so you can hire an engineer for $400 there for example so you go to the website you put the job post up they do like all these verifications you know that took a day sure I lost a day on that but now I'm on the site I'm paying 50 bucks I'm getting all these engineers applying it straight to my inbox and they're taking pictures of their desks they're doing IQ tests whatever I need them to do especially once they get them on skype once they get them on skype I do the standard job interviews standard testing of a day and it works just great like you could just you could just hire people you can hire engineers my friend hired an engineer in Serbia he's figure all kinds of automation for his business even though he wasn't really knowledgeable in this he just figured out how to do that because it's an engineer that's what engineers do so my friend is hiring engineers paying them two three four hundred dollars per month full-time and they're sitting there and doing real work good work and everyone's happy and my friends businesses is breaking records every month like he's doing tens of thousands of hours per month and yeah I'm starting also to hire in Serbia for example right now you don't have to hire in Serbia there's so many countries where we're just trying out Serbia right now we can do any of those countries in Eastern Europe where you can do South America you can do even Asia in some countries it's just that I prefer Eastern Europe for the time zone and there's just a little bit easier to communicate sometimes so that's that's basically what I'm doing these days that's the update on the hiring process guys very good because I have all these hiring processes on YouTube I've all these hiring processes I've been shearing over the years but this is how it works 2019 try it out great stuff if you'd like more processes for how to run your business properly how to automate how to scale and how to really build a business not just be a freelancer
