 [Music] hey guys do you have two hours and to turn packs if you do put together our charming Christmas quilts it comes in two sizes and it's a completely free pattern from fat quarter shop and in this short cut quilt series all you need are two charm packs some thread and a creative grits ruler that's at least 5 inches wide and a background fabric today I'm going to use Oracle 2021 and I'm using some basic gray Christmas fabric super easy pattern so let me show you how easy it is so super easy we're going to be making some half square triangles and since we're using charm packs we're gonna do it a little bit different than we normally do you're gonna take a background fabric G and a charm pack square put them right sides together and you have the little jagged edges on the edge and you're just gonna ignore those draw a line on the wrong side of your lighter fabric you can do it on either if you put it on your lighter fabric it's easier to see when you get to your sewing machine but it really you can do it on either so I draw a line with a friction pin it will disappear when you iron it off later and what you'll do is go to your sewing machine and stitch directly on that line it will look just like this you're gonna trim a quarter inch away from that stitch line and then you're gonna discard this so we're gonna take this and press it open and this is your half square triangle that's how it looks pressed open and you're gonna make 12 now we're gonna just build your tree and the most important thing is to label all of your background rectangles and squares because when you're building your rows it's easy to get them mixed up and then your quilt will be wavy instead of straight so you're gonna take two half square triangles and on your first row you're gonna add fabric see rectangles to the side and when you're stitching these my most important thing would be to pin so when you're piecing pin at the bottom of the half square triangle and when you get to the top if you look you can just make sure everything lines up just like that and pin and that way when you stitch right here and you press according to your pattern your points will be really nice so that is your first row as you can see this is super beginner we're going to be building our second row you want to make sure that you're half square triangle is the correct way so it's building a tree and you can kind of visualize that you're gonna stitch these together using a quarter inch seam and then use a fabric D on either side and one thing that you can do with this grunge it's kind of hard to see which is the front and which is the back when you cut your fabric into rectangles what you can do is then make a stack and put them all face up and then put your alpha Biddy on top and if you do that then you're always working with the right side because that can kind of be difficult to see and then this is what your second row looks like for your third row you're going to be using fabric ee rectangles to half square triangles and to charm packs and again visualize your tree going up stitch these together add the e at the left and right and you will have your third row and we're almost halfway done building rows so I thought it would be good for you to visually see how when you're building your tree the tree goes up and this is all super beginner this is your fourth row it's gonna use F your fifth row uses H and your sixth row just uses turn packs and half square triangles so just build one of each and we will move to the trunk and then of course we see the easiest for last your trunk we'll use two fabric B rectangles and a fabric a and now we can build our tree to put your quilt Center together you're gonna put all of your rows we just built together and I'm going to give you some tips what I like to do is take your rows fold them in half and Mark the center with a pin first and then when you're putting your rows together match your Center so just take your two pins put them together and pin I think pinning is super important and then you will pin at the very beginning the very end and then however many pins you think in between I like to go about every three inches I can go faster when I sew the more pins I have so just pin as much as you think this is kind of how mine will look and then once you pin you can sew all your rows together and your quilt Center will be done this is how your quilt Center looks once that's done you're gonna add fabric eye rectangles to the left and right for your sides press then add your top and border fabric J's for your side borders you're gonna put together nine fabric a squares super easy you're gonna make two side middle borders then you will put together 11 fabric a squares for your top and bottom middle border you'll make two of those then you will attach your side metal borders press and add your top and bottom metal border and press once you've got your middle borders down you're going to add your side outer borders and then your top and bottom outer borders and and two hours you have a cute quilt the best thing about the charming Christmas quilt is it's super easy it's completely free we have two sides options so make sure to get your free pattern at that Photoshop subscribe to our YouTube channel and I'll see you next time [Music]
