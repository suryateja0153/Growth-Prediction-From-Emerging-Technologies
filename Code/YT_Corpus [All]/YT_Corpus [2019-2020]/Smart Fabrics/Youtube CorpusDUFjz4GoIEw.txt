 [Music] I do have a shopping addiction but it's not that bad first item is from Vajra and these are some super cool forest green trousers and they're at $19.99 the magic power of clothes is that they let us choose who we want to be fashion has become affordable and accessible to everyone but we are buying way too much and the clothing industry is polluting the planet it has to change but how can we reinvent fashion but keep the fun pioneers are experimenting with new fabrics recycling and high-tech design paving the way for the future of fashion some of the solutions that we are looking for are here already this work hands this is from the cans of the collector that was on the catwalk last September the promise is the magic transformation now tonight for this job interview for this date the possibility of seeing myself grow in the eyes of someone else and that is magic it's nice when you see on the catwalk and people just don't realize the model work you spend this is backlight welcome to your new wardrobe [Music] fashion for everyone our insatiable hunger for new affordable clothes has turned the clothing industry into a dizzying fast fashion system more than a hundred billion new items are produced every year a third of them are never sold never worn and dumped shredded or burned after oil fashion is now the most polluting industry fashion effects 100% of the population we all wear clothes I mean you may not be interested in fashion but you still need to get dressed and our wardrobes are in the fashion supply chain so every day when you choose the clothes you wear you actually can have an impact in 2013 or salade de Castro established fashion revolution a movement demanding attention for the world behind the clothes racks fashion revolution is by now the biggest fashion activism movement in the world and it was started as a result of the Rana Plaza disaster which is this tragedy that happened in Bangladesh where a factory building collapsed killing 1138 people we all realize that something needed to be done fast intelligently creatively and so we got together and we did it flash mobs in big cities hashtag who made my clothes this is how fashion revolution is trying to influence industry and consumers last April we reached over 270 million people with our hashtag who made my clothes and I think people are beginning to be aware of the fact that the fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world that we don't know who makes our clothes that there is ZERO transparency this conversation is really becoming mainstream are you suggesting that it's the consumer that has to bring about change in the fashion industry absolutely not we do not suggest that at all change needs to happen at every level of the fashion supply chain and the consumer is not involved with every level of the fashion supply chain only the last so consumers can certainly be very active in terms of asking who made my clothes consumers can certainly make more mindful shopping choices personally I tell people torture yourself wait you know it doesn't mean that if you've got ten quid in your pocket that doesn't have to translate into clothing wait if you really really really want something that's beautiful it works perfectly and then once you do decide that you want to buy something mend it repair it share it pass it on there are ways that we can really prolong the life of clothing and therefore really slow down their journey into landfill and this is the one thing that consumers can do to make a very very big difference consumers can change their buying behavior but that's not enough new ideas for making the fashion industry more sustainable must come true from designers and businesses searching for a new approach I think that there is a new generation of designers that really are embracing not just the different aesthetics but a different approach that incorporates sustainable material that incorporates that curiosity of actually wanting to employ your design for the good of others as well as the good of your collection that listen when the finale you do not stop the humorous and optimistic VIN and oh me are part of the new wave of activists designers they've been working on new biodegradable fabrics for 17 years suddenly their hip and uber-cool their new show kicks off London Fashion Week models can you please put your phone away now because if I see another phone then it's gone [Music] sustainable fashion is looking at carbon footprint carbon emission renewable sources green energy circular economy end of life of Garmin producing less garments you know calculating formulas in terms of how you produce a garment and and each Garmin what the end result is I think the term is used so loosely and I think the fashion industry right now is so back paddling and and struggling to catch up with this idea how's the shoes going then you stay close to the fittings with a glue gun yep the tagging gun of a tagging gun in a glue gun with your all time sure yeah right okay then so that's got to go on let's find it somewhere to put that I really didn't like fashion at all I don't like the way that the fashion industry is set up but I like fabrics I like the science of fabrics I like the feel of fabrics and the textiles and the way that they move and the way that they work I like how things are constructed I like how things flow I like the sculpture elements of garments when you're in fashion your base cost these textile and textile is something that fashion designers often completely ignore they just get it in from a supplier or an agent we looked at it financially that was one of the motivators also dealing with the the traders that we didn't really necessarily get on with we thought no no no we're not paying you any money let's work out a way to do it ourselves and we're quite determined like that if we meet a lot of friction along the way or somebody bumps the price up we'll go know we're doing ourselves goodbye and we're stubborn the first one that we developed I think was the latex one because latex production is often working with exploited villagers and with very bad processes for the environment as well so we thought okay let's see how much it is to invest in our own plantation let's make sure that everything we touch we know where it came from why it's got there and who's made it and this was many many years ago there's a lot of our pet fabric which we take from river and ocean cleanup schemes we're working with a group of kayakers here in England who go down the rivers and pick up plastic in their kayaks their different plastics that you collect you can turn into very fine silk like fabrics and it's really out of just pigheadedness that we wanted to make sure that we did things away that we wanted to do Vince very organic in his creative process we all seemed to desire a wedding dress you would look like a tree I'm very rigid in my creative process so I tend to see straight lines and squares and rectangles and triangles I think maybe because I've got Asperger's and I tend to like order we get that big dress out next because we've got the big big let's have a street to look and then go bigger and bigger let's just let me think matcom go there let's put it yeah good look out Maria so sure so then it's when you get backstage in you're in the middle of it it's not fashionable I think of it as as Fernando Mia's as the ideology that we are is actually just just just really the the window front of our ideology it's not about the commercial process it's not about making a lot a lot of money about being responsible and inspiring if I say to you could you bake a cake but do not use flour yeast butter eggs sugar buy still what a fluffy cake now that's exactly how we work you're asking us to build a collection but please do not switch on the iron more than half an hour please use only sustainable recyclable highly renewable sources of the material please also calculate the human energy the carbon emission the carbon footprints so the luxury of being a fashion designer is not there then Indomie avoid London and New York so they can work a hundred percent sustainably they operate from the rural fertile Cotswolds instead and grow crops here to make the materials used in their collections [Music] [Music] this is fine these ones are fine I think we need to just be careful of which pile we're using for the thing I think all of these are fine well we spend a lot of our days growing things and making things and move very hands-on because we both like experimenting and if you're going to do sustainable and you're going to grow crops I mean you might as well be where the fields are we turn into farmers a lot of the time you've got to see where the nettles are growing and you've got to be hands-on and touch it and then you really believe in your products and when we were in central London or when we're in New York it just wasn't accessible you're part of a system you're not quite sure whether you're thinking in the right way it's the same skin on Facebook for too long it's like suddenly you're you're liking things and you don't know if you like them it's exactly the same process of you if you're in a city with fashion it's like you're going on to these parties in you're thinking what a waste of time I could be growing Nettles about 80% of the things we try don't work and I think with with the new Publix that we're doing with cow parsley and with the Rose Bay willow herbs it's a very labor intensive but we'll have an idea we'll see how it works and then what we'll do is we'll ask other people to help us to make it what does it take to turn a nettle into a piece of fabric you have to brought it and then you break the back of it and see how the fibers are you then take out the the middle bit the woody bit that you don't need and you're left with these fibers which you then get that they're sort of like brushes with needles in that you just combs and comb it come it out and to like a fluffy sort of floss which you then twist and twist into a twine which we then weave into into garments it's quite fun the fact that you have to go Salvage for your own craft it's nice when you when you see on the catwalk and people just don't realize the amount of work you spend seven months a year doing things like this he's so rewarding and this is what we make our leather from this is a tree mushroom which is a new type of way of working with leather and this is the end effect when it's been processed and dried it's quite durable quite stretchy and then we put oxidation on it to bleach it and make it a little bit more wearable but it kind of goes through that process from from that really the horse chestnuts they make leather as well every autumn is just rotting on the roadside and we pay their kids to go do some weekend jobs on Saturday afternoons so he's still hanging out in the mall they go pick chestnuts for us then indomie our small-scale pioneers but lately famous people such as Michelle Obama blondie Beyonce and Lady gaga have taken to wearing their clothes and now the big brands have come knocking you have organizations coming up to us and going right we want it in zero ways can you help us seriously if you are really concerned about the environment then you have to take a step back and say maybe we need to hit the pause button maybe we need to say less is more but but that's not gonna happen for persisting brands there's no way there can be sustainable I mean that's just it's just impossible if your commercial entity already in order for you to be sustainable you're gonna have to take a serious pay cut lost and discarded fishing nets litter our sea and entangle marine life the economic generation system allows our design teams deliver a solution that inspires a canal thread created entirely from regenerated fishing nets and other nylon debris clothing brands like H&M are joining the trend their advertising and research focus on recycling and sustainability the conscious exclusive collection features innovative textiles woven from recycled plastics regenerated nylon and fiber source from responsibly managed forests that's the main problem with this industry everybody is talking about it but nobody's actually doing it could you imagine if in a know me for hmmm no I think there's few questions that needs to be answered first so for example it's very very amiable what H&M is doing in terms of putting a lot of money behind research and sourcing and and all that stuff but the very very simple thing would be why are used to producing that much practice what you preach meanwhile the clothing surplus is piling up production has doubled over the last 15 years anything that's not burned in European waste incinerators ends up in Asia or Africa where they wonder where all these new or hardly worn clothes come from via syphon the panicky can be easily verified si those are very a Capri use cupcake zero take this vitaliy use cocoa Fredonia select ala many people feel better about the waste they produce with their clothes because they hand them in for charity purposes how do you feel about that well you know when I was growing up giving things to charity certainly was an act of goodness it is no longer now it's simply an act of dumping I mean the reality is that nobody wants our secondhand clothing anymore our secondhand clothing has had a very detrimental effect in many of the countries where it's shipped you know in Africa for instance where it's decimated the local printing the local weaving you know that their skills businesses will do anything to be green as long as they don't have to cut back on production H&M has even burned rejected clothes to generate green energy it's just completely nonsensical if you want to save energy don't produce them in the first place you know it really doesn't make any sense there is nothing nothing about the burning of clothing that can be ever deemed sustainable what we need is an efficient common-sense creative and technological approach that allows us first of all to understand where surplus happens and then address the surplus before it becomes waste fashion brands prefer to keep their surplus and sales data

that nasty name necessary the heck by wrinklies yeah CSA car this hell to homely predict who Rebecca is Colin applausing for that overstock problem it's a drop in the ocean less than 1% of all clothing is recycled into new clothes producing one pair of cotton jeans takes more than 10,000 liters of water then Ando me are seeking a solution to the cotton problem in their own refuse so let's let's get all those that we can turn into the fine fabric first we try not use cotton we use a lot of our path so we use a lot recycled Salvage plastic bottles and turn them into yarns and then weave into fabric and they feel a surface cotton this is Pat one of the biggest problems with cotton is you stick the word organic on the front of everything and everybody thinks oh it's wonderful cotton uses one of the biggest is biggest wasters of water ever and you look at parts of the world where cotton plantations and cotton farming has grown up I think it's Kazakhstan which is one of the biggest new developments of cotton and it's just drained a sea is drained and an inland sea completely of its water because it's just feeding cotton and where does that cotton go it goes into five-pound jeans or really cut price jeans that people wear once and throw away it's ridiculous and then then it may have the label organic cotton on it this what's organic about actually draining a whole sea from the planet so we gave delivery off metal every couple of weeks this is from local care homes local hospitals local businesses that senders mainly metal but often you get plastic as you can see mixed in with it as well and what we're doing now is stepping up production so we need lots and lots of metal and luckily there's a lot of it around I mean like this once we can beat up into jewelry but the majority of the Gans the radhaji of the cans that we use go into shirts and to skirts we're sitting on a goldmine the length who his leg feels are like Gore mine stores I mean listen I mean electric wire for example it's like I mean it comes in like this what we'll do is we'll strip it off the plastic can go into clothing and the metal can go into clothes so there's two different types of textiles within each wire that's the metal fabric that came from account Geoffrey's really shop around the corner this is from this world of hands this is from the cans of the collector that was on the catwalk last September but it's very very you know wearable and scrunch able and you can sew it so that's good yeah just very final iminium yep the future of fashion I think fashion general it's got to got to go to an awful lot of change and I think smaller companies will start to thrive smaller companies will start to to really blossom and mushroom out and the internet will help that so the future of fashion is something completely different from what we see now we need to get the plastic air could you imagine that the garments we see will be produced in larger numbers and you can actually wear them oh absolutely yeah but it takes time getting all of these production cycles set up is a really slow process then you can start to produce the volume of textiles where you can make the right volumes of garments and what we're looking at now is the ideal fabric to scale up for production so I think I think this one would be good for the cow parsley and the Rose Bay willow herbs and I think this one for the Nettles because if you look at the heights of the nettles here they've growing really really high I think separating it half and half with nettles here and cow parsley there let's have a look at the production ship and there I think just a strip here for I don't think we should do more than that down there it's really sunny and that's always very sunny there so maybe put the peas there we'll have to talk to the farmer about it and see which is the percentage is better really can the gap between VIN and Omi's unique sustainable items and the mass production for the high streets ever be closed muddy isn't it the whole business model for the clothes industry would have to go writer and thinker Otto von bouche says fashion shouldn't be addictive but liberating at the famous Parsons School of Design he tries to wean his students off the fashion system and change their perspective on fashion you know if I have a special pocket with a little mending kit that I always carry around and then suddenly I just see oh my god you have it you're loosing your button how would that change my relationship and my attention to other people if I'm actually sort of seeing that I can I can repair for you and if I have the mending kit with me in a special pocket that I know it is always there it contains something that opens the world for us so many of my students have this view that thanks to the democratization of fashion thanks to H&M and forever 21 dollars everybody has access to it we live in sort of fashion utopia the only problem is that we just need to fix a little factories here you know and and and some pollution there you know but otherwise it's fine but the troubles of fashion also here there's all these anxieties and fears and all these stress that people feel around clothing that we need to sort of highlight and as designers we need to deal with we need to find much more wholesome ways of being with clothes and we need to make people feel that they don't necessarily need to buy it as fast food look at the role of the designer I am dependent on you feeling bad about yourself I need to continuously undermine your self-esteem that you are not good enough so you need to come to me to buy my clothes to feel good about yourself but I cannot give you too much I cannot sort of cure you because then you don't come back the business model is built on me producing addiction in you making sure that you just feel good enough for it long enough to come back to me I need to be your sugar daddy otherwise I will not make it as a fashion designer you know I will not have enough customers to to pay my bills so you know there's something corrupt in the very at the very core of the way that the role of the fashion designer looks at its user Oh Misha you didn't own one of these skirts until last week now you own four of them but can you blame me spectrum of possible ways for me to engage with fashion rather than coming back to the fashion store sitting when I'm tired and sad at night going through the websites buy things I haven't tried on but it doesn't cost too much it's like a computer game you know and it comes to me sent over from some factory overseas I don't really care it fits or not perhaps Israel otherwise I just throw it out it's so cynical you know it's so horrible you know in the thousands and thousands of students that come through this this economy and with that image of mind that that is how fashion should be I mean we need to 'unschool them we need to deprogram what the fashion hurt you have told us all in order to to have a wider vision of what fashion could be this is you know this is it's a crisis of imagination what is a pocket that has my phone on the outside but that I cannot reach so that when my phone rings I need to come up oh can you help me answer the phone and you know someone has to go down in that pocket and take out my phone you know how would that symbolize something else you know the more I have a pocket for my phone that is on the inside of my garments the more I show that I don't trust you guys but if it's a public phone on my back you know I need you and I show that I trust you because you need to actually take out my phone for me to answer what if we weave symbolize in signal trust to people instead you know how would that change the way we are in the world pockets pockets contain secrets contain magic I think the interesting part comes out of building skills and abilities because there's something deeply transgressive and a little dangerous about skills because we never know how people use them you know so if you actually teach people to so yes perhaps it's a trend right now but this all but there is something subversive in that very skill of knitting or sewing or whatever because suddenly you can trade it you can do something outside of the economy with it being able to make your own fashion gives a sense of autonomy this could be the solution to our insane fashion system the question is do we go back to needlework and nature or fast-forward to the technological future recent graduate Jasna Rock ahem is working in Antwerp on
