 [Music] great way so what i'll show you now is just two really effective ways to wax your kit in the field and the first way is just using a normal drinks bottle um by boiling up some water and let it cool a little and then once it's ready make sure you wear some thick gloves it's obviously hot clean any debris off and we'll just do this backside panel here so as even as possible but it's not a science at all put it there get your bottle and then you just take it oh yes it's melting in over the public yeah super super quick very effective that's very clever we do something similar to that for for a couple of reasons in the tropics you get these insects to lay their eggs in clothing right and it's good to iron them if you don't have an iron pot we use a metal mug with water and also if you're doing a repair with the duct tape yes if you heat it it glows it goes forever very good that would be a good way of doing it yeah you can also do it while the uh the garment is damp not not soaked very neat i'm impressed with that are there any other ways yeah so the next way let's get a a smock now and we'll do part of this this shoulder so put it down here here we go we'll just again wax this area here so don tell me about the wax right so so the wax it couldn't be more natural it's beeswax from southern sweden we take it up to northern sweden and um it's processed there and it's the balance we use of natural beeswax and the paraffin oil that works so well and we've just refined it over the decades so with this now what is key is bunching it up so you can comfortably hold it and that's why it's good to do it really panel by panel so i'm just going to put that there i'm going to get our stove put it safely up here so start that there got a pizza off we go turn it up get a good nice war going and then when i get the smok i'm going to make sure i've got a good handle of it nothing's going to fall out so to speak i'm going to watch the wax as it melts and then i'm just at that point not get any closer but off we go you can see how instant it is smell it i can smell it yep are you worried about burning the jacket no no you won't you will not if i keep it at this height where it's just melting you will not burn um the jacket at all that's really neat it's fantastic isn't it fantastic and okay it's an open flame but i can see where the flame is i can see where the melt point is don that's really clever so what are the advantages of the waxing is it just about waterproofing right no no not not at all um so if you apply the wax it will give good repellency and of course that's the beauty of it is the more wax you give the garment the more water repellent it'll be but the breathability will come down in the scale a little bit um so it's just that wonderful balance very much up to the end user is to how much wax you put on how breathable you want it to be etc but it's a really bespoke system it's really intelligent it's very basic remarkably sustainable but but so effective so effective i think it'd be interesting to try it with a stove and just a a metal army mug as well just heating the mug i think that would work really well absolutely absolutely no no i'll give that a go but if you think about the classic nature of the fabric there's no other type of fabric you can do this with other fabrics have other advantages it's brilliant you can adapt it to whatever your circumstances or needs are absolutely absolutely [Music] you
