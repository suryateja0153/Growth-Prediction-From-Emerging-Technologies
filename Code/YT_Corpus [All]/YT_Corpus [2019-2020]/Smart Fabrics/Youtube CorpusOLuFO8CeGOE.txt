 hello everyone my name is daniel i'm a third-year phd student from ex-discovery lab at donald bust college today i'm going to talk about capacity content based objective recognition on interactive fabric using capacitive sensing this work was done in collaboration with two undergrad interns lou and the ug as well as my advisor teddy and the shindong before go into detail of this work i want to briefly show you what capacitive is and why it can be useful capacitive is a capacitive sensing technique that makes very aware of the object is in contact with this includes things like food items and dinnerware it can also determine the change of what's inside objects like containers or cups for example it can differentiate between milk coke apple cider cold and hot water in a regular glass cup and those many everyday objects around us are made or covered by the fabric there are numbers of verifications that are enabled by our system technique such as turning a cluster into a data tracker with our smart textile or a smart tablecloth for recipe helper next step add a slice of cheese although there are a number of techniques to enable interactive fabric the one most related to capacitive is testable by jungkook at all testivo demonstrates a negative fabric to recognize metallic object based on inductance in contrast our work focuses on non-metallic arbitrary data also very common in daily life all work complement existing research with a new sensing technique that is based on capacitance next i will explain how the sensing works for capacitive when object is placed on a textile sensor that is made of conductive electrodes the capacitance among the air source will change due to the permittivity of the aperture and the different material of the object will bring out different permittivity resulting different capacitors thus capacity will recognize objects by measuring different changes in capacitors and next let's dive into more detail of the sensor design our sensor is composed of dimensional electrodes that are connected by laws and the columns and there is a ground plan on the bottom that is similar to the common design of touch panel with this setup there are two types of capacitors occurring on the aetro they are mutual capacitors and the cell of capacitors mutual capacitance is the capacitance between the adjacent electrode and the cell capacitance is a capacitance between the electrode and the ground plane both are affected by an object to allow the signal more pronunciat in response to the small change in capacitance we use the resonant-based capacitive sensor to precisely measure the aggregation of length however this approach is problematic the sensor reading at a location interfere with all electrical connect in the central or color due to self capacitance to solve this problem we also measure the mute capacitance to capture the content area of the object and then we gather the sensor reading only in the content area next we need to determine the proper size of the natural and the separation distance between the electrode which are two factor than the effect of sensor sensitivity thus we conduct two experiments in the first experiment we test the reactor with the size of seven millimeter 40 millimeter 21 millimeter with a fixed separation of 2 millimeter the result reveal in the left side of the table clearly 7 millimeter is the best option among switch sides considering the balance between the sensitivity and the resolution and next we conduct a second experiment where we test the suppression of two millimeter three meter and four millimeter and a fixed size of seven millimeter the results are shown on the right side of the table surprisingly the separation of four millimeter is the best option since it increased the sensitivity significantly but with our larger impacting 2d resolution so through these two experiments we determine the size of centimeter and the separation of 4 millimeter for all implementation next i want to talk about their approach for fabrication first we're using an adhesive to bond the conductive fabric to a textile substrate then we use a desktop cutting machine to cut out the electrode and the lower connection after cutting will be heating again and then purely unnecessary pieces off so the pattern is clear next we need to connect the column electrodes to connect the column electrode using a sewing machine or hand stitch to connect a conductive thread for each column then we attach your conductive fabric to the bottom as a ground plane the sensor is completed then i'm going to describe how we accomplish object recognition using a textile sensor when object is pressed on a sensor the sensor reports a 12 by 12 capacitance values based on all our observation and the initial test we extract 86 features which can be divided into two categories super related feature like the number of copper pixels and the material relative feature like mean and median after the feature vector is packaged we can fit into a rainforest model since it has been found to be accurate robust scalable and deficiency in many applications we use the output from the model as opposition results in the following demo video i'm going to demonstrate our sensor working in real time the detected item name will be shown on the left side of the screen and the key map image of the capacitor's footprint will be shown on the right side we can detect different type of object like losing office such as hand sanitizer airpods lipstick hard drive credit cards and another credit card we can also detail objects in your living room such as kendo book on water plant and water print we can also detect the glass and detect if the water is in glass we can also detail an object in a kitchen such as a bowl or a bowl for soup we can also detangle the slice of juice salt and we can also detect multiple items and even different type of liquids to manage international accuracy and the robustness we will attend participation study we tested 20 everyday objects including kiwi avocado grapefruit critical and soil each object was repeated for 10 times in randomized order we pretend a model shooter before study and the wind real-time recognition in a study in turn our system can achieve overall accuracy of 94 percent this is increasing results especially for the items which have a similar strap but have a different content or material such as kiwi and avocado in addition we also evaluate how well the system can recognize different type of liquids for this evaluation we recruit a volunteer and they asked her to test six type of liquids including cold water hot water coke apple cider milk and beer each drink has a tiny sample for training and a tiny sample for testing the results show the overlapping of 90 percent the worst case which was bigger if removed resulting a higher accuracy of up to 96 percent aside from this test we also tested the performance of the sensor in a vertical placement similar to a packet the process is the same as the one described previously we had one volunteer and a 20 sample for training and testing we include eight object can be put into the sensor such as airpods lipstick kiwi avocado cheese this carbon credit card discipline in reward card a book and the external hard drive the overall accuracy is only 70 which is likely because our sensing technique is contact-based when the sensor is pressed vertically the contact between the object and the sensor cannot be guaranteed since the object may partially lean against the sensor or due to the deformation of the sensor itself if we remove the list three performing items the accuracy can rest to 87 percent in addition to notifications showing in the beginning i want to show you some more demo application of our sensor for example if we integrate with the iot speaker our system can remind a user to take a lipstick left on the table when user register or shop at the website for the very first time let tablecloths recognize the credit cards press on it and automatically fill in the critical information further the table clothes can also detect if the user table plants is in need for watering so the user can be reminded when the soil is dry finally the system can remind the user to clean the table after the empty bowl used for soup was left on the table for several hours next i would like to discuss the future work first our preliminary results demonstrate the sensor deformations that affect the sensor reading we are investigating a method that can model the shape of deformation blood sensor using a unique sensor reading introduced by folding the electrode at a different location degree and angles second let's all take any use capacitive sensing it is expect that the finger touch gesture can also be sensed however our current prototype has a frame rate around 3 to 4 hertz due to the hardware limitation in the future we plan to improve the hardware making the prototype even support touch input third our technique cannot differentiate metallic objects this is a limitation of capacitive sensing we expect that a hybrid approach combining competitive sensing with inductive sensing has a great potential to solve this problem with that i would like to conclude our work with three tackle messages first we present non-mechanical object recognition technique of interactive fabric using capacitive sensing we measure the accuracy of our technique with several experiments we demonstrate unique application import biologist technique thank you for taking the time to listen
