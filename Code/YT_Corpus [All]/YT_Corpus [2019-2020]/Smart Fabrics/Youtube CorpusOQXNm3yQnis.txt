 so here's the question does the perfect face mask exist we'd all love to find one that is comfortable breathable filters the air and doesn't cost much i went seeking the perfect face mask and i tested 10 of them for myself hi i'm cindy from smart family money i help you learn how to shop smarter save money and save time so you can get back to changing the world face masks are a part of everyday life now and i wanted to have enough of them around the house that i didn't have to worry about running out of them all the time and i wanted ones that would fit my whole family and that everyone liked this seemed like a nearly impossible task because every mask we tried we would like one part about it and not like another part about it and it just seemed like there just wasn't a perfect face mask so i asked all of my friends for suggestions and i've read all kinds of lists on the internet to find the best face mask that everyone was recommending but then i tested them all myself after i got all of my 10 face masks i wanted to answer specific questions about them i wanted to answer is it comfortable does it fit and does it fit a variety of different shapes and sizes of faces does it work with glasses and hopefully not fog them up too badly can you breathe comfortably through it and as you're breathing is it actually filtering the air and that question question's a little bit difficult to answer i also wanted to know does sound travel through it or does it muffle your voice a lot and of course as a mom on a budget i'm always concerned about how much does it cost to answer all of these questions i ran a number of tests the first test was a fit and comfort test to do that i just tried them on i tried to wear them out when i went on errands or to appointments and i had my whole family try them on and try to wear them around and then anytime anyone came to my house i'd show up with a bag full of masks and asked them to try them all on and they could pick their favorite and take one with them and then i asked them to please give me a report back on how that one went in real life don't worry i washed them in between people but i tried to give them a very thorough real world test and of course with everyone in my family wearing glasses they definitely got a thorough testing with how they fit with glasses on too which for us was very important for air filtering i did three separate tests i did a candle test a vacuum test and an aerosol spray test for sound muffling i did a sound test with a speaker for all the different qualities of the mass i gave them a score of one to five with one being the worst and five being the best the value score is based on the price per mask with five being the best price meaning low number and one being the worst price meaning a high number i just wanted that to follow the same sort of scale as all the rest of them and then on each mask i followed up with an overall star rating for how much i would recommend this mask this is essentially if a friend asked me if this was a good mask or bad mask what would i say to them about it on a scale of one to five now i'm going to go through all the maths and tell you the results of my many tests i'm going to start with my least favorite and go up to my very favorite if you're interested in any of these masks i am going to include links down below to buy all of them i did want to point out that some of the links are affiliate links where i will make a commission if you buy something through them but some of them are not i did not choose what to be included in these tests based on whether i could make a commission or not i really was just trying to find what was the best mask out there and my least favorite ended up being the sean simon mask which is disappointing because i was really excited to try this one because it seemed like it was so soft and comfy unfortunately it didn't work out so well the sean simon mask is made out of 95 rayon modal and 5 spandex it has two layers it does not have adjustable straps no nose piece no filter pocket it comes in one size and it is made in the usa because the sean simon mask is not adjustable it's a little bit difficult to fit it was a little bit too small on me it pulled on my ears but it was too big on my 12 year old daughter but i did find one friend that it fit absolutely perfectly and she felt like it was so soft and so comfortable and she was absolutely in love with it and i was really happy for her until i did the air filtering test and afterwards i told her please stop wearing that mask it's terrible this mask did almost as bad if not worse on the air filtering test compared to my super thin neck gaiter it's like things just go straight through it you can see on the cornstarch test it was all over that black pad on the aerosol test it just came flying through the mask and even on the candle test you can see that the flame was like falling over i couldn't quite blow it out with the mask on but almost besides being soft one upside to this mask is it won't follow your glasses at all but that's really because the air from the mask is just going straight out through the mask so i don't really count that as an upside i would absolutely not recommend this mask the next mask on my list is from sendusmas.com you've probably seen this one advertising around facebook seems like they're in my feed every single day the sundesk masks are made out of 100 cotton they have two layers made out of the same fabric they do have a filter pocket on the bottom of the mask where you can slide a filter up inside they have adjustable straps they do have a nose piece and they come in three sizes kids youth and adults the sundust mass company seems to keep advertising that they're a canadian company and back in the spring they were advertising that all of their masks were made in canada and shipped from canada but i noticed that on their website now they say that they are shipped from canada or buffalo new york they no longer say where they are made so i know where a mask is made is a question a lot of people have and i actually don't have the answer to this and i am a little bit concerned that they're being a little bit shady about where their masks are made and they're trying to make it sound like they're made in canada when they aren't any longer when these masks came i was a little bit unimpressed with their quality they just don't seem quite as nice as a lot of other masks the material is kind of thick and heavy and then it had a lot of strings hanging off of it and they just don't feel as nice as i expected one thing i don't like about this mask is the way the pleats are structured the upper pleat tends to get stuck in your mouth when you open and close your mouth to talk so that's really annoying i do like the adjustable straps on it they are nice and soft and adjustable with the fabric feeling kind of thick on these masks you would think that they would filter the air well but they actually had some of the worst results on my air filtering tests because i don't find them very comfortable and they don't filter the air very well i would not recommend this mask next up is universal thread from target they come in two different styles a contoured style and a pleated style these masks are 100 cotton they have two layers that are of the same cotton material they do not have adjustable straps they do have a nose piece they do have a filter pocket and they come in two sizes women's small slash medium and large slash extra large and they are made in china as you can see these masks got really wrinkly after i washed them and i did follow the washing instructions which was just to machine wash and machine dry them i think this sort of fabric it's kind of like linen pants and it just wrinkles a lot now the contoured one i had didn't wrinkle quite as much and it seemed like there were different fabrics for different colors and maybe some wrinkled more than others so i think it's kind of a gamble on whether the fabric works out well on these they come in two different sizes and i do have the pleated one in a small medium and the contoured one in a large extra large but the problem is the small one was too small for me and the large one was too large for me so i had a little trouble with the fit because neither of them fit me now there are probably people that the various ones fit but at least for me they just were not working on the positives on these masks they did really really well on the filtering tests so if they fit you well they're gonna do a good job of filtering the air and it is nice that they have a filter pocket if you wanted to add some extra protection another upside of these masks is they're really inexpensive they're sold in one packs or two packs for two dollars per mask so the packs are either two dollars or four dollars that's really cheap the universal thread masks were far from my favorite but they're a decent quality mask for a very inexpensive price so if they fit the people in your family go for it they're not a bad choice next up i have the button smith mask i get this one on amazon and i was really intrigued that it has a built-in neck strap which is pretty cool this mask is 100 cotton with two layers of jersey type material it has adjustable straps no nose piece and it does have a filter pocket it comes in four sizes extra-large adult adult youth and child and it is made in the usa with this mask i was definitely impressed with the quality of construction it feels very nice and solid and well made unfortunately it's thick and heavy construction is part of the reason i have some problems with it the ear straps are rather thick and heavy and when they're behind my ears i feel like they're pulling my ear ears forward no matter how loose or tight i have the straps the straps do tighten and loosen by pulling on the neck strap which is a pretty clever construction but i just don't like how it feels on my ears the thickness of the edge is also a problem for my glasses because it's rather thick and my glasses sit too high on it and i feel like i can't see properly so i definitely would not recommend this one if you have glasses if you don't wear glasses it is a nice mask as long as you don't mind the thick straps behind your ears it could be nice it actually got perfect scores on all of my filtering tests so no doubt it does a nice job of filtering the air unfortunately another downside to the buttonsmith mask is it is very expensive it was actually the most expensive at 15 per mask of all the ones on my list next i have the bespoke mask from kohl's i was really excited about this one because it comes in so many colors and patterns and there's even some with fun messages on them i really wanted this one to work this mask is 100 polyester on the outside and 100 cotton on the inside and it has a middle layer that is a built-in filter layer so three layers total it does have adjustable straps and a nose piece it does not have a filter pocket and it comes in two sizes kids and adults it's made in china i was a little bit confused about what the bespoke mask was made out of because on the package it said it was 100 cotton in the inside 100 polyester on the on the outside but then it mentioned that it had a filter layer but it didn't give any information about what that was so i have a children size one and i cut it open to see what was inside there is a third layer inside and it is sort of like fabric interfacing like the sort of thing that's inside a t-shirt that has embroidery on the front of it so it definitely has a real filter layer in the middle of it one downside to that though is that the wash instructions say you should not put it in the dryer and that's definitely not the most convenient thing but i'm sure the reason they say that is because this might melt if you put it inside the dryer the upside to this is this mask scored perfectly on all of my air filtering tests it did a really good job on filtering the air the fit on these masks was a little bit difficult the adult one is definitely pretty large and it felt a little big on me even though i feel like my face is sort of like an adult's medium size my 12 year old daughter it was way too big on her so that's why we got the children size but you can see how much smaller the children's is than the adult one so there's such a giant size difference and i think there's a lot of people that fall in between what would be the child size and the adult size it also didn't fit great on my face and i felt like the nose piece was rather large and heavy underneath my glasses and like the buttonsmith one it really pushed up on my glasses and i just didn't feel like i could comfortably wear my glasses with it because of the size of the nose piece this does have a little flap on the inside that's supposed to prevent fogging and glasses unfortunately it really didn't work and this was one of the worst for fogging with glasses i think because of the filtering layer this was also one of the worst for muffling sound so it's not a good option if you're really concerned about the sound of your voice coming through but i do give this one good ratings for filtering the air it's pretty fashionable compared to a lot of them and the price is decent so it has a lot of good things going for it next up is the reebok mask it's very similar to the adidas mask that has been really popular and talked about my dad purchased this one for himself and he lent me one through my testing this mask is a polyester and spandex blend on the inside and the outside it has two layers it does not have adjustable straps no nose piece it does have a filter pocket and it comes in two adult sizes and is made in china i really like that the reebok mask is really soft and it feels good on your face i can definitely see why people like this kind of mask for playing sports this mask actually scored perfect scores on all of my filtering tests too even without adding an extra filter and it does have a pocket that you could add more if you wanted to unfortunately this one did not fit me very well this is in the larger size which is called adult medium slash large they also have a smaller one that's extra small small the medium large was a little bit big for me with the people i had try it on it seemed like it best fit larger men since i didn't get to try the smaller size i can't really comment on how that one would have fit me or not because it does not have a nose piece and the way it fits i found that when i talked it would slide down my face and fall off my nose also the lack of nose piece meant that it had nothing to prevent it from fogging up my glasses so it was really not good for fogging the reebak masks are only available through reebok.com and they are three for thirty dollars so they're not cheap but they do seem worth a look especially if you're looking for something for sports this is the janu mask that's made by a company that makes medical scrubs i ordered this one because several of my friends mentioned it as being their absolute favorite mask the outside of this mask is a polyester rayon spandex blend and the inside is 100 cotton it has two layers and it includes an antimicrobial treatment it does not have adjustable straps no nose piece and no filter pocket it comes in two sizes kids and adult and it is made in vietnam everyone who touched this mask said the same thing they said ooh it feels so nice it really is a beautiful feeling fabric i am very impressed with the quality of this mask the problem is since it's not adjustable and it doesn't have a nose piece it kind of either fits you or it doesn't so many of the people who tried it on well they all liked it but several people did choose it as their favorite mask but they were the people that it actually fit unfortunately i was not one of those people because it was just a tiny bit too small on me and then the ear parts would just pull on my ears the other problem for me was the lack of nose piece meant that it fogged up my glasses pretty badly all the people who chose it were people who did not wear glasses this mask did really well on all of the filtering tests and it also did not muffle sound at all which was great it also seems to hold up really well to washing this one has been washed a bunch of times and it still looks like new the price on these masks is also surprisingly low for how high quality they are they come in packs of five for twenty five dollars so only five dollars a piece unfortunately you can only order them through the janu website and you do have to pay for shipping unless it gets over fifty dollars and then it is free after fifty dollars overall i would definitely recommend this mask if you don't wear glasses and you have a smaller ladies face unfortunately that's a pretty small number of people but for those people it's definitely a nice pick i hope you're enjoying this video about my quest for the best mask if you really like this kind of content i'd encourage you please subscribe and turn on your notifications so you'll be notified when i release more videos like this i really enjoy making these kinds of videos and when you subscribe it helps me to continue making more mask number three is the athleta everyday mask this is a favorite of a lot of people so i definitely had to include it in my list and check it out this mask is a polyester spandex blend on the outside with two layers of cotton on the inside for three layers altogether it does have adjustable straps and a nose piece it does not have a filter pocket it comes in one women's size and it's made in china in my opinion the athleta mask gets really high marks for looks i think it just looks really classy and put together compared to a lot of other masks it also has nice feeling fabric it does have adjustable straps but one of my testers did complain about this rubber piece on the adjustable straps it is not quite as soft as some of the other brands also the nose piece that is in the athleta mask is a little thicker and heavier than a lot of other nose pieces i found it didn't work great with my glasses and some other people did think that the nose piece was a little bit strange feeling because it was just a little too heavy the athleta mask did really well on all of my filtering tests and it also didn't muffle sound at all it seems to hold up really well to washing and i think that's because the outside is polyester so it still looks nice over time the price for these is five for thirty dollars and they're available through the athleta website you could get them in the store but i have not seen them in stock at any of the stores around me unfortunately on the website you have to spend over fifty dollars to get free shipping so you may have to pay for shipping if you want to order these although i wouldn't really recommend the athleta mask if you wear glasses because i don't feel like it works very well with glasses if you don't wear glasses i think it is a very nice high quality good looking mask that does a good job with filtering the air i would recommend it number two on my list is the old navy face mask this one was recommended to me by lots of people the old navy mask is 100 cotton with three layers of identical cotton it has adjustable straps it has no nose piece no filter pocket and it comes in two sizes kids and adults it's made in china i was confused when the old navy face mask said it had three layers when it really just felt like two layers of cotton so i cut one open and i was surprised to see it really does have three layers of identical cotton inside of it so that's nice to know the fabric on the old navy face mask is kind of thick it does feel a lot like khaki pants thankfully it does get a little bit softer after you wash it a few more times it also gets a little bit wrinkly but so does everything else that's 100 cotton but it's not as wrinkly as many of the other masks this mask did really well on my filtering tests and it works surprisingly well with glasses for a mask that doesn't have a nose piece in it but because of the way the fabric lays you can set your glasses on top of it and it does alright with glasses my daughter definitely appreciated that the old navy masks come in all kinds of fun colors and patterns definitely more than a lot of others it's also very inexpensive at only 250 per mask you can buy them in five packs or 10 packs and there are even some available at my local store so you don't necessarily have to order them online you can check on the website to see which patterns are available locally to you as my different testers tried on the old navy mask i feel like most of them said the same thing they said oh that one works and it feels like that's a good description of the old navy mask it fits a lot of people from tween sizes up to larger adults it's reasonably comfortable it fits reasonably well with glasses it does a good job with the filtering but it's not really perfect in every way it's not the most comfortable it's not the best with glasses it's just a decent all-around mask and it's at a good price is the old navy mask my favorite no but it's a very solid mask at a very reasonable price we finally made it to my favorite mask it's called the simlu pleated adjustable mask from amazon i picked this one because it seemed to have everything i was looking for and had a bunch of great reviews this mask is 100 cotton with two layers and has adjustable straps a nose piece it has no filter pocket it comes in one adult size and it's made in china i feel like everyone who tried on this mask said oh that's nice that was pretty much everyone's response and that's how i feel about it too it's just comfortable it fits it works it works with my glasses without fogging i really have nothing to complain about it the only complaint i might have is that it only comes in black or white and that's a little disappointing especially to my tween daughter who would really love some fun colors and patterns one possible negative of this mask is that the fabric part is kind of small but i found that it was generally big enough to cover everyone's nose and mouth that tried it on and it didn't really seem to be a problem it definitely does shrink after washing and i'll show you the difference in size between a washed one and an unwashed one it definitely shrinks a lot and the unwashed one also had pleats in it that were pressed into it and those do go away after washing but that didn't really bother me but that was something i noticed some reviewers mentioned another thing that i noticed reviewers mentioned was that the nose piece was sometimes off center but the nose piece is in a pocket that slides back and forth so you can just slide it over back to the middle one of the things i really love about this mask is it fits everyone in my house it fits my 11 year old son my 12 year old daughter and my husband and i and it's really nice to have one kind of mask that all of us can wear one positive about this mask that i can't stress enough is that it really works with glasses i've tried so many masks and this is one of the best for preventing fogging it's not perfect i don't think any mask can completely prevent fogging but it actually works and it filters the air and it still doesn't fog my glasses that's an amazing combo and on top of those other great things about this mask it's also really inexpensive the price depends on how many you want to order at a time but regardless it's less than three dollars per mask and it comes with free prime shipping that's awesome so i just ordered a 20 pack of this mask so each person in my family will have five of them to hopefully be able to get us through the week without washing i don't think there's truly a 100 perfect face mask out there but this is the closest one i've found so far i hope you liked this video thanks for sticking around through all of it if you liked it please give it a like and subscribe and please comment below if you think there are other masks i should test or if you'd like to see other videos in this series related to mask testing i'll see you in the next one
