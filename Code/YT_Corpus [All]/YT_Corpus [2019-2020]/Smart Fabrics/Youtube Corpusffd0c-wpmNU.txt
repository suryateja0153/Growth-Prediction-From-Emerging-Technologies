 hi everyone welcome back to our channel the number one place for designers artists and creators i'm jacqueline and i'm an interior architect and designer here at dmv now that bars restaurants hotels and other hospitality businesses are open we need to look at how we're going to make these places safe and also how to enjoy them like we used to but we can't simply carry on like before because it's not safe to do so so today i'm going to be talking about how we can design for the hospitality sector post-pandemic we're moving into a new era of hospitality that will change the way we dine stay and travel before opening the design studio i myself actually worked in the hospitality sector in a five-star hotel so i understand how this will affect customers as well as the staff and we need to make sure that moving forward both parties are going to be safe i think that one of the first things to do moving forward is instead of straying away from changes we should really embrace them and one way i think we can do that is through the use of perspex screens perspex screens can be easily cleaned and allow different groups of people to be kept away from each other whether that's bar staff customers or just between tables although i have seen some wacky concepts including this one by christophe guerning which did make me laugh i don't think things like this have to be necessarily wacky you know let's just keep things simple but also become design features there's no reason whatsoever why these screens can't be fun stylish and enhances space they don't have to be clinical hospital cubicle looking things you know therefore we should make sure that each business makes their customers feel comfortable and not like they're in some crazy sci-fi fantasy film let's also not forget smaller details like signage and floor decals that instruct customers what to do as these will play an integral part and be used at all times during a customer's experience now after 15 weeks of lockdown i'm sure we can all expect a huge influx of people who want to dine travel and stay although the customer's safety is often put in the spotlight we need to also remember the front of house and back of house staff that are going into work and putting themselves at risk when i worked in hospitality i was surrounded by people with different health conditions and even much older age groups so it's important that we respect these members of staff and make sure that we remember their safety and one way we can do that is to provide them with a new type of uniform moving forward staff could wear visors and gloves so that they can still see customers and interact with them in a friendly way some people might think that's over the top and really unnecessary but really it's just fundamental in making sure that the staff's health is kept optimal social distancing now this is going to be hard to say the least especially in smaller hospitality venues but it can be done but yeah maybe not by implementing creepy mannequin figures and cut outs within seats yeah i'm not too sure about that if your restaurant typically seats 100 covers make sure that the tables and chairs are spaced out so that there's room for customers to walk around even if that means lowering the amount of covers you typically do obviously if you get rid of covers then your profit is not going to be as much as you usually make so make sure to balance that out in your pricing and in fact many polls have been done recently asking the question would you pay an extra amount to help your local business and the answer has overwhelmingly come back is yes because we're all in this together and people want to help out other businesses also bathrooms are going to be particularly difficult places to social distance in so it maybe puts a member of staff by the bathroom door and then they can tell people x amount are allowed to come in at any certain time because really if you just put a sign there people are people they won't obey them so make sure there's a member of staff guiding people and instructing them what to do usually within a restaurant the main cleaning is done at opening and closing and not so much in between other than clearing tables so maybe you could cut your day into intervals so open for breakfast close for lunch and then reopen for dinner and within that lunch interval do a deep clean or if lunch is a peak time for you then make sure that there's a member of staff going around constantly cleaning everything as the day goes on either way we can expect cleaning practices to be leveled up even further after the pandemic and that moves on to my next point which is hygiene as the two fit hand in hand in order for your bathrooms not to be rammed with people wanting to wash their hands make sure that you have hand sanitizers on each table and as customers walk into your venue this will ease customers as it will make them feel safe there's also a few smaller things to take note of lots of times in restaurants you'll see things like this where sharing is common and they say that sharing is caring but certainly moving forward it is not sharing or reusing of items needs to stop another point is that if you're a customer intending to go to a hospitality venue soon make sure that you take cards with you instead of cash paper money is a fomite which is an inanimate object that's able to carry pathogens quite literally dirty money so just stop using cash and take a card with you in the long term we can expect to see drastic changes to the hospitality landscape especially i think integrating technology into interiors gone are the days of face-to-face check-ins at a hotel facial recognition and other advancements allow for contactless options this is a concept by the mansa practice where your hotel key is an app on your phone and that will let you into your room even the use of patamosta lifts with no buttons or waiting that is honestly who knows but i'm open to it also we'll see the use of self-cleaning and antimicrobial fabrics even the use of antibacterial doorknobs any material that will make our lives easier and safer another example could be a storage box fitted with a uv light that can sanitize hair dryers coffee makers and smaller objects and then that concept can be fitted into much larger things such as bathroom drawers mini bars and wardrobes and it will be activated every time a door or cabinet's closed there could also be more biophilia within design as well as plants actually improve the air quality surrounding you as designers and architects i feel that it's our responsibility moving forward to ensure that our built environment is prepared for the next pandemic in the future there's no doubt that the hospitality sector will see drastic changes and even in other sectors such as commercial office spaces as the work from home movement is here to stay especially millennials and zoomers who are used to living a laptop lifestyle it's just the way we live these days and if you'd like more information on how you can open your hospitality business safely then visit the uk hospitality site
