 hi it's genin chammy back with another notion video and this time it's this adorable pink iron Tammy found this and I'm like you bought it because it was cute and small that's right I did she claims there's more to it than cute and small and thank goodness yes there's did I buy this okay I'm looking for a small project iron something to take on retreats or when I travel and I need something that gets hot and stays hot and it's smaller and it's smaller okay now you often find with small irons that they heat up but they don't retain that heat isn't worried they turn off or they're not even that hot that's right this thing gets really hot we were playing with this earlier this case it's very hot so the silicone rests that it comes with has a tab you can hang it to store it like this and the steps on it to use the iron we would just pop this off and turn it over now this is a resting side okay so the iron is just gonna rest on this the whole time it's nice to sit upright like iron oh it doesn't sit upright so let's turn this on and let me play with this and I'm just gonna turn this on right here with this dial okay you see it glowing it glows and then it fades out it comes back on again that's because it's heating okay you see it doing that so they the on and pulsating is heating and what you think to temperature it is solid right that's correct I like it that's correct I like that and that exactly I can understand that alright so you grip it like this so I have my index fingers coming over it I love the tip on this iron and I don't want to touch that because I can feel it getting really hot yeah but depresses seem perfect to press a seam I'm just gonna get it warmed and I am just this thing has got a tip on it that is amazing oh it's so it is cute okay it's cute but it's also very effect that it's very effective iron this I mean it's hot Jen Phyllis it's really high I know there's so many people that travel oh yeah well they travel all year long you travel in an hour you want an ironing board in the Google iron and spaces right space is a premium uses limited how do I put this in my hands I don't know but I'm enjoying this just kind of passed it over and she took it look how that is you know the other thing I've noticed about some irons they're just heavy they're really heavy yeah this is not heavy this is a great iron for my hand I don't get tired using this I've been playing with this iron for a while now Wow and I notice I've got these little it would tell me about this that's your steam okay so it does have a little reservoir and as soon as you're done playing I'll show you okay thing it's not it's not steam it's not really this is not a steam iron yeah it's got a shot of steam if you need it okay but it's not gonna steam forever you're gonna fill your reservoir right here in the handle so it's a very small red sure so you're not gonna use it to steam out twelve yards of power its job as though it's really the scene it's a project iron just this is perfect for keeping beside my sewing machine when I'm paper piecing or when I am using quotes coupled with this will pressing Matt this is a winner and this is what I need right here my machine besides the brand being it's only so low so Alyssa isn't I definitely recognize brand in our industry is so warranty I love it I guess three years yes three years viola so you get a warranty hard in the box three-year warranty that is amazing for a company it is because a lot of them you find maybe a year of when your warranty is about all you get yeah if you do buy the iron and you do have a problem along the way up to the three years you to contact my manual this over that's correct that's correct well I'd love that they stand behind their products right here three years I do too I know that we use our products every single day so me as we continue through our quilting journey and videos you can expect to see more of that on camera because we have such limited you're gonna see this iron-on yeah on camera I'm okay so you bought it alright just because it's cute I know it's hot and it does this stay on Tammy yes it does this stays on constantly it does not have an auto off feature I do not like an iron with an off feature because it seems every time I go to use it it's just turned off you have to turn it on and stand there and wait for it to heat back up again that never fails it never fails no this does not have an auto off feature so if you're used to an auto off feature you're gonna need to be carefully you see this iron that you make sure you unplug it and turn it off and put it on its little resting yeah definitely that's always good and Kingsdown when it's hot glad you found that I think this is gonna be added to probably my sewing room - absolutely okay we'll see on the next shabby fabrics notion video [Music] you
