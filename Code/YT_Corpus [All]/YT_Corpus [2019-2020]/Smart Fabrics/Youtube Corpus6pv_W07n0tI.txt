 Apex Wall is the perfect companion for your mountaineering trips. It has an essential design that maintains the carrying comfort and the great functionality needed for this use. It is equipped with our Dry Back Contact back-panel. It is designed with a reduced contact surface and 3D ventilation channels, that increase the breathability on your back and give better stability. The Split Shoulder Straps and the ergonomic shape provide better freedom of movement and fit, a huge advantage when climbing. The hip-belt can be adjusted to adapt to the user’s anatomy, offering the perfect load control. Built for the alpine terrains, it is made with Robic, an extremely strong fabric, up to 60% more resistant than standard nylon, and with a water repellent coating. It has a roll-top closure to easily adjust the volume to give you further stability and a side zip pocket allows you to rapidly access your gear inside the pack. It also has dedicated attachments for ice picks, rope, and helmet. Apex Wall is available in two different volumes in 38 and 32 litres.
