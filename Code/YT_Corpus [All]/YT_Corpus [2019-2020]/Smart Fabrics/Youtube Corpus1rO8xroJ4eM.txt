 [Music] which is the mother of invention and we're going to see some very necessary changes in our industry which we're all welcome we're already seeing new fibers coming to market at a pace that we've never seen before that are really starting to address the sustainability challenges in front of us we use our multi brand platform to help new and exciting brands get to market more quickly and to adopt sustainable practices as they grow long term we're going to be manufacturing clothing in a very different way to the way we do now if we don't move together and adopt new industry norms as a sector rather than individual businesses we won't see the change at the pace that is necessary for the environment so bringing the research and development conversation into the business environment that can really accelerate the pace of change the fashion textile technology sector covers such an enormous wide broad range of grounds just work around textiles it's work around innovation in store this work online is work on a mobile it's work around engagement and all of these areas taken together are big and huge there's been a lot of conversation happening about the death of retail I think that's very very wide of the point I mean the reality is that FTT these kind of technologies will support an entire broad range of different types of channels and one of those is going to be physical and physical is absolutely not dead at all the challenge is of course trying to take very nascent technology which operates in very niche markets and make it scalable and I think a lot of this technology isn't yet scalable and once it starts to become scalable once it starts generating capital and generating monies and I think we're into a much more interesting area the other issue is the trend in technology today is increasingly moving towards combinatory forms of technology where we take for example a R and AI and data information and combine that with engagement piece for example errors around height of personalization and trends and taking physical shape of people and colors and feeding into that lifestyle data from the magazines and the media that they read and combining that with environmental data around whether it's sunny or rainy and rather than a lot of ftt technology is sitting in isolation we need to come together and if they come together then you get that one plus one equals three and the impacts on far more powerful what we offer up is our experience to SMEs and apprenticeships and interns and students and help them we've been through it ourselves from you can harvest some of that knowledge back to them but we also get stuff in return we get creativity with the innovations we get fresh thinking so it really is an equal partnership [Music]
