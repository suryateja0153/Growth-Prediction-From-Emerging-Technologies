 we present snack app snacking behavior monitoring with smart fabric mechanomyography on the temporalis automated dietary monitoring or adm is a central topic in ubiquitous and wearable computing concerning personal health and fitness management they have in various studies using wearable sensors mostly around the neck and mouth region to detect eating activities a review by oliver am has summarized that most adm systems utilize the body emotional sound caused by eating to infer the eating events including ingestion chewing and swallowing in this study we want to look at adm from the myography analysis that causes the chewing events chewing is essentially closing our teeth to squash the food by the movement of the jaw and during this process the jaw is pulled up by the muscle temporalis which is above our ears on the scalp in a study by zhang published in 2020 emg electrodes were placed on the legs of a glass frame that were used to detect eating events however emg requires direct skin contact which is not easy to achieve in a hair region in another study published by us in 2020 we use simple skin smart fabric which performs the planar force mechanomyography to detect the eyebrow movements with the sweatband an advantage of mmg is that the muscle movement is coupled mechanically to the sensing element instead of electrically so no skin electrical contact is needed to target the smart fabric mmg on the temporalis to detect chewing events we designed a prototype on a cap the sensing fabric is sewn inside the interior rim of the cap the tongue of the cap offers a platform to place the electronic hardware that performs the data acquisition and logging this form factor makes it easy for us to record data in a simulated daily scenario but the sensing method can be easily adapted to other soft or rigid form factors such as a sweatband tens visor or even glass frames and goggles we performed an experiment with 10 participants with multiple sessions on different days to evaluate our approach the people consumed various snacks out of their choice we did not have any specific requirements and types so some are soft such as bananas and oranges some are hard such as nuts some chewy such as gummy bear chewing gum sausages some are crispy such as nachos or chips the raw signal is already visually obvious between the eating events and other activities we performed high-pass filtering and frequency analysis with fourier transform on value transform we want to highlight that the dominant frequency you see in the spectrogram generated by the mmg method coincides with medical emg studies of the temporalis during control training actions result of our study using a support vector machine classifier shows above 80 accuracy in detecting the chewing events i just want to show two participants before i finish we see person 2 has a very poor accuracy and person 4 has about 80 accuracy with the footnote of different hairstyle now this is participant four we notice that the tongue of the cap is wider than his head leaving gaps on both sides and his signal intensity is actually quite weak but this can be easily addressed by a different garment design we simply did not foresee that the tongue of the cap can be a limitation and the rest are different hairstyles from participant four we can see she had straight and curly hair and afro box braids that was a brief presentation of our snack study thank you very much
