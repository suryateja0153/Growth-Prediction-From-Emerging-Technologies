 Textile machine operators use machines to make thread, yarn, fabric, and other textiles from a variety of materials. They move material from one stage of processing to another to ensure a quality finished product. Bleaching and dyeing machine operators treat fabrics with chemical solutions to change their color. They monitor machine displays and make adjustments to ensure processes run correctly, including those that wash, bleach, shrink, or dye textiles. Cutting machine operators use manual and electric devices to cut layers of fabric according to patterns. They adjust machine tension or speed, and maintain the machinery. Knitting and weaving machine operators produce fabric and knitted garments. They feed yarn and thread through guides and rollers to weave and knit materials on machines. They make sure woven cloth is free of defects and make adjustments and minor repairs when needed. Winding, twisting, and drawing out machine operators tend machines that wind or twist textiles; or draw out and combine materials such as wool, hemp, or synthetic fibers to make thread and yarn. They also wind thread and wire onto shuttle bobbins—thread for sewing machines, and wire to reinforce sheet glass as it’s manufactured. Textile machine operator positions typically require a high school diploma or equivalent.
