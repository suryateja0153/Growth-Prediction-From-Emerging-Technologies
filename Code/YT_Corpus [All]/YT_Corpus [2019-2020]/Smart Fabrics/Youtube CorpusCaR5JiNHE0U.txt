 I never actually tried to take one of these off before oh this is one of those really annoying security tags that you have on your clothes whenever you're shopping and you're trying on clothes and these are on here or maybe you're one of those people that actually stole the shirt and you have this on there these are the security tags supposedly they are full of ink and I try to take them off ink will come off on them on you and it'll ruin the shirt or the pants that you try to steal sir that you accidentally take home I didn't even know that how do you get side of that yeah I just thought there were like a little security tags like I thought it was like a little chip in there so that people from the store could go and find you that's so here's we're going to do I'm gonna put one on your shirt we are going to test it out here [Music] so right now we have nine of these tags on Lincoln well you can see II can tell you some of them like this one at school they do it cool all right so we've got all these on here let's try taking it off with this night oh I'm scared I know I've never actually tried to take one of these off before I don't oh my gosh whoa blue oh my gosh look at that nasty we've got bluing dripping don't let your on the carpet Lincoln that's not coming off already ink is already right up the other thing oh oh oh now green what two different colors this one you can see on the outside as yellow and purple on it and I'm going to try to see what happens Oh what's inside of security in tags Oh we're finding out how are you get this off or sell something this is gonna take so long you wanna try this at home really see I am a professional okay sure about this different too so we've pretty much wrecked lincolnshire and we've shown that this is not good and you can't just pull them off yourself it is dangerous the ink goes everywhere and your shirt or your pets are wrecked did use to your cell phone exploded look the red exploded inside of it no oh oh yeah you're leaving it through the shrubbery okay solo just pulled it out of his shirt got it out nos before my shirt all right so hopefully we have proven to you that these things are very difficult to take apart unless you have the right tools we went onto eBay and we were able to buy a lot of store somewhere in America and she sold them all and she said I hope this works for you it helped with my store when I have it they came with this little metal magnet what does that do as soon as they wanted that's weird see how easy that is this is sharp yeah well you could just use the magnet of your own so we have way too many of these little security ink tags Lincoln has shown that it definitely puts ink out if you try to get off get out of this shirt let's get you in a different shirt destroyed okay okay so while Lincoln is changing before we take apart the security ink tags I want to take a minute and talk about today's sponsor of the video which is Mac well than clothing back Weldon actually makes this really nice blue shirt that I have on and this nice sweater Mac Weldon is a company that believes in premium fabrics and smart designs so whether it's your basics like t-shirts or even underwear their clothing is really comfortable and it's really interesting because they've interwoven silver why would you do that well supposedly silver acts as a micro Mike microbial micro pol like I'll put out on the screen here with the definition it has that worked into it they worked it into their underwear and t-shirts which is really good for a teenage boy the clothes are super comfortable they sit well they look good whether I'm golfing or going on a date with Leslie I feel like they look good Lincoln's back and looking cleaner this is a Mac Weldon golf shirt so if you want to look good like Lincoln and I and our nice Mac welding clothing you can go to Mac Weldon calm and use the code what's inside and you'll be able to get 20% off your first order it's time to see what's inside of this I think we go with the one that's a more common looking exterior with this hard plastic that's what most people see first we're gonna take it into little magnet bang and boom and somehow inside of here it grabs it hard enough that it won't come off unless you use this magnet to get it off there's no like little ledges or any grippy things on this so whatever's going on is happening in here what is it that is moving I feel like we can get inside of it [Music] [Music] oh that's working I think we need to be a little more okay that was successful I smashed it something fell out I'm gonna do it again here we go you can even hit that one that I barely even hit it and it popped out so nothing yes is what happens there's a strong comes off it does have a spring inside of it Oh a little like Bell whipping thing this right here is one of the metal parts and the three little balls are on the side of it and that sits inside of here with the balls that are down in it and when the magnet comes on the back side of it it's pulling this off see the three balls there we go right now it doesn't come off I grab this metal part boom what it comes out it's just these three little metal bearing balls you're good each one of the security tags they have a little pin on the top with little grooves in it so you can't pull it out which is crazy because they're like little balls and you can't even pull with your hands just simply comes out and it's the string it's so simple so yet genius scientists are so smart the engineering mechanical engineers the way that they figure stuff out like this how does that puncture and make this explode so this metal pin right here goes all the way through to the backside of it when you pull on it too hard this metal circle goes in and it punctures the glass both of we leave that for the house black ink right there I just remember that this house is a rental and it's gonna be there for a while that's a lot more ink that I thought would be on there that is pretty wild I don't think I got on my nice back welding shirt the nail the three little bearing balls this is incredibly interesting and great engineering and I feel like we solved it that's what's inside of a security tag I hope you guys enjoyed this video yeah we made a big mess that I'm gonna go and try to clean off both my hands and the concrete and lincolnshire does it go there sorry buddy you forgot you some new golf shirts and Mac well insurance people were gonna steal stuff and they just got this thing it'd be so easy to take off these dirty things you could just go into the dressing room and like which we again do not recommend that two different colors scientists are so smart
