 I went to the Kyoto design lab summer school last year and being in such a busy city and then turning a corner and there would be a huge temple where you can go and meditate I thought it would be really nice to put that element into Western culture. So I wanted a place in an office space where people could experience this calm. So something that would maybe be enclosed and you would have all these textures around you and standalone pieces to pull and brush the walls and take their minds off whatever they need to for five minutes. So all the samples that I created were made to be interactive. I've done some where the were made to just be used as they are. So this one's a stretch one. You pull it out and it unfolds and unravels, it's a bit like origami, so it's replicating that idea of Japan in this as well and it's just something nice to play with and this one is made so that when you stretch it, it creates the sound and I've got this one functioning with a program and an Arduino board. There's a lot of research that suggests that interaction and playing with things can actually aid communication and it's actually been brought into offices already through Lego play. So I hoped that in the future I'd be able to see these similar samples developed further to be really ingrained in English culture. Something that actually helps people. I'd like to see them in offices, in hotels and just for people to use for themselves to take home and experience them and enjoy them.
