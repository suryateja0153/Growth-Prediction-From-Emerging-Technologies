 Smart Thermally Actuating Textiles (STATs) are tightly-sealed pouches that are able to change shape or maintain their pressure even in environments in which the exterior temperature or airflow fluctuates. STATs electrically control liquid- vapor phase changes of a fluid known as NovecTM 7000, which can expand its volume by 100-fold when exposed to heat and re-condenses at lower temperatures. The pouch is made of three layers: -a sensor layer with electronics woven into the fabric -a membrane made of a heat- sealing thermoplastic - and a textile-based heater. Fabricating the textile heater A conductive woven textile is adhered to a heat-sealable textile using a double-sided adhesive. The sample is placed in a laser cutter to pattern the heater design into a textile with electrically- conducting silver-plated threads woven into the fabric. Excess conductive woven is removed to reveal individual heaters. The flexible textile heater array is completed by permanently binding the two layers using a heat press. Fabricating the textile sensor Similar to the heater layer, a conductive woven textile adhered to a heat sealable textile is placed in a laser cutter. The lower electrode design is laser-patterned into the conductive woven. A thermal film is placed onto the sample then laser patterned into the dielectric layer design. Holes are cut through all layers for air exchange. Seperately, a conductive mesh spacer is laser cut into the top electrode design. A temporary adhesive is used to remove mesh spacer cutouts from excess and align with the previously laser patterned layers. All layers except for the conductive mesh spacer are permanently bonded using a heat press. While hot, the condutive mesh spacers are bonded and the temporary adhesive is removed.
