However, there are still several challenges to be considered regarding the power source for these devices and their biocompatibility. \f1 \cf0 \ \f0 \cf3 There is a lot of recent breakthroughs in that field due to the development of graphene printed electronic circuits. A research group from the University of Manchester has succeeded in the manufacturing of flexible battery that can be printed on textiles using simple screen printing techniques. \f1 \cf0 \ \f0 \cf3 The current hurdle with wearable technology is how to power devices without the need for cumbersome battery packs. Devices known as supercapacitors are one way to achieve this. A supercapacitor acts similarly to a battery but allows for rapid charging which can fully charge devices in seconds. \f1 \cf0 \ \f0 \cf3 Now a solid-state flexible supercapacitor device has been demonstrated by using conductive graphene-oxide ink to print onto cotton fabric. As reported in the journal 2-D Materials the printed electrodes exhibited excellent mechanical stability due to the strong interaction between the ink and textile substrate. \f1 \cf0 \ \f0 \cf3 Further development of graphene-oxide printed supercapacitors could turn the vast potential of wearable technology into the norm. High-performance sportswear that monitors performance, embedded health-monitoring devices, lightweight military gear, new classes of mobile communication devices and even wearable computers are just some of the applications that could become available following further research and development. \f1 \cf0 \ \f0 \cf3 To power these new wearable devices, the energy storage system must have reasonable mechanical flexibility in addition to high energy and power density, good operational safety, long cycling life and be low cost. \f1 \cf0 \ \f0 \cf3 \ Dr Nazmul Karim, Knowledge Exchange Fellow, the National Graphene Institute and co-author of the paper said: \'93The development of graphene-based flexible textile supercapacitor using a simple and scalable printing technique is a significant step towards realizing multifunctional next generation wearable e-textiles.\'94 \f1 \cf0 \ \ \f0 \cf3 \'93It will open up possibilities of making an environmentally friendly and cost-effective smart e-textile that can store energy and monitor human activity and physiological condition at the same time\'94. \f1 \cf0 \ \f0 \cf3 Graphene-oxide is a form of graphene which can be produced relatively cheaply in an ink-like solution. This solution can be applied to textiles to create supercapacitors which become part of the fabric itself. \f1 \cf0 \ \f0 \cf3 Dr. Amor Abdelkader, also co-author of the paper said: \'93Textiles are some of the most flexible substrates, and for the first time, we printed a stable device that can store energy and be as flexible as cotton. The device is also washable, which makes it practically possible to use it for the future smart clothes. We believe this work will open the door for printing other types of devices on textile using 2D-materials inks." \f1 \cf0 \ \f0 \cf3 The University of Manchester is currently completing the construction of its second major graphene facility to complement the National Graphene Institute (NGI). Set to be completed 2018, the \'a360m Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC) will be an international research and technology facility. \f1 \cf0 \ }
