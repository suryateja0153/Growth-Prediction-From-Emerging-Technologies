 hi everyone I'm Ingrid Nilsen and I have been making a beauty style and intentional living of videos on YouTube for the last 10 years it's pretty special for me to be here today because this is part of a video series that I am making in partnership with indeed and it's all about what to wear to work [Music] one thing that is definitely part of the work world that is pretty much unavoidable is interviewing the build-up to an interview can be so nerve-racking but I believe that thoughtfully putting your outfit together in advance can help to ease those nerves so today I'm going to show you three outfits in five minutes or less that help to illuminate your best self and take the next step towards your interview for the first interview look I have a dress and some heels I chose this dress as an option for something that is potentially more creative so I went with something that has a bold print because I'm someone who loves color and prints and I think that an interview is really a place for your personality to come out in what you're wearing and a great way to do that is through prints and colors I also just really love dresses because they're a one-piece wonder you throw them on and that's it this dress happens to be a shift dress so it hits me right above the knee and I love the silhouette of a shift dress it's super classic and you can get it in different colors and different patterns but if you want to go with something longer depending on what your comfort level is or what the workplace is you can totally do that too I paired this dress with heels to elevate it a little bit more but you could also go with another shoe option depending on the workplace side note if you've passed the interview and you've got the job won congratulations and to make sure to check out the video where I talk about what to wear in different workplaces you can click the link here and I'll also have a link down below for the second interview outfit I am taking traditional elements that we're familiar with but putting a little spin on them so I have a blazer here and I also have a turtleneck but the turtleneck is red it's also this nice thin breathable material a different color at the neckline I have simple wide-leg black pants and then I also have a pair of patent boots as well the reason why I love this outfit is because it has those traditional elements that we are familiar with like a blazer like turtle net but I'm incorporating colors that I know I love like red I also really like to stand out so red is one of my go-to colors and it specifically ties into the red thread that's in the blazer I love it when things like that happen for shoes I wanted something with a heel but I also wanted it to feel a little bit more modern and more true to my style so that's why I went with these pointy boots and I love the patent finish because the shine just really adds that cool element to it the pieces in this outfit take what could have been an otherwise colorless outfit adds color adds texture just adds more personality let's get into the third interview look now I love prints in color but there are those days where we want to keep it neutral so here I'm working with a striped knit top gray knit pants and white shoes this is an outfit that I put together for a place that is like a startup where people are dressed more casual but this is an elevated version of casual if you're not sure what to wear to an interview you can actually do some research in advance and look on social media the company's website you can also call their HR department and ask them what people typically wear and what their dress code is like then you can base your outfit on that I love these pants because they're a knit material so they're really comfortable you can move around in them but the tie up makes it feel more elevated and the tailoring and the silhouette of these pants also make these pants feel dressier then they feel when you have them on and I love pieces like that the sweater is a very light knit sweater and the gray stripes tie in with the gray pants for shoes I went with something flat and closed toed but they're pointy they're also white so they have a little bit more personality to them and then when it comes to makeup for interview outfits personally when I'm going into something where I might be feeling nervous I like to keep my makeup pretty neutral I love color on my lips but not when I'm nervous but I don't want to be thinking about is it beating is it in my teeth has it come off completely and now is it all over my face so this is one of the few times where I'm like colored lips I'm sorry but not today that is going to be it for today's video if you would like to see more videos like this make sure
