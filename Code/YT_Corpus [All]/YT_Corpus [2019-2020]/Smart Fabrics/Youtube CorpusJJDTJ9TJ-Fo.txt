 THE NEXT GENERATION OF WEARABLE ACTIVITY CENTERS MAY NOT BE STRAP ON DEVICES LIKE FITBITS OR DEVICES, BUT FABRIC OR THREADS SEWN INTO CLOTHING THAT COULD HELP DOCTORS. SEEM CRAZY? IT IS QUICKLY BECOMING REALTY AT THE APPLIED LIFE SCIENCES CENTER IN AMHERST. THIS COULD IMPACT US IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.  HERE IN THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES BUILDING, PROFESSORS AND GRAD STUDENTS DEVELOP WEARABLE TECH.  WHAT OUR LAB DOES IS MAKE SMART GARMENTS, EFFECTIVELY A WAY TO TELL YOUR CLOTHES HOW YOU ARE MOVING, HOW YOUR HEART IS BEATING AND HOW YOU ARE BREATHING. SOMETHING YOU WEAR EVERY DAY AND YUDSING IT TO GIVE YOU HEALTH RELATED INFORMATION.  THESE TWO PROFESSORS ARE BEHIND THIS HEALTH MONITORING TECHNOLOGY.  REAL POTENTIAL IS NATURAL, REGULAR CLOTHING BEING USED AS A SENSOR. I WANT TO DISTINGUISH THAT FROM YOU CAN TAKE THE ELECTRONICS IN A FITBIT AND STITCH IT INTO CLOTHING. THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT A TEXTILE BASED WEARABLE. THE THREAD ITSELF IS SENSING, WHICH MAKES IT MAGICAL.  THE TEAM DEVELOPED AN ARMBAND THAT DETECTS YOUR MOVEMENT AND SENDS TO A COMPUTER PROGRAM. THE RESEARCHERS SAY THIS DEVICE CAN TELL SPECIFIC MOVEMENT FROM BRUSHING TEETH TO SLEEPING.  WE ARE LOOKING AT SLEEP POSTURE TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR BREATHING OR SLEEPING IN A POSTURE LEADING TO HEALTH PROBLEMS. WE LOOK AT HOW YOU MOVE YOUR JOINTS, YOUR ELBOW, KNEE AND HIP, IF WE CAN MAP THAT OUT THAT TELLS YOU HOW WELL YOU ARE MOVING, HOW YOUR BODY IS MOVING IN RELATION TO YOUR ABSOLUTE NORMAL AND AN INDICATOR OF ILLNESSES. WHAT WE DO IS FIGURE OUT HOW TO TAKE ELECTRONIC TEXTILES AND MAKE GARMENTS OUT OF IT. WE SPECIFICALLY USE A DEVICE THAT ANY TIME YOU SQUEEZE IT BY PHYSICALLY BENDING AN ELBOW OR A KNEE, YOU CREATE A CONTACT BETWEEN TWO LAYERS OF FABRIC. WHEN YOU RELEASE YOUR ELBOW, THAT RELEASES. WE USE THAT TO GENERATE AN ELECTRONIC SIGNAL. WE ARE A KROS DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF CHEMISTS, CHEMICAL ENGINEERS, COMPUTER SCIENTISTS AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS. WE WORK TOGETHER AT THE UMASS CAMPUS IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THE GARMENT, WHAT DEVICE TO PUT ON THE GARMENT AND HOW TO PROCESS THE SIGNAL SO WE GET MEANINGFUL INFORMATION OUT OF A SIMPLE ELECTRONIC IMPULSE. MY WONDERFUL ENGINEERING STUDENTS LEARNED HOW TO SEW AND WEAVE AND THEY MAKE OUR GARMENTS AND I'M VERY PROUD OF THEM.  THEY EMPLOYEE VAPOR CHEMISTRY TO THE FABRIC, AN ECOFRIENDLY WAY TO MAKE THE GARMENT WASHABLE AND CONDUCTIVE TO ELECTRICITY.  WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS SINCE MY LAB MOVED TO UMASS AMHERST. WE THINK OF A WAY TO SEE IF WE CAN MAKE IT USEFUL AND DURABLE ON A GARMENT. THAT IS WHAT MY STUDENTS THINK ABOUT EVERY DAY. HAVING THE DESIRE TO MAKE SOMETHING NEW THAT WOULD HELP YOU IN YOUR FUTURE AND LIFE.  THIS IS EXCITING FOR HEALTH CARE. IT IS A WAYS AWAY, BUT WE ARE MAKING VERY STRONG PROGRESS.
