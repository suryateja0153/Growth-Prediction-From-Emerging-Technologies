While often associated with STEM subjects, UC’s College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning is working to incorporate cutting-edge concepts into fashion design with the opening of the Fashion Technology Center. DAAP's new center features labs dedicated to wearable technology, computer-aided design, automated textile innovation and specialized apparel production.
