 hi everyone well we are here at the Mandarin festival getting our booth set up this is so exciting to be here the festival runs a Friday Saturday and Sunday and we're here with smart pots so thank you guys so much for inviting us out thanks for coming we're looking forward to it this is Jeff and Dustin the Smart Pots why don't you guys just tell us a little bit about Smart Pots and maybe how the company got started what Smart Pots are for those of our viewers who don't know about them yet  Smart Pots are a fabric aeration growing container, fabric planter so you're gonna be able to plant anything and everything in a Smart Pot and we're gonna show you out here that you can do everything from succulents to vegetables to tropicals to house plants and what we're doing out here is a lot of citrus mandarins so it's a fabric aeration container the root prunes the plant and you're going to be able to grow a bigger plant in a smaller footprint and it's a healthier way to grow plants because the roots are going to be able to breathe get light get air and and it keeps those roots healthy and happy so much better than a hard sided container Dustin what's your role here at the festival this weekend support everybody out here of course Isley's and really educate people on the benefits of smart pots I've been growing Smart Pots fo over 10 years now and I had pots that are eight years still look amazing kind of a lot of stuff up for the festival to show people what you can grow and all the different varieties you can do and you know what Dustin would you mind grabbing that microgreens a little container down there cuz a lot of our viewers grow microgreens and I really like to tell people don't stop growing just because it's winter time these are a nice little quick crop that you can grow and eat in about a week or so yep so can you tell us a little bit about what you have I started the spouts a week and a half ago believe it or not just going outside with the light and the thing I love about these guys is like you talking about how quickly you can get some greens and how healthy they are for you absolutely they're packed with nutrients and people can eat them in about a week to ten days are these like little cabbage greens or arugula um it's a mix of different type of greens so there's some Swiss chard in there and there's really small ones but I like growing these guys all the time just because how quickly they grow we are so excited to be here this is so much fun it's a small-town feel here in Auburn it's gorgeous and you can see some of the vendors that we that are here a little gazebo here in the center you want to swing around Dustin show them the gazebo it's just really a neat neat vibe neat feel here let's head back over here and again just mandarins everywhere well day one of the Mandarin Festival is about to open and before the gates open we're gonna just take a little stroll down here this is called growers lane because it's where all of the mandarin growers have the delicious mandarin oranges and there's all kinds of vendors and booths all kinds of delicious mandarin food we can't wait to try it to sample some of them today of course you got to have the ice cream you'll have the chance to taste some of the delicious mandarin oranges look at those shakes mandarin shakes and juice one of the cool things is - you could actually purchase a bag of mandarin oranges and then have them shipped home and the post office is here and they will arrive before Thanksgiving so mandarins just in time for Thanksgiving good morning how are you okay it looks delicious mandarin cookies mandarin fudge mandrian bread that's a good one too there you go and I'm already smelling the kettle corn good morning oh that smells so good not anymore I'm gonna ride get it right here we are at our booth Kelly Kim smart pods right over here Dustin you travel all over the world with smart pods which has really got to be a lot of fun it's amazing that's great now tell us one way that you've seen smart pots use that not a lot of people might know about it's called pot in pot so you have a beautiful terra cotta pot and you can put a smart pot in there and pull it out so up here in Northern California we get a lot of the freezes there in winter time and we're gonna happen to these glazed pots is it will actually crack or split and the pot doesn't look that great so what you do is you pull the pot out and you can take this guy and winterize it as well as the pot just clean the pot put it in your garden shed and you're ready for a next spring there's also working like a larger sized container that may be very small tree or something like that you can definitely do that and one of the true benefits of this instead of getting the air pruning you get the mechanical pruning of the roots so what that means is the roots will still come through but you're still gonna get some pruning in the pot so you don't get that root bound plant oh that's really exciting thanks a lot Dustin your a lot of our viewers will enjoy hearing about that awesome thank you Karen you're in Smart Pots  headquarters in Oklahoma City yep that's right the headquarter is absolutely how cool now tell me one story that you've heard from a customer or one way that you're involved that is really inspired you yeah so we actually do a lot of work with schools and nonprofit organizations and so it's really exciting when you get to hear the stories back from like the teachers or the principals of the schools talking about how the kids were super excited about getting to grow in smart pots and just get that passion going at a really early age so sometimes we'll donate like our smaller raised beds and they'll plant up a little raised bed garden and then sometimes we'll actually donate a pod and the kids can plan something up themselves and they can take it home to their family and expose it to them and get that that family excited about gardening oh that's great because what I found and I'm sure you have too with your own kids when they grow their own vegetables they're a lot more excited about meeting oh yeah absolutely Jeff tell us a little bit about how the Smart Pots fabric is made and where you make potatoes smart pots are 100% made in the USA which i think is awesome because there's not that many products the left that are made in the US but we're made in Oklahoma City that's where we were founded that's where we still manufacture all of our products today so everything from the bag the fabric to the label to the tag to the thread when we say bag to tag it's manufactured in the United States of America and we're proud about that we have our own plan Oklahoma City we have employees that have been with us for 18 years so hand sewing these bags at our factories so you know people don't realize smart pots are everything from one gallon to thousand gallons and sizes so and everything in between this is a new color this is our new what we call natural and it's a kind of a combination of our old tan and our black the great thing about this fabric is that is a little more UV protected so it's going to have a real heavy UV protection to it and it's it's nice because it kind of blends in a little more people wanted something a little different it doesn't show there or you know outdoor wear and tear as much so this is a fabric we've introduced this year to our line yeah I love how the black fabrics are kind of a new cleaner woven around the pot it makes it really interesting and then for the Cali Kim listeners the the exciting news is that next year 2020 we're gonna have three new colors to our line and that's and I'll go ahead and spill the beans but it's going to be a purple a orange and a blue kind of a turquoise blue so those are going to be added in the first part of 2020 that's wonderful and I knew a lot of our viewers loved to decorate their outdoor space and they really had the outdoor living feel so those colors will really make your patio yes we filled with flowers or with vegetables be functional and edible at the sink - absolutely oh those are pretty big gosh those are beautiful these are the most beautiful mom's from Isley's nursery they actually have personalized CaliKim Garden and Home Smart Pots you can only get them here that's right it's a lot of fun I work the Smart Pots so to help that help show gardeners all over the world how to grow in a quick simple inexpensive way in containers without having to have a lot of space to grow vegetables this is a youtube gardener out of Southern California that works with us and I've told her about this and she's up here for the home show so I wanted to bring her to show and they could film it they do a lot of YouTube videos and social media stuff so have that senior points out us thank you gorgeous so Earl's mom and dad started the nursery Wow 85 years ago selling pansies 1932 this was all chicken right really mm break and my granddad and at that point of course there's always fallout from chickens and they throw that groans great vengeance definitely the pansy stick off and that's how it started Natalie was one of the winners of the tickets for the Mandarin Festival excited that you came out to see us today and you drove from LA Angeles which is about how far away like it's six hours was to drive six hours so she drove all the way from LA six hours to be with us here today thank you so much for coming out to see us and tell me a little bit about your garden so currently I'm growing carrots in the past I've also grown tomatoes so and do you have rice bags containers what are you growing in yeah so right now the tomato was inside of a I guess it's a race bed it's like along the long are cool okay and then the carrots was in a container okay wonderful now how did you first hear about us on YouTube so this is like many years ago when I was first kind of trying to get inside you know the whole gardening scene I really couldn't find any youtubers who was doing anything in California but I wanted someone who was doing gardening in California so I could kind of learn from and then I came across your YouTube video and then that's how I kind of started you know getting more into it and that's how I started trying carrots because before I would have never tried here so it probably started tomato oh wow that's exciting so I love how you've experimented and tried new things but that's what it's all about trying new things and then learning quicker mistakes and what works or what doesn't work right yeah why do you like to hurt it I think for me it's really just knowing where my food comes from and then knowing what I'm putting inside my food so when I harvest it I know what my body how does the flavor of home grown compared to the flavor of store-bought doesn't compare at all I definitely can taste that the fruit is a lot more ripe it's sweeter it can't it just it doesn't compare compare tomatoes from the grocery store versus your home ground no anytime right okay thank you so much Natalie you really are just thrilled to meet you yeah oh you are pretty now that we've had a chance to meet you yeah so much has been such an is great to just watch you guys on YouTube it's just so have done thank you so much and we love to hear comments like that because that motivates us encourages us thank you thank you all kinds of different sizes from like gallon on up 1,000 gallons it's crazy and you thank you thanks so much for hanging out how are you warm son on your back and just get into the soil with your hands and there's something about just planting a little seed and then there's a miracle I feel like it's a miracle I just watching it we do we do have some potting mix in these containers yes well we're here with Nisha and she drove about an hour and a half here to the Mandarin festival she's one of our YouTube viewers and longtime followers on social media and now she's our friend because we've got to meet her Nisha thank you so much for driving up to see a little bit about your garden yes I started it two years ago with this very small like a pepper plant and a Holly basil that's what I started everything killed so many times before yes and then after watching your videos growing how to grow peppers tomatoes and cucumbers and herbs it's so simple how to grow in a Smart Pots and just simple dirt and the seeds you need start small then expand your motto I always follow died and now I have a very big garden okay it's so exciting yeah now tell me like where do you garden i exactly garden outside my garage I have no space no land so it's on the side of my garage we have a one car so we parked it so I have on both sides oh that's great so you don't have like your typical backyard no so it is possible to grow in your small space right it is now tell me about your tomato plant you're growing it in a container yes I'm going in a 15 gallon to 20 gallon smart food container with a good dirt soil and on top of that it's a Red Vine Tomatoes so they really vine up almost about six feet to eat fit oh my goodness so I didn't I have a trellis to hold it well so I literally took a twine and twined it up on the world there was a block there as I pointed up and it's going oh my goodness it's almost like 7 feet I know yes so are have you got a lot of tomatoes from it in a container Oh from one container I got about 100 100 Tomatoes yeah some scream - sorry and how do you harvest sticks it's so tall yeah I plan to let it you have got to give us a picture of that I absolutely I will great what do you do with all those tomatoes so I give it to my neighbors I also send it to my mom in Albany all the way from California yes and I always are made of pizza sauce and also love of having on a grill cheese much better than grocery store oh there's nothing like it right yes now you were telling me earlier how you've also inspired your mom and dad yeah vegetables yes I I took them I basically took a favor of land and a mint and put some soil with some tissue paper with water sprayed water on it and I ship it to them and now they have a paper plane and mint growing oh my goodness in Albany so it's very cold over there it's incredible so you ship plants that ya grew all the way across the country to your parents yeah so they're growing too and now they're going I need one mint is proneural so it always comes back so in the Sun in winter she takes it inside and then spring she remembers it outside and starts growing and it's like blooming so exciting yeah well it's so amazing you're such an inspiration to me how you work for something and then share it with other people yeah and you've started small and then you've expanded into what you're doing now so thank you so much for being here today I love your YouTube channel it's like amazing growing so much so you have really inspired me yeah you are my garden guru hey I'm Jeff with Smart Pots and we are the proud sponsor of Flo the clown is the mountain and Flo's job as she runs around this fairgrounds this whole festival and promote smart plots the entire time interacts with children interaction with adults hands out a ton of your leftover Smart Pots swag she sends people to our booth she's awesome at what she does  Lisa you won the best tasting Mandarin at the Mandarin festival that is so exciting congratulations thank you yeah very exciting who were some very surprised it is our first time and we've been coming since the inception of the festival and this is your daughter here this is my daughter Laura my husband said the farm picking and it's his grandfather's ranch okay and we his grandfather started in 1927 and is one of the firsts who brought mandarins back with a group of three or four growers in the late 50s early 60s they began mandarins again in Placer County and these are the same trees that the fruit is off of that were planted way back then so city years old yeah six IRA we sell at the Auburn farmers market on Saturday mornings and we sell Tuesday mornings at the market at Roseville at Whole Foods and then we do appointments on our farm and we have and we should yes I do a lot of the picking and I do most of the farmers markets as well mom has been coming up with that and I pretty much do a little bit of everything yes yes my husband's part of it too I'm just all trying to make it a family ordeal we're actually working on a trial project and the fruit that one is from the trial to reinvigorate old trees to see if it was worth keeping them or digging them out and putting new trees in and it really seems to be working because something has really paid off but the entry is really healthy walrus they're pretty yeah so although all the time Andrews are hand-picked every one hand cliff because if you pull it off the tree that little where the stem joins the fruit tears out and then your fruit doesn't keep for you okay animal entry and it lets bacteria into the tree so yeah now I've heard like before we came up here about this area is especially and tell me a little bit about why that is and what's special about this area Mountain Mandarin growing area it's a kind of a microclimate where you have your cool nights which is what brings the sweetness in your flavor up and but you have your warm days which so we have a really more intense flavor then you will have some of the people say that mandarins from the valley are more flat tasting where we have that more intense citrus flavor and the sweetness easy to peel of courses with most mandarins we really cold right we don't have the we grow the owari satsumas only on our farm we don't have any of the other newer varieties we grow navel oranges also it was so much fun to be here yeah that's the end of the festival it has been a blast an absolute blast to be here we've had a ton of fun we were so inspired and blessed that so many of you made it up here to see us yep some people all the way from LA so that was just inspiring it's very cool we also want to thank  Smart Pots and the Mandarin festival for having us up here we had a ball and we look forward to next time thanks so much for watching see you on the next video bye guys
