 though I'm Hari takahashi meijin ubasti I'm going to talk about our work 3d printed fabric so I'm honored to present this work in this great session you know what our Weibo is 3d printer this is a no bubble above a 3d printing technique by controlling the movement of the nozzle in a law or printed pillars the 3d printer weaves a textile so we present tools to design various textiles and we demonstrate examples of various sizes materials and patterns right this background of all work so the development of 3d printers allows users to fabricate so accurately and easily print 3d objects at low cost especially field deposition modeling so-called FDM is Bob one of the most common and affordable 3d printing methods this emerging technology has been inspired researchers in HCI for example new 3d printing techniques allow uses to fabricate neural structure that contributes to print expressive object and improve printing process making soft object is also an important topic by printing or combining a soft public unique properties such as flexibility breathability and suitability are added to a rigid object so these are related works on the 3d printing technique 3d printed hair is my most favorite work a technique for fabricating a hair like structure by calling extruded material using the tip of the nozzle as the imprinted cam form this he'll write stewardship in wire print a 3d printer forms an object with wireframe structure so this technique improves the printings period and enables rapid prototyping furthermore FDM can express fluffy structure fluffy texture by controlling parameters such as the height of the nose opposition and amount of material are being extruded and these earlier it works on printing textiles so printing textiles or printing seeds is one popular topics of 3d printing a common approach is printing a chain mail chain mail right structure this consists of tiny interlocked parts and using a flexible material rightly lastima users can print of flexible feet on the bed of a 3d printer so with an expensive 3d printing message for example SL s and remove bubbles of support material or more complex structure such as wealth knitting this can be printed okay so how much passion is also printing a flexible textile with the conventional FTM 3d printer and I want to extend the application and possibility of 3d printing a gesture stick of our technique is its structure so the printer weaves a rigid material into warp and weft structure one of the popular structures over fabric so these are three challenges to establish the technique first house we D printers can waive textiles with rigid material and while weaving how to avoid the collision between the print ahead and printed object so finally how users can design textiles using our technique okay so let me talk about the detail of our techniques so we also provide more information in our papers of realism and paper so first about structure a printed text is up right on the bed of a 3d printer and consists of three components based fillers and fibers the base is a facet the base supposed entire structure and Pyrrhus woman has work in the textile so these pillars are printed in thin cylinders the outermost thicker pillars the flames this also supports the structure fibers are woman as the weft supplying the 3d printed hair technique associate with the mix of fiber and weaves it with the pillars so to make a long fiber the 3d printed the contains three surprise an additional amount of material while printing of fiber so next the printing Auto after printing is the base so step one asleep in turn makes subtilis here the outermost peel of Rachel law than in a pillows and a step to using the outermost atilla's the top of the post pillars the 3d printer makes a fiber and waves yet so depending on the density of the fibers this step is skipped step three ISM the outermost pillars are extended as a fiber is affixed to the outermost pillars the finally the simplest also extended and going to step one so while printing this structure we other passage to create visual for example the nodal moves in the height direction or passes by the side of a printed object to avoid a collision okay so this is a close-up or printing textile so here simple as a little higher exams outermost pillar then this really printer waves of fiber and some extent the outermost pillars unconscious to the next step hey so in addition to the basic structure basic components we provide these design parameters for programmable design first our technique allows users to print various lengths height and shapes of textile now by controlling the density users can make sports or dance textile so we found the pillars can be removed from a textile depending on adhesion condition also using various materials and controlling weaving pattern user cam design diverse mode a diverse textiles and several parameters are affected by the setup and material support example the maximum size is limited by printing area of a 3d printer to utilize the parameters we implemented design tools so we use Leiden and grasshopper these are child software on the script in the script the parameters are shown as GU eyes so from the parameters that so generate zico zico is a series of commands to control a 3d printer users can print this in a conventional way for example using a host application so we also use this tool to explore parameters for our technique then we developed the tool with various extensions so these are extensions of the design so get these are also implemented as grasshoppers pre script the left one is the simplest to generate a straight textile basic examples are made with this to the central one this generates a carved textile and enable integration with sweidy sort mesh the to come user geometry in child we also implemented a tool to control webbing pattern the right one to generate the movement of nozzle according to binary image okay so other tribe raishin so because the type of 3d printers are materials deck boss so we cannot injure the parameters is available for all 3d printers and all materials I mean users have to separate the parameters for the setup so because it's unrealistic to test all parameters and all combinations of parameters we recommend to print a small textile that takes ten to twenty eight minutes to print the result where they're helpful to calibrate parameters for example too much material cannot form a thin fiber so you will have to reduce our amount of material yeah common troubleshooting tips also 3d printing are also helpful so with the calibration we confirmed that our technique is available on for FDM printers unconventional material such as PLA and abs however it was difficult to form of fiber using conductive flexible you try comment yeah I think due to the viscosity okay so let me demonstrate applications first basic textile we printed this best text stuff with various sizes and colors of material 216 me metal with 50 millimeter high she takes approximately nine hours to print the largest one is 270 millimeter always on high it takes 50 hours to print and on right side this is the March car textiles the pillar and fibers are printed in different colors so we used your nozzle printer and a printer that has the capability of mixing materials next we printed carve textiles aren't integrated this with the 3d model so we found the woman textile maintains a shape similar to shape memory material we are printing yeah by the way my straw this one is also 3d printed it works well and on right side is pattern generation which was designing up patterns using the density and thickness or pillars and more complex pattern using a banner image is also available but a complex pattern often causes printing error several fibers cannot be woven tightly with pillars okay rust examples I think these are waste wise applications by controlling the other heating condition a pillar can be removed from the textile though we tried inserting an actual component the test we switch into the textile as one pillar so we made a simple circuit using our fabric and right side we used conductive ABS material for printing fillers this striped pattern of conductivity can transfer touch operation through the touchscreen okay finally we briefly tested the properties of printed textile depending on the setup parameters and materials the properties the quad river is just eliminated test about flexibility the textile is flexible in the weft direction because the weft is printed yet weft is made from a single fiber on the other hand it's easily broken in the warp direction because so what subpoenas are printed in layer by layer manner most strength also takes the consists of simpler and thin fibers is able to withstand heavy loads here is switch ramp just saw my presentation this is summary of our work will demonstrate our work tonight optimal reception please enjoy the examples thank you very much [Music] thank you for the excellent presentation also great to see you're wearing your results so we have time for a couple questions hi um great work I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the motivation behind this project and what you think the advantages are of 3d printed textiles as opposed to like traditionally woven ones with like soft fabric materials oh about my motivation for like what you think the advantages of like particularly 3d printed textiles are like material advantages mm-hmm so I'm sorry if I can get you a question for three so because I like 3d printing I also inspires 3d printing technique in USA on air sheesh I for example mm-hmm so I so I have tried to print 3d printed hair or soda print fluffy texture we I wanted to print I just wanted plain textile but the text icon says complex structure whap on the weft so it that was a big challenge for me yeah to print work on the web structure okay thank you yes good have you looked at using the extrusion flow instabilities to try to do that in a much faster way like if you under extrude or over extrude and then the factory doesn't follow the path but then can give you very fancy loops that get you closer to textile looks what's a man do we can talk in private if you don't know exactly what I'm talking about but when you extrude with the nozzle if you change the feed rate that you're working with you can actually create instabilities in the flow so it doesn't follow the path you actually want yeah where you're printing I don't try it okay let's tie hi I'm curious if you've gotten a chance to explore any other weaving patterns so I think all the examples in the paper are like a plain weave like over one under one over one under one have you gotten a chance to play with any other like styles of weave like over two under one over to like a twill weave or a perky SW chances of patent so I try to bring us a logo yeah cool thank you let's thank the presenter once more [Applause]
