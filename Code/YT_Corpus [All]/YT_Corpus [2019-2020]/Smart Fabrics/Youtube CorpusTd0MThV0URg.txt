 hi thanks for joining me this is angie at chic  n scratch i have another sewing project for you   today we're making this fabric basket and  this is very different from the previous   fabric basket that we made the other one used  two long pieces of fabric this one's using   a layer cake and we're using four squares  that we're going to be trimming down okay   what this does is it allows the images to  be right side up for example if this was one   long continuous piece of fabric our trees  would be upside down over there okay so   i'm going to show you all the steps in the  video this is using 9 by 10 pieces of fabric   and this is just using the regular 10 by 10 layer  cake so if you didn't want to do any cutting this   is it's just going to be an inch bigger i just  for some reason like the little shorter ones   you can also fold the top down if you prefer or  leave it straight up okay i hope you enjoy the   video thanks a lot okay so we're going to be using  four layer cakes to make our basket today we've   got two of this pattern and then we've got two  of this pattern okay we're going to also be using   some fusible fleece which we will measure that  in a little bit and we want to use coordinating   thread i'm using rfil 2600 it's a gray uh you'll  see that in just a minute when we're sewing   okay so now we're going to cut an inch off of all  four pieces and we're going to cut an inch off   at either the top or the bottom so it depends on  your pattern i can tell if i take an inch off of   here the antlers are going to get covered up when  we fold the basket down so we're going to take these two pieces and we're going  to trim one inch off the bottom now while i'm cutting this i'm going to go  ahead and say you don't have to cut this   you can actually make this basket without  cutting it but i prefer the 9 by 10 size now we're going to do the same thing to  the back fabric i'm going to move this over we're just trimming off one inch okay this is the inside fabric this is the  outside i'm going to take my label and add   that now i'm going to use my su daily i  don't know i think it's called a glue pen   so i'm going to add this here and i'm going to  glue down this side just to prevent any shifting   if you don't use a label then  this you can skip this step   i do get these labels from the dutch label  shop okay so now i'm going to fold that over and i want to make sure that i'm  only pinning it to the front fabric okay so now we're going to  place these right sides together   and we are only going to sew the  bottom right now okay so i'm going to   turn it this direction line it up  and then i'm going to take my clips and that's what we're going to sew i'm going to   do the exact same thing to the inside  fabric turn them right sides together just stitch the bottom so i'm  going to take my clips again and now we're going to go  to the sewing machine okay okay so i'm going to line this up to the  outside edge of the foot and this is foot   number one on my bernina okay okay so we've just sewn these pieces together and now what we want to do  is press our seams so this is the inside fabric   and this is the outside fabric  okay so let me get the iron okay technically it will be best  if you press these seams open so that it won't be  so bulky on the bottom okay there's that one now this one   okay so now we are ready for the fusible fleece  so for this basket we're actually going to apply   the fusible fleece to the outside so i have  a piece here but i can tell it's too short   so what you want to do is take your tape measure  and measure it from here to here from here to here   so i'm going to do that now okay so lengthwise  it is 17 and 3 8 and i tell you to measure this   after you've sewn them together because if  your seam if you're sewing at a quarter inch   this is going to be a different measurement  if you're sewing at a half an inch   it's going to be a different measurement i use the  side of my presser foot to gauge where i'm sewing   so whatever your method is that's why i'm saying  measure this after you've sewn them together and   if you weren't consistent your back fabric might  be a little bit might be a different size so   for this one it's going to be 17 and 3 8 but  don't use that measurement without measuring   your own because it could be a little off okay  now i'm going to measure the width and it is   10 inches give or take so 17 and 3 8 by 10  is what size i need my fusible fleece so i   will go cut that and i will be right back okay  so here is my fusible fleece that i have cut   and then here is my front fabric  so i'm going to place it on there and then i'm going to take my  iron and start in the middle   and then work out now when you're using the  fusible fleece i would suggest that you turn   the steam off on your iron yeah so turn it turn  the steam off and then you're going to press out and if your fusible fleece is a little bit shy   of the measurement of the  front fabric that's okay too you don't want it larger it will get  on your iron ask me how i know that okay now i'm just going to  turn it over for a second   and depending on what kind of iron you have  you can press this on the back side too all irons are not created equal so i'm just going  to say that i do really like this little travel   iron it's perfect for filming videos i will say  though that i don't use it all the time when i'm   quilting because i have the smart iron but this  one is perfect for filming it's small it doesn't   take a lot of space up and it's nice and hot  okay so we just pressed the fusible fleece on   and what you're going to do now is fold this  in half and i want to make sure that the top   is straight so i'm going to pin the top first and  then i will pin the left and the right okay so you can use pins if you prefer i'm  going to use a clip anytime i can   so that i don't accidentally poke myself  that pins work too for whatever you   prefer i should say okay that one's  done now we're going to do the back   or the inside fabric i should say i don't know  why i say the back this is the inside fabric and i'm going to pin and you don't  have to worry too much about pinning   the inside fabric but the most important part is  let me back up a second is you want to mark where   you want to leave your opening so that you can  turn the basket right right side out and we're   going to be trimming off a half an inch on the end  so you want to make sure that you put your opening   not at the top of the basket where they could  see your where you stitched it and not at the   bottom where we're going to be cutting so  ideally you want it right smack dab in the   middle so what i'm going to do is take a pen  and mark where i want that opening to be left   so right about there so i'm going to leave an  opening like that okay and then i'm just going   to pin this again so now what we're going to do  this is the top this is the left this is the right   we're going to stitch down both sides only  and the same thing on the front fabric okay don't forget to leave your opening so that you   can turn the baskets right side  out or the basket right side out okay so i'm going to start back right about there okay so we've just sewn the left and the  right together on both the inside fabric   and the front fabric before we go any further  we want to make sure that we caught the label   if we did not catch the label then we can put  it back on the sewing machine and sew it okay so   i can yep i almost cut off the c but it's  there so it looks good okay so our next step   is go ahead and take these pins out before we  poke ourselves and you can use a rotary cutter   you can use scissors whatever floats  your boat you can use a marker   you can measure one and a half inches and  use your markers what i really like doing   is using a piece of paper that i cut with  a one and a half inch punch and i'm just   going to place it down here at the bottom and  i'm going to pin it and then cut it out so and this step doesn't it doesn't have  to be perfect it's yeah y'all will hear   me say that a lot i say it even paper crafting  sewing and paper crafting so i'm going to take   my fabric cutting scissors and i'm just  going to of course i used a pen that was   huge ideally you'd use a smaller one so i'm  going to remove this one and a half inches   and then i'm going to do the same thing over  here on this side so pin it and then cut it out use a smaller pin we're done with that one so now  let's do the front fabric okay i know most people use a rotary cutter and  use their erasable pen and i do that sometimes   but i think this is easier  technically it may not be as precise okay so now we're done cutting those  corners on the bottom of our bag   our basket and now what we're gonna do is let me  open this up just like this and we are going to pin this you can use your clips but they won't  fit under my presser foot so i'm going to use a   pen even though i prefer the clips somebody  needs to make us some smaller clips right   so i'm going to pin this and then i'm going  to take it to my machine and i'm going to sew   straight across there so i'm going to do this  on both the front and the lining of our basket okay they line up pretty well now  this one so the same thing for the lining okay i've got both of these pinned we are  ready to go to the sewing machine okay okay so now you can see this is not straight  probably as a result of me using paper instead   of a ruler but again i'm okay with that but  i do want to make sure that i'm consistent   so hopefully you can see where my foot is i want  to make sure i clear that line right there okay   so there we go same thing over here so okay so we've just sewn the corners you want  to make sure now that you don't have any   holes on the side or the bottom so check all  of your seams to make sure there's not a hole   and now we're ready to layer these so you're  going to take your basket you're going to leave   the front fabric just like this okay so front  fabric in there you're going to take the lining   and you're actually going to turn it right sides  out okay so right sides out and if you use a label   this is my piece of advice don't put the  opening of your lining on the same side as   your label so my labels on the right side right  now i'm gonna put this opening on the left side   that would really interfere with your label  okay so now what i'm gonna do is put these together and open the seams so i'm going to start  on this one side here whoops okay make sure i'm   in the camera view and i'm going to use my clip  and then i'm going to go over to the other side   and do that side and then we'll hope that the  rest if you're sewing was consistent they should   they should um line up nicely okay there  we go so i'm going to clip this one   now for the rest of these we're just going to  go around and do the same thing just clip them these clips might be a little too big for your  sewing machine if they are then you will have to   pin them and you'll see what i mean in  just a minute when we're actually sewing now this basket is not a reversible  basket the one i made before   uh is because of how we made  it but this one is not because   of that opening piece and the liner okay  so we're going to the sewing machine now   okay oops i hit the camera so now we're ready  to start sewing i'm just going to start here and   um yeah i'm just lining it up  to the edge of my foot okay okay this is how it looks we just  stitched around the entire top of it   now before i proceed i'm going  to cut these extra threads   i know some people don't do this step  you don't have to if you don't want to   it depends on how much time i have whether i trim  them or not but okay so that's pretty good now   we want to turn this right side out so we're  going to look for that little hole that we left here it is right here okay so we're  just going to slowly push that through   this basket is actually going to be for me so i am  so excited okay so now i'm going to take my hand   inside the bottom press these points  out and then same thing on this side okay so here's how it looks look how pretty  that's the front that's the back or this is   the front that's the back it's either it  doesn't matter okay so now we have this   little opening that we have to close that's  inside so this is where i was talking about   this basket is not reversible because of this  unless you're one of those perfect sewers   i still haven't figured out what that  trick is to make this look so fabulous   i'm okay with this basket not being reversible  so now all we're going to do is sew this   up so i'm going to start here and end oh  right about there where that white thread is   this time i'm going to be lining up the edge of  the fabric to the inside of this presser foot okay okay so we've just sewn that closed doesn't  look the best does it that's why it's the liner   uh you could use the same color thread  and that would um make it less noticeable   i'm okay with it look in that like that  okay so now what we're gonna do is push   the liner inside there just like that and then  we're going to fold not fold we're going to   flatten that out and i'm actually going to use  pins because on my machine uh these little clips   are getting caught so i have to use pens for this  step so i'm making sure that the lining is is   inside there and it doesn't have any ripples or  whatever and i'm just going to pin and i'm going   to go around the entire thing and then what we're  going to do is stitch around the entire basket i should get my pins closer right let's see okay now we're going to go to the sewing machine okay so it doesn't matter where you stitch or  where you line this up you can line it up to the   outside of your presser foot or the inside  or your quarter inch whatever you want just   be consistent across the entire thing um i think  i'm just gonna go use the outside of the foot okay okay so we've just stitched around the top now  what we're going to do is take our scissors   and snip all these extra threads and while i do  that we're going to talk about the previous fabric   basket that i made that one was reversible  if you had if you used one piece of fabric   and there was reindeer or deer on there the  back side the deer would be upside down so   that's the benefit of using this video so that  you can use two pieces of fabric so that your   animals or your pattern is right side up you know  what i mean okay so now the final step is we are   going to press this because you can see it's  quite wrinkly okay so here's my ironing boards   i've got this little mini one these  came together i did get them on amazon   if they're still available i'll make sure that  the link is on my website and um on my what um   under the description of the video okay so you're  just gonna press this around the entire basket okay so here's how it looks pretty darn  cute right okay that wraps up this video   all the supplies that i use in my video  will be listed in the description under the   video and also on my website along with the  free pdf okay thanks a lot have a great day
