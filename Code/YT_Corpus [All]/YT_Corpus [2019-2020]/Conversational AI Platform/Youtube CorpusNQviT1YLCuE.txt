 are you looking to extend the functionality of google assistant and add unique user journeys to help users get things done if your answer is yes then consider building a conversational action conversational actions briefly take over the assistant user experience to fulfill user requests with a conversation users can interact with the conversation using touch text and voice while your actions respond back with audio and visual prompts these sections are available for google assistant on phones at home or on the road let's dive into how actions are involved how a conversation works and how you can connect web services and apps for additional functionality users can invoke conversational actions by simply saying hey google talk to and then your actions display name which is your brand product name or persona that uniquely identifies your actions we'll begin with the main invocation which is the default way users tell the assistant they want to have a conversation with an action he has a flow when action is involved using the main invocation and a system processes the user's request through natural language understanding then the action needs to generate a prompt and send that to the assistant typically this is a greeting or informational prompt that guides the user on how to converse with the action every actions project has a main invocation but you can also define additional deep link invocations these invocations let users begin conversations in a different ways and go straight to different functionalities of an action once the action is invoked the conversation begins between the user and your action to build this back and forth between the user and your action you need to do three things one process and understand user input with natural language understanding two apply logic to organize the conversation flow and three generate the appropriate response back to the user to build this functionality you use conversation components such as intents slots scenes and prompts you can learn more about these components in our other videos now there are times when your action may want to make an api call query a database or dynamically generate prompts to do that your action can trigger a web hook that sends a request to a registered event handler with a json payload let's go back to the diagram and update it with a fulfillment service to handle those types of requests the assistant process user input and carries out intent matching and slot feeling your action triggers a workbook and makes a request to your fulfillment service your fulfillment now processes the requests which contains a json payload from your action and returns a corresponding json payload response this is the first step to build unique and customizable user journeys with conversational actions check out our docs for more requirements and details in the description below i'm andy chen thanks for watching and i look forward to seeing what you built
