 hi and welcome to ignite 2020. i'm nancy tandy i am the go-to market lead for business applications here at microsoft today i would like to introduce you to joe camp one of our power platform experts joe is a cloud advocate here at microsoft and has an extensive background in financial in the financial industry he will be presenting today the introduction to power platform and we're welcome to want to welcome joe and we look forward to this presentation thank you nancy um thanks everybody for uh attending this session again this is the introduction to power platform we've got a lot of material so i'm gonna just go real briefly into a little bit about me my name is joe camp i was part of the windows insider mvp program uh windows insider program prior to this role i've been in this role for two months so i'm learning learning a lot and learning very quickly and there's a there's a phrase at microsoft it's it's uh learning from the fire hose or drinking from the fire hose so that's very much what i've been doing over the past couple of months so anyway on this slide up here we've got my my social credentials um you're more than happy to follow me or more than happy for you to follow me and be great i do provide content about powerapps uh through that channel so with uh in the context of this conversation again this is an introductory power platform conversation we're going to talk about the components of power platform and then as we talk about those components we're going to talk we're going to weave in some business value of power platform and then some of those components and then we will talk about some of the things that we encourage you to do to continue your journey in learning more about power platform and we will include resources to help you with that so jumping in power platform is microsoft's low code platform that spans across office 365 azure dynamics uh azure dynamics 365 and other standalone applications the four main components are power bi which is the power analytics component power apps which is the application development component power automate business automation and then power virtual agents which is the intelligent virtual agents or the chat bot framework and then there are three pieces at least in the context of this conversation that feed data into these components they are data connectors we're going to touch really briefly on the ai builder and then the common data service so moving into power bi power bi is the power platform business analytics service that delivers insights to analyzing data it can share those insights through data visualization which makes reports and dashboards to enable fast and informed decisions a power bi scales across your organization and it has built-in governance excuse me and security allowing businesses to focus on using data more than managing that data whether your data is in a simple microsoft excel workbook or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses power bi lets you easily connect to your data sources clean that data and then model your data without affecting the underlying source then you can visualize or discover what's important what's in that data based off of visualization tools within power bi power bi consists of a power bi desktop a power bi software as a service service and then a mobile power bi app which works on your phone as well as tablets and the phones ios and android compatible the second component is powerapps and powerapps is microsoft's no code low code platform for building applications this tooling builds off of some concepts that you are probably already familiar with if you're spending any time in excel and you're building formulas within excel you can take that skill set over into the power apps platform to build apps you can use powerapps to build simple solutions like vehicle inspection forms status reports or complex business solutions for purchasing a purchasing process or an inventory management tool with powerapps you have choices on where and how your data is stored excuse me something in my eye the sum some of the common data sources include the common data service which we'll talk about in a little bit sharepoint sharepoint online dynamics 365 and sql as well as excel online additionally you can connect your app to over 325 connected data sources powerapps easily supports multiple data connections allowing you to bring data together from many platforms into your single app additionally powerapps has democratized artificial intelligence by providing a wizard-based interface for building and training your model or your your ai model um and unlocking the power of azure machine learning and connected services we're not going to talk too much about machine learning or actually we're not going to talk at all about machine learning or cognitive services a little too heavy for this conversation there's a ton of information in microsoft learn and i encourage you to to go there and look look at that if that's something that you're interested in next we're going to talk about power automate and power automate lets users create automated workflows between applications and services it helps automate repetitive business processes such as communication data collections and decision approvals not only for the individual user but power automate allows for the creation of enterprise grade process automation power automates a simple interface allows every level of user to automate work tasks from the beginner to a seasoned developer a few examples of power automating what power automate can do for you you can automate repetitive tasks like moving data from one system to another guiding a user through a process so they can complete uh specific different stages an exam something that i like to think about is the onboarding of a new employee going through that onboarding process and then you can also build out purchase order approval automation the last big component of power platform is power virtual agents empower virtual agents as microsoft's low code no code bot framework power virtual agents or pva enables anyone to create powerful chat bots using a guided no code graphical interface without the need for data scientists nor developers power virtual agents addresses many of the major concerns with chat bot building eliminates the gap between subject matter experts and the development teams building those chat bots removes the complexity the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of conversational ai and the need to write complex code and power virtual agents empowers subject matter experts to build and maintain their own conversational solutions an example that i like to give about power virtual agents is you can you can when you're building your power virtual your pva power virtual agent you can invest nest that into your company's website and then you can pre-populate a number of questions kind of a frequently asked questions that you get from your customer service support team uh in the power in the pva and then as somebody comes to your um to your website they engage with that chatbot and the chatbot's asking a lot of questions and um in providing answers to the customer the customer may ask ask a question that the chatbot just doesn't have the data to support the question and that is a trigger that will automatically send out a p a power automate an email notification to a live agent that within that notification that live agent has all the history of the conversation if you will between the chatbot and the customer and it's a seamless transition to where the the live agent can now help and support the customer so a great customer experience excuse me so we talked briefly very briefly about common data service and the common data service is a cloud-based solution that easily structures a variety of data and business logic to support interconnected applications and processes in a secure and compliant manner managed and maintained by microsoft the common data service is available globally but deployed geographically to comply with your potential data residency it is not designed for stand-alone use on your servers some quick attributes about common data service is it handles authentication through azure active directory allowing for conditional access as well as multi-factor authentication common data service allows you to easily apply business logic at the data level common data service offers you the opportunity to shape your data allowing you to discover model validate and report on your data and then the common data service stores your physical data within the azure cloud which is something we touched on earlier one of the powers for of power automate no pun intended is its ability to leverage data across many platforms to do this components of power platform use data connectors you can think of a data connector as a bridge from your data source to your app or workflow which allows for information to be conveyed back and forth data connectors allow you to extend your business solutions across platforms and add functionality for your users and power platform has more than 325 data connectors out of the box with that said you do have the ability to build custom connectors and custom connectors allow you to extend your app excuse me by calling a publicly available api or a custom api you're hosting in a cloud provider connector data connectors work by sending information back and forth across these apis and gathering a fail available functions for powerapps and powerautomate the data sources for the connectors are in two forms they're tabular form which is one that returns data in a structured table and this is great for power apps because powerapps can directly read and display these tables through some things called galleries forms and controls and as you go through and learn about powerapps you will understand that galleries forms and controls are part of the powerapps studio which is the the the area where you're going to be building your app additionally if the data source supports it powerapps can create edit and delete data from these data sources examples of tabular data are the common data service sharepoint excel excel online and sql server the other data source for connectors though is the function based data and this is one that uses function to interact with the data source these functions can be used to return a table of data but offer more extensive actions such as the ability to send an email update permissions or create a calendar event examples include office 365 users within your tenant or within your subscription a project project online and if you're utilizing azure then you can you can use azure blob storage then the components of a connector there's two main components there's triggers and actions and triggers are only used by power automate and prompt a flow to begin or a power automate flow to begin triggers can be timed based such that a flow could begin a specific time of the day so say you need to you need to transfer data from uh one system to another system daily you can set up a um you can set up a a power automate and the trigger for that data flow from one data source one's data system to another data system is a specific time of the day additionally and or you could set up a trigger based off of an action by creating a new record in a table or receiving an email actions are used in both power automate and power apps actions are prompted by the user or a trigger and allow interaction with your data source by some function for example an action would be sending an email to your workflow or app or writing a new line in a data source so pulling all of this together so we've talked about a bunch of different components of uh power platform um and let me kind of give you a a fictitious tell your fictitious story of how this could work say for example current life right now there's a business that has an i.t department and within that idt department they provide quit equipment to their employees who can check out a set equipment for an event and the current process is one where the employee has to walk down to the i.t department talk with somebody within it they're asked to fill out a form the i some the individual within with that works in it has to go back and look in inventory see if they have it um then they come back out they give it to the employee the employee takes it away does some work and the employee for whatever reason is late in getting that equipment back to to inventory an email has to be generated as a response or as a reminder so it's just kind of this long laborious process the benefit and what you can what you can do with power platform is within powerapps you can build an app and you can take within that app you can include all of your inventory you can include current status or status of all that inventory whether it's available or not you can also include use usage or user information on how to use specific pieces of equipment so say for example i need a piece of equipment for a user group that i'm going to talk to i can pull up the app within my phone or on my laptop i can fill some things out requesting for a specific piece of equipment needed this day this day this day click submit once i click submit a power automate flow sends an email directly to the i t department the it department now has my request they will know whether they have the equipment or not they can send an email back say yeah joe come and pick up this piece of equipment at this time and then you have five days to use the piece of equipment on the fifth day i receive an email which is a power automated generated email that says joe you need to return the piece of equipment and then i do and it saves saves the the it department a ton of money and it's on a time and but then what you can do is as you're creating all this data you can take that data and you can put it in a power bi solution where you can visualize who's checking out equipment what equipment's being checked out the length of time that it's gone you can use this data to figure out does a department need some dedicated equipment based off of the amount of times that they've checked some stuff out it's great for budget budget planning and this is something that i had to do in a former role and having this would have been fantastic from a planning budgetary perspective so that's kind of a high level story on how power platform can work and can work for you so now that we've gone through those pieces of power platform and the components of power platform i want to share with you some thoughts on what you can do in steps moving forward in learning learning uh getting a deeper understanding of the different pieces so one of the things that we have an interest in to be very transparent is we would love for you all to consider sitting for and taking the power platform fundamentals certification test and that's called pl 900 it is a an exam which you would once you pass you have it on your resume it certifies at least from microsoft's perspective that you understand the business value and the business proposition a power platform and you know i think that you know it's a nice skill set to have on your resume so some of the skills that are needed um you need to understand the business value of power platform which we've talked about the core components of power platform which we talked about the business value of power bi power apps power automate and power virtual agent which unfortunately is missing in this slide and the next couple of slides that i'm going to talk about will hopefully help you gain a little more knowledge on those components and so one of those is microsoft learn and this is a kind of a it's microsoft learn for those who don't know it's microsoft's gosh what's the best term to describe it the best time to i guess to describe it is learn it's an aggregation of mob modules that kind of walk you through the various pieces of of power platform and this this is a um a learning path within um microsoft learn the power platform fundamentals so it's eight classes eight sessions um there's uh um information about uh power pla power power bi cds and power automate and as well as some some activities that you can work through to build an app build a dashboard a build power automate if you want to be in an instruction instructed uh environment training environment we do work with some instructor-led or some instructor partners um and you can easily do that uh and then finally just this one not finally but this one slide um talks about power platform fundamentals uh and the certification and then this slide is really the main slide that i want to share with you and please take a a screenshot of this this includes the the link to the learning path that we just talked about on microsoft learn it is a link to the instructor-led training if that's something that you're interested in and something you want to do and then the certification details this landing page has a ton of details on skills that are are are quizzed on and it's a great informational website or a webpage then these last two slides power app test environment this is a an opportunity for you to set up your own test environment it's an article that i wrote that walks through the steps on building a and using m365 developer program uh to build out your own um test environment this is actually what i use to build out my power apps and and power power automate and and testing area testing sandbox i guess lack of better way say um and then this last bullet is the uh is uh my kind of a written demo on the very first power app that i ever wrote less than a month ago or a month ago and it goes step by step by step uh on on the app that i that i built which was actually an inventory management app so a lot of material in a short amount of time please consider uh following up with some of this some of these other resources for continued learning um that is the completion of my portion nancy i know that you wanted to talk about the ignite skills challenge i do thank you joe so that was a great presentation um so i just wanted to mention to everybody we are having a cloud skills challenge uh during ignite and it basically is there are six different learning paths that you have an opportunity to consume and if you can complete one of those learning paths you will get a free microsoft certification exam you can join in the fun by going to the learning zone and there's a url down at the bottom of the slide it's it's a lot of fun we've done it at some of our past events so take a chance and get learned and skilled up so joe we have a few questions um that came in and wanted to just kind of go through a few of them if that's okay yeah that'd be great thank you and the first one is do you have to sign into microsoft learn and is it free or does it cost something microsoft learn is free um you don't have to sign in one of the cool things about microsoft learn is it kind of tracks your progress and um you get some points uh in the upper right-hand corner and for me being somewhat competitive against myself i like to see the the little slider bar kind of move over as i'm gaining gaining knowledge points so it's not it's it does so but to do that you need to sign in with uh with your microsoft account so your email address your email account but no you don't have to do that great and can you tell us a little bit about the certification um what is the best way that you like would prepare for it do you is it just consuming the learn content or do you recommend going to a class uh so um full disclosure i haven't taken the exam yet um but my feeling is that the information within microsoft learn uh the um the uh learning path i think is sufficient that will will be enough to get you through the exam one of the things that you do want to look at is there's some there's some classes there's some beginner classes within microsoft learn for power virtual agent which are not unfortunately at least not right yet but i think that'll get changed are not part of that learning path but that's easily discoverable so my my suggestion is take the learning is take the learning path classes of the eight classes and then when you're in microsoft learn search for a power virtual agent and there is a beginner's learning path there of three classes and i would recommend that you take those i have not taken um a an in-class um learning so i really don't have a benchmark on that um but my suggestion is to do to do what i just did and play with and set up an app set up an environment play with the play with the tools um within powerapps and get familiar with them it's my i think that's my best my best suggestion that's great okay so i have another question that came in what would you recommend to a developer to try out first in power platform so the four solutions within it um i would suggest you play around with power apps and i think as a developer i think what you'll end up doing is you'll you'll you'll then play around with power apps and then what you'll think about is all right so maybe i can extend this which you can and then depending on what languages you know you can tie in some javascript or some python and tie that into some some other database building out maybe your own custom connector or if you are also playing around with azure then you can connect some some of the azure tooling into your app i have a feeling that as a developer that's where you would go my background to be very to be very honest is i am learning i don't have the dev background skills and you know this is to me this is so much fun because i feel like a dev though i'm you know i'm learning to be a dev um so my suggestion would be uh play around with power apps first okay so i think we have time for one or two more questions um this was a good one do all power platform apps need cds uh no they do not um as a matter of fact the um the power app that i built is tied um in the the where is it this um this bottom bullet point the power app that i built is tied to an excel online spreadsheet so that's my data source so no you don't you don't need to have cds okay um another question just kind of came in do you have an example of the cds so if they went into your app demo would they see that no it's not in i do not but i i know that there is a there is a common data service um learning module within um the uh the learning path that i referenced and then there's also a ton of information on it's uh docs.microsoft.com and when you pull that up in in the upper right hand corner there's a search field and you can type in common data service and there's a ton of information there okay well i think we're at time for today um so that's all the time we have for q a um joe uh thank you today for presenting it was really great and i just want to thank everyone for attending on behalf of microsoft and joe and myself and we hope you have a really great ignite 2020. thank you nancy and thanks everybody for for coming out and listening to listen to my talk today greatly appreciate it take care hope you all have a great rest of your ignite
