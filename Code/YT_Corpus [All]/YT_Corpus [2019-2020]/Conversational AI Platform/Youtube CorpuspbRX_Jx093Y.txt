 hi I'm Raj Setlock president of Soho pork will draw upon my personal experience of nearly 30 years in the high-tech industry with companies of all sizes and our experience here at Soto I think you can use a lot of the strategies that I'm going to be talking about to help grow your business hi I'm talking about conversational AI in business today it's an exciting area actually the whole artificial intelligence machine learning area has been a hot topic but before I get deep into the definition and how it can be used in business let's talk about the precursor of AI assistants and that is chat BOTS many of us have probably interacted with a chat bot in the past whether it's dealing with businesses that you're conducting business with or even using them in your own business and so to visualize a chat bot essentially it's a chat type window where you're interacting with this chat bot and you're doing some predetermined flows so for example making a reservation or checking inventory or checking your account status so the chat bot accepts text or text-based requests it can process those and give you the information back but beyond that they're fairly limited you're not going to have a conversation with a chat bot it doesn't have the the robust natural language processing capabilities that an AI assistant actually has and so if you think about an AI assistant you think about the ability to interact with that assistant and have it do tasks for you and the big distinction is is that you have a much broader latitude to have conversations with an AI assistant as opposed to a chat bot if you go too far out of bounds with a chat bot it just simply won't know what you're talking about and won't return any meaningful kinds of results so with an AI assistant on the other hand you could actually get some meaningful work done by employing these software technologies and the good news is we're starting to see AI assistance in many of our critical business applications use you're seeing them in CRM customer relationship management tools you're seeing them in back-office applications like finance and ERP applications and so they're becoming widely used and really providing productivity gains for those that that are actually using these assistance so let's talk about in a little more detail how we can employ an assistant some of the examples of where they can help so I've listed a few from a sales perspective these assistants can be absolutely incredibly valuable so one of the things that salespeople struggle with is reaching potential customers on the phone now with an AI assistant as it learns the customer patterns and it understands more about your business it can give you deep insight such as when to call a particular customer so how does it find out when the best time or how does it know when the best time to call a particular customer well the AI assistant is basically scouring your data in the CRM in this case and trying to evaluate this this best time to call by looking at other data points when does this particular customer typically open emails when have they answered your call in the past these are all indicators that can be put together to form the best time to call so based on all this information it can come back and tell the sales rep the best time to call this particular customer is between 1:00 and 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon so great insight for a sales rep it keeps them very productive the other thing that is always a little bit cumbersome for people in business is to make sure that they're updating records in their applications I'll use the customer relationship management example again salespeople would rather be talking to customers closing business rather than updating records so if you could tell your assistant to update the records that's a huge productivity game for that particular sales rep and that's exactly what an AI assistant can do it can do this based on giving it a command via text or you can do that through voice and typically when you're talking about conversational AI you're talking about leveraging the voice capabilities or the natural language processing capabilities via voice let's give you some other examples that are found in some of these modern AI assistants dictating notes all of us would rather have somebody take notes for us right and in this case an AI assistant can do just that you can ask the assistant to take notes and put it in a particular customer record so that it's there for the future as well you can ask it to set up follow-up tasks set up calls to be done later any kind of thing that you would manually do your AI assistant can be trained to do as well running reports many of us spend a lot of time looking for data across our organization and pulling it together and either through Excel or some sort of a bi tool have to figure out how to collate the information and and get to the end result an AI assistant can do a lot of that for you again it starts to learn about your business it understands where data is stored and it can pull together the relevant information to give you the exact report that you're looking for in a very timely manner lastly some of the interesting things that are emerging in AI assistants is the ability to make some judgments about your business so one I alluded to earlier is the ability to kind of predict which customers may buy in the future and what products they may buy another angle on that is AI assistants are getting very good at sentiment analysis again they can go across your applications they can work in your CRM and understand who the customer is but they could also make connections with that same customer that is having an interaction with your customer support department and start to pick up on any sentiment that's that's coming out from these interactions they could also see emails and be able to distill out some frustration or anger that the customer is having and in turn the AI assistant can come back to a sales rep or a Customer Support Manager and say hey I think that we need to do some special outreach to this particular customer because they're pretty frustrated right now and there may be a possibility that they leave us based on their interactions that they're having so these are some examples of where any AI assistant can help I think it's it's really gonna transform the way we get business done and what I will finish with here is that when you're out looking for that fect assistant it may actually be in software and living as an AI assistant so take a look see where AI assistants are coming out in the applications that you're using and see how it can help you and be your number one assistant in your business thanks and we'll talk to you soon
