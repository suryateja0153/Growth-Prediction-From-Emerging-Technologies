 When you think of the information that patients need. Whether it be therapy information or plan coverage information or explanation around why something didn’t happen – to be able to get that very quickly through conversational AI – whether through chat, message or voice – without having to be on the phone waiting for a customer service rep to come on. This is a tremendous upside for customers within the healthcare and LS space. There is a growing trend among the younger generation, there is an expectation to have data at your fingertips and that’s only going to increase. What should also come as no surprise is nobody wants to pick up the phone. And certainly nobody wants to wait on hold. When it comes to actual patient data, for folk who are not dependent – they are above 18 and they are living within the same household, there will be restrictions that will be in place just based on the HIPPA privacy settings. So, conversational AI will need to be smart enough in its implementation to know who they are speaking to and who to grant access to. If  we can have them be more informed, then great. If we can have them be more intelligent before going into a doctor discussion, brilliant. If we can give them a sense of trust that the information they need they can get and understand in the moment, then we win because they’re better off.
