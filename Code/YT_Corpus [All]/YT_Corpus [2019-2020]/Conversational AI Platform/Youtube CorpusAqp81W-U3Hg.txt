 you we face you know high turnover with high turnover and that's natural for the industry that we're in the food industry when you face that you face having to hire in at a high volume 1 we have paperless onboarding so I think that's something that's you know very important but then when I built a team of recruiters I have a recruiting manager Sarah Smoot who you know really runs the team and is amazing and they would call every person coming in through our ATS system and we just started to really monitor their life and you know with their work-life balances and and so in there we just said hold on you know like we need more than just a phone call because sometimes they don't answer or when they're calling back it could be dinner for them things like that and so we you know reached out to text recruit which is the platform that we use to implement being able to reach out by text message there's two different ways that it can happen if it's just the recruiter if someone goes to jobs Domino's calm and applies and come and comes through our ATS system we capture their their phone numbers captured so we can and at its that's where we can reach out to them by text message and but then there's another way and this is where it goes beyond the recruiter and what we call Dottie and she's actually a robot as what I call her and text her crew it's there they call her or well they call it re but but this is where it's a robot that we had to train in a sense but and you'll see her it says text you know Dottie two nine seven two and one and as an applicant when you see that when you text it that's them engaging with the text and then it's an automatic response back and then two you can take it a step further where not only have we trained the robot or it's a chat box in a sense but you know how to respond my recruiters can also watch those conversations and they can click in and click out at any time one of the biggest when first looking at it I had you know talk to Tech's recruit and said you know I I just I don't think we're gonna be able to to do this but set you know who do you guys work with and they couldn't send me obviously certain details but who do you guys work with and they you know had plus you could look it up on their website so I started just doing my own research and going on there you know they had a guarantee of a thirty seven percent response rate and I thought that was low and so I said I just started in research and I said you know I think we can make this happen because what you would see is you would only see a piece of paper that said text whatever their key word was to that number but it would be sitting on a window next to the hours of operations or there was nothing that really grabbed your attention and so I said you know how can i I said I think we can figure this out so created a character her name is Dottie that's what we actually made our our key word is Tex Dottie and so we made her our official recruiter for the face of RPM pizza and so creating that marketing campaign plus you know print material social media whatever that is and getting the team trained up took about six months to do but about a month to implement and we I had three months to prove if if there was an ROI there and it proved itself in a month our results you know like I said the 37 percent response rate and coming in we were sitting at a 94 technically 92 but on average and 90 percent response rate which is unheard of for for any of their customers so our turnover started when I joined the company was at 200 percent so again I've been on a mission to to really you know figure out ways to change the culture and so and there's a lot of factors that go into that there's no one magic trick it's a it's a lot of magic but where this comes into play with turnover is that it sets the stage just like anything anyone would do when meeting someone they want to you know like they're gonna build a relationship with is that not only you know that this is its engaging it's quick its efficient and it's you know it's it's what they want and so that's where it starts it off and then what we do is it helps keep ourselves internally accountable for giving that same experience all the way through if they stayed with us for 30 more years one thing that it really helps you know Drive is knocking out you know applicants who don't fit our criteria and so you know something as simple as you know a teenager who wants to drive for us you know and they're not of age and so that question is in there and so what happens is that you know we might have a hundred people coming in and but we don't have Dottie is able to ask a certain you know a couple of questions and so maybe twenty drop off from there because maybe they weren't of age to drive right so then well we're dealing with eighty the recruiters are there doing a little bit of a pre-screen and so for the most part everyone actually you know will pass and it just the terms comes down to like backgrounds and things like that but so it makes it a lot more efficient and quicker in that way and with mass people also you can do campaigns with this system so I can or one of the recruiters can actually be talking to multiple people at one time and through the text messaging most of the times when they're doing that they're using the system on their computer it just seems to be a little bit easier for on their side but so that's also exciting being able to handle all of that you have to train her on keywords and and so I mean I don't think you could really create anything that just like you know someone's got to give it the information and the knowledge so so that's where you our recruiting team when you know we're when they were testing and things like that they were keeping up with what people were responding back with and and so we have a lot of we would call them bloopers where we go whoops and we would you know call tech soccer and go hey we've got to restructure these questions we've got a you know add in some more keywords and when these keywords are picked up here's the response back and so that's where there's a lot of training that you have to do but when it's going I mean it's that's not an every may be in the beginning it's more often but it's it it gets easier as time goes by you
