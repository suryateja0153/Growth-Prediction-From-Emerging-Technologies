 hello everyone uh real warm welcome to you in this session of microsoft ignite um today we are going to talk about introduction uh to power platform so um unless you are already aware i'd like to take a brief um the session will help you improve um your productivity and your organization's productivity by helping um and understanding the capabilities of microsoft power platform um automating the very basics of business processes with power automate um performing basic data analyses with power bi um so that you can produce business insights acting more effectively by creating simple power apps through canvas app experiences and making a very powerful chatbots without using any code so we have today with us uh joe cam he has got years of experience with microsoft and uh even more years of experience working uh in the finance segment specializing in capital markets so he brings the best of both worlds technology and domain and he will be walking us through to see how this amazing no code low code experience works for everyone over to you joe thanks very much for the introduction and thanks everybody uh for taking some time out of your your day your morning or your evening to spend a little bit of time with us so as shared my name is joe camp um this is a high level introduction to the power platform and there's a good we have a good bit of material to go through so we're going to jump right into the agenda and so this morning this afternoon this session we're going to talk about the components of power platform as we talk about those components uh we'll give you some business value of each of those and then we'll kind of wrap it up into a scenario type of discussion or a discussion um then we're going to share some our thoughts uh to help you um in your learning journey with respect to power platform as well as share some of those resources so jumping into the power platform as shared power platform is a microsoft's low code platform that spans across office 365 azure dynamics 365 and some standalone applications there are four main components within the microsoft power platform there's power bi which is the business analytics component power apps the application development platform component power automate which is process automation and then power virtual agents which is the intelligent virtual agents or the chat bot framework excuse me some of the some of the other pieces of power platform all up or ways that data and data sources get into the these four components and that's through data connectors which we'll talk about ai builder which really not gonna talk about too much we'll touch a little bit on ai and artificial intelligence but not a ton and then the common data service so power bi is the power platforms business analytics service that delivers insights for analyzing data it can share those insights through data visualization which makes reports and dashboards to enable fast and informed decisions power bi scales across the organization and it is has a built-in governance and security allowing businesses to focus on using data and not managing the data whether your data is a simple microsoft excel workbook or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses the power bi lets you easily connect to your data sources clean that data and then model your data without affecting the underlying source then you can visualize that data and using that visualization that helps you make a better and informed decision about your business power bi consists of a desktop and online software as a service component which is power bi service and a mobile power bi app that's available on phones as well as tablets and phones obviously works for ios as well as android devices excuse me the next component is powerapps and powerapps is microsoft's no code low code platform for building apps and this is built off of some knowledge that i'm going to assume that a lot of you already have and that's where and that's your ability to build functions and formulas within excel that skill set absolutely transitions well into the ability to build power apps you can use powerapps to build simple solutions like a vehicle and inspection form status report or complex business solutions for purchase a purchasing process and or even inventory management with power apps you have choices on where and how your data is stored some common data sources include the common data service which is something that we'll talk about in a little bit sharepoint sharepoint online dynamics 365 sql and excel online additionally you can connect your app to over 325 connected data sources powerapps easily supports multiple data connections allowing you to bring data together from many platforms into a single app and lastly powerapps has democratized artificial intelligence by providing a wizard-based interface for building and training an ai model which unlocks the power of azure machine learning and cognitive services now in the context of this conversation and the the level we're really not going to go into any detail on machine learning nor cognitive services but if you have an interest in those two topics i encourage you to go to microsoft learn because i know that there's a bunch of information there about these the third component is the is power automate empower automate lets users create automated workflows between applications and services it helps automate repetitive business processes such as communication data collections and decision approvals not only for the individual user power automate allows for the creation of enterprise grade process automation power automates simple interface allows every level of user to automate work work tasks from beginners to seasoned developers a few examples of power automate are the automation or automating of repetitive tasks like moving data from one system to another or guiding a user through a process so they can complete uh different stages an example of this would be the onboarding process of a new employee to to your organization or to your business and then purchase order approval automation is another example the fourth component um at the higher level is the power virtual agents and as i referenced earlier power virtual agents is microsoft's low code no code pot framework power virtual agents enables anyone to create powerful chat bots using a guided no code graphical interface without the need for data scientists nor developers power virtual agents addresses many of the major issues with chatbot building eliminates the gap between the subject matter experts and the development teams building those chat bots and removes the complexity and excuse me complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of conversational ai and the need to write complex code power virtual agents empowers subject matter experts to build and maintain their own uh conversational solutions i think a great a great example of power virtual agents is you can you can with the power virtual agents uh platform you can embed that into your website of your business website and you can see questions or frequently asked questions from your customer service team 10 12 15 questions whatever the number is you're comfortable with as well as answers such that when a customer comes to your website there's this pretty organic exchange between the customer and the chat bot um if the chat bot gets it's a question excuse me that it's not able to answer and that is it's not part of the the um the questions that are already within the data set for the power agent that can trigger a power automate notification to a live agent and within that power automated trigger notification the live agent will receive the history of that conversation between the power virtual agent and chatbot and the customer such that the power agent now has a history of what's what's been uh what's been asked and then can then talk directly to the customer seamlessly um without losing any of that without any of that history and that will create and i think a pretty good customer experience excuse me sip of water here now i talked earlier about the comet data service and the common data service is that is a cloud-based solution that easily structures a variety of data and business logic to support interconnected applications and processes in a secure and compliant manner managed and maintained by microsoft the common data service is available globally but deployed geographically to comply with your data your potential data residency it is not designed for standalone use on your servers a few attributes of the common data service include the ability to handle authentication through azure active directory allowing for conditional access as well as multi-factor authentication allows for you to easily apply data logic at the data or a business logic at the data level offers you to the the control to shape your data allowing you to discover model validate and report on your data excuse me and stores your physical data in the azure cloud pardon me so the power and this is pardon the pun but the power of power platform is its ability to leverage data across many platforms to do this components of the power platform use data connectors you can think of a data connector as a bridge from your data source to your app or workflow which allows information to be conveyed back and forth connectors allow you or data connectors allow you to extend your business solutions across platforms and add functionality for your users and the power platform and i think i referenced this earlier has over 325 data connectors now with that said you do have the ability to create your own custom connectors and this will allow you to connect your app by calling a publicly available api or custom api you're hosting in a cloud provider connectors work by sending information back and forth across these apis and gathering available functions into power apps and or power automate now the data sources for these connectors are two-fold one uh our first are a tabular data and a tabular data source is one that returns data in a structured table format and this is fantastic for for powerapps because powerapps can read this directly and display these tables through galleries forms and other controls and galleries forms and and and controls uh is part of the power platform um studio and when you learn a little bit more about power not power platform the power app studio and when you go into a little more detail and learn a little bit more you'll see what i mean by galleries and informs and that's all again all related to power apps additionally with the data source um powerapps can create edit and delete data from these data sources so examples of data sources tabular data sources are common data service sharepoint excel and sql server now function based data source is one that uses functions to interact with the data source these functions can be used to return a table of data but offer more extensive actions such as the ability to send an email update permissions or create a calendar event examples of function based data include office 365 users so the users within your office 365 subscription project online and if you're leveraging azure azure blob storage now there's two main components of a connector of a data connector there's a trigger and then there's actions triggers are really only used as part of a power automate and a trigger prompts an out power automate flow to begin triggers can be timed based such as a flow or a power atomic flow which begins every day at a specific time say for example you want to pull data every morning you need to pull data from one system to another you can build out a power automate that directs that data to be transferred to another system at a specific time every day or a trigger is based off of an action by creating a new record such as creating a new record in a table or receiving an email actions are used in both power automate and power apps actions are prompted by the by a user or a trigger and allow interaction with your data source by some function for example an action would be sending an email to your workflow or app or writing a new line in a data source now pulling all of this together so we've talked about the varying components of power platform all up so how what's a great scenario as to how all this works um and i think i think a good scenario is something like this you have a business within your business you have an i.t department and the i.t department offers equipment to your employees to kind of check out for like an event and the process is the current process fictitiously is the employee such as myself walks down to the it department says hey i need this piece of equipment for this event that's going to happen next week um do you have it and can i check it out uh you the the i.t department will say yeah you need to fill out this form submit the form uh the it department has to go back into inventory to figure out if they want to have the have the uh have the piece of equipment they need to share user instructions to me so that i properly use to use the equipment three days four days down the road i've used this piece of equipment my event is over but i have neglected to share that or send that check that back in to the i.t department so the it department's having to track me down and send me an email saying hey joe you need to get this back it's a very laborious not a very efficient way to run some sort of inventory management what power platform does for you is you can within powerapps you can build an app that includes all the equipment that's available the status of that equipment whether it's available in inventory or not and then maybe some use use instructions for for the person who's checking it out so as an example i can take excuse me i can take i can open up my power app [Music] at my desk or on my laptop and click out click a couple of buttons submit that to the i t department the it department now knows through a power automated email that i need this piece of equipment they confirm that they have it they send an email back to me says yes come they say yes come at five o'clock today you can pick it up i walk down pick up my uh pick up my equipment um i have say four days to to use that piece of equipment that i need then i need to return it on the end of the fourth day automatically uh through power automate i get an email it says joe you need to this is a reminder you need to return this piece of equipment now this is creating a ton of data and you can take that data and you can put it in a power bi and then you can build some reporting and that reporting can include what type of equipment is being used most often what departments are using what equipment [Music] are people [Music] being good corporate citizens and returning the equipment in a timely manner and then taking that data you can then build out budgetary needs for you as an inventory manager you can have conversations with departments about some poor behavior from some of their employees as somebody who was an inventory manager in an old role this would have been fantastic for me from a bet a planning perspective and from a budgetary perspective so that's kind of a high level easy scenario of what power platform can do for you so now what i'd like to do is just kind of walk through some of the things that we would love for you all to follow through with and as part of your learning of power platform and specifically we've we what we'd love to do is give you some give you a bunch of information to go home with as homework with the idea that you consider sitting for and taking the power platform fundamental certification exam the benefit to you in taking this exam is when you when you pass you have this skill set on your resume and you have um something that says yes microsoft based off of this based off of the fact that you have taken this exam and passed this exam microsoft is acknowledging your understanding of the fundamentals of the power platform so to get to that point the skills required are the business value of power platform which we've talked about the core components of power platform which we've talked about and then the business value of each of these components power bi power apps power automate uh power virtual agent which is unfortunately not within this slide and so now the question is alright joe well this is great but how do i get additional information or how do i learn more and from microsoft's perspective there are a couple of different ways through microsoft learn um we've built a um learning path that's uh in this case it's a microsoft power platform fundamentals learning path this is uh eight modules of learning that go into deeper detail on the components that we discussed as well as provide opportunities for you to build your own app there's a step-by-step building your own app there's step-by-step power automate as well as building a uh power bi dashboard this is actually something that i've gone through myself as part of an onboarding process i've been on the team for two months so this was a great tool to help me if you would rather do instructor-led learning we do work with partners that offer instructor-led training and i'll give you a link to that in just a minute um to that information and then this is just this is just to highlight the the power the certification and the power platform fundamentals certification so this is the this is in my opinion one of the one of the important slides of the deck uh and uh the first the first bullet point is the power and i would ask that you take a screenshot of this the um the first bullet point is the learning path the link linked to the learning path which i just referenced if you want to do more instructor-led type of training you can go to the second bullet point the third bullet point um is a landing page for the fundamentals uh the power power platform fundamentals uh certification there's a ton of information there and then these last two bullet points one is the powerapp test environment this is a this is an article that i wrote um that um walks you through how to build out your own test environment for power apps power platform and it's through the microsoft 365 uh developer program step by step relatively easy this is actually what i use for my test environment and then lastly is a uh my first power app demo and this is step by step uh process on the first power app that i ever built and it's it's a kind of a quick and easy inventory management type of tool but i think it's pretty good i'm a little biased so that's really the content for um this talk i have been asked to bring up this slide which i think most of you all have seen in other sessions the ignite skills uh cloud skills challenge this is an opportunity for you to take some uh take some learning and based off of based off your interaction you have an opportunity to get a voucher for a free exam so i think with that um my my content's done um i don't know if there's some questions in the queue [Music] but nippon i'd kind the first question that i have here for you is what is the difference between a logic app and or our automate sorry i think it's a pretty common one so what's your take on that yeah so that's a great question i've actually had that question in in previous sessions so um this is my understanding the difference between logic apps and power apps and logic or excuse me power automate so um logic apps is a great way to tie the different services within azure together power automate and is a great way to leverage um other services such as sharepoint um twitter and some third-party connectors so there's this kind of internal component with respect to azure and logic apps and then this little more external component facing of power automate and some of the other tools out there hopefully that answers your question right right definitely i think it does add more clarity um the second one that we can take since you have time is uh what exactly is the difference between the fundamentals and the role-based certifications and do you have a guidance for which one to take when um so with that question i think from my perspective a fundamentals is kind of an entry level um certification and will help you with um kind of the overall business value of in this case uh power platform uh role based i think is a little more in depth a little more technical and i think a little more functional with respect to with respect to in this case powerapps so my feeling is personal feeling is that if you're new to this space go through the powerapps fundamental microsoft learn learning path take that pl 900 class take that pl 900 um exam which is the powerapps uh or excuse me power platform fundamentals and that and then build off of that and then go into more role-based certifications got it got it so okay here's what i understood of this session joe first of all it was awesome super clear uh for someone like me who has got a limited coding experience i feel a bit more empowered than when i entered the session um so i will summarize from what i have learned is that uh power platform essentially comprises of four broad categories the power apps the power automate the power bi and is that all or the power agents sorry the newest edition there you go so uh i'm learning learning slowly but steadily so um all of these helps people with no coding experience to build uh applications for the business and to build boards to build dashboards etc and i think uh this this is really great start for my own journey i i do believe that others like me on the call would benefit from it as well and i really hope uh that uh you have a great great ignite experience too i really hope that everyone who joined us today uh had a great experience as well and um best of luck for your learning journey uh hope to see you soon bye-bye yeah thanks yeah thanks very much i greatly appreciate it thanks everybody for for tuning in and and hope the remainder of your tonight your ignite experience is a fruitful one thanks again everybody awesome thank you everyone bye
