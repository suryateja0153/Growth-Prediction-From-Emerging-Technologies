 from the silicon angle media office in Boston Massachusetts it's the queue now here's your host David on tape hello everyone and welcome to this exclusive cube conversation here's the setup the storage industry has been drowning in complexity for years companies like pure storage and Nutanix you know they reached escape velocity last decade primarily because they really understood well how to deliver great products that were simpler to use but as we enter the 2020s virtually every player in the storage business is trying to simplify its portfolio and the mandate is coming from customers that are under huge pressure to operationalize and bring to market their major digital initiatives they simply can't spend time managing infrastructure that the way they used to they have to reallocate resources up the stack so to speak toward more strategic efforts now as you know post the acquisition of EMC by Dell we have followed closely and been reporting on their efforts to manage the simplification of the storage portfolio under the leadership of Jeff Clark iBM is one of those leading companies along with Dell EMC NetApp and HPE that are under tremendous pressure to continue to simplify their respective portfolios IBM as a company has declared the dawn of a new era they call it chapter 2 of digital and AI which the company claims is all about scaling and moving from experimentation to transformation chapter 2 I will tell you one questionably is not about humans managing complex storage infrastructure under the leadership of general manager Ed Walsh the company's storage division has aligned with this chapter to vision and the cube has been able to secure an exclusive interview with edy who joins me today great to see you Mai thank you very much for having me so you're very welcome you mean you heard my my narrative how did we get here how did the industry get so complex I'd like the way it kicked it off because I think you nailed it but it's it's just half the storage industry always been and there's a reason for it 20 years ago but it's almost it's run its course and we can tell you what we're announcing but everyone there's always a difference between high-end solution sets and low-end solution sets in fact they're different there's custom silicon on the high end so think about EMC symmetric sand the day it was the ultimate custom hardware and software combination and then the low-end storage well it didn't have any of that and then there's a mid tier but we actually everything's based upon do so think about you know you need the right availability the right price ports feature function availability features it made sense that you had to have that unique thing so what's happened is we're all doing you know sustaining innovation so we're all coming out the next high-end array for you EMC is the next one is hash tag next-generation storage right a mid-range so they're gonna do redo their mid range and then low-end but they never come together but this is where the complexity you're nailing it so no one's a high end or low end shop they're they basically used at all but what they're having to do is they have to manage and understand each one of those platforms how to maintain it it's kind of specialized how to report on it how to automate it each the automation requirements are different but then different API is to actually automate it now the minute you want to say okay now help me modernize that and bring me to a hybrid multi-cloud now you're doing a kind of complex thing over multiple ways and it cuts different platforms which are all completely different so and now the key thing is in the past it made sense to have high end silicon with high end software and it made sense and different low end and basically because of the some of the innovation we've driven no longer do you have to do that there's one platform that allows you to have one platform meet those different requirements and dramatically simplify what you do Enterprise so we're gonna talk a little bit more about what you guys are announcing but how do you know when you get there to this land of simple yeah one it's hard to get there we didn't talk about that too but it's one client so we just had a call this morning with our boredom advisor for storage or division and they're kind of the bigs of the big Zepa to be more on the high-end side but just so you know the sample size but literally in the discussion of we're talking about the platform the simplification how do you get to you know hybrid cloud what we're gonna do on the cyber incident response type of capabilities high Brazilian say and literally in the call they're already emailing their team saying we need to do something more strategic we need to do that we need to look at this holistically they love the simplicity everything we just went through there they can't do any more especially in Chapter two it's about modernizing your existing mission-critical enterprises and then put them in a context of hybrid multi cloud that's hard you can't do with all these different platforms so they're looking for let me spend less you said to free my team to do up stack things they definitely want don't want to be managing different disparate storage organizations they want to move forward and use that free up a resource to do other things so when I see big companies just literally jumping at it and giving an example I've you know we talk about the cyber resiliency thing I've had for those this week that's exactly what we need to have done so it's just reason it just I haven't had a conversation yet that clients aren't actually really excited about this and it's actually pretty straightforward so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt again we'll get there but assuming assuming you're there why do you think it took so long and we kind of mentioned it's hard but yeah so transformations are never easy and typically whoever trend is the transformation agent gets shot in the back of the head right so it's really hard to get teams to do something different so imagine every platform EMC has nine now right so through it is through acquisition or others you have VPS you have you know VP of development offering and maybe sales but then you have whole teams are your founders you've acquired right so you have real people that are they love their platform and there's no way they're gonna give it up they always come out with a next-generation and how it's gonna solve all ills but just it's a people transformation how do you get you know we're gonna take three and say hey it's one platform now to do that it's an operational transformation challenge it's actually driving the strategy you don't do it in a matter of you know a week there's development to make sure that you can actually meet all the different use cases that will take you literally years to do and have a new platform but I think it's just hard to do now anyone that's gonna do that let's say you know EMC or HP wants to do it they're gonna do the same thing we did which is going to take them years of development but also its meaning and managing the transition and the people involved or the founders you've acquired or it just it's amazing in fact that's the most wonderful part of my job it's dealing with people but it's it can frustrating so we've seen this over the years where I mean look at NetApp with waffle it was one size fits all for years but they just couldn't cover all markets and then they were faced with Tam expansion of course now the portfolio expense do you think I say of three and that you know and and and and David Scott at HP II used or HP at the time used to talk about how complex AMC's portfolio was and you see HP has to expand its portfolio we all did including IBM do you think pur will have to face the same sort of well you are seeing here with three right and then that's without the file so I'm just some of what we do for physical virtual and container workloads and cloud right so if you start going into what we're going to do its Gala object we all have our own there too so and I'm not even counting the three to get to that so you'll see pure doing the exact same thing because they're trying to expand their Tam and you have to do some basic innovation to have a platform actually meet the requirements of the high-end requirements the mid-range and the entry level requirements it's not just saying I'm gonna have one you actually have to do a lot of development to do it alright let's get to the news all right what are you guys announcing so basically we're announcing a brand new were a dramatic simplification of our distribute storage so everything for nons age so if you're doing physical boxes bare metal Linux you do in virtual environments VMware hyper-v power VM are you doing container workloads or into the cloud our platforms are now one it's gonna be one software one API to manage but we're gonna actually with we're gonna do simplification without compromise we're gonna give you what you need you're gonna need an entry level packaging mid-range and high-end bus could be one software allows you to meet every single price requirement and functionality and we gave you some what I'll say is a surprises on the upside before what we're bringing out to you because we believe in value innovation I think we can up the value or bring their clients but also dramatically take out the cost complexity but one thing we're getting rid of is saying the need the requirement to have a different harder software platform for high-end mid-range and low-end it's one hardware and software platform that gets you across although those and that's where you get a dramatic simplification so CMOS CMOS so normally what you do you would optimize the code for the high-end mid-range and low-end what why are you able to address all three with one OS how are you able to do that took us three and F years so there's actually if so I'll talk about a couple innovation pieces right so on the high end you have customized silicon we do everyone does so we had a Texas memory systems acquisition it was a flash short to you about three hundred seventy five terabytes uncompressed II do pretty big chunky you had to buy big chunks so it's on the high end that was the unit of granularity right so but it gave you great value but also you had a great performance latency better than you've been nvme today before nvme but you get in line compression encryption so it's wonderful but it was really ultra high end what we did is we took that great custom silicon and we actually made it onto what looks like a custom or to be a standard nvme SSD so you take a samsung nvme or WD and you compare it to what we would call a flash core module they look the same and they go and interchangeably into the same nvme standard slot but what's in there is the same silicon that was on this ultra high-end box so we can give the high-end exactly what we gave them before ultra-low latency better than nvm a but also you get in line compression deduplication level but we can take the same and VM a drive and we can put it into our lowest end model you know an average sale price $15,000 it allows you to literally not no compromise on the high end but have unbelievable surprises on the mid-range and low end where now we can get the latencies and the performance and all those benefits on to be honest so much lower box it's the same functionality in focus e you lose nothing now that took a lot of work that wasn't easy you talk about people there was you know roadmaps that had to be changed or you had to know that we're gonna do that and stick to our guns but that would be one other things is you're gonna get some things on the upside that you're not expecting right so because this custom silicon I'm gonna have unique price performance but also cost advantages so I'm gonna have best price performance or density across the whole proc line but also I'm going to do things like on the high end you used to unbelievable operational say right so to cite three cite hyper swap you know I know it's two boxes act like one have a whole outage or a site outage and you don't literally miss a transaction or multi sites so but we're gonna able do that on the low end and the mid-range as well cyber resiliency is a big deal so I talked about operational resiliency it's very different coming back when it's cyber but cyber incident response becomes key and it's so we're gonna give you a special capabilities there which are not available for anyone in the industry but it's cyber Incident Response only a high-end thing or is it a low-end thing no it's it's across everywhere right so so I think we're gonna shock on the upside but a lot of it was the development to make sure the code stack but also the hardware we could lease a no compromise you want an entry level I'm gonna meet anyone at that moat in fact uh because the features of it I'm able to compete in an unfair level against everyone on the low end same thing mid-range and high end but you're not losing anything because you're losing the cuz of silicon so let's come back to the cyber piece what exactly is that okay so listen this is not for data breaches where you have to put you know so if a data breach happens they steal your database or they steal your customer names you have to report you know to the press you have to let people know but it's typically they don't call the storage guy and say hey solve it it was stolen at a different level now the one thing is that doesn't hit the media but happens all the time actually more more frequently and it definitely gets called down to the operation team or the storage team is for cyber or malicious code all right they've locked up your system though they didn't steal data so it's not something if the report so what happens is call comes down and you don't know when they got yeah yeah so it's an iterative process you have to literally find the box bring up maybe it's Wednesday bring it up give it to application group know it's there bring up Tuesday it's an iterative process right it's real for oil 100 years ago no drill another hole so what happens is you know if it's cyber if without the right tools you use your backup but it one of my border advisors Lilly major bank you know I had four of those I'll give you one it took me thirty three hours to bring back a box it was a large database 30 terabytes 33 hours now why is you back why didn't he use his primary stores against dr copies everything well they'd have the right tool sets so what were able do is tape is great because it's air gap but it takes time to restore and come back by running the the modern data protection like we have or v Mirko he steel i‰Ùs the recovery being faster because you're mounting backup copies faster but the fastest is your primary snapshots and your replicated dr snapshots and if you can leverage those but the reason people don't leverage it and we came upon this almost accidentally we're seeing what our gr services brethren IBM doing from IBM s o searching outsourcing or GTS when they did have a hit and what they want to do is bring up your snapshots but if you bring up a snapshot and you're not really careful you start crashing production workloads because it looks like the VM that just came up so you need to have and we're providing this software allows you to visualize what your recovery points are allow you to orchestrate bring it up environments but more importantly orchestrate it into a fence network environment so it's not gonna step on production workloads and addresses but allows you to do that and provide a URL to the different business users that they can come and say yep it's there it's not so even if you don't use a software before this incident it gives you visibility orchestration and the more importantly a fence a safe fence network at a sandbox to bring these up quickly and check it out in an easy promote to production so that's your safe zone safe zone and it's just not there so you know you start bringing up snapshots and now it's not like a dr case where you're just bringing things up it's like you have to be really smart cuz you bring it up and checking it out so without that they don't want to trust to use a snapshot so they just don't use primary storage with it it becomes the first thing you do because you hope you've got it within a week or we can have your snapshots if it's in the environment for 90 days now you're going to tape now if you do this if you put this software in place before an instant now you get more values you could do orchestrated dr testing you can because we're doing this orchestrated bring up application says it's not a vm it's a sets of VMs fence network bring it up does it work you can use it for test dev data you can use the Virata make dr but even if you don't set it up we're gonna make it available you can actually come back from these cyber resilience these cyber incidents much faster and this is a capability I get on primary storage because everybody's targeting you know the backup corpus for ransomware and things of that nature this is primary storage and we do it in our backup so our backup allows you to do exact same thing and do the bootable copies right and so if you have our backup product you could already do this on primer but what we're saying is regardless of who you're using because you're we're still saying you need to do backup you air-gap your backup because like wanna cry was in environments for 90 days you know your snapshots only for a week or two so the fact matters you need it but in this case if you're using what the other guys you can also we're gonna give it just for this tool set is um how does it ability there's a factor I know like forgetting for instance AWS and reinvent I think announced an immutability and we use that yeah I think IBM may have that because of the acquisition that you guys made years ago I think clever safer fundamental to that their architecture is that it is that a way to to combat yeah ransomware so this helps so mu Billy allows you not to changes so ransomware and you know malware typically is either encrypting or deleting things encrypting is what they do but they have the key so the fact that matters are deleting things so if it's immutable you can't change it now if you don't the right controls you can delete it but there can't change it they can't encrypt it on you so that becomes critical so what you're looking for is we do like for instance Oliver this flash system laws you do these snapshots lokor modes that allow you have and go to immutable copies either in Amazon we just for that or locally on our object storage or in IBM's cloud does allows it do that so the different platforms have this immutability that our software allows you to integrate with so I think immutability is kind of critical how about consumption models the way in which your packaging and pricing people want to the cloud is sort of changed the way we think about this however you responded to that so you hit upon our chapter 2 we IBM in actually resonators a client says chapter 1 we're doing some lift and chef than we were doing some new use cases in the cloud and and they had some challenges but it worked in general but we're seeing the next phase 2 is really now looking at the 80% of your key workloads your mission for Gork loads and basically how you transfer those in so so as your basic if you look at it's your chapter two but you're gonna do the modernization and you might move those into the cloud so if you're gonna move in the cloud they'll say well I like to modernize or storage free my team up because it's simple I don't have to do a lot of things but you need to simplify so you can now you know modernize so you can transform but I'm gonna be in the cloud in eighteen months so I don't want to modernize my storage so what we have is of course we have you can buy things you can lease things we have a utility model this is great to three to five years but we have now a subscription model which think of just cloud pricing no longer commitments use what you use up and down and if it goes a zero Carlos will pick it up and there's no expense to you so no long-term commitments in return so in fourteen months I've done my moderation you help me free up my team let me go and then we'll come up and pick it up and your bill stop that day cancel anytime thank you said time do you expect people to take advantage of that I mean there's a ton of demand at this point in time I think everyone's on their own cloud journey so we talked a lot about meeting the client where they are at right so how do I meet them where they're at and everyone's on their own journey right so a lot of people are saying hey why would I do anything here I need to get there but if they can modernize and simplify what they're doing it again this is our your mission-critical it we're not talking to you these are your how you're running your business if you can make it work better in the meantime and then modernize that get it to containers get it to a new platform that makes all the sense in a world and because if we can give them a flexible way to say it's cheaper than using cloud storage like an Amazon or IBM cloud but you can use the unprimed for you up and then anytime just return it I that's a big value that people say you know what you're right I'm gonna go do that you're able to give me cloud-based pricing down to zero when I'm done with it and now I can use that to free up my team that's the value equation I don't think it's for everyone but I think first segment of the market I think it's critical and I think IBM's kind of like perfectly positioned to do it with a balance sheet to help clients out so how do you feel about this I mean obviously put a lot of work into it you seem pretty excited you feel as though this is gonna sort of hell reenergize your your your business your customer base and how do you think competitors are gonna respond a good question so so I think simplification especially if you get where you talk about value equation I think I can add more value to you mr. customer I can I can bring things you're not expecting right and we'll get to this cyber in a second that'll be one of the things they're not expecting and reduce the cost of complexity so we've already done this a couple times so we did it with our mainframe stores launched in the fall if bar none the best box for that workload lowest latency most integration encryption pervasive encryption and Chrisman flights but also we took it from nine variants it's a two because we could and people why did you need all those well there was reasons for it in the past but no longer we also got rid of all the hard disk drives we also add a little non-volatile cache and allowed you to get rid of all these battery backups all these custom things that you used to have in his high-end bucks and now it's dramatically simple better Boeing no one asks hey where do my other seven variants went it was simpler it was better faster but then it was a best launch we've had in the history of the proc line so I think it's we can add better value and simplify for our clients so that what we do you asked about how people respond I listen they're gonna have to go through the same thing we did write a product line has people behind it and it's really hard right or a founder behind it right you mentioned a couple they're acquiring companies I think they're gonna have to go this it's a transformational journey that they're gonna have to go through it's not as simple as doing a PowerPoint I couldn't come to you say I can simplify without compromise that can help you on the low end mid range high end with same platform unless they did a lot of fun and mental design work to make sure I could do that flash core modules being one of them right so I think it's gonna be hard it'll be interesting well there you have to go through the same thing I did how about that usually usually when you make a major release like this you're able to claim top gun' least for a while and things like latency and bandwidth and I ops and performance are you able to make that claim so in fact you'll see a basically you saw in the launch day but basically saw the latency which is one because we're bringing a custom silicon down our latency you'll see like I'll give you pure bragging and the websites there Louis latency is 70 microseconds which probably is pretty you know it's me 150 microseconds pretty good right it's good bragging rights we're at 70 microseconds but that's on there X 90 using storage class memory so Lily we're 2x faster than on lazy how fast you can respond to something but we can do it not only on a high-end box but we can also do it on our average sale price $15,000 box because I'm bringing that silicon up and down so we can do the latency now EMC the highest and power max box right though to big to big jassi's put together that can do a hundred microseconds against till we're seventy microseconds so we're 30% faster and that's the epitomised of the high-end custom silicon in software so latency we got it I ops right so look at the biggest baddest two boxes of EMC they'll do you know 15 million I ops on their website will do 18 million but instead two racks it's eight you I mean it is 12x better I ops per rack space if you want to look at that way throughput which if you're gonna do you know it's all about building smarter businesses its its journey to cloud and building a smart business is everyone's trying to do this throughput in analytics becomes everything and you can do analytics and everything your DBA is I've gotta run analytics so through foot matters ours is for every one of our boxes that you can kind of add up and cluster out it's 45 gigabytes a second pure for instance they're bragging rights is 18 and they can't cluster get anymore so what were you will do is on any of it and most of their high end but I'll say I can do the same thing up and down my line because of where I'm bringing the custom silicon so on bragging rights and that's just a kind of website big bragging rights I think we got it cold and then if you look at price performance and just overall price per capacity we're in line to be the most cost effective across to everybody up and down the line is very interesting it's kind of its unique and then you mentioned the resiliency I'll tell you that's the hottest thing right so you mentioned the cyber incident response so that is something that's just we did on the mainframe so we did that last mainframe cycle we allow you do the same thing and it really drove all the demand for the product sets it's already the number one thing people want to talk about because it becomes a you're right I needed that this week I needed it last so I think that's gonna really drive demand so what worries you well on this lunch not much I think it's how fast and far we can get this message out right so okay so execution obviously so you feel pretty confident about that and then yeah getting the word out letting people know well congratulations it No thank you very much reciate it appreciate coming in and thank you for watching everybody this is Dave Volante for the cube we'll see you next time
