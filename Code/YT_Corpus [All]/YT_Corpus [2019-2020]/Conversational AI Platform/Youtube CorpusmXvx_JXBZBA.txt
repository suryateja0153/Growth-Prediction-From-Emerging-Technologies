 [Music] hi and welcome to episode 195 of the weekly Google cloud platform podcast I'm mark and I'm here with my colleague and new host Priyanka hey Priyanka hi how are you doing I am super excited to be part of Google cloud toss cause from now on absolutely and I know you have been not just a host but also a guest on an episode previously but now you'll be joining us as a host as well yes it's super awesome and of course in our interview today you and I got a chance to sit down with Kathy and Jessica about some best practices for conversation AI they're both Googlers here and they kind of work on different teams but it's really cool to hear the different perspectives on what's important and how do you design good conversation systems yeah and the more exciting part is Jessica brings the developer perspective and then Kathy brings her conversational design experience from over the years of building IVRS and then moving into building conversational designs so I'm super excited for them to be here so it's a lot of fun but we also have a cool question of the week I saw that you put out a blog post about how do you integrate dialogue flow and bigquery those are two very different tools yeah yeah so we're gonna be getting into what that looks like a little bit later but before we do that let's talk about our cool things of the week [Applause] yeah so I had something cool I read this blog post that promised Korean himself had published out on Google and Mayo Clinic's new revolutionary partnership in terms of AI in healthcare and it's really exciting to see how we are able to take the AI innovations that we do at Google and apply them to some of the practical applications like the patient experience clinical experience and then diagnostic and even research so there's going to be some more stuff as a part of this partnership coming up which will be a combination of the security and the compliance that Google Cloud offers in the platform combining with the infrastructure so check out the blog post but in general it seems to be a very exciting venture where we're going to explore possibilities in healthcare with the Google cloud platform yeah it's always super cool to hear about different companies that are using GCP but I think a lot of it like you mentioned is really based on what the technologies are enabling them to do and then kind of all the cool research and future potential that comes out of that yeah pretty exciting super super cool well I actually have two cool things of the week the first one is some really really big memory optimized virtual machines and when I say big I mean big because apparently and this is news these are six and twelve terabyte memory virtual machines Wow which just blows my mind in every possible way because I remember the day of trying to get my hands on like 256 Meg chips putting them into an old desktop computer probably cutting myself on the ram one too many times so to think about the scale of how it's changed from back in the day all the way to these 12 terabytes of memory I mean it's astonishing yeah the blog post is talking a little bit about how these are certified for SA P Hana and using it for those types of workloads but I guess you can probably just use them for any other application that might need 12 terabytes of memory to run yeah this is some cool exciting yourself that's the kind of stuff that I think that when customers come up and they see oh look you know we have these hideous technology or these tools available that's when they can say well we're really good at our subject matter what can we do with these new tools what can we find out things and just like Mayo Clinic I think there's some cool opportunities there yep what was your second cool thing of the week my second cool thing of the week is a great little educational hands-on lab actually it's a quest so it's a full set of videos and labs and then a little quiz at the end all called understanding your GCP costs so I've been working on this for a while I've talked about it in a couple of the previous podcast episodes and you can also see these videos on the Google cloud platform YouTube channel but it's kind of a good starting place to look at understanding your GCP costs right I mean it's incredibly important to understand what tools are available for you to measure your costs and then starting with this quest and then the you know the next content that I'll be coming out it gives you a little bit more hands-on guidance for how to actually control your costs so things you can put into place there's a bunch of different discount tools like sustains use discounts committed use discounts but then also like identifying resources that you're not using and then putting budgets and quotas into place so you can control it it's actually really super cool because when you think about it I think a lot of people just kind of you know use the cloud they use the machines they go for it and then they're like okay well pay X amount well as you get to be a big business that doesn't make as much sense you know you need to plant you need control your cost effectively so this is a really cool way to start with that and I wanted to tease out that there is a code I don't know how long it'll last for so you know if it doesn't work ping me or something we'll figure something out but there's a code 1q - costs six to six so I'm sure that I'll be in the description of the show notes but if you use that you can get the labs part for free so quick labs I think normally has credits that you need to do the labs and this will let you bypass that you know I really really recommend it for people - especially people who are in finance to get a better grasp on what the cost controls are but I think this is introductory level enough that everyone maybe should look at getting a baseline understanding of where those costs are coming from and how to analyze them so that they can kind of tackle the cloud a lot more responsibly do you also a little bit about maybe like how do I set up my organizations so the costs are properly limited and stuff in that video series that you talked about earlier absolutely so there's a video or two on a resource hierarchy and organizations and again these are things that you know the average individual user someone who's not either using it as part of a business or as part of a small business may not run into but especially for large businesses and enterprises and so forth the organization is a very very important part of how you structure your Google cloud platform resources and learning about that can be really really handy for scaling out yeah I remember those questions coming up a lot with enterprise customers that I spoke with so I think it's amazing to have that resource and we'll make sure that the link for the videos go in the description absolutely well with all that cool stuff out of the way let's get right into our interview with Kathy and Jessica [Music] Kathy Jessica thanks so much for joining us today first things first tell us who you are and what you do yeah so I am head of conversation design outreach here at Google and basically that means I talk a lot about conversation design what it is and try to bring awareness so thank you so much I'm a developer advocate for actions on Google which means I could have built a lot of voice applications and through that I build a lot of content from the learnings that I get so we could teach other third-party developers how to build for Google assistant and then with that I also get all the feedback from developers on what goes great and what goes not so great and bring that bar so the product teams we can make it better gotcha so first things first Kathy what is conversation design right you mentioned that you kind of focus on that I don't know what that is that is an excellent question that I'm asked many times basically you can think of it as we are trying to teach computers to communicate like humans and not the other way around so basically rather than have you learned some complex way of either speaking or typing or tapping or swiping we'd rather leverage how humans have been speaking for what 150,000 years and make it that much easier to get things done get the information you need just the way you're naturally used to doing and so we want to work in the world where we're thinking about how humans communicate and then applying that within the technical constraints that exist today so I have a question about that so I think we we got the definition of how to work with conversation design but Jessica I have this question for you is this any different than how we interact with maybe say apps or websites and do developers have to do something specific when they develop for voice no definitely developing for voice is very different than something with a GUI because there's all control as a developer when you have a GUI there's only so many buttons a user could push first is a conversation at any point someone could say anything and you're supposed to support the user through that and it's not just necessarily that they could see anything at any time because most people would have learned from Kathy they're cooperative they want to support you and be able to talk through things we're not going to be just bringing something crazy into the conversation it's more on how people explain things or communicate could be slightly different and our voice applications are actions that we call them in Google assistant we call those actions and sub apps we have to figure out how to capture those different types of utterances that users can say and give them the appropriate response so it's definitely a different mental shift when it comes to thinking about how you built and something that I've seen and I actually experienced what I read my first application once I built it and as I was going to the docs its head design I was like that's cool I'll do that later because as a web developer that's what I would do I would kind of built all the scaffolding then I'd bring in all the design after and it turns out no can't do that this time you have to have the conversation design first and then you build after so are there like a list of best practices are there a bunch of like design Doc's on how to do conversation design yeah we actually have established a lot of best practices and principles and can go to for example actions google.com slash design get a whole ton of information of even what is it how to get started the first thing we always recommend to people whether you're a developer or marketer or whoever whatever role you have is to start with something called sample dialogues and what that means is basically you're creating a conversation it's like a movie script it's a back and forth between the user and the action and that just really helps you sort out the complexities of what this is gonna look like cuz a lot of times like Jessica mentioned people think oh yeah the words will just fix those later but in fact the words are the structure and it's gonna impact the flow and the wording and everything throughout your whole development cycle so you might as well start with design in the beginning and really save yourself a lot of headaches so can anyone write these conversation design practices or when we start to develop is it just the developer who are the stakeholders involved when somebody is thinking about designing something like a conversation I think in the ideal world a team will have a conversation designer as part of it and that person can really help steer the direction of how things should sound what things we need to keep in mind what are we gonna need from the back end all that kind of stuff now I understand in the real world not everybody's gonna have a conversation designer to work with so instead in those cases I definitely encourage the developer or the project manager whoever it is to really study on best practices and then write sample dialogues and then what you do is just like in Hollywood with a movie script you do a table read you read them out loud because sometimes we write formally and when we actually hear those things out loud they sound kind of stiff and awkward so you really want to read out loud with other people and you'll quickly get a feel for where things are going well and where things are going wrong and that can really help anybody really get started and do a better job yeah I think the last time we chatted with Priyanka a little bit about some of the other chat options specifically built into Google we kind of brought up the idea of people being frustrated by being very locked into kind of an older school version of a voice system where it wants you to say something very exactly I like right yeah I want one small cup of coffee that is dark brew please and it adds a lot more effort into it as opposed to how people might more naturally speak you know you mentioned earlier Jessica that you thought about the code part of it first and the design part of it later and that can you know lead to a lot of challenges using these best practices how do you kind of convince somebody like to actually take them into account and actually spend the time upfront working with them before just kind of trotting off and doing the code part oh yeah that's something that I've constantly seen whenever I go out especially when I do like a one day workshop it's really unrealistic to have a great design a great voice application built in one day it takes a long time and so I definitely try to do my little soapbox speech of like oh my gosh I spent hours thinking these they're technical issues when I was building prior to having a design it turns out was a design issue I didn't know where I was going in regards to the conversation flow so I think that's kind of my mantra I'm constantly trying to figure out I don't think I have it great kind of convincing argument besides sharing my story and sharing kind of the statistics on like it takes more time and you're gonna end up spending more developer time in the long run trying to fix those mistakes and because voice is still fairly new I think it's more people are gonna be experiencing that and then they realize and they go oh Jessica and Kathy they were right so is there an example you can share of where someone might have run into that or example that you've run into specifically yeah my very very first voice application that I built point of the application was to mock or mimic technical interviews because the hard part when it comes to interview it's not so much being able to solve the technical problems it's hearing the problems I'm practicing it and hear it from someone else so they cool I'll build this thing and it's a really cool tool I would have loved to have had this when I was going through my process of looking for a job and I would get into these weird kind of scuffles where I would start but how would I bring the user from giving them that information bringing them back and laying them how to come back and I knew how to do that technically but when I sent it out and had people try it out it wasn't natural what it felt weird don't think well how can I be clever and like putting little flags and try to bring them back and it's like oh my gosh why am i doing all this overhead to solve our problem where I could have just stopped and went okay let me talk to other people let me figure out and build the actual conversation design by using sample dialogues anything something that could be really challenging or something that I know when I mentioned to folks specially developers those are sample dialogues I get the for what is that it's like home it's literally writing down pretend you're the action and pretend someone else is the user and having that conversation so I usually like telling people just grab two friends tell one of their friends you are the action this is what you do use you know the other friend you are the user no talk and just let them naturally talk and write that down and how they're doing it is the best free way to do that yeah no I'm just to give you a really basic example I think a lot about yes/no questions and how often we we fail the user on those because a lot of times people will say well I ask them yes/no questions so let's say I asked you do you like candy and you might say yes you said yes I do like candy you didn't say yes I just broke the chat pod you shouldn't have broken it if somebody design it well or I might even say like well do you count chocolate which is neither a yes or a no but it's a very natural thing for someone to say and so someone who's really thinking things through and following best practices is not just going to be like oh I told them to say yes or no that's all I'm gonna accept they're gonna say what are related things they might say or maybe you're booking a table at a restaurant and you say how many people in your party and maybe I say well do outdoor seating now that's a related question but it's not a number like you asked me for it that being said I'm not gonna suddenly say how tall is Barack Obama when you asked me you know how many people in your party so it's what we call sort of adjacent topics so you might not answer the exact but the user will say something related and you need to anticipate those or things are gonna fail very quickly yeah I think this is something Priyanka you brought up the last time we chatted about people don't know exactly how to have a conversation yeah I think which is first of all a fascinating subject I mean just you're mentioning earlier if you tell two people to have a conversation boy they get really awkward really quickly think about everything you say but people don't normally think about everything they say they just kind of keep talking and eventually their brain might catch up but for people like me no words are way faster than thought so you can just keep on talking but it's an interesting thing because when you actually call it out I don't think a lot of people do think about like how much we use especially contextually right which is one of the hardest things to grab but one of the most important pieces of a conversation because you can ask a question like exactly that we know India about door seating it's like oh well you're talking about this restaurant you're talking about this how do you handle that kind of idea that people don't know how to have a conversation yeah I think it goes back to the point where you don't just start coding right you start to think about how it's going to have interaction with not just one person but different people right because I could talk about things in a different way and I think we talked about this last time when we were like if I want coffee depending on the time of the day and the day and the frustration amount I would ask for coffee in different ways like when I'm happy to be like wow coffee this is amazing oh my gosh can I just get coffee right now I'm so frustrated like things like that I think we have to incorporate how a user could react in different situations and ask for the same thing in different ways and then I guess people coming from different places with different accents could ask for certain things in different ways so things like that but Kathy I would like to ask you what are the things that are hard to deal with when we are working with conversation I think one of the things that's difficult and Jessica was talking about the difference between something like a GUI versus a Bui as we call it voice user interface is the fact that with a GUI you know what they did they pressed a button they swipe they chose a menu item with voice and natural language understanding it's a little bit more of an educated guess you know speech recognition act has improved dramatically and the time I've been working in this field but it's not perfect and human speech we don't get it right all the time either but when humans have a misunderstanding we are really good at what we call conversational repair if you say something like I went to the such-and-such restaurant last night I didn't hear that I'd say what restaurant and you'd say oh this one and we'd move on and we're very good at that kind of repair and that's something you really have to anticipate when you're developing these conversations which is no matter how good your design is no matter how good your prompts are people are gonna say things that you did not expect and you will get an error and you need to spend actual time thinking through what is my strategy for handling when things go off the rails how do I get somebody back on track and just doing the default of like sorry I didn't understand please say that again he's terrible it won't work and but did we see it all the time it's a great way to get your blood pressure up real quick and so we really think more like what's the user doing what do we just ask them let's rephrase the question a bit oh we have another error okay let's give them more information maybe they can't find their account number and we need to tell them more you have to know up front you're gonna spend time on error handling or repair and that is going to be the make-it-or-break-it difference between your users having a successful experience or not yeah I was kind of mentioned earlier that sometimes people will say something completely unrelated to what you know you were asking about is that handled in the same way do you try to handle it in a like context shifting way and you say now we're talking about this so the AI is just has to keep up or do you try to keep them in line with what the original conversation was it kind of depends on the goal it's like if you're trying to book a table then you do want to get them through those questions but you should be flexible you don't have to answer the questions in the exact same order on the other hand if they're saying something completely out of context you may not be able to help but another thing I want to mention is basically if somebody says something that you can't do acknowledgement is really important so for example if I go to a concierge at a hotel and I say hey can you rent a car for me and let's say they can't let's say they only do dinner reservations if the person just said I don't understand do you want dinner reservations I know I want to run a car what the human will actually say is I'm sorry I can't rent a car would you like dinner reservations so our systems if you look in the logs and a lot of people are requesting a feature that you do not have don't just say I don't understand you should do this other thing say oh sorry we don't do that feature yet I can do this or that people like to be acknowledged when you have a frustrating day and you're talking about it with somebody you don't want them to say well I don't know it I'll help you you want them to say wow I hear you're saying that you had a difficult talk with your coworker people want to be acknowledged and this is true even for a voice user interface so it's incredibly important to make sure that the conversation system is very clear about what it can and can't handle but also that it still tries to keep users down that path while matching all of the kind of requests of that I mean I'm assuming this is kind of covered in those best practices of things to keep in mind when you're designing a system yeah for sure like you said you want to further them towards the goal but at the same time keeping them from having a frustrating experience and sort of gently guiding them back on track yeah most third-party voice applications don't do everything they don't necessarily it shouldn't replicate the Google assistant because Google system could do all the things generally a lot of what developers are bill T are specific to a niche or to a certain topic and so that's where I know I felt several applications and there are times where users are not as knowledgeable that I can't tell a joke because that's not what the actions about but most likely the user is thinking that they're talking to Google assisted and so I have an intent instead of all my actions going hey you might be one cool assistant just say goodbye and I'll get you out and when you want to chat about X say hey Google talk to blah and that way it could get the user to what they want to do and it's not for seeing me as a developer trying to solve all the problems because that's not the purpose of individual actions yeah and so what are some of the common pitfalls that developers actually come across in their trying to develop I think we talked a little bit with Kathy about how do you actually like repair conversation with the conversation design aspect of it but we didn't touch a little bit on the developer aspects and what do they see as challenges I would say the biggest challenge is not choosing the rice use case doing things through voice is great but it's not helpful when you're searching for something particular and there's lots of options on your train a narrow it down it might be helpful to narrow it down using voice but then maybe at the end the user might want to be able to see the last three options because they want to get into the details and that's where you could use multimodal I'm having a smart display or being able to show that other smart phone might be a helpful set up instead of just appending all envoys because that might not be necessary the best use case for that and so I think the best use case and I usually tell folks if it's something you're already doing with your voice that's a great thing to make into an action if it's something like you're using let's say spreadsheets that might be a little more challenging to go okay if I want to get column four and row B and trying to figure that out if your spreadsheet is lerton you have like actual like labels on things and it could make sense then that would make a lot more sense you brought up a great point there about multi-modality and with new devices out there we are getting into that world so Kathy would you mind touching a little bit on how do you design properly for those multimodal devices and you know just for anyone who may not be sure what multimodal means you know definition would be fantastic for me but you know so muslin modal were generally referring to the case where there are different ways you can interact with the technology so for example Jessica mentioned smart displays like the Google home hub so that is what we call a voice for word device so you can do a lot of things with your voice but there is the addition of a screen and so you can see things like if you're shopping for a blue shirt you can see the pictures on there and something like a phone of course is also multimodal because you can type you can speak you can tap you can swipe so when we're thinking about designing for these new surfaces its kind of exciting because something like the smart display it's very new and we haven't quite all figured out exactly with all the best use cases are yet but generally our guidelines are that when you are thinking about this the first thing you need to understand is that although it would be great unfortunately you can't just design once and be done for all surfaces obviously there are things that are in common across all of them there will be some differences as well so our advice is to start with the voice first experience like the smart speaker because believe it or not that is often the most complex or maybe most constrained case and if you get the conversation done right or the smart speaker then what you do is you go to something like the smart display and you say okay now we have the option for visual elements where would it benefit the conversation to add visual components at this point and then you can do the same for the phone as well so start with the voice only experience and expand from there a lot of times people go with oh we're gonna have the pretty pictures first and then they get back to smart speaking they're like I don't know what to do so definitely start with voice what also adds like a tremendous level of complexity when you're talking about mixing and matching all these different interface not only is it now you're doing conversation design you're also doing all the actual interface design and then I have to imagine it's exponential in terms of difficulty because you're trying to mix them and there's enough eighties sci-fi shows out there that kind of showed people interacting with computers and then talking to the computers and maybe even using some kind of third-party tool all of these things mixing together to kind of create one single experience that's gonna be hell for UI designers whether its graphical visual or a combination what does that look like right now it's a significant challenge and I think it's important to to acknowledge that and if you are for example running a business or you're the person who's the decision maker about we're gonna do this conversation action you just have to keep in mind that it's gonna take some time and you have to have these different skill sets so you have to have a visual designer you have to have these different folks who are gonna work together and we have established some of these nice processes where there's handoffs and so we really are establishing these best practices to deal with these new multimodal services because as you say it does add complexity when you've got to be thinking about all these things but again if you go through the process in the right order you'll save yourself a lot of headaches and hassles and they'll be a little smoother definitely and I would say even just building a voice conversation application it's not where you could just work in the silo all by yourself it's really working with the different parties and working together so I definitely think meeting with the voice first building that experience first lays out a lot of great groundwork and then adding in the visuals the compliments the support and even the visuals we do have a new tool called canvas where you can bring in HTML CSS and JavaScript into play which is a totally completely new experience and you could play games and do lots of fun interactive simulations too you really make the experience more rich but definitely want to start with voice and then you can add in those fun features later but I want to bring up chemists kids either with canvas you don't necessarily generally have it set up where there's buttons because it's a surface you could just use your voice and so you don't need like a green button to go you just say go and just kind of make that more part of the visual elements and so an example would be lets say you have a game where there's a little character instead of pushing buttons that's his attack or like go home or XYZ just push on like the monster you want to attack and push on the home icon thing like in the background so you could go and do it that way and set or of course use your voice to control your character so it's a different type of UI experience as well so if you were to pinpoint some of the use cases for the listeners today what would be some of the best use cases to kind of handle or tackle as the beginners who are starting to think about creating something for voice yeah I mean as Jessica mentioned one of the one of the good indicators is do you have conversations with other humans about this thing because that's often a good indicator also of course the context where is the person are they in the kitchen and their hands are busy or they're a new parent and they're always holding their babies so they don't have use of their hands or they're in the car and you really need to reduce the cognitive load but you really have to ask yourself what is better about someone doing this task through something like a smart speaker than on an app you know maybe it's not and I think a lot of companies get excited like we're gonna build your voice is gonna be awesome and then it fails and like I don't understand why didn't it work as well because it's faster for me to do it you know on my phone so you need to think through some of these things like what's the value add truly for doing something on a smart speaker the other thing I was going to say is that a wonderful place to be thinking about conversation design is really through the idea of inclusive design which is we want to make sure that whatever your product or feature is or the information you have available can everyone access it and voice technology is really reaching the point finally where it's getting mature enough to help really the people who need it the most may be somebody who is visually impaired somebody who has muscular dystrophy and can't use their hands to do things but they can use their voice and that's really one of the places I think right now voice is is the most powerful but to me this idea of inclusive design isn't just about this one group or that one group it's it's really about all of us because all of us throughout our lives have situational impairments where maybe you're walking in the door and you're holding your groceries and you briefly don't have you your hands or I can't find my reading glasses and I can't read this important text message or I broke my arm all of these things so really it's about building for everybody and do I need to be a machine learning expert and do I need to know natural language processing in order to start building for voice no which is fantastic I know when I first started in this field I was really intimidated and scared that I would have to learn all these really interesting concepts and really challenging concepts and the time to get up to speed on that would take a while and what's great is we provided tool called dialogue flow that does the MOU for you and so what's great is that you just as a developer identify the different intents or functionalities that the user could potentially have within your voice application and just provide training phrases to specify for each of those possible interactions and it handles the machine learning for you so what's really great is you don't need to do that but if you're interested in that you can also connect Google assistant to your own and oh you as well so you don't have to use that well so if you do have that background and that knowledge great connected to any other I know you that you have but if you don't don't worry about it so it sounds like there's a bunch of cool tools out there people want to get started including dialog flow and of course Priyanka you've got the deconstructing chat bot series that goes into a little bit of this and links out to a bunch of other useful resources yeah we also have a bunch of code labs to refer to while you do the deconstructing chat pod videos so if people are really interested in that that sounds like a good starting point if people want to learn more about the best practices you mentioned the link earlier are there other good resources for those best practices or for thinking about conversation design we've also got some videos out there on things like conversation repair also persona we didn't really touch on that but when you are designing you want to be thinking about the personality and the characteristics of your action or your conversational experience so personas and other important things so we have some videos resources for that as well so what's in the future for a conversation design because I saw this little thing about alter ego there's some pretty interesting prototyping work going on right now alter ego is one example which is out of MIT Media Lab and it's all around the idea of a lot of us might be comfortable talking to our smart speakers in our own home but maybe not when we're on busts are out about on the street or even in our office it could be a little annoying hear everybody talking to their computer so there's this idea of silent speech or subvocalization which sounds very sci-fi where essentially you are wearing something along your jaw line and what it's doing is it's picking up pre speech signals so as you start to form words before the words actually come out of your mouth you're doing these tiny little signals that are actually indicating what it is that you're about to speak and so this technology is picking up on those pre speech signals and translating them silently into words which could then be passed along to a voice assistant and of course the responses could be done in your headphones so no one would actually hear it and I encourage people to look at the alter ego video that MIT Media Lab put out to check it out so that's like an example of someone taking this conversation design and just short cutting the actual meaning to talk part well you're still talking it's just that the words are not audible which to me is what I would define talking as but speaking maybe I should are conversing I don't know what the right verb is but you're still having a conversation but you can think of it just like when you're typing to somebody you're talking to somebody but the words are not spoken out loud so I mean it could open up a lot of avenues it sounds like for almost like an additional interface to communicate with these things but I'm guessing it would still follow a lot of the same conversation best practices and guys for sure and even if you're talking to say a chat bot that's typing only you're still following the same best practices and when you type to a chat bot it's much more like spoken words than it is like if you're writing a formal essay or something like that so even though it's a different modality you're still following conversational principles and what about for cool tools coming up or any other you know future products that are really cool for people to check out yeah we recently just announced canvas and that's like the cool new thing right now where again you're bringing in web technologies into voice and making that voice forward so that is really exciting and I believe that just God noun says for GA this month so that's like hot off the presses the nearest thing right now awesome well I guess we did talk a little bit about who you are and what you do initially but if people want to find you what would you like to share where you're going to be in the next few days or your Twitter handles so I am Perle 42 on twitter i also log on medium from time to time and i'll be speaking in january at project voice and what is project voice project voice is going to get together a whole lot of voice developer and designer and biz dev folks too for a week of talking about all things voice and conversation how to build the products use cases everybody together to really talk through those things you can definitely follow me on twitter my handle is chat the sweetie all one word and i also blog a lot of medium as well so you definitely check that out on the Google developers medium page right now I'm really seeing season two of assistant on air which is a video series where we have conversations with folks who build for google assistants so season 1 was all about talking to Googlers internally how they build and why they build Google assistant or actions on Google in that particular way or how they could use the tools and season she was all about our gdes which are Google developer experts so there are folks globally around the world who are experts within building for Google assistant and I sit down and chat with them awesome well thank you all so much for coming in I think we had some really cool understanding more I mean I definitely walked in here without knowing what conversation design was and now I know a slightly bit more so thank you all for coming in thanks very much awesome thanks happiness thanks so much to Kathy and Jessica for coming in and talking about like I said before the best practice is around conversation AI I really like that note you said Priyanka about how it's a good balance between the design of conversation AI and the experience there but also the development aspect of it and how do you combine those two to make a good system yeah it was very enlightening to hear not just from the Google assistant perspective but the general aspect of designing any experience from the conversational point of view and speaking of which I think it's about time to get into our question of the week for this you published a blog post I wanted to ask you more about it you have a solution here to combine dialogue flow and bigquery and I mean my first question of course is why would you do that what tools are available in there that make that useful but then also how do you do it so when I've been speaking with customers and users of dialogue flow one of the cool questions that always comes up is I want to take some of the data that I'm getting from the users like I take an example of an appointment schedule and the time and the date and why people want to set an appointment for coming to whatever it is that I serve as a service right and I just wrote this cool little tool to understand there is the reporting side of things that dialogue flow offers but there's always an analysis that you may want to do as a business in terms of what you want to make decisions offer so I take these appointment things from the users date time and why they want to come in and then I want to do my own analysis to understand when do people come in more or what are the different requests that I'm getting more versus this and all of that is very easily available as where it was and I can pass them into bigquery and I can run sequel commands on it so it's a very good way to find out how can I provide a better customer experience and what are some of the questions I should even automate or not automate is an indication that you can get with an integration like this so that's the why aspect of why I came to think that this could be a good tool and how do you do it is actually pretty simple in dialogue flow you have the fulfillment where you can write no js' code to make a connection to any API so in this case I'm using the bigquery API to take those variables that I'm capturing as a part of dialogue flow the dates and the times and why people want to come in for this appointment and then just pass those variables into a table by calling my bigquery API from the cloud function that is inside fulfillment from dialogue flow so it's pretty simple integration if you want to look at a sample or want to do it yourself I have linked some of the code into github and you can download that from the repository as well so like you still get to use the dialogue aspect of dialogue flow in creating the chat bot but then you're easily able to take a question that somebody asks or some information that somebody provides and then basically query against bigquery which is really good at well big queries and then take that get an answer back and then use that back in your dialogue flow application you could either use that back in your dialogue through application or you could take that information and create your business strategy off of it and be like okay now I should change my bot or I should add you know these questions because people are asking for these more that type of stuff so you can decide where to focus more of your energy on but as you said you can also process it and send the response back to the dialogue flow to have further conversation so both ways yeah would you recommend that people generally take the conversations that users are having with their dialogue flow apps and record all that information in bigquery so they can make decisions it is a good practice to do that if they are thinking about you know mln AI aspects of taking this huge amount of data and making sense of it and then utilizing it to either better improve the conversational experience or to provide more experiences that they may not be thinking of providing today just based on what the users are asking for super cool so we've got that article down there and it sounds like the codes on github as well yeah so it'll be a great opportunity for people to actually pretty easily try it out yeah awesome well I think we're just about out of time but before we go Priyanka do you have any cool fun trips coming up any big events yeah I have a lot of travel coming up in October I will be in Europe OB and go to Berlin doing a talk on natural language processing and conversational AI and then similar in Milan and then later in November I'll be and Copenhagen doing NLP and conversational AI talks again oh that's a lot of travel coming up for you yeah and then after that I am going to be on me in December so I'm looking forward to that it sounds like you might need it maybe a staycation would be better exactly yeah with family Shh yeah I think I'll have a vacation coming up as well so definitely looking forward to unplugged for a little bit and you know maybe maybe I won't even bring my laptop with me I've been juggling that idea we'll see if it actually happens or not but you should definitely try to do that because without laptop life can be good well thanks everyone so much for tuning in whether you're tuning in from your phone or from your laptop hopefully life can still be good while listening to a podcast so we'll see you all next week [Music] I can't even find my window sorry too many tabs too many tabs somehow the world has gotten into a scenario we're having a hundred and fifty tabs open is acceptable I know I don't get it I don't understand how people stay organized as so many tabs open
