 Hi. How are you feeling today? Actually, I'm not feeling so well. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm PETRA, and I offer free medical screening. Would you like that? Yeah, yeah sure, why not? Welcome. Do you suffer from any hormone imbalance issues? Well, yes. Like PMS or low sex drive? Uh, I thought that was just me getting older. Do you experience poor concentration? Maybe. Or poor memory? Yes. Brittle fingernails or excessive hair loss? They're cracking, they're awful, you can see. Do you often feel cold? For example, having cold hands or feet? All the time. Unintentional weight gain, or an inability to lose weight? Yeah, yes, I guess so. Have you been suffering from any mood-related issues? Unhappy, most of the time. I advise you to go see a specialist. Some of your symptoms are consistent with hypothyroidism. Hypo-what? It is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain important hormones. I've never, I would never have guessed. Abby, I wish you all the best. I'm definitely going to see a specialist. Thank you.
