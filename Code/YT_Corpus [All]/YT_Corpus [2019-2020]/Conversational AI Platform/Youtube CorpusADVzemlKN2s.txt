 Yeah, everyone Good afternoon I'm from a firm called recruitment smart technologies and we are using AI and machine learning data science technologies in recruitment for their charge sector a Bit about me I'm Pablo quani and I'm the co-founder for the firm and We are Going on from last three and a half years We have pivoted two times before this and now we have got a good product market fit, which is really doing well in the market So very quickly what we do we help large companies to find a perfect hire and seconds and We do this with our proprietary machine learning technology So the market size is huge in UK itself is around 30 billion dollars The recruitment technology market is around 17 billion and in the US market is around 600 billion So the total the total market size is massive The current landscape if I want to suggest you it's very very convoluted into the recruitment market at one side we have candidates on the other side we have organizations and recruiters and there are job boards and It's pretty much going everywhere. The recruiters are reaching out to candidates. The candidates are reaching out recruiters They are not able to get back to them on time and what it real deals It's not a good candidate experience and the companies are not able to find the best talent So how we are disrupting it? So in the transform view you have a recruiter and Our solution basically helps to source screen and Improve the candidate experience it works with job boards, it works with applicant tracking system and improves the candidate experience and we have two products in this space one is Sniper AI which is a talent intelligence platform and the second is Jeeves area, which is a conversational AI platform So both these products sit between the whole landscape between the recruiter Candidate and the ATS in the job board and kind of transform the whole arena The key KPI is that we help to achieve is to improve The resume scanning we reduce that time by 53% we improve the funnel by 60% and We help companies to save caused by more than 37% So this is a high-volume game and a lot of companies lot of candidates are applying which are not applicable So it reduce the whole high-volume by an 88% The competitive advantage that we have in this market is that we have a algorithm that works at speed at scale or multilingual We have global partnership with forms like ASAP and Oracle and we are very enterprise focused There's a good competition in this space but what we have been able to achieve is in a very linear fashion that we with a very small funding of 1 million we Have been able to build a great product and also got a good traction in the market. I will bring it to you So this machine learning technology at the end does match and rank candidates it brings a unified candidate experience We have a chatbot solution and everything works in real time So this is the great case study that we have Infosys which is one of the largest customer it is saving, you know I sorry about this time to high reduction improve in the recruiter productivity and conversion ratios I Think there is some so the partnerships that we have with SP Oracle and enforces. It is really working Well, we are getting a lot of customer traction from all these three we have close customers in Dubai and Middle East in Singapore in US and in UK we Have integration with pretty much all the larger HR providers in the market like Oracle success factors and workday Most of the job boards are integrated with our platform So we are a kind of a marketplace as well giving 70% of the access to the to that to the customers This is the team all the three key keep people are you know serial entrepreneurs I worked with cap general before Yusuf has worked with E Y and Collett has worked with KPMG. He's the CFO in the firm And then we have advisers who are helping us as well. And we have a team of around 20 people based in Poland and India 95% of the revenue is recurring we have a very good customer base. Probably can't see that properly But what a phone Capgemini althought I am more Sun and more than 10 customers are using us What we are so the ARRA is like 2 X growing every year on a year next year We are looking to close at 1.7 million. They said this we this year that we are around 650 K What this is a the key key slide. We have a funding of a 1 million GBP till now we are looking to raise 500k more or to a million so we are flexible and these are the current investors that we have onboard Alpha beat HR tech partnership fom and the exist strategy is with Oracle SP or any of the large recruitment forms, like adequate manpower Thank you You
