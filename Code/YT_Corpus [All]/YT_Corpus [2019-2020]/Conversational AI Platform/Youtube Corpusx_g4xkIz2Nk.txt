 It's a good afternoon I'm a co-founder and president at course AI and it's a real pleasure being here and presenting to you guys Need to find my clicker. There we are So, let me walk you through about a bit about our history a chorus So we were founded in mid-2015 raised our our early seed of six million dollars and spent the next year or so Building and developing our AI stack and our product We delve deep into a I built our own speech recognition engines our own machine learning models and so on and so forth around mid 2016 We started a style we started establishing our sales and marketing 2017 we already raised our series a of 16 million dollars and started selling in earnest and 2018 Was all about growth we grew revenue by about two and a half times closed over two hundred paying customers analyzed above four million conversations and closed our thirty three million dollars round be 2019 is again all been about growth to date Less than half a year around a half a year into 2019. We've more than doubled the amount of conversations we've analyzed we're all about growth now and We're introducing some more cool AI components as well So just to recap over 200 paying customers in 2018 more than four million conversations Analyzed to date and over 80 employees where our R&D is based mostly in tel-aviv headquarters in San Francisco and another sales division out of Boston So why analyze conversations to begin with the really three main reasons that you want to analyze conversations and sales conversations specifically The first is you want to actually understand what differentiates your top speakers from the rest of your speakers From your your top reps from the rest of your reps so if you understand what your top reps are doing better than the rest of your reps you're obviously able to Clone your closers as we say and allow the lower performing reps to get better and better A second component is or a second reason you want to analyze conversations is you want to cut down on ramp time? So if you're able to understand what the best conversations are to help teach new new Reps learning the job you're able to cut dramatically on ramp time And the third reason you wanna analyze conversation is approximately 80% of your calls disappear into thin air Nobody really knows why you lose them why the deals are lost? being able to You can listen in to a call and understand why a specific deal was lost but being able to do so at scale Would be impossible without a platform to analyze conversations automatically So indeed we've built a Conversation intelligence platform what the platform does what our product does is record? conversations transcribes them in real time in surfaces insights And we do so with our own proprietary Automatic speech recognition engines our own machine Learning models, basically what we do is we deconstruct conversations into their core semantics and phonetic building blocks To understand exactly what is happening at every moment in a conversation? So for example, what pain points were discussed what risks are for the deal what the risks are for the deal what topics were discussed? So just to recap we record a conversation we're able to identify the moment a conversation is happening on You know a video calling conference platform we transcribe it using our own speech recognition so that the accuracy the precision is extremely high and we analyze conversations in real-time Surfacing surfacing the topics even if the topics themselves are not pre known So if there's a new feature or a new product a new positioning of the product We're able to pick that up in real-time using our AI and with all this data we Enrich the CRM we send all of this data and overlay it over the various different fields in the CRM in addition a Above or except for the basics We also have additional AI components were able to analyze themes across different Congress Asians were able to curate playlists for For specific reps completely personalize them. So if a rep is if we detect a rep is having trouble with objection handling We can automatically create a playlist that is tailored for him or her if they're having a problem with discounting the same we can automatically detect conversations that do a better job and and curate these playlists for them we have Scorecards that were able to learn from how to coach better And were able to measure a sales processes And their adoption across different stages and and across time We have some absolutely phenomenal customers that we work with again over 200 paying customers today. This is a Very small amount of them, but some great customers like Adobe outreach Envision zoom MongoDB and what we're able to do for our customers is pretty phenomenal Were able to reduce RAM time by up to 50% for example zoom is such a customer And were able to increase sales rates depending on the stage and when they come to us by up to 30% So some really cool stuff apart from that we have Integrations with many different types of components so for CRM we have Salesforce for collaboration We have slack for email and calendar. We do everything from G suite a Microsoft Exchange and Outlook video conferencing so all the main players So Zoomer conference go to meeting RingCentral Skype for business and in terms of dialers Although all the usual suspects. So RingCentral insidesales.com Truly sales loft and so on and so forth So the remainder of the talk, I want to talk a little about the insights we were able to Surface and there are two types of insights. Generally speaking the first type of insights are Company-specific insights for specific customers were able to analyze conversations and let them surface and understand what's happening and there are more generic or Cross-industry insights. So let me start from some cool cross industry insights So we've identified that for example top reps not performing reps when they are Negotiating contracts they use a much more collaborative language. So they use words like we us together versus less high-performing reps that will use things much closer to I in you so for example instead of saying I will send over the contract for you to review will be something like will send over the contract and we can work on it together and creating a much more collaborative friendly and pathetic kind of Environment, so that's a really cool correlation. We found for top performing reps Another one is in terms of questions. If you had to guess for a second whether top performing reps asked more or Less questions in low performing reps think for a second What would you what what you would guess so most people guess that top performing reps ask more questions than lower performing reps The truth is they actually ask on average about the same amount of of questions The biggest difference between them is the type of questions. That is me that are being asked. So top performing reps ask Open-ended questions questions that elicit better a more response more talking from the prospect Help uncover more of the pain they're experiencing and create a sense of empathy. So it's not the amount of questions We found that differentiates top performing reps from low performing reps, but rather the type of questions and finally another another cool point is Action items for top performing reps set the same amount of action items But they set the action items and next steps much earlier on in the conversation so when they reach the end of the conversation, basically they're just Wrapping up and and recapping what has previously been agreed on I see I'm almost out of time. So I'll run through some customer insights. So we found for example for zoom when they started talking about Their positioning their vision wire cueing founded zoom in his mission their sales went up when outreach positioned themselves as a Competitor in a competitive way versus sales loft. They started selling more another company in Insight squared They were leaving money on the table They were offering discounts way too early in a deal without it actually affecting their the result of the deal So those are things that were able to surface automatically for our customers and help them improve their sales results a Walk through a few other things cool things we've done for customers. So for a company called plaister we helped reduce shadowing time by up to 70 percent by automatically Curating playlists of what to listen to per specific rep help them coach better on a specific topic for zoom we were able to reduce RAM time by up to 50 percent by Automatically curating playlists for new reps to listen to as they join For house-call Pro we were able to increase sales rate by approximately 10% and we were able to do that by identifying winning talk tracks and disseminating them across organizations And for guru we were able to shorten sales cycles by creating an alignment between the various different sub teams of sales sales Engineering and product so they were all more aligned and collaborate better within the organization. So That's what I have for today. Thank you very much for listening and great to be here. Thanks You You
