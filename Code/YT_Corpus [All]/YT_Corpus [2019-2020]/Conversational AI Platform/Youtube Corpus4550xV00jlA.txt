 good afternoon everyone we're very excited to be here we're going to talk today about connected brands and the power of language and we're from our GA so I guess first off we'll go through Jenifer much introduce yourself sir I'm Jennifer Vaughn oh and I am the head of verbal design and creative director and verbal design and we'll talk in more detail about but it is the discipline that deals with Framm language and we'll get into some of the details later all right I'm Gus obviously I'm in desperate need of a new headshot we'll get to that but essentially yes we're from our GA and for those you didn't know the brand is a practice of within our GA essentially it all was born out of this world like this rural belief really that brand belongs in the boardroom and in order to do that actually we forged a department which is called brand transformation which is essentially bringing together innovation consulting in brand but we're not making this up we all come from the branding industry we've come from this kind of broad spectrum of brand hopefully you recognize some of these agencies up here and we're incredibly proud to be alum of these agencies but what it's done more importantly is giving us a bit of a breadth of experience and definitely opinions of what makes a great brand and ultimately it comes down to these four key things essentially we believe that a great brand is great strategy made visual verbal and experiential but often these individual crafts are treated as just that individual right and they rarely work together or at least seldom are in pursuit of the same outcome whereas actually as we all know that to create truly innovative connected brands you need to work way more iteratively way more collaboratively which is why actually we believe that all of these disciplines need to work together regardless of what your craft so we call this philosophy connected brands and what we mean by connected brands is essentially this connected brands or when you think about branding or storytelling in general it always started with the story the killer idea the problem and that worked for many many years an entire industry was built on it but ultimately when you think about it they're quite passive behaviors you would kind of think about this great metaphor dear you would read about it you'd listen to you'd listen about it or you don't see me kind of watching it on TV whereas as we know today that ultimately the way we connect with brands is way more experienced and more behavioral right actually it's like the tweeting swiping slacking then mowing swiping and that direct connection with a brand from a user is actually incredibly important which is why it's not just the story and the idea that we need to drive but actually the systematic bottom-up cultural approach on how to build build a great brand so we kind of think of those two things together how do you take the story what we say and the system what we do and work to build a more holistic brand experience another way to think about this is through signifiers and behaviors a signifier the things you're kind of more traditionally associate with a brand the name the logo color palette grid system etc but then there's the behavior how the brand experience lives how it adapts how it connects to the user and all those things together create a much better a more holistic brand experience great example here a long-standing client of ours can't take credit for this redesign but we're huge fans of it when the Google rebrand was announced you look at it from like on the surface level and you go okay it's like a bit more slick San serif type they kind of kept the googly colour palette and it feels clean and modern like some of their competitors fantastic but actually the real magic behind this rebrand was that they realized their future was going to be driven in AI and ultimately the Google assistant was going to be a core part of that so what they did they structured their entire rebrand around behavior around that brand experience and that identity shifted to become more behavioral to prepare Google's business to move into a more conversational interface and what's amazing about that is then that enables you to take that from a rebrand and transition into more behaviorally driven marketing shifting from campaigns being rooted in a traditional metaphor and then actually going to actually thinking about how it can play a key role in people's lives and this makes a lot of sense for for Google because Google's whole business is is built on language even from search and now as they move into conversation so of course they would be thinking about behavior that is rooted in the spoken word in fact they they put a stake in the ground and went so far as to say the future really is about the spoken word not traditional interface as we've thought about it before but we think that you don't have to be a technology company or Congress or a company that's using AI or chat or conversational design at all to really benefit from thinking about language and the power of words in in a different way because whether you are using traditional forms of communication or building a conversational interface or just building an experience whether that's digital or physical you're having a conversation with your consumer you're telling them something and there is an exchange and so words really really do matter so when we got together to really think about how we could give language and words the right seat at the table when it came to branding at r/ga we looked back on what our experience with brand language had been in the past and I'm sure this won't be surprising to many of you but we found that there are two typical approaches that tend to happen in the branding world when it comes to language so either we have something like this where there's a really robust strategy phase defining what the brand is all about and then verbal and visual split and build identities separate from each other and somewhere in the guideline in phase they come together it's a mash-up you hope it works together but there was no exchange between the two it really was an integrated design at all or what happens which is more unfortunate is that writing isn't considered in in the brand process at all and it really is seen as something that happens later as an additive can you wordsmith something can we add a headline but it's seen as something separate to brand design altogether and then that got us thinking well when we think about all the disciplines all the crafts that are part of branding and Beyond we attach this word design to them visual design experience design product design industrial design it the list goes on but when it comes to language we talk about it differently it's verbal strategy verbal identity voice personality and why isn't language associated with design and it's weird right because when you think about design and break it down into what it's time to achieve there's no specific craft associated with it really like design it's both strategic and creative of course being able to not just come up with a strategy but understand how to communicate that strategy is key it's the foundational building blocks of how you continue to build on that strategy going forward and design solves problems you know if you've sort of solved the problem how do you communicate it how do you communicate that solution and how is that solution then translating not just through a logo not just through a grid structure but actually then rooted in the very way we communicate so that whoever the audience might be and then ultimately design is not a discipline it's an approach and I think this is a key theme we want to talk about today is actually then how do we actually start to think about where if we are all in service of solving problems then how do we remove the idea of that being attached to a specific craft and actually bring more people into the conversation so of course this is all to say that language is design so the first thing that we did was call the discipline what we believe it's deserving of language at its best is design so let's call our practice verbal design and really I think this is one step in helping us treat verbal design differently because we were talking about it differently so we were treating it as something other than than other crafts but of course semantics is not everything we really do need to put our money where our mouth is so what do we mean by verbal design and how is it different for one its output focused it's not about theory that sits in a guidelines it's about finding actionable ways to activate language and empowering every writer and even others who are not writers by trade to use language in the right way it's also dynamic it's not a single identity that's static it evolves as context of all those people evolved it's truly a system just like visual and experience art it's all encompassing it means it touches every word everywhere it starts with names it carries through two long copy even UX coffee you know every word matters it also is inclusive of traditional and non-traditional forms of communication and perhaps most importantly it's foundational it's not a supplement or something that happens at the end part of the brand foundation in some we define verbal design as the craft of designing an approach to conversation that a brand has everywhere and that starts with language so what does this really mean for our day to day well we we take a page out of advertising's book inspired by the beautiful partnership that has worked for decades of copy and art right the avatar thing has always respected that these crafts should come together so we bring disciplines together verbal visual and experience from the very very beginning to be thinking about the brand idea not necessarily just about these different crafts but what is the overarching idea and more importantly what's the character of the brand what's the essence that we want to bring to life and when you start to do that and you think about language as something more fundamental you actually start to ask different questions about what words can do in your brand so instead of how can I wordsmith this which far too often happens we can ask what is the idea and how can words actually be a vehicle for unlocking the potential of that idea I'm bringing it forward instead of asking what do people want to hear and just sort of trying to mirror what you think your audience wants we start by asking what is authentic to us what do we have the right to say and then how can we meet audiences where they are instead of just thinking about how a line sounds how or how a word sounds we think about how we want to make make people feel really carrying that idea of character through if this is a conversation there is an outcome not only based on the content but the tone and how people are walking away feeling and ultimately how does this all add up it's not about single lines or single words it's about the totality of what you're saying and the whole conversation and when you ask these questions and think about language in this way you really can start to create a cohesive experience and that's because everything is coming from the same place it just doesn't just happen it feels like it's coming from the same place because it is and so ultimately what this means is that verbal design really can be that connected thread in a connected Brown system driving your story in your system and connecting all your experiences together all right and then we just wanted to take you through a quick example of how especially from like a visual design standpoint just how that can be so inspiring as a foundational insight and idea and how we can extend that into an assistance so we just when I talk to about client that came to us silk ink were incredibly fortunate to work with this unbelievable company that came to us and they essentially asked us to do a couple of things they wanted us to help define and build their brand but to tell you a little bit about silk ink silk ink really starts with these three amazing people the first two are great Altman and Rebecca lacouture they are both biochemists they actually met at Tufts University and they shared this passion for finding healthier safer alternatives to harmful petrochemicals and then the third member of this story is it's actually great wife Rebecca Altman and she is an environmental sociologist which is essentially the study of not just pollution in the planet but actually the pollution of the body which sounds terrifying right so we'll get into that a little bit and essentially this is we are in the mists of this invisible crisis and essentially nearly everything we were everything we put on our skin the siege is sitting in right now they're all coated in harmful petrochemicals to achieve a benefit it might be water wicking it might be an emulsifier in your in your moisturizer whatever right but essentially these things are not only harmful to the body they also end up just going into our water supply and eventually our food supply it gets better so amazingly Greg and Beck actually found this incredible solution this natural alternative in the form of a humble pure silk cocoon and what they do with this silk cocoon is pretty astounding they literally just take it they add water and salts they put it in a hydro fuse and then they create this property they call activated silk liquid silk it's kind of like a gel but then by combining different properties with this liquid silk this activated silk you can essentially match or outperform any benefit that a petrochemical can do but without any of the harmful I guess results experiences right so pretty astounding the most even more in credible than that is it doesn't disrupt the manufacturing process at all manufacturers around the world can still order this substance as they would order any petrochemical and seamlessly put it into their supply chain that's incredible can we just think about that for a second that's mad so essentially they came to us and thought about the opportunity was enormous and it was huge privilege which was how do we help them try to build this brands communicate this product and essentially disrupt entire industries not just the chemical industry so competitors such as de pon but also actually disrupt the fashion industry the health industry the medical industry and beyond and I said we needed to brand them and help build their business right but there are a couple of challenges here one the science is actually really really complicated at its base it seems simple but there's so much to tell but but more the problem as gus was explaining and the solution are both invisible so how do we get people to even understand that there are chemicals and additives that can harm us in our bodies on everything we buy and touch but also buy into the fact that there's this invisible solution from silk that's not changing your clothing or your products but making it better so that that's really tough right we need to bring it to the fore and and help people get passionate about it the other challenge here was that silk knew that they couldn't do this alone the technology the science is amazing but they're not going to start manufacturing chairs and skincare and leggings right they need to work with partners across the board in every industry who are the leaders in these different areas to actually replace the chemicals with activated silk so we need to be thinking about mass and luxury everything from tires to food to to high fashion and even globally too so how do we create a brand that can work in all of those places so where do we begin of course it always starts with strategy and what we call an active purpose an active purpose defines the role as well as the impact of of the brand so for so what we defined was that there a green chemistry company that exists to advance the world's health by unlocking the power of nature's most elegant chemistry so a lot of beautiful things here advance the world's health is about the people and the planet unlocking nature's most elegant chemistry really means bringing science and nature together to bring out what was already there and make it better to change everything so we have our strategy but now we need a name they came to us as silk ink as we said but that name really wasn't working very hard for them it really wasn't serving as a tool to communicate their purpose or the potential impact that they could have so we think about naming and of course naming is a key component of verbal design we think about some standard criteria that I'm sure a lot of you have seen or worked with if you've been through a naming process we need to connect to the strategy through the name we need to make a good first impression we need to find a name that can grow with the business as it evolves and we need to be able to own the name and it needs to be clear from any unsavory connotations or perceptions in key languages but we don't want just a good name and yes all those things are true we want a great name so for us because we think about brands a little bit differently we think about that story in that system we think in a great name place one more role and we give ourselves one more challenge as the naming isn't hard enough and that's to really find a name that can bridge story and system so yes it's inspired by your strategy and what you believe and what you have to say but it also should unlock a world and we'll show you a little bit about what that means as we go through so how do you get there it starts with thousands of names naming is really really hard a lot of blood sweat and tears goes into naming I'm sure you all know many to many many name deaths along the way but that's okay we're working together visual verbal and experience again to come up with names and test and learn as we go so what is that story in the name and then what what are those system ideas is this unlocking anything what's the potential and we keep doing this it or it or a iteratively well on an iterative basis until we come up with eight or ten that are really powerful and can connect that story and system that's what we did for silk and then we get to our one chose name and for us even though we presented 10 great names there was really one name that was bubbling to the top as the winner and that was evolved by Nature so we we love this name for a lot of reasons first it's really a beautiful shorthand for that strategy remember the strategy was about advancing the world's health that's evolved by unlocking nature's most elegant chemistry by nature so it really does tell the story really beautifully but what makes it a really great name is that it's a platform for starting a conversation with brands and consumers alike that conversation that needs to be had about the invisible problems and the invisible solutions and the reason this name can do that is because it's actually designed to tell you the benefit without having to work too hard right so you know that something has been evolved that's inherently a good thing and it implies a before state so we're not telling you that there are negative petrochemicals there before we can tell you that later but we may be peeking your interest we may be inspiring some questions what's been involved what does that mean how did nature come into play here but then what you think about I can't go back there but when you think about partnerships it really does work in tandem with every partner name so if you have Chanel locked up with evolved by nature and Nike evolved by Nature if you read that as a single idea you can understand that Chanel or Nike have been evolved by nature which is creates this value exchange between the two brands I'll show you a little bit more how that works the other thing we loved about this name was this little verbal gift in it so this by Nature Park we can take this and pair it with a brand level benefit like cleaner or a I think there's just a little lag here sorry or a product level benefit like stronger to start to tell a more complete story about what evolved by nature means and and what it does alright so then what happens is how do we do that we so we know our name starts a conversation right so that we know that skis are getting people understand what this of all by nature platform is but then shouldn't language be integral to that entire brand expressions so in other words how does their verbal design and inform both those signifiers and behaviors so what we did is you know ebn is as you now know e BN is this green chemistry company but what also what's interesting is this when we start with a name it's built to engage a conversation with people right but when we think about language and verbal designer being extremely important then of course from a design standpoint a visual design standpoint then type itself needs to be extremely important right so what happens then is we wanted to think about how we could continue that conversation around a little evolution into the typeface itself we know there's this kind of juxtaposition between science and nature so we really wanted that to be something where we could start with this pure natural silk cocoon obviously the nature but then end with this groundbreaking science which can disrupt industries being obviously the science portion of this right so not rocket science we went back to this idea of serif and sans but what we got really excited about was actually the evolution itself is extremely dynamic so we can't just have a static typeface and it can't be set in a single type way or a single style so we were this amazing typographer from Paris to try and think about how we could create this variable typeface which is constantly transitioning and programmatically evolving from one state to the other what's cool about that for us or at least was cool to us is we can start to build this system where we're constantly in flux and whatever conversation we need to say whatever amount of gravitas we need or sophistication we need depending on the partner brand the the language that the brand itself the behavior could flex so what we wanted to think about there was then if we're a verbally driven brand and that illustrates both problems and solutions and we can use typeface as a vehicle for that story of evolution but what we also needed was a visual signifier how do we actually have a shorthand for this and ultimately how is there another way that we can reveal there's something more to be discovered being a verbally driven brand we went back to language and there was this beautiful gift in the idea of an annotation or more specifically the asterisk the asterisk being a symbol where when you see it you know there's something more to be discovered I mean I'm really excited about that it's a big problem as we mentioned was thus like we need a way to give people and let people know there's something there so they and discover more without explicitly calling it out but the interesting thing about the Asterix today is it's almost used in the opposite way like it's used to hide something rarely will you ever look into what an Asterix is actually calling out so we wanted to shift that behavior from Asti the asterisks being a negative thing to actually all being harmful chemicals to actually something that's harmless for you so we put those two things together and when they put together that Asterix can trigger that evolution whatever evolved by nature is providing with to the brand we can then activate it and start to generate a conversation around it and that was kind of what ended up this is the static form of the brand but we wanted to kind of bake that evolution into it and it brings the benefits to the fore but it also creates a platform to start that story obviously variable type is quite sophisticated this was a startup and it's grown now but still they're people who can't necessarily flex and work with variable types so we built a script into it so in whatever platform you are in whether it be Microsoft Word or PowerPoint all you needed to do was just add that asterisks and it would automatically trigger the latest word that stood next to it so what was great is the idea we have this kind of symbol for change which we thought was really powerful it pays off on the questions it can answer them it can anticipate them but then most importantly it creates a conversation and interaction with the consumer so it's that signifying behavior coming together so now with our visual design in our verbal design coming together we actually don't have to say a whole lot to say a lot so you can use the asterisk strategically placed on a product in this case the leggings with a simple benefit and the payoff if you can see on the left hand side there were I guess it's your right hand side the the brand becomes the payoff so you understand that the the moisture-wicking is brought to you by evolved by nature and then as I was mentioning before that verbal gift that by nature part can work really well especially in motion but also in static to start to tell more of the story over time and yeah and I guess Jim was talking about earlier like we can actually then kind of use that verbal gift it kind of creates these partnerships but again what's been fantastic to see is they've been going to speak with partners it makes it a very unobtrusive way to actually be a partner so what's fantastic is we're starting to see a lot of like quite large companies who are both investing in the company and like committing to this Chanel being one and others being announced soon but ultimately what is great about that it gives us this incredible flexibility to continue that conversation and this is an important point yeah absolutely so it's said that you know this this is a verbally different brand and I've started with the name but of course you have to say more eventually we don't want to leave people hanging so what we created was the systematic approach where you can have the flexibility to say more say less create more intrigue than pay off with education in different ways all the while using all of the tools in our toolkit to connect with people and let them know what what they need to know which is that their there is something there that they they need to pay attention to so as again I mean this kind of goes on but as you can see like having this Burberry LED system gives us a lot of flexibility we can describe a lot or a little we can start to bring people into the story yeah so I think you know we knew that not only brands were important but we that consumers are important and influencers too so here you know we can use that that phrasal construct of the name to say something like created by let's say outdoor voices worn by Kayla who's a fitness influencer and evolved by nature so you you get all parts of the story all the people and players involved in one small space and the hope is over time that it becomes a standards mark as well that you know hopefully will start just as in the you know like 10 years ago you start to see the organic mark appear in on your groceries the hope is that at one point you start to see this March which can mark that can symbolize that there are no more harmful petrochemicals in this product you're buying and ultimately we wanted to build this a b2b to see brand so not just a business that trades in chemicals but ultimately one that can come by flex to also relate to consumers from a mission standpoint as well so that was the case study of going together and how we think verbal design could be like really powerful unlock that in the idea behind an entire brand yeah so hopefully you walk away you know understanding that today a brand really must be connected we have to bring story and system together thinking about both at the same time and letting both influence the other and then of course verbal design can be a really essential essential thread in that system so it always has a role in connecting the two but sometimes it really can unlock the whole idea and you could have a brand world that's built on language and on the power of verbal design and ultimately as you do think about how brand interactions are changing we really are primed for a future in which verbal design and experience design are truly one in the same and even brand design itself as our primary way of interacting with brands as shifting to be more language and conversation based and I think that kind of just leaves that this final thought is that what we're really excited about and I think what we will learn working together at r/ga is that designers above everything needs to be connectors and not just kind of focus on our own craft but actually ask the right questions and think about how together we can make those connections among two people's perspectives crafts and then ultimately create more powerful ideas and we're impacting forward and that's it thank you
