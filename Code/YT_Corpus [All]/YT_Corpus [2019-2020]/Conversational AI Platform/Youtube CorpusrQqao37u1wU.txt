 There are estimated 90,000 threatened species across the globe. To understand what puts a species at risk, we need to know where are they born, how many survive, where do they go, how far do they go?  At Wildbook, we are using an algorithm to digitally tag individual animals much like a human fingerprint. So this is a new whale shark for science?  Yes and we named her Wilma.  Wilma the whale shark.  Microsoft AI gives us the building blocks to analyze public streams of photos and videos, and identify individual animals in an instant. [MUSIC]. AI can determine location, date of sighting, migration patterns, and even in animals social group, and an intelligent agent can contact the content's owner, and ask for the missing detail. Microsoft's AI for good initiative gives us the technology to create a comprehensive view of the planet's biodiversity. In the last 10 years, we've identified 10 times more whale sharks than ever recorded in human history. By leveraging citizen scientists together with researchers, we can form conservation policies. Microsoft AI will help us accelerate our work by empowering people to take action.  What we get back is "wow" this is amazing! [MUSIC]
