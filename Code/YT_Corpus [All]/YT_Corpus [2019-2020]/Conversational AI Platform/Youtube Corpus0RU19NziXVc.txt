 So let's get started It's two o'clock so welcome everybody Thanks for tuning in to this webinar Build a Bot in One Hour I have my trusty Head of Customer Success here Michael Larsen who will be taking over in a minute I just wanted to give you all a warm welcome remind you to mute your microphone so that we can just give our presentation and go on with the build a bot workshop If you have any questions please type them in in the chat window or raise your hand and we'll If you have any concern regarding the technology if something's not working just also write in the chat and we'll take care of that So thanks everybody for tuning in and I'll leave the floor to Michael Thank you Okay welcome to this webinar about the Build a Bot in one Hour Actually, we have one and a half hours I hope every one of you will stay during the session I will start sharing my screen and make a little presentation and feel free to ask actually during the session Just use the text and we'll take care of that I'll share my screen Okay Okay my name is Michael Larsen and I just want to make a short presentation So before I joined BotXO I have been at BotXO for nearly three years actually nearly from the start I was a Customer Service Manager in Topdanmark the second largest insurance company in Denmark and been working with change management and my focus is actually on customer value and looking the at the organization from the customer's perspective actually is what I'm driven of So I'm not a normal tech guy Just an ordinary line of business human in this Bot world actually My position right now in BotXO I'm the Head of Customer Success and Academy and have had a lot of projects in my hand plus 100 projects actually so that's some experience I hope you could benefit from and of course, I'll try to do that Okay let's get started The agenda for this meeting: Actually in the left side you can see the agenda but overall it's about a short introduction to chatbot and the thinking behind going into this bot world actually and the next step will be after the introduction and we have looked into some of the tips and tricks I have for you We'll build a bot live no preparation actually, it's very scary for me because we'll do it in one hour and let's see I will during the session involve you and let's see what we get Hopefully we'll have a product We'll have a chatbot And that chatbot you will have in an HTML file after the meeting We'll send an email if we succeed So that's the plan So let's go for the first step It's maybe a little bit weird to have a picture of Mars but actually what I experienced from working with a lot of different customers Every customer actually has this vision or strategy They want to be more efficient They want to be better at handling customers increase customer satisfaction, increase self-serve and so on So the strategy from the sea level in the organization is often very clear and that's the direction What I experience is that long view and that vision could actually be a problem when you start in the chatbot configuring a chatbot So my advice is: The first small right step is actually the best step And to use this parallel Let's go back to If the vision is to land on Mars and live on Mars Let's go back to the 50's and 60's and remember the history So the technology in the 50's was not at a stage where you could travel to Mars But the first step was to build a spaceship travel in space and of course you know the history about a monkey and we landed on the moon and the program and the ISS International Space Station and now we have SpaceX So my advice here is to remember you have the long view, you have the strategy but you need to take the right step And in different organizations the step can be different Actually this is the first time you want to go into AI and you want to build a chatbot or you will work with machine learning and AI of course, that is another step for a big organization being into AI and machine learning for a long time that could be another step So remember The next step is always the best step actually You could focus so much on the strategy and the vision And you lose the first step and you are more obtained of tomorrow's technology instead of being obtained of what is the technology and the possibility today and take those steps It also give you experience and another angle is also that it will give you the knowledge internally in the organization that gives opportunity to work with the technology So my advice is: Take the step And take the right first step Remember to ask questions if you have any questions during the session Please write a question No? Yeah one second So I thought there was a question about the webinar being recorded So the webinar is recorded I just wanted to I forgot to mention it before And the recording will then be available on our YouYube channel after the session is completed So you will be receiving a link to it after the webinar And yes feel free to ask any questions as we go Okay so let's jump into the strategy Take the first step Let's start with: okay what is the problem? What is the problem you want to solve? And normally what I see It's focusing on customer service It's often frequently asked questions It could also be internal service It could be HR, IT It could be for people to access internal information. product launch, crisis communication, sales lead generation I think there's a possible use case for chatbots in every situation where you have a conversation So remember that when I'm talking about the chatbot It's actually The right name is actually conversational AI And a conversation is a human to a human That is a conversation That's the task with the chatbot We want to imitate that interaction between two people having a conversation Now it will be a person and a bot having that conversation so that's Conversational AI And the problem is it's often in customer service it's the inbound that's a pressure on customer service or the internal organization and if you have peak periods it's very very difficult to plan actually So some good advice is to try to understand which type of questions do you have And I believe every organization know which kind of inbounds they have in the organization And of course also think about which kind of this type of question is a candidate for automation An automation is very easy when you have a standard answer to those questions And I try to make it very simple and it sounds like it's very easy but remember that in the organization you work in a way today and it's the same way I actually want you to think about chatbots So it's the same logic actually so types of questions and also candidates for automation There are two ways to look at the inbounds: There's being reactive and that's actually normal in service that's answering all the inbounds And if you're not able to answer the inbounds you'll hire some more people to take care of that That's normal Another solution is of course to put a chatbot in front so, first line support taking care of these inbounds and be online 24/7 and take the pressure off of the inbounds actually and help the operation Another way to think about the inbounds and also position a chatbot that's being proactive Being proactive with a chatbot could be We know we have sold something sent a confirmation mail and if there's any doubt about when it arrived and so on you will actually create a ticket: "send the email" or ask for it in another channel "take a phone call" But a way to prevent that inbound could actually be built in a deep link in that outgoing email or communication and that could be a direct link for chatbot and that chatbot could be specialized in taking care of that event And because it will be a unique link and maybe also add some information about the user but that's another story you're able to make it a little bit more personalized and you don't need to start with a very open question you could actually I recognize that the user is this context Okay So let me show you maybe I think maybe most of you know what is a chatbot but I have some different examples I'll make it very fast actually But let me show you something This is the Rockwool bot It had a lot of intents actually and I will come up here for a moment This is very classic on the website built in front of the existing website and you have the chatbot in the lower right corner actually It will pop up here and it will start Now it's starting I have tried it today and the configuration is they want to keep track on the latest conversation That's the reason why you can see it in the widget here But let's say it starts from here now and I will ask about where is the nearest dealer actually So the chatbot needs to understand this freely writing text and that's AI that's a Natural Language Understanding So we'll train AI module understanding variation of this question Actually we have some pre-built so it will be very easy to do In this situation there will be a difference between markets and there'll also be differences between the product in this situation I chose Rockwool And it will look up dynamically Nothing is hard-coded here and we're able to see 1.7 kilometers from here that's the supply And I could click here and get the map and how to get there actually But I'll say yes thank you and leave this conversation So this is a classic chatbot actually Another way we also have The Fragrance Shop that's also a nice one that's built in the Zendesk widget And let's take a look at that The story started last year actually before Black Friday and they managed to get the bot online very fast and it helped out with all the peak in requests during Black Friday Okay you could ask here Where is my order? I just want to to show you this is inside the Zendesk widget So it works inside the Zendesk widget like other channels like Facebook Messenger or other channels you actually know So again it needs to pick up the freely written text, understand that and the reply is designed by The Fragrance Shop in this situation So it's very cool I'm not continuing the flow but I think you can understand what is happening here And we have another bot here Work Live Stay I will not show it but I just want to show the widget Instead of having that chatbot icon, in the lower right corner we have an iFrame here and it's designed here and you could ask questions about international work involves in Denmark So the Matas chatbot is also living in the Zendesk widget So this is the problem you want to solve and the chatbot is an example of that and the design is always about the conversational AI But let me continue to the next slide The idea of designing a chatbot: My experience is You could talk about that there are different roles when you design it You could talk about that you are an AI manager Conversational Designer There is also Content Designer, AI Manager, Web Developer, and a lot of different roles But my experience is if you bring it down to the line of business people and ask about how do you do it today For instance in service organizations they have maybe a call quality, they have quality flows, scripted flows They have decided what is their quality And by defining that you are also able to design this flow into the chatbot So my advice is Focus on what is working today and design the bot towards that My experience as a Customer Service Manager and also working with the organization and seeing the organization from the customer's perspective I see a very simple call flow when a customer calls and when I'm working with customers I always ask about Is this also the way you are working in your organization? And actually they say yes always I have never met an organization big or small saying this is totally not the way we are doing it So the first step will be I compare it to the phone So you will say welcome and how can I help you? So be polite and helpful and just ask that question So the customer will of course answer that and the Customer Service Agent needs to understand that question If you don't understand that question you'll guess And my experience is humans they are guessing and they will not get the right answer and you need to go back again to the start and ask again So what was the issue about And it's exactly the same here It's the same logic Then when you understand the question you will give the answer or drive an answer flow with a follow-up question But to make it very simple understand the question, answer and then have the follow-up question Was it helpful? just to check And if it was helpful another follow-up question could be Do you have another question? And then it would be goodbye I think that is the way almost every organization designed the service Yeah, there's a question? Yeah so Michael I see a question from Theo Can a chatbot propose products through understanding a question? Yeah it can actually A good example I'll not show it right now but we could do it in another session go into The Fragrance Shop and try their chatbot actually They have built-in a flow called Fragrance Finder It was designed in a landing page where I have a totally classic question flow a web form And it made a search on the web so you are able to understand you are asking for product recommendation It's actually a pretty good flow they made and then they integrated to that Fragrance Finder and build it in the chatbot So it's a big yes actually So please write in the text Can you see this flow also cover the way your organization is working? Just a yes and no, that could be very fine I will continue meanwhile you are saying yes or no In human to human contact it will also be the human who will not understand We call it fallback And that means I don't understand what you actually are asking for So you will say something like Sorry I didn't understand Could you please rephrase your question? We call it fallback in the design of a chatbot You could also be in the situation where a colleague needs to hand it over to another department or another colleague or second-line support And that's exactly the same in a chatbot The chatbot needs to hand it over to a human for live chat or email or whatever I call it quality flow and spend a little time on this because I think it's actually very important to make it so simple And you can compare it to the organization today and how you work today It's a conversational design and you have a conversational design today in the organization that's just human driving the conversational design You know actually what to do Let me jump to the next slide How to start: Many people talk about the data and structured data And of course, if you have data about your inbounds and your needs and what is the problem That's fine Use it Many companies big and small companies they don't have structured data and they need to spend a lot of time to structure it For a service bot it could be more efficient just having a two-hour workshop with the line of business people Ask them What is the top 10 questions you have in your organization? You can wake them at 3AM in the morning and ask them that question and they know what the answer is You could also ask them about How do we want to reply to that and the variation of the question? So if you don't have structured data and it's very difficult to and will take a long time to structure it Think about using data from the human's head and ask for it And about the Tone of Voice There's a lot of discussion about Tone of Voice and of course, you need to have the same Tone of Voice as the rest of the organization so it will be a part of your communication strategy or channel strategy of course The easiest way to do that is actually to ask the human I call it here the data from the human's heart Ask for it because they know the Tone of Voice They know how to reply to these questions A little practical tip is to make a role play If you are in doubt about what is important how to answer and how to work with it make a role play Two persons: one is playing the customer one is the customer agent and then just take it from there and map it And remember also to map what the agent is doing the customer service agent is doing on the screen because that will give you input on how to think about integration to IT systems If the vision and the idea is to get the bot having access to the same data as a human it's a good way to to map it actually It's very low practical but it works actually The next the next step here I call it the project plan Actually my experience is big and small companies small and big projects It's the same process Big companies: more politics more governance Small companies: could be a lack of competences But it's the same process actually It's defining the scope of the chatbot, the business value what are you aiming for? So the vision And when you have to find that in preparation step one You're going to design a design We'll work on in a little bit I'll show you a platform How to build a bot in one hour After you have designed the bot you want to go live You will define the channel Is it in Zendesk? Is it a webchat on the website? Is it Facebook messenger? Is it another channel? It's up to you That definition will also give you an idea of who should be in the project group from the start the product team Because if you need to add some script on the website of course you need to involve the person who can place that script on the website and that's it Then we have the launch I call it hyper care So after I go live you will have a hyper care period Ask yourself Who will maintain the bot and improve the bot from there? Often it would be the line of business person and that means the line of business person is very important in the project from the beginning and also in the design phase so When you know the bot and the design of the bot you're also able to improve it and you are able to to look into Where is the problem? Where can I improve it? And the next step will be maintenance and then scale For maintenance you could ask a question internally And I normally ask this precise question when I have workshops with companies I ask Who will have the one-to-one conversation about performance? Like you have with the team lead and the human agents And they look at me and say That's a very good question But the question is actually about Who owns this business case? Who is responsible for performance? And who will need to have the analytics and reports where you can follow the performance? And of course also decide how to prioritize improvements and how to do it And then the last step is scaling the bot or figuring out a new scope for a new bot actually so live with a chatbot that's how I see it and it works every time and it's very simple different organizations are mature in the different steps in different ways but mainly it's about what is the problem, what is the value, what are we aiming for then do it and go live and launch it and maintain it and scale it after that it's not a big deal okay I will finish up this intro and just want to mention that the BotXO Community and we call it community because we want and we try to be customer-driven I know we have some customers participating in this webinar also today so that's very fine We have our Customer Experience Group every Wednesday from 2 PM to 4 PM what we call bot Wednesday and that's open mic, that's inspiration, that if I have a problem with the configuration I need to integrate to Salesforce I need to to do many things so we'll talk about that and that's the open mic is totally free actually, you don't need to to buy hours of us to to talk about that a very low practicality thing of course you can sign up for a free trial after this and follow us on LinkedIn Twitter and Facebook and I would really recommend reading our BotXO blog there's a lot of inspiration, high tech actually, on the AI engine but it's also low practicality stuff about a lot of different things designing a bot and it's also new stuff like using NFC tags as a trigger for a bot so sometimes there are some funny things also and we are looking into every part of tech actually so for now I think you, yeah I just want to continue building the bot and and that's the next step maybe I just want a glass of water and I could ask a question any questions for now? So in the meantime, I've shared a a couple of blog posts that we have worked on general topics like 'How to build a smart bot' or 'How to avoid the most common UX mistakes', so I've shared them in the chat there so if you are interested yeah please stop by and have a read we have a ton of material also so if you're interested in a specific subject within you know this kind of technology or in chatbot building just type it in the chat and I'll find some material to to share either here or we'll reach out to you later so if you have any questions throughout this webinar just feel free to drop them here. So yeah so I guess the first part of the presentation and inspiration part is over, so then Michael now will proceed to the actually fun part Oh yeah, the scary part which is the actual uh bot building so we'll have a look at the BotXO Platform and how it works and how a bot is actually made which is what you're all are here for I imagine so without further ado let's get started with that yeah sure very good. Were there any questions? No questions so far but I'll keep an eye on the chat if somebody Were there any yes and no to my question? No, but I would be interested actually to know what are the industries that you guys represent today whether you work in HR, finance, e-commerce what are your, yeah, where do you come from in terms of industry because I think it would be very useful for us to know also as we go forward and develop a bot together with you to see what you guys are up to and to to make sure that we have some input so we can build a bot actually that is interesting for you that is actually useful for you so feel free to drop by what kind of industry you come from. Yeah okay very good Bea. So, we have two e-commerce so far, René and Theo. So let's wait that's a candidate for a bot maybe? Yeah, maybe yeah because I'm thinking that I see a lot of people actually with the company that have registered that have some e-commerce business so maybe it could be interested. Healthcare, we have Christian in healthcare so that would be maybe. Could be if you also write okay it could be interesting to also make the bot live right now but you can think about it and write it to Bea and you will tell me, yeah, then I will go to the chatbot and show it now then we could talk about that in a minute or two Okay the BotXO Platform is an AI platform and it's Conversational AI and we are focusing on chatbots right now but actually, the Conversational AI is also about voice bots and we have some use cases about voice bots also and also voice bots for IBR in phone systems, so you will have instead of press one two and three you'll be asked a question and the bot is able to pick that up and write the conversation and use that but that's another topic, let's focus on the chatbot that's a text. So, our platform is a bot builder there's an AI Trainer integrated so you don't need to connect to other services for that is built-in actually yesterday we got the great news that we actually was the best performing AI for the BERT model and that was independent papers that wrote that so that's very new actually, I don't have details just had it in in high level description so we also have Webhook Builder. The Webhook Builder is interesting because we want to make it easy for line of businesspeople to integrate to different systems, IT systems and of course, we have the analytics but let me jump into the platform and I will show you instead of talking about it yeah Let me start. My idea here is to start totally from scratch and then I want to introduce you for this template I will work on and that's also a template our customers are working on. That means very short time to live and fast to value So in this situation, I would choose a do-it-yourself bot and the logic in our system here is having this module, you could move it around so a module is actually where you can design what is the text from the bot and I just want to keep that 'Hello' from the bot and in this situation, I want to to make two buttons I want to say to a human and and please ask if you have questions, we also have some Youtube tutorial videos showing this actually. Okay say 'Okay' I'll save it and I'll test it here and you can see so this is the message in the module and this was the two buttons I created. In the right-side panel here we have what we call a Debugger. That means we're able to see what is happening in the bot, so we could follow the configuration and the flow and how it is evaluated so it's very easy to configure and troubleshoot actually and and this is the view of, a test view, of the widget actually. Okay, now I want to configure two more modules and they are modules for speak to a human. I'll go into that module this is an internal name of course, speak to a human For this purpose, I just want to say 'speak to a human'. Of course, this is not conversational, I just want to show you the functionality and I'll call this module 'Where is my order?' That's it. Very good, I'll save it Okay, so I want to connect these buttons with these two modules and I do it from here, you can see we have two tabs. We have the message tab and we have the connection tab. Very easy. We click here and classic connection if the response in this module contains 'speak to a human' we'll go to a module called 'Speech version 1' if we choose this one, we'll say 'Where is my order?' and now we have the lines. I'll save it and I'll test it I'll click on 'Speak to a human' and here you can see it's evaluated by module connection number two, I just set up, and we'll go into the module called 'Speak to a human' okay let's have a situation where I'm not clicking on the buttons but I want to write freely written text actually so we have our NLU training here it's our AI manager and I'll go into that here we'll find some, we'll do it in English, we have a lot of different languages it's trained and pre-built in many languages please ask if you have any questions but all the Scandinavian and Nordic and European languages we are supporting, actually, out of the box so that's very good and all languages could be trained but it's only about the pre-trained modules so, okay here we have some pre-built intents and you have also access to those. In this situation, I just want to to activate this common small talk because I know something is relevant here and I'll train the bot. What is happening here, we are adding this AI module to this bot actually, so we are putting the brain and the understanding into this bot now so it's able to understand freely written text we need to configure the answer but first, we want to train the understanding and that's what's happening here and normally it will take about 20 to 30 seconds to train it the first time and after that, of course, you are able to to to add sentences and train it even more you're also able to train your own module and that's also very easy and if you need me to show you that of course, I will do that yeah so when it's finished we will we'll test it and we'll see how will the performance be and this is the AI we have in our backend and we will use that and it's a pretty good module and okay now it is trained and we have the tester here and we can test, for instance, I want to speak. Maybe some of you have another sentence you want to try we can test it, please write it because it's not totally fake so if you have something about 'I want to speak to a human' please write it to Bea and we'll try that and test that live and maybe it will work or let's see but the situation here is we added this sentence it's recognized in English it's what we call 'common small talk' that's the domain and the intent is speak to a human it has a high confidence score it's 99 % sure about this is the right intent actually. Do we have any not so far but please write imagine that you're on an e-commerce website what would you ask the bot? So right below some questions related to purchases orders whatever yeah that's a good one so we could actually go in and activate, we have another domain here and I know shipping maybe he could add where's my order variation of of that sentence, we could try that out otherwise, I'll do it myself I just trained, do we have that? So we have another question. Would it be possible in other languages? Yeah it would there are different ways it's more like a business decision different ways to do it some companies they want to use translation tools like Microsoft Translate or Google Translate we can do it dynamically and the problem using those tools is about if you have a very specific industry language or company language but you can do, we can use that and it's we have some customers doing that some customers are also using translations tools like crowding or it could be hard-coded in the bot. We have for our sentence analysis, we are able to recognize the language you are writing in so we are able to make the path in that direction we're also able to take, if we're on a website the URL into the bot that means we're able to to take the location and from the location we could define if the location is in Denmark we could start the bot in Danish, if it is Sweden we'll start it in Swedish and it's more like a business decision how to make a multilingual bot that's not yes there are many different wishes actually but let's see 'where is my order?' yeah, so we have two What are your shipping terms? Yeah fine I'll take that. We have another question from Jacob, as a suggestion about what to ask the bot: 'What are your shipping terms?' 'What are your shipping terms?' So, it will be recognized by this 'Terms and Condition' And that's fine but also about shipping provider will open up here and you can see the different domains shipping, tracking, time, change, cost, contact, who's the provider, do you provide on-site shipping, or what is the location and do we want to deliver in Denmark or Sweden or I know Samuel from Gana is also participating that's very cool and there's a lot of different possibilities here and you can also see related to shop, the most common intent is added to this I will say around 70 to 80 maybe higher of all relevant intents related to e-commerce actually we are supporting out-of-the-box in many languages, so it should be it should be possible. Any other questions? Not so far but if you have any other question that you would like to ask the bot and see if it recognizes the intent please type them below yeah okay, I will continue. Let's continue building the bot in the meantime. Very fine. So this is very good so, what I want to do here I want to add the ability for the bot to listen to those in a new intents action. So we have what we call Global Connection. A Global Connection is actually the same as a connection added to the module but it will listen to the conversation unless it's told anything else Okay, so I will configure this the NLU is the brain, now we need to define what is the answer in this situation, I want to define the intent as 'Speak to a human' low confidence is fine because it's validated with a higher score here and it needs to go into that module we call 'Speak to a human' this is also a discussion about what is called NLG so generated language driven by AI, I don't see any companies right now who wants to hand that over to to AI they want to have 100 percent control of the content and so that's that's very good you have 100 % control of the content and the answer and we'll use AI to recognize the language here so I'll test again and instead of clicking on 'Speak to a human' I'll write 'Is there a person I can talk to?' yeah very good. So it's evaluated, I've never written that sentence before and it's not very good English either but it worked actually and that's good so it was evaluated by Global Connection, the connection we just made and it went to the answer 'Speak to a human' and of course, you could drive it from there, yeah. We have another question from Theo: 'Would the bot understand spelling mistakes?' Yeah it will, that's a very good question and spelling mistakes is actually the reason why you want to use AI instead of having keywords spelling mistakes, one of the algorithms in this processing about the input is actually correcting for spelling mistakes so yes it will be a part of it there's also some other algorithms working in the pipeline for analyzing the sentence and using the AI for that so the answer is yes. And when we're talking about feeding this engine this AI module we talked about if you build your own intents industry specific or specific for your company actually, I would say I could make it work now with only one or two or three sentences added to this model but that's what I call an event NLU for production but I will recommend between 15 and 30 example sentences for every intent and then you will have a working module a little bit more robust than the event model so that's it that was the short answer. Okay. So we have another question: 'So is the bot just getting smarter over time?' that's actually also a good question regarding the way the NLU works Yeah. So, right now of course we will to the pre-build. So one of the benefits of being in a community is also benefit from the community and also be able to add to the community so what we want to do when you use our pre-built is improve the performance so we'll do that that's on our side it will not be smarter by itself the risk, of course, is that it is biased or it will be biased but what we recommend is, for now, that the Bot Operator as we call them, will look into the data and improve the bot and add the sentences needed for better performance so that will be a part of the daily operation for companies and you can also decide how to do it and if you want to improve it or is it good enough so that's part of the daily operation so it will be smarter if you do something or you will benefit from the community. Yeah any other question? No other questions for now but I'll just summarize in bullet points what yeah the answers that Michael has given so far okay good. Do we have any company who wants uh to have the Bot so if anybody from the audience would like to volunteer to build a bot or some sort of prototype you have a website we can look at, it could be very cool, let's do it So we have René that works in e-commerce Theo as well we have Iman as well. We could take Iman I think it's Interflora right? We could do it in English I think Iman is in Danish, yeah give me two seconds. You just had a message Okay, let's see I actually know him. Yes. Okay so take, I will take the UK Interflora and try that out because I think it's best that we do it in English. Okay that's scary a little bit scary so let's do it. So, what we talk about is the structure here that is the bot building and of course, we have the NLU, Global Connection, we also have some possibility to set up the script and for the website and so on we have the Webhook Builder here and Analytics here, I will not go in details for that for now when we start with a customer, the first half hour we were through actually, that will be a part of discovering what is the use case and what is the scope and so on and by understanding that we'll also understand how to build a bot, so I have made this bot and this bot is actually not special for this event it's the bot we normally use as a template to build and the logic this is maybe a little bit confusing but I want to show you the logic okay I know you cannot read it and that's fine for now but the logic back to the quality flow okay we have this start this will be the welcome 'Hi, how can I help you?' recognize if you're writing in another language in this situation then English if you say hi it will say hi so it added some small talk to the beginning the next step will be it will understand what is the question, we'll go to the NLU evaluate the freely written text, it will go into this area where I have put in all the domains we are supporting out of the box for e-commerce and that's, you just need to to write the answer in here and then after that we'll go into the past so this will be the answer and the answer flows in here all of them and the logic here will be 'Was it helpful?', 'Do you have another question?' and 'Goodbye'. In here we have the fallback flow we have the handover and the reason why we have it here on the left side that is normally we'll not change that but we'll build the bot and we'll build it from from this base to the right or down in the screen actually, so that's that's it okay let me let me try to go into Interflora okay I don't know the website but let's, so normally I'll say okay what do we have and we'll go into that so let's see what's happening here maybe I could get a little bit of transformation help here could be yeah we have the FAQ here so a good thing working with the part about the structure and which kind of question it should be able to answer you have already decided a structure on the website and many times that's actually the structure you want to build in the bot but you want to it's another channel than the website so you want to have a shorter answer or maybe it will also be possible to optimize the answer flow by driving it by conversational AI actually but the idea here back to the question before maybe we could go into this one and it could be inspired and I just want to add something it's also possible to use web scrapers and web scraper will actually I'll open up one here I have three different scrapers for websites, I'll not do it live now. Okay it's picking it up So, actually, there are tools out there to scrape the web so you're able to to instead of doing this manually you're able to scrape the website and have the structure and you can work on that in an excel sheet or whatever sheet you want to work in In this situation I just want to go into this delivery let's see maybe there's some track and trace, delivery time tracking orders and take that, okay so this is tracking orders. I will copy that answer I know this will be too long answer for tracking orders but I'll show you the logic actually, I have made a flow for this actually maybe it will work so the idea is to have, okay I want to to to track and I want to have a message in here I'll put it in and in this situation you can see you'll contact a phone or email and you have a description that's the way it is today Another way well, of course, I will keep this it needs to be customized a little bit I'll put it in here also needs to be customized but let it let it be as it is right now okay normally one of the big problems in e-commerce is actually this question so let's save the changes and publish it so the idea is working with this template it's only about adding the answer and only about adding the NLU to understand this freely written text in this situation because this is a normal question I have added a Global Connection here I think so and I know it's either shipping tracking or it's shipping time it will go to shipping tracking module here in that situation so so that's fine I'll test it and you can see what will happen can we say the f word here? No? Go ahead never written that before, okay, so it goes to that specific module we just updated a good way could be having a follow-up question asking about the order number and could put in some validation some code to validate if it's the right input in this template I haven't made any validation so I will just write like this and my email is okay and then normally you will fire webhook to your backend and search for the order number, have the double confirmation by the email so there's a match between the email and the order number and then you for security reason you want to you are able to give the answer and that could be a very personalized answer here and the follow-up question is 'Was it helpful?' yes instead of writing 'Yes' I could actually write 'Yeah' because the yes is also driven by the NLU so it understands freely writing text related to the intent called 'Yes' 'Thanks, do you have another question?' and 'Yes, I have another question' and you have another question? Yeah there is a question from Theo Can we copy the patterns box you have built for customer service purpose time saving and inspiration? Yeah that's part of our service actually we are a platform and we are not looking for a lot of the consulting hours we are a platform and therefore we want to give you the tools to make it very easy So short time from project to launch that means lower cost and a better return of investment actually, so the question is yes, the answer is yes we want to give you this if you become a customer and we will, of course, if you need onboarding, how to work on it we'll do that but we'll provide these kinds of tools if you want that and we work we'll make it as easy as possible for line of business people to work with that, I hope that was the right answer okay, I want. There's another question, yeah there's another question from René: If you build a bot in your setup can that be copied into other languages by translating or do we need to start over for each country? That depends on the setting you want to do, we can do it dynamically and we can do it in different ways I think it's it could be another topic but we could have a follow-up session about multilingual bot, we have different ways to do it for instance we have a customer having 40 languages it's about, I will not mention how many intents, it will be thousands of questions related to those countries actually, so we have a solution for that, you can also hard code it if you want to do that, so there are different ways to do it We have another question: 'How long is the time between question and reply and why is it that long? Have you thought about that specifically to make it more natural? That's a very good question and I think many Content Designers and communication experts talk about it and I actually have had a bot operator education with one of the lead Danish marketing and communication bureaus in copenhagen and they actually saw that the pause between messages is a it's a very powerful tool  to communicate actually there's nothing right or wrong but it's about how to how to communicate to the to the people. Then we have another question: Does the bot have any kind of easy integration with Whatsapp, social media etc? Yeah, for instance, easy integration with Facebook Messenger that's easy and we we are able to integrate with every channel actually, so I can. We have in our bot settings we have a channel integration here and that's some different channels and you have all the Azure channels here also and we're able to to connect to different channels also I want to show you the webhook here I'll not go through it but we have a marketplace where we have a lot of different standard integrations and we have created the webhook you just need to add the API key and then decide the data you want to use in the bot and we're able to use them in the bot so we have a lot of different possibilities here you can see the logos I will not go into details about that but that's a lot of different standard integration our idea again we don't want to build yes we do it if it's needed and customers need help we customize some webhooks and APIs but most of the situation we just need the IT department to give us the API key and then it's from the business people needs to define what is the information you need and you just need to add it to the response from the webhook and we'll use that in the configuration so that's it so the answer is yes we're able to integrate to everything then we have another question: How long is the pause between question and reply? You can define it and I will yeah it's customizable Yeah. Let me go into this bot it's customizable, yeah, you have this delay and it's in milliseconds so it's actually possible to set up the delay you can configure it precisely as you want to so pause here It's also about is it young people, is it high lix or is it what is it? you can define it. Ask 10 people about the pause and the delay and you will have 10 different answers to that any other questions? No other questions so far I will just link a couple of product pages here in the chat so you guys can have a look at our product page the page or easy integrations which is the page that we saw just a moment ago and then a page about our NLU which is basically the bot intelligence machine so to speak, so you can find more information there Good back to, if there's no other question I will go back to this will not create the whole FAQ but you can see how to do it actually, let's see what could be interesting that could be about us maybe that could be let's see about Interflora, click here so I'll take this in this bot, I have pre-made all the modules in this panel you're able to hide what is not used right now so it will give a better view but actually, you are able to show some of this and I have I have this about company here, this one in this situation I want to make a card card read about a short text could be refining and then just add open the URL and let's try to open it in in the chatbot and we could add a image here for this purpose just add this one and go back here could be this text of course it needs to be customized so the trick here is to activate the NLU about the company and it's here and it's activated and could be: Who are you? and it picks up about company sharing provider 'Hello' and that's it, okay and go into the Global Connection here and configure it: 'If NLU understands' and I call the name of the module the same as the intent so it's easy to connect those two so let's try it out and test it: 'Who are you?' And going to this module of course you can see this is a very long text and you need to to do something about that but the idea is here 'You can read more about it', make a beautiful image you could make more images of course like a carousel and I want to click here and it actually starts in the bot so we're able to read the web inside the bot and like an iFrame, of course, this side is not designed to be shown like this so instead of that we could open up another tab and you will see the side here so that's also a way to do it we can also do it dynamically so you don't need to hardcode all those carousels or cards but we can pick up by one of your search engines we can pick up the information and we can return that dynamically so that's also possible and we use that, for instance, for Zendesk Guide but we also have our combination with a Google search engine and our AI we call it the BotXO Search Engine it's very powerful and you can do some site searches also  so we can do dynamic carousels for that and that's a very easy way to  make the bot able to search on websites actually okay back to the bot I think we are not able to get more content in that bot but I want to show you something Good. Let's try what I call a happy path A happy path is defined by the six steps I defined earlier so here it will actually ask: 'Oh I want to change something here' Let's say I'm the BotXO chatbot and I want to change that click from the Debugger to see Interfloras chat and I want to do something else to pick up that image and we can, we connect.. We're running out of time so I will not do that but I can change the icon actually, okay let's test it again, I'll show you 'Hi I'm Interfloras chatbot' 'Who are you?' and we know that will be yes, and when I click on that I'll go to the website I would say: 'Yes' here 'Do we have another question?', 'No', so this is a happy path and it will say, hopefully, it will say: 'Goodbye' if you closed, you can close it okay, 'Have a great day' and then just close it from there I want to show you another path this is what you should focus on when you build a bot that's a happy path but what we have built in this template is actually being able to to: 'I have a question in Danish', let's see haven't tried that, okay it's picking that up and in this situation, it seems like you're writing in another language than English Our chatbot is able to answer in English, okay good we can continue in English, I'll do that we also have a question, Michael, if you want to take a question so: 'Could you ask for a review at the end of the bot conversation?' Yeah, we can do that and if you use our web widget we have actually a product launch coming up and that's about triggering those reviews, so we are able to do that you can do it in the conversation but we're also able to let the chatbot trigger actions on the website it's not a secret but it's a big, it's coming, yeah let's keep it if you're interested in that, that's a webinar for itself, I think Yeah. But we're able to do that, so if you have the form we're able to trigger it actually Okay, I could.. 'Tell me a joke' so the fallback here will be okay: 'Sorry, I didn't understand please rephrase it' and you can configure it like you want: 'Tell me a joke' Try again and then it has another fallback text: 'Thanks for trying again' and 'I want to contact Support' and in this, I'll disconnect the debugger in this situation, it will check for an available agent for live chat in Zendesk setup, it's a standard configuration very easy to do actually if no agent is available, it will go to create a ticket to create an email 'My name is Michael', very good plus 45 in Denmark, 'What's your question about?' it's about tests and then it will actually send me an email and will check if it was successful sent or not, so there'll be some validation so we're sure about it and the information in this situation, it's a success and we go into we check the webhook status actually So that's it and the last thing I want to show you is actually this configuration We have another question. Yes 'Is there any literature you can recommend for Conversational AI? There's a lot but we also have our support centre for example Yeah, yeah we have and actually also our Support Bot on the platform here we have that also and you can use that so so we are using that and this is a beta version we are going a little bit wild in a while about the bot on on our website here we have our health center in here, maybe we could paste the URL in the chat and also blogs I think the problem about what can we recommend if you have a book it will be outdated before it's written actually so what I will recommend is follow us, of course, but also other companies about AI and chatbots and chatbot websites. It's the best actually We also have recently released a blog post gathering the 25 top artificial intelligence and big data publications that we can link here yeah sure. I think our blog post is very good yeah, I'm just following on Linkedin and different forums also inspired by people I have one chatbot book in Danish and think it is pretty good we could also add a link for that, yeah but I'm not a fan of books for new tech actually, it will be out there before it's written, I'm sorry to say Okay, another question? Okay, let me finish up Oh would like to have half an hour more we have three minutes more Michael I know, I know yeah let's let's focus on this Okay, the email was sent and how to do that is using our webhook so a webhook is actually just a connection to a functionality in this situation, we send an email and the email you can define in that webhook I will not go into details it's very easy and takes less than, yeah, one minute to configure it I could actually change it now and and send the email to one of your email addresses it's very easy so adding a webhook for integration to whatever you saw were integrated with Zendesk, Salesforce, Dixa and other systems and also some Google tools and translation tools and yeah a lot of different integration possibilities too you just need to have the API and put in the webhook here and then we'll get the result and do the action actually that is needed so that's it I think I just want to finish up so we have the bot builder we have the templates and of course, you can use that The template I think is very cool because you have the starting point of course, you need to change the context but you have a template to start with you also have after you have given the answer you have the standard flow set up here and also to have another question in the chat and the fallback flow and the hand over flow, we have as a pre-build what you need to focus on and decide is which kind of questions do you want the bot to be able to to answer and for that go into the website, look at the website, check out the pre-built, in the NLU, then decide what to activate use the modules I have created in the template fill in the content the answer you want to to give to the customer have some deep links to the website if you want to do that make an answer flow if you have the tracking flow here and then as the first phase I think the best way if you have IT resources, of course, you integrate as much as possible the role-play method, use that method, that's very efficient and do that if you don't have IT resources just just go ahead hard code what you need, deep link into a website and it could bring value and, of course, deflect some of the tickets or emails you get today or phones you get today, that's it, and of course, use the integrator in the Webhook Builder So I'm out of time now So should we wrap it up quickly with the last slide we have a couple more things to say before we leave you today, so thanks for sticking around for those that managed to stick around until the end. Thanks Michael for a great training session, there is so much more to say of course, but there's only so much time so with today I want to leave you with a couple of takeaways, so if you go yeah, for the participants of the webinar today we'll be allowing you to sign up for a free trial or we can sign you up for a free trial starting today or whenever you want so you can actually go in the platform and test it yourself and basically practice what you have, the couple of things you have learned today in such a short time you can also request a prototype and you can have a personalized demo to figure out how the technology can support your use case so your company your needs and basically support the user case that your company would like to have potentially by adopting this kind of technology so do reach out to Michael at ml@botxo.co if you want to get in touch about that and if you're interested we also have another webinar coming up next week, we'll be doing that webinar in collaboration with Klaus The theme of the webinar will be towards a bot human hybrid customer service, so really putting the emphasis on humans and technology working together so yeah I'll leave you with the bundle offer of the free trial and personalized demo and hopefully many of you will request a prototype or many of you will schedule a demo to see how we can help your business and if not then I'll see you on the next webinar it will be on the 2nd of September and I've left you the link here on the conversation so thank you so much for tuning in today thanks, Michael for a great session and if you do have any questions, please follow up with Michael with yeah his email, all right then thanks everybody have a great rest of the day Bye
