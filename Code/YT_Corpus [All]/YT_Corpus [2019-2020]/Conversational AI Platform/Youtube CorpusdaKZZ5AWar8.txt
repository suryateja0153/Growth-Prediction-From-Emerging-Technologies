 live from Washington DC it's the cube covering booby world nineteen to bide booming welcome back to the cubes coverage of boo me world 2019 from DC I'm Lisa Martin John Fourier is my co-host and we're pleased to welcome a couple of guests from Accenture Bhoomi partner to my right we've got PEO global managing director of integration and Leticia kiya to Accenture's globally for conversational a I welcome both of you thank you so big news you can't go anywhere these days without talking about AI I mean there's even commercials on TV that you know any generation knows something about AI but letici let's start with you some big news coming out this morning with what Bumi and Accenture are doing for conversational a I give our audience kind of an overview of what you guys announced this morning so thank you very much say conversational AI is booming in the market it's at the top of the agenda for a number of our c-suite it's a new way to make system monument so instead of having to learn the system you can actually speak ask them direct question and have a conversation and actually while we're doing this what we've announced this morning is Accenture and Bumi are going to partner together to deliver that kind of services for our clients much faster because we have the expertise on the know-how of designing those conversational experience and Bumi obviously integrates really fast with back-end system and the two together can really be accelerating you know the value delivered to our client and the technology piece just wanna make sure sense because you guys are providing a front end so real technology with booming yes it together story yeah it's definitely a together story and as you say we are quite expert in designing those experience on the front end and and Bhumi obviously kind of powers up the integration in the background so this is gonna be enabler something you said a minute ago is instead of us humans having to learn the tech the text going to learn us is that fair to say by you fair to say that's exactly oh we want to see and I think we call that trend you know radically human systems yeah so systems you know are going to become more radically human as we go on and conversationally AI is one enabler of that is is it good it be empathetic like when you're saying this morning something I loved onstage we've all had these interactions with AI with BOTS whether we're on a dot-com site trying to fix something for our cable provider or we're calling into a call center and you're you know you're starting to get your voice changes your agent and you want that is it going to be able to understand oh all right this person maybe need to escalate this there's anger coming coming through the voice is it gonna get to be able to detect that on voice you can definitely start detecting tone much better than on text because on text is very small snippets and it's quite difficult to define somebody's mood by one small interaction typically you need a number of interaction to kind of see the build up of the person's emotion but on voice definitely you know you know your intonation definitely defines you state of communication yeah you can tell if someone's happy sad and then use the text metadata to add to it this is fascinating because we all see Apple with Siri front end that's a different system they have a back-end to Apple this is a similar thing you guys have a solution at Accenture can you explain how people engage with the century because the boomy story is a great announcement congratulations on that but still you can deploy this technology to any back-end is that to any Beckenham we have a number of life deployment running at the moment think the key thing is you know especially in the call center cool Santa is an area that has not been invested in for like decades yeah and very often the scripts are by in word driven so they would describe the company's processes rather than think about the end user so what we do in Accenture is we try to reinvent the experience be much more user driven and then we have a local no code kind of interface to be able to craft some of those conversation on all the variation but you know more importantly we actually store all those conversation and can learn and so we have assisted learning module to make you natural language processor cleverer and cleverer and as you were saying before we started to be on hair you know the user is contributing training data yeah I was sharing that might one of my recent stories of an ISP that I was trying to interact with and frustrated that I couldn't just solve this problem on my own and then after I was doing some work for the cube a few months ago I realized oh actually I have to be calm here I have an opportunity as is everybody to help train the models because that's what they need right it takes a tremendous amount of training data before our voices can become like fingerprints so I think more of us just kind of maybe flip that maybe our tongue will get better and obviously the machines will detect that right yeah I know definitely I think the key was conversational AI is not to see it as just pure tech but really an opportunity to be more human centered and you know obviously knowing who people are and how they interact in different kind of problem and scenario is absolutely critical Peter I want to get your thoughts on digital transformation because you know we've been I mean we've done I've done thousands of interviews on the cube with many many shows digital transfer has been around for a while yeah it all stops in one area okay processed technology great areas we have visibility that automations excellent for processes technology a plethora of activity the people equations always broken down culture has stopped DevOps maybe not an updated scientist or linguistic engineers to do conversational AI you guys fill that void great technology the people equation changes when there's successes it all comes down to integration because that's where it yeah either I don't believe in it or no I don't want to do it the culture doesn't want it time to value the integration piece is critical can you guys explain how this boomy accenture integration works and what should enterprises take away from this well yeah one of the key things when we started our relationship with bhumi more than five years ago now really Bumi was the leader kind of the ones who invented I pass right the integration platform as a service so in the small and medium business a lot of those companies had already moved a lot of the critical apps to the cloud but in the enterprise we see that it's taken a lot longer right so certain departments may move of certain pieces but it's still very much a hybrid right between cloud and on-premise so taking a platform like Bumi and being able to use that with the atoms fear of platform has really allowed us to move forward we've done quite a bit of work in Europe and now in the last year we've been focusing in North America along with Europe and so they're really the platform has allowed us to focus on the integration it's interesting you bring up you guys both have been in sensor for a long time you've seen the the waves you know Oh big 18 month deployment eight years mean money yeah I mean sometimes years go back in the 80's 90's but now the large enterprise kind of looks like a lot of SMBs because the project's all look they're different now you can have a plethora of projects out there hundreds of projects not one mono left so this thing seems to be a trend you guys see it that way do you agree if you like share some insight into what's going on in these large companies is it is it still the same game of a lot of big projects or things being broken down into smaller chunks with cloud platform can you guys just share your insights and you can do okay with so the days of the Big Bang big transformation multi-year programs we don't see very many of those right a lot of our clients have moved away towards lean agile delivery right so it's really being able to deliver value in shorter periods of time and in that sense you do see these big company is acting more like SMBs right because you really have to deliver that value and with bhumi's platform it's not just the integration aspect and there are relationships started there it's with some of the other pieces to the technology like flow and and low code or no code as well which has allowed boomy customers and our clients and our teams to be able to get those applications out to production much quicker the citizen developer yeah absolutely trend yes I guess my thought I will come with the innovation angle young so obviously we're very turbulent time where company you know like a number of the 4,500 or 20 years ago they don't they're not there any longer and there's quite a heavy rotation on you know on some of the big corporation and what's really important is to size the market and innovate all the time and nothing that's one of the reason why we have much smaller project because if you want to innovate you need to go to market really fast try things up and pivot the city IDs really fast to try to see if people like it and want it and I think that's also one of the key driver of smaller kind of projects that would just go much faster to life we had a guy in the queue say data is the new software kind of you know provocative brockless statement around data is now part of the programmatic element an integration speaks volume here so I want to get your reaction to the idea of glue layers I mean people kick that term how it's a glue layer basically an integration layer with data control plane this is a really big part of the integration story for Bumi but for other customers what's you guys thoughts on you know this data layer glue layers that software and data come together you're selling it with the conversational AI it's its voice in terms of software connects to another system this glue yeah so that's a very interesting angle because I think you know in the old integration world people would just build an interface and then it would go live and they wouldn't necessarily know exactly what's going out under the bonnet and I think having that insight of what you flew often they use when they kicked off is something that becomes quite important when you have a lot of integration to manage I would remember I was working for Bank a major bank in the UK where we were trying to you know make a mainframe system go real-time but we had all those batch schedule kind of running and nobody really knew when what and the dependency in between each other so I think it definitely helps a lot you know bubbling up that level of visibility you need to transform truly yeah and you're seeing a lot of companies now have chief data officer right the data really is important and with big data data lakes unstructured data structured data traditional RDMs databases being able to access that information is that just read all innocent read and write and you're really seeing kind of how all of that has to come together the go-to market for booming Accenture Pete talk to us about how that good a more market strategy has evolved during the partnership and where you see it going with respect to you know emerging technologies like conversational AI oh yeah we've got great opportunities right so we started off really just hey there was an integration opportunity and you know that are we doing much work with bloomie and the enterprise five years agos we hadn't right and we started doing more work kind of in Asia pack and then in Europe three years ago we entered the formal relationship to accelerate the B growth it was accelerated growth platform which started in amia and this last year we formally signed one in North America as well and in the last three years we've done four times the amount of work the number of customers we've got more than 40 joint customers together the number of trained professionals within Accenture we have more than 400 people certified with more than 600 certifications some of them may be a developer as well as an architect and so a lot of that is really that awareness and education training and enablement as well as some some joint go-to-market activities any others in specific I was reading some use cases in healthcare and utilities yeah we're definitely we've seen quite a bit in utilities in our in energy practice we've seen it in transportation we've really because it sets your covers all of the different industry groups we I mean we're really seeing it in in all of them you know I'm fascinated by the denouncement you guys had with bloomie that big news conversational AI because it just makes so much sense but if I worried people will pigeonhole this into you know voice like telephone call centers only because the use cases that you guys are showing on stage was essentially like the most like a query engine and be using voices versus a agent you know call center workflow which is a natural workflows big market there are no doubt about it but there's other use cases this is a big wide topic can you just share the vision of conversational AI little further meaning I think the capability we have is to kind of be able to go on any channel voice is the interesting one because it's I think it's it's very common still you know to have a call center when you dip in to challenges and this is kind of the most emerging and challenging from a technology perspective so that's the one that was shows showcase but there's a number of chat channels that are also very important on the web or a synchronous channel like whatsapp and Facebook and all of that kind of thing so it's really kind of really offering a broad choice to you and consumer so they can pick and choose what they want at the moment that won't you I think what we see in the market is a big shift from synchronous kind of interaction like on the web you're going to have your chat with something and you just need to be there to finish it to actually text because you can just send attacks get a response go to a meeting and on the back of the meeting and when you have five minutes you just kind of do the reply and you're actually solve your problem on your terms but really when you have the time so there is a lot coming there and you know with you know Apple business charts you know there's you know there's a number of mechanisms that are coming up on new channels before company tended to be you know we do digital we do call center and maybe we have you know chats but actually all of that is broadening up you know people want multi-channel experience synchronous is key synchronous and asynchronous communication is there a tell sign for a client that says I'm ready for conversational AI it's we have to have a certain data set I mean is it in ear face what are some of the requirements someone say I really want this I want to do this yeah so the way we deal with all of that very often is if you have call center recording or chat recording we have set of routines that we pass through so we transcribe everything and we do what we'd call intern discovery and from that we can know you know what are the most kind of critical kind of processes kicked off and from that we know if it's transactional or if it's an interaction or an intern that's emotionally loaded like people not happy with the bail and then we have the techniques to address all of those different kind of processes if you want to transform them into new experiences and we can very easily kind of look at the potential value we can get out of it so for instance with one of our clients we identify you know if you do that kind of transformation you can get twenty five million of your call center you know like which is very sizable and it's very precise because it's data-driven so it's based on real kind of calls recordings and a tire can't hide from data I mean the you see that's successful or not he can't hide anymore yeah and I think one of the extra value add is very often call Santa a janata agent they not really paid to classify properly so they would just you know pick up the most easy one all the time so they wouldn't miss classify some of those recordings choose you know what's easiest for them but when you actually go into what was said it's a very different story great insight ai becoming not just IQ but EQ in the future yes definitely that's that's the OL ID that's why we need our users to erase it exactly and turn those frustrating experiences into I have the opportunity to influence the model last question for you in terms of conversational AI and the business opportunities this partnership with bhumi is gonna give to you guys that Accenture oh it's definitely looking forward to joint go to market taking taking this globally we were named earlier this week yesterday of the Worldwide Partner of the year the second time with Accenture has been awarded that which we appreciate and that we look forward to working with bhumi and taking conversational AI to our joint clients awesome Leticia P thank you so much for joining John I'm a really interesting conversation can't wait to see where it goes great thank you very much pleasure very conversational very conversational yes may I hear yeah mom that may give you a bud new conversations exactly for our guests and for John Fourier I'm Lisa Martin you're watching the cube a friend Bumi whirl of 19 thanks for watching
