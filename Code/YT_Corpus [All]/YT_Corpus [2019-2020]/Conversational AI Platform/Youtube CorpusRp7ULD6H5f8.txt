 hello everyone welcome to Microsoft build 2020 this session today is a part of our students own community area section you know we've you know our team's gotten together we've created a lot of great content for not only professional developers but also students ooh that are really interested in learning about you know all the different tools and technologies that we build here at Microsoft before we begin I do want to mention our code of conduct you know we're gonna show it really quickly here on the screen I don't expect you all to read all of this but please do keep in mind that you know we expect everyone to be on their best behavior as we go through these sessions now what I want to do is introduce to you my friend and my coworker Jazmin and jazz was going to talk to you about chatbots so take it away Jazmin all right thank you hustle hi everybody welcome to the student zone and this session we'll be talking about chatbots sso mentioned I'm Jasmine Greenaway I am a cloud advocate at Microsoft coming from you coming to you all the way from Brooklyn in New York City so let's get started so first we're going to talk about what exactly a bot is and at its most basic for the most basic definition a bot is an application that is set to do a certain task so you might be wondering what the difference between a bot versus a regular application or app on your phone is well the thing with a bot is is that you don't need once you have it set up you don't need to have any external external communication or external interaction with it it's it's automated so you know when you think about using a regular app you get the press a button with a bot it kind of knows what what's what to do on its phone so normally but normally just like any other application a bot is going to need to communicate with your device so whether that's a computer or a or your phone is going to communicate through ones and zeros which we know as binary and and that output will be what we see or that on the screen or that that we're looking to accomplish so that could be something as simple as an alarm it could be maybe answering a question or it could be something even a little bit more advanced like getting some data from a graph or a chart now let's take a little history lesson on BOTS so in the past BOTS had a little bit of a notorious reputation you've probably seen this this um image here called a reCAPTCHA where you know you probably usually see this when you are signing up for a new account or you are logging in to something maybe if you've forgotten you know your password and after a few tries if this shows up well this was this was implemented to protect folks from from BOTS specifically folks who are maintaining these sites maintaining these users because you know you don't want a bunch of you know just empty you know a user is made by a bot that and these are accounts that are never going to be used so so that's a that's one protection against bus that we've seen but in the past we've also even had help helpful BOTS so if you have ever used Microsoft Word you've probably heard at least heard about clipping Clippy you don't see Clippy in these versions are the newer versions of word but in the past clip II was a bot because because clip II was there to help you with specific tasks based on what you were doing in your document so this example here this could be essentially probably quickly will usually ask us after you've had you know your um your document maybe it's an essay that you're writing sitting around for a while and the Cleary's gonna ask you if you want a statement and if you pressed pressed yes then it then it would seem for you and the final bot that I am very I that's about as close to my heart is from AOL American America online so this was back in the day when you know we we all were using dial-up internet and AOL Instant Messenger al had the messenger and one of their BOTS was smarter child and this was a text-based chat bot where you could ask questions say supremist converse with this spot and asked whatever you want so those are some three just examples of BOTS in the wild now as I mentioned before bots are there to help you with a specific test and you're probably wondering why would I want one what's so great about a bot well let's think about a very basic example here so they'd say that your mom might have left their sees that you have a very very very messy room it's really really bad and she's like I need you to clean this room please this this is unacceptable and you are like wow I hate cleaning I hate cleaning my room I wish I had a robot to do this for me well imagine that you had one and it was like well I love cleaning imagine having a robot for you so that you can save time playing video games playing Animal Crossing whatever you might be doing programming so because the spot is saving you time so bots are helpful they save you time and they are and and they're helpful in something in some cases so specifically let's talk about chat BOTS the difference between what what defines a chat bot is pretty much a bot that's that will help you based on what you the way you're communicating so usually this is voice or text so in this example here what we're looking at is somebody maybe sending a message to the chat window where a bot is there to ask how might help you and usually in some cases we don't even know that it's a bot that that we're chatting with but in the end they can be helpful as well so there are quite a few parts of the chat bot but two parts I really want to focus on is this knowledge base and the code which a bot doesn't always necessarily need code but sometimes it's it's it's a necessity so let's talk specifically about this knowledge base the knowledge base is going to be all the information that the bot needs to do its job so these are the questions that the user might ask this might be maybe some external connections that it might need so so this is where anything this like I said before this is where the bot knows what to do and the code helps with with that as well so let's take a so let's actually replace the image of a bot with what the bot would actually look like so what we're looking at on the left here now again still has the knowledge base still has that code sometimes but now what we were really seeing this is a real represent representation of the bot it it's just usually a chat window that you can text or type in or or chat via voice okay so what's to say there is a service in a Microsoft that Microsoft provides called the bot framework and this is a huge platform and what this platform allows you to do is that you can create a bot from scratch you can test it and you can share your bot in the world through to the world through many of these mediums called channels so a channel would be where your bot would be communicated with so for example you can use Skype Facebook messenger even email slack teams if you like and then um you also have a bunch of different options for for devices and also you can use additional services such as the Cognos services such as speech vision language understanding and and the like so the bat framework is a really really cool way to get you about your get started on your pot and we're going to see an example of this a little later but now I want to move on to a little bit more detail around what a bot can actually do so you know normally when you know when you ask somebody a question say Oh or say greet somebody you say hello how are you normally the answer that you're expecting is oh I'm good or I'm not doing very well and how are you well imagine that a computer could do that imagine if the computer asks you how are you and you were expecting and it was expecting me to or to to reply I'm good or bad and how are you so that's just a normal conversation flow and the person in the middle with that with that laptop is going to be the scientist so normally says it can be a data scientist it could be an AI scientist or a machine learning scientists who mimics or tries to emulate this natural conversation and this term is called natural language processing we this is how we teach computers and our BOTS to communicate so that we can understand each other and have a normal conversation and this is really really important when we are thinking about different languages so yes my natural language is in English but in Spanish the context might be might be a little different so again that scientist has to be able to to be able to mimic or imitate or even simulate that normal conversation flow no matter what language it is now let's take a look at this with our but so so with natural language language processing it makes it easy for a bot to be able to take a look at exactly what the problem is and what the user needs so in this example here I'm asking for this person speaking help with order number 1 to 3 and the user but and the the customer service representative on the left side here would say ok please wait a moment I'm gonna look at order 1 2 3 and on the right side here the same user is asking or helped with a specific order but now the but that might be on this their desktop is asking ok let me look up order number 1 2 1 2 3 so there's some specific keywords that are that our bot knows that it that um that the user needs help so for example the user said they need help so the computer knows that it's going to need it needs that this person needs assistance and then the next key word I can't we could probably point out here it's order so this person needs help with an order and they need help with an order 1 2 3 so the computer has or the spot has three things that this person this this user has to find that they need help with so specifically disorder so now the computer so the so the person who has created spot could probably use use this information to go look up order 1 2 3 and then their chat window maybe they have these order details so there's also another service called Lois also that stands for language understanding that helps BOTS with natural language so in this example this person asked for SS for HR rep and Lewis sees that it's that the intent is that they want to contact somebody from HR and so the bot responds with that reps name their email and their phone number so with on that note let's take a look at a chat bot in action so what I'm going to do is I'm going to swap to the bot framework emulator and what the bot framework emulator is is a is a way for you to test your bot locally before you deploy it to the cloud so what I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna start I have a bot that I created with with the bot framework I create it in though and they actually already have it running and so what I'm gonna do now is connect to it through the emulator and click connect now one spot gets started it's gonna ask me two things so it's gonna it says hello gives me a nice welcome and now it's asking me for my name so it's gonna ask me for my name and a message that I want to send to to my but now when I answer my bot with the with these prompts what's going to happen is going is going to go to a logic app it's going to connect to my logic app here so I'm in an azure a logic app is a way for you to do event-driven event-driven coding with a really cool interface that an editor that looks like this so what I'm doing is having my bot communicate with my logic app through something that we call an HTTP verb and this is and this verb is a post which means that I am sending information to this logic app so that this logic app can consume my the user and the the use are the name and the information the message and then what will happen next year is that I get a sent that message and that that message from the bot to the to a queue and so a queue is just a way for me to save all my messages in the order that they're received so the final part of this is is that I actually have a little Chrome or not Chrome edge extension here in the browser here the browser extension here that will read the bot messages in here notice that I have no messages yet because there's nothing in my queue yet so that's pretty much what this spots going to do this I'm going to answer my boss questions it's gonna come to my logic app here and then it's gonna put it in the queue and then when there's messages in my queue I'm gonna see it in my extension here okay so let's do this so I'm gonna say my name is jasmine and then Wes my message I'm I say hello student zone 2020 Hey and then it's going to say hello they are thank you for this message hello students so in 2020 and if I look back at my logic app make sure they go back here and it's refresh it I should see a green checkmark show up down here yep saying that I that my logic apps casitas so that means that my message got sent to the queue so if I open this up I should see my message I don't see a message yet so let me just refresh this a few times might take a second to show up let's see here let's double check and see if my message made it into my queue here you yep I made it into my cue yeah and their sign my message in my kita but looks like it's not showing up in my extension might take a second might be me internet connection but that's that's not right maybe we'll check we'll check it later during Q&A okay but that's essentially the gist of the a bot so you can so in that example I didn't really have Louis I wasn't really using Louis it was a simple it was a simple but but if I want to add Louis it'd be super easy because Louis and the bot framework work really well together so if you are interested in the demo that I created you can or any more information about chat box you can visit this link down here and yeah I think it's time for to open it up to any questions all right Thank You jasmine that was great so we do have tons of questions in here only I hope you're ready man this is alright okay so I'll scroll a little bit cuz I didn't see some interesting ones that I wanted to forward to you the browser here to answer questions sure so first question I want to ask you is from Angela and Angela can BOTS be made with to you Microsoft bot framework to use discord oh yes absolutely so it might have not been in that um in in that diagram but if but it might be available when you take a look when you're setting up your but if not there are always ways to connect your bot to to a different chat excuse me a different chat medium so it might be it might be a little work if it's not there already if it's not it's not one of the channels that you can use already but it should be possible yeah I don't know we also got a lot of questions about just different channels that we could use there's some folks that we're asking about how to twitter and twitch and some of these other things so is it is it fair to say as long as that platform supports bots of some sort that you could integrate bot framework one where yes yes you could even like just have a simple bot like show up on on the browser there's like a little so one of the channels is called web chat and pretty much you would essentially take a script it gives you a little JavaScript file or sorry a little HTML slash JavaScript thing and you just paste that into your HTML file and you're ready to go is that you have to do a little bit more a little bit more security stuff our security measures with it but it's that's possible there's many many channels for you to use all right so here's another interesting one question is is it possible to run the chat bot technologies as mentioned here on premises if yes what are the requirements ooh that's a good question I would say I would say yes only because I have I'm running this locally on my computer I you know I just used the emulator this wasn't deployed to the cloud and the way that I communicate with my with my logic app unfortunately I'm not sure what happened to my extension here but it didn't show up in there but but yes so so my theory is yes because um in in we didn't look at the code but in my JavaScript I did that post request to be able to communicate with my logic app so I my my theory is that yes you should be able to use this on premises okay and speaking of logic apps we do have a couple questions about the logic app one is where does the logic app come from does it replace an HTTP function or code that you write I wouldn't say essentially it replaces code because you kind of still have to think programmatically when you're using a logic app you his first year think about you know what how do you want your logic have to start like what are in inst and this is part of a technology called Cerberus our event-driven event-driven code so so with something called a trigger we need to find out what what will make the logic app run and star start and so here in my example here I'm using this HTTP endpoint but you could use things such as you know even like getting twitter twitter notification there's a bunch of different triggers but what I really really love about logic apps is that it's very it's very fast for me to get set up I could have easily done this with an azure function which is also part of as your server list offerings but with logic apps it's just I really love it because just easy for me to just get going and get that set up faster than an azure function so I mean I could have used a juror function it's just really up to up to you okay great and another question coming to you says what were you using to process to queue messages what was it using that process to queue messages okay yes so um the service that I used was the azure storage service and in under that is um the one of the services under that is the queue so you need to create an address storage account to be able to use a queue and so on the other side of that so is the the SDK that I use I actually did not use an SDK actually used a arrest the rest service or the REST API that's available to to be able to access my queue so what should show up in my in here is that the message here and so with with the extension with this extension that I have here it's a simple like Solow HTML and javascript extension that I should be able to just get the last message that was on that queue so so yeah I'm just using the the the after storage account to to access to set up my cue the answered your question okay and then another question and you use this kind of but in a video game ooh you could because you can because also you can run it locally you know when I first was building my body I actually was you know doing everything on my computer and I think that yeah I wouldn't see why you would be able to use it use it because you know the bot framework is you know it's a set of tools and including the emulator that you can you know you can you can test locally with and and you know using it locally does not only essentially mean testing so I would assume that you could use it in the video game okay so we have a few questions about like learning and just getting started in general yeah first one how much not much do you need to actually start creating a chatbot mm-hmm so with the bot framework I would say I would say maybe some minimal to intermediate knowledge of either JavaScript Python or C sharp because you're going to need to be able to use the SDKs to be able to create your your BOTS but in the resources that I provided in this slide here you can find you can find my demo that I wrote in in JavaScript but like I said before and I also have more resources for different samples behind that link but I would say I would say either JavaScript having some basic knowledge of JavaScript Python or C sharp will get you will get you will get you a little bit further ahead there's also a tool called the bot framework composer where it's just very similar to what that logic app interface looked like where you can drag and drop your how do you want your bot to communicate and what you bought your bot to do that's kind of a newer a newer tool but definitely check it out if you are new to coding and but also want to check out a chat box okay and another question from Arthur Arthur's asking how to load and get a database of knowledge of the bots how can answers of all questions luckily it answers at all ones were interested in should we make a model for our chat bot so I kind of sounds like you didn't want to train the model right like I don't think there's necessarily a database but this probably be like ake of stuff that you eat and drink oh right mm-hmm yes so um so with list this is where Luis comes in because this is what is really important so you know you know one part is how what you're saying but also the intent so you know you know in that example where I talked about somebody asked me help help with order number one two three Luis would be the tool that would come in there and say okay this person needs help with this specific the specific order and remember that the other part of chat BOTS is that they are set or they're created to do very specific tasks so you know if you have a botanist maybe doing like a bunch of things just very similar you know this is a concept that we learn in I remember learning in in college about coding you know if you have too much logic if you have too much logic and one thing then you know that's just opens up the potential for for a lots of errors and you know makes it harder for you to debug or fix if something goes wrong so you know you want to make sure that your bots are to the point and if you have too much stuff in just what maybe you need a separate bot that does other specific tasks or you need to build a little bit more context with Louis or even in your the code of your BOTS so it really is it depends on what exactly test that you're trying to accomplish alright and so we have a few minutes left still tons of questions coming in but for a second because there are some questions that aren't necessarily bought for work related that I kind of think he might be interested in answering so one question is so what exactly it is that you do in your role Oh what is it that I exactly doing my role okay this is this is a fun one um this is actually really one of the reasons what I really like um you know this role is that you know we get to connect with folks like you all over the world and show you all the cool things that you can do in the cloud you know we all have our you know our many different strengths and one of my favorite things is demos so you know this is so that extension that I I built that unfortunately didn't work I like used Microsoft Docs to like learn how to build that and there was no pretty straightforward so that's actually really one of my favorite things but no part of you know part of what we do is just connecting with folks and you know showing them how to use a cloud you know so you know my typical day is you know answering emails from you know folks you know community members and you know communicating folks on Twitter pushing a few things to repose on github and you know put any kind of presentations like this and also like looking at different Azure services that you know are around you know I kind of just stumbled on the bottom remark and was really into it and and that's and that's what brought me here speaking about it today great and then the last question because we're like at the last minute right now last question yeah day at work look like for you oh okay so yeah Mike has mentioned before it's you know chatting with committee members I know talking with team members and also you know just also planning my day having at least like sending like three goals that I want to get through the day so it's normally like preparing a presentation maybe looking at maybe reading some Docs reading more about a specific as your service and then I was in communicating with the community so so yeah so coding communicating and in planning all right great and so so we're gonna stop right now Thank You jasmine so much for that session I think you have more slides at the end to that you wanted to just talk about real quick yeah sure so um if you have any if you could please fill out this short survey about this session you know it really you know you know one thing that we always love to do here is you know you know make sure that we are taking in feedbacks taking the feedback seriously and you know coming coming back to you with you know in with a new improved versions of what we're doing based on what you're telling us so please check it out and then the rest of these links are all all resources that you should check out you know the fun doesn't stop after the talk so please check out these these resources and also that first link there that AKMs students that build like also has resources to what we covered in this session today and that's it all right thank you everyone have a good day and make sure you check out the rest of our sessions at Microsoft build
