 good morning everybody glad you made it final day if you're not fatigued by now we hope to wake you up this morning so the next session is going to be about AI in the role of entertainment and storytelling but particularly with interactive entertainment and storytelling and the format this morning we're going to have two talks short presentations by guy gadney of charisma AI and then Laura Harrison of the BBC and then we're going to go into a panel discussion with a few more guests so welcome in guide Laura sorry Laura fest so I'm rehearsing from BBC research and developments and today guy and I are hopefully going to try and answer the question that is a I'm making storytelling more interactive and I'll talk a bit about some of the things we've been experimenting with in R&D what challenges we faced and and what we've learned right through from exploration to testing and there's so many things I could have talked about today but I managed to narrow it down to just three content areas and those are news and factual object based experiences and drama and storytelling so what do I mean when I'm talking about AI in this context so firstly and most commonly I mean sort of machines that have been fed big datasets where they can understand the differences and anomalies and surface points of interest to the user but secondly I mean the progression of machine intelligence technologies such as branching narrative that sort of moved us from more of a lean brat lean back and absorb approach to a lean forward and play experience so lastly beyond that the machine intelligence how can I add value to the experiences in some way so back to my three examples the first is just in news and factual so recently BBC news labs have been experimenting in something called semi automated journalism with local news services so people today know more more about what's happening in their local communities because of social media obviously but sustaining local news has become increasingly a bit more of a struggle because of this so the team at BBC News labs wanted to ask the question of could AI help them in creating more relevant stories for local audiences with adapting expectations so they used huge big datasets from the NHS for this as you can see this is part of the process pipeline so they take the datasets from the NHS then using natural language generation they create a story for and every local NHS trust then there's also an automatically generated graphic for each story and usually this process takes a few months so being able to create generic templates has made this a huge step forward and then it's just up to the the journalist to then verify the story which is the most important bit before publishing to audiences so obviously there are challenges here and some interesting questions before the team got started you know will journalists be comfortable in publishing stories that they haven't actually written themselves and will audiences actually be happy reading stories that were compiled by machines and there are some sensitivities as we know about what AI means in this area around trust particularly with the rise of deep fakes and some spread of misinformation but we've learned that whilst people are increasingly ready to experiment with new technology that machines cannot replace the craft of curating and structuring and telling good stories we definitely need humans for that but AI can certainly help so some of your tomato journalism although is a far more Leanback approach to nain storytelling has had an impact on the audiences by potentially allowing us to create more localised and relevant for the audience that we couldn't perhaps have done before so the second of the examples is around object based experiences this notion that everything within a story and it's telling is atomic by default so that it can be broken down into bits into objects into components that when is automatically reassembled using machine intelligence can offer a more interactive and personalized experience for the audience so imagine if AI could understand all the variables about you as a user so where you are what device you are using whether you're in the car on the train or at home whether you're on a 20-minute commute or your killing time on a Saturday afternoon and it took all of those variables and it automatically served you a story that's fulfilled the elements either for a Leanback experience or for a more interactive experience so machines can enable more adaptive storytelling by understanding both implicit and explicit personalization so for example I like drama versus location services detecting that I'm on a particular Street that can be used in a drama so definitely ways for more experimentation and interaction so for this particular experiment our challenge was to try and make complex tasks a lot more easily understood and we did it through a maker long origami frog which is quite fun so in the initial user testing a very sort of linear instruction we found that the instructor was quite hard to follow at speed and this made people quite stressed following one camera angle was really hard and the language is quite insistent sometimes a bit repetitive so people gave up a lot quicker so instead we added some variables whether that's multi camera views or ways to repeat steps it meant that more audiences were to digest the information and carry out the task therefore interacting more more playful with the content so breaking things down into objects that can be reassembled due to varying personalized factors is highly more interactive and enjoyable for audiences so the third example I'd like to talk about its drama and making fictitious stories more playful using AI so here we have the inspection chamber which is a an interactive sci-fi comedy drama and it uses voice interactions with a lexer in a branching narrative format where you play you and we wanted to go beyond the sort of transactional nature of a chatbot and look whether you can really interact with a machine in a story sense and taking off into entertainment areas and not not seeing tech as a barrier to the story so the main challenge was with this experiment I was mainly designing an experience that has thousands of variable outputs and you can see here in the example of orator which is the tool that powers this experience how five or six possible answers to a question could quite easily become very complex a very complex task in story design so how can a I help us with this challenge so in this example users were a lot more engaged with the interactions obviously they were asking them to do more things but the total users was relatively low so we want to experiment a bit more in this particular non-transactional story format and we'll talk about that a bit more about that in a moment i think i'll expand particularly so is a I making storytelling more interactive it's certainly making interactions become easier for audiences to experience and making those experience somewhat more compelling however we still need humans to craft these stories into something meaningful and value so beyond R&D work in AI we work collaboratively with the industry through connected studio stimulating the creative economy and partnering with experts to help us really scale our thinking so over the past seven years we've partnered with startups and SMEs in the tech industry to enable us to sort of rapidly prototype the new concepts and formats but also test new technologies with BBC production teams and last year we put out a call to the industry for scalable and reusable storytelling tools that we could licence and experiment in the field of adaptive and immersive storytelling and building on those experiments beyond the transactional as I just talked about so one of the partnerships that came from that was with charisma so I'm just going to lead directly on from lauralee and just show you this morning a couple of things we're working on quickly and then on the panel we can dive down into a bit more detail so where we are with with charisma we wanted to build a platform which the BBC very handily summarized as scalable reusable storytelling technology and built from scratch with storytelling in its DNA and that's quite different from you know just standard chatbot technologies that you might see today which in that transactional sense tend to be more search engine focused and their goals are very much about getting you as the as the user in and out of the experience as fast as possible that's a search engine so say Alexa you know played tuned to certain radio station you want that to happen fairly quickly and largely that's the end of the of the experience we want to take a different approach which is very much more natural which is around conversation and in a conversation you're not going aids being back again you're going a b c d e and to make that natural was quite complex which is why we ended up building this from from the call and the first project we worked on with the BBC was aberrant on tomorrow's world it was a futuristic look at AI powered taxi service and the experience adapted based on your your input and it was a sort of moral code input so if you answered the questions that we had in a certain way then the experience would take you down a certain track if you went down the different way then we would take you down a different track I'm not sure if we can get the video playing behind this all of my videos about five seconds long so they are into the and and the experience that taught us a couple of things one the UI was great and it was it was a mercy focus of the first person and the and the conversation that was going had pastes had a sense of tension to it it's one learning out of it it was that it's good to show the character this was a sort of AI without a character but that then leads into the second one how old are we say it which is where we created a character and our guy here was we've done a couple of experiences looking at emotionally engaging characters and we did a perfect boyfriend and a perfect girlfriend and then we decided to go a bit darker than that into this suspected serial killer and the story is that he's walked into a police station and he wants to talk to you and again as it is you and and with that you start talking and two things to pick up on here one was that's video so we integrated video into the interactive experience and two as you saw he got angry and you'll see a motion coming through and a couple of things that we can talk about in a minute but the emotional angle of that character again breaks fully away from from Alexa and then finally though you know if you're looking at chat box generally people think of them in terms of one-to-one conversations but that's not a story and it's not drama you need to have this sort of broader broader cast in that space so what we're working on at the moment is now a an adaptation of an immersive theater production set in World War two it's got a whole cast and just a little sort of a stir before proceedings begin I would like to be the first person to congratulate the newly appointed Prime Minister on their promotion it's like sort of work is work in progress but again 3d that's now 3d avatars and animation multiple characters you're in a room and you're in part of that space so leading in to the next session I just wanted to put things in in three contexts around character conversation and context which is where where we spend a lot of our time looking the character's personality you have to have that because that's how we engage as humans mood States the cast of stars you know you want to have that this is about storytelling and again if you want to have something which is a very much an electric experience that's great and that's more probably call center type things but our view is that if you're starting from storytelling then you need to need to do something different and that's more of the charisma experience that we're building conversation you can see themes super important story branches multi-device as an output and the context of it so you need to be a we never want to have anyone in our experiences have an answer of I'm sorry I don't understand that that should never happen because it doesn't happen happen in Star Wars it doesn't happen in Harry Potter and it should never happen with us so next phase what we're looking at and maybe we will pick up some of these themes are emotion complex to do this but again it's part of the whole bringing things to life and the experience to life the virtual emotion maybe will touch from vrf people are interested and automation I'm currently doing a fellowship with a bunch of universities in South West of England around automation one liner AI is here but actually it's just sort of cause and effect the effect is going to be automation which has more of a philosophical approach to it so with that I think I'll pass over again so right now you've the examples that you showed us their b2c so as a user we can go and you know see these interactions in real life and play with them or go online a lot of your work is b2b right is that the work that you did with the BBC so what I'm thinking about is there are several levels where humans can either accept or reject the story you have writers who are writing these lines who might say that doesn't seem right that hey I didn't get it right you then have actors or characters you know if there are real humans they can reject it again and say my my character wouldn't say this and then finally to me you have like the audience who would be like this would never happen in the story so I'm interested in what your success rate is or how you're developing these three human barriers in entertainment and storytelling and what your experiences of that so the short answer is it's and really to echo something Laura was saying it's about the writers it's about creativity charisma is not an automatic writing tool it's a way to make the writers job which is writing complex narratives easier and the magic in what we do is actually interpreting what the users saying and interpreting it in a way that feels natural and makes sense and brings people into the story so that's sort of the third part of the question it makes the user feel a sense of surprise that the experience they're getting is relevant to what they've just said and I think that's the context piece but you know there is the debate over the next few weeks and months is going to be about automatic writing properly and if you want a closed when that's going to happen it's going to be July 1st and it's going to be with the potential release of GPT to serve find it reserves that and you know it's insane and that will trigger the whole conversation about it our view is and always will be that that the creative industries are you know we're creating stories for humans and with that we have our own sort of micro emotions that we need to bring to this and so the art with the writers for us the most important piece in the mix because they're the ones who can tell the stories in the best way and with that I'd like to invite the rest of my panel morning guys so let's just kick off by having some introductions who you are what you do and what you're working on hi I'm Emily short i'm chief product officer at spirit AI and spirit really came into being to serve the game space in a couple of different ways the way that is relevant to this panel is that we work on a product called character engine which is about developing characters who can interact through natural language or through other interactions that are happening in a game of space so you could imagine a character who needs to respond to the players just killed somebody in front of them so creating tools that let people author really responsive narrative experiences around the complexities of both the player input and the development of the story world good morning thank you very much for having me and I'm Isabelle Perry and I work at a company called bite which is a marketing technology agency bite brings together data media creative and tech and I head up the tech team we do a lot of work with chat bots and augmented mented reality for brands like Spotify ASOS Victoria Beckham and I think it was interesting hearing guy talk about transactional chat BOTS because we do transactional chat BOTS and conversational chat BOTS and some of the work that we do around that is sort of almost impersonating real people in order to market their services or products so we created a chat bot that was speaking on behalf of Victoria Beckham we created chat BOTS that are speaking on musicians on behalf of Spotify and with augmented reality we build tools or we see it that we build tools for other people to build their own stories in 10 seconds if it's on social or for longer experiences on web type of body my name's Steve where's week and I'm the senior AI developer panda robots calm which is probably the oldest and most popular building platform in the world there's over 60 billion messages being processed by our BOTS we currently have over 250,000 developers on there my current work and something I've been working on for about 15 years now is a chap called Mitsuko and this is just a general conversational chat bot it doesn't have a business girl it's just there for people to talk to kind of like the general intelligence of you know like a c-3po our kid for a night right of that kind of thing people talk to it for fun I'm fortunate enough for this one far labna prizes which is like the equivalent fee you know the World Cup the Oscars for chatbots so it's currently recognized as being the world's most conversational AI and I'm guy what we work just what we're working on at the moment was quite interesting is is when I didn't show was we're adapting John Wyndham sci-fi book the crack and wakes into this medium and I think is sort of one of the biggest challenges we face so literally that's what the team is doing today also select start with character because all of you build and develop characters and characters that can tell stories with interactions a lot of the existing products are you know two-way connection have you guys thought about how you would build things with multiple mass amount of people interacting with one thing at the same time yes so one of the use cases for character engine is in games that are designed to be multiplayer where you've got lots of players running around a world traditionally authors for this space find themselves challenged to create enough varied content that different players have different experiences in the game world and there's something for them to talk about and discuss so one of the areas that we're interested in is creating characters who actually can develop a personalized relation with the individual people who are interacting with them so that means the character remembers things about how you specifically have treated them they developed different kind of personality attitudes towards you than they might towards another player and that means that if you have multiple players interacting with the same character you might see that character treating different people differently depending on their kind of backstory so that's one area where you can see kind of an evolution that is interactive over a long period of time and responds to kind of different player contribution Steve if you thought about people speaking to Mexico across different people so if my son was talking to her would she be able to then talk to me about him know everything that would be cool for some people no it's it's all totally confidential as you know anybody it's all I get is a customer ID number the sole purpose for that is so that you can keep context of conversations because it's not unusual threats have a few thousand conversations all at the same time I don't know where anybody's from any personal details apart from what the users are willing to share with the bots but but we'll never ask them you know things like credit card details and things like that obviously but it will ask them you know what's your name just so I mean it's like in normal conversation you know that's what someone's name isn't it helps the conversation flow but those details are never shared amongst anybody I use them to improve the bots but I would never think if someone said what did this last person say it would probably just make something up when it comes to putting emotion into characters how do you define and go about building that emotion well how do you define emotion in AI because I feel like emotion is a term that we take for granted because we have it but how do you define it in a machine setting it's all very much kind of bluff and trickery rarely a lot of people who talk to these things they do genuinely think it's alive you know a lot of people in our only experience of AI in robots is from watching Star Trek and Knight Rider of things like that and they expect the bot to be on that kind of level which simply is impossible Hollywood expectations to heart it did so the way I've got it is it's very much as it's developed over the years it's kind of tucking on and so I can keep it kind of like a consistent personality ravanamma to try and remember does it like their concern which is things like that so to keep it like an emotional level it treats you the same way you'll treat it so if you're not very nice to it and you're polite to it it'll be polite back to you if you start insulting it or being mean the bots will be mean back to you which I think it's a fairly human trait and so you react to people like that it tries not to get angry with people and must be angry with them Isabel how did you find actually you had a real human to start with with Victoria Beckham so how did you understand and read her emotional temperament and her emotional intelligence and then transfer that to a machine luckily we had an incredible guy called Hugh in the office he's 23 and read nothing but Victoria Beckham commentary for about two weeks and everything that went through the door went past Hugh and he became the voice of Victoria Beckham it's I think it's probably a lot easier when you are impersonating a real person because people are probably more willing to believe that it does have emotions but your previous question what's quite scary is that degree to which even when you've said this is a robot this is a chatbot I'm not a human repeatedly people are desperately keen to connect emotionally and so on every bot that we've ever built which is speaking on behalf of a real person people say here's my number call me to show it's a real person or can you send a photo where you are right now so I can show my wife I can't believe I'm talking to the real you and it doesn't matter what age range the target audience is or or who the person is and it's really dangerous and I think that's one of the reasons why I'm very Pro on the the state of California is trying to introduce a rule that any chatbot needs to declare it's a chatbot and I think it should go further and say it's a chatbot built by this organization because of that emotional magic which people seek out so you didn't actually meet Victoria no she's very she's very busy just thinking about that building a persona for someone who you haven't had any human interaction with how do you construct your team like what does he do in your team for example how do you construct a team that can read this information then take that it is data turn it into a conversational form when you know if you have psychology or philosophy or all of these type of backgrounds how are you thinking about how you transfer a real person into a machine without meeting them do you not ever worry about misrepresentation because we weren't speaking on behalf of Victoria Beckham the individual mother wife friend we were speaking on Victoria Beckham the fashion designer who wants to speak about her collection was doing a lot of marketing around London Fashion Week and had things that she wanted to say we were not in a position where we were in danger of like we weren't required to tap into that side of it and it would have been inappropriate in our role if we had tried to reflect that so it had a very specific purpose yeah yep Emily when there is no specific purpose apart from playing again how do you build this 360 degree character like Isabelle said not just Victoria Beckham the businesswoman but the wife and the mother and I also is an abandonned I was a child star and actually had a very pushy family and all of this stuff because that's that's the thing that I'm interested in with character it's like when you when you meet another human you're reading them from the minute before you've even actually met them you hear their name and that name Emily means something very different to Sharma Dean yeah you know you are reading them visually from head to toe you're thinking where did you study where did you grow up and all of these we process and so quickly and building an idea of who this person is so when you don't have a specific purpose for example with your characters how do you tell that story because to me that story's for me 35 years of you know of journaling so that actually depends quite a lot on the needs of the story and one of the things that I think about quite frequently is that telling a story well is actually kind of a teaching process and so I tend to think in terms of like what are the top things that I need this person to understand about the story in order for them to even appreciate it at all and those kind of drive what the kind of key character moments are so depending on you know is this more of a drama is it more of a thriller or whatever I can identify there are these things that really need to come across and so those become things that should be reflected in the characters speech in their actions in this sort of the more handcrafted moments that are occurring in the narrative and then you can kind of step down a little older to be below that and saying I'm gonna also as an author throw in a little bit of added detail and then when you get to the kind of the bottom layer of things that really feel quite arbitrary where it's kind of like it doesn't actually matter from an artistic perspective what the answer to this question is but I just somebody might ask so what am I going to do about that that's where we actually start to get into using a little bit of just-in-time content generation where the system may actually not have an answer to that until somebody asks and then it'll it'll pick something that seems plausible based on what else we know and put it in place but I would say it's those arbitrary details that make it the most human do you know what I mean so for example if you I just watch Shinobu last night if any of you guys have been overwhelmed by this incredible drama and then I read some real-life storytelling by people who were like eh three four five and their memories of that so for example a character who has been through something like that might have mistress for government high environmental you know like the environment is really important to them so then wouldn't it be call in the story if they constantly carried around a reusable water bottle instead of drinking water I feel like it's those little details that make the story really really special guy I was gonna do you want to say something to that I was going to ask um so thinking about memory and history and someone's entire human experience how do you think about reacting to world events that are happening now because you had a spy one did you tell me you're gonna not do a bracket one no nothing to breaks it but that could be one but do you think about how characters and stories are impacted by global events in real time yeah and it's actually quite the answers that's quite prosaic but just to pick up on that that last piece as well about character AI can generate content but in the storytelling world we would never get away with it if we're dealing with and you know it's not a real-world example for anyone thinks but if we were dealing with Harry Potter and JK Rowling there is no way that a single word would get out in that project if it had not been written by her AI could not generate it similarly if an AI cannot generate a Rembrandt whatever anyone says it's not a Rembrandt a rep by definition a Rembrandt is a Rembrandt and as you said everything that came you know in his history everything every element that came up into that create that piece of art is a Rembrandt and I think we need to sort of move away from this trend of applying AI to art and creativity because it's not helpful as regards memory we've actually just about to complete it a year-long research project into the impact of memory on storytelling and again it's quite simple which is that if you have a book that book doesn't know when you're reading it whether you're crying or whether you're laughing similarly neither there's a TV show or even you know sort of linear medium but in our world it does and we do know that sorry and that's that that's interesting because for a storyteller it's not just about knowing your name but it's remembering to a certain degree of accuracy and let's say we were in a drama where I choose to miss miss remember what you've said that has a big big impact on the storytelling so I think with with in the way that we're looking at things the memory of the memory is important and then the real world is easy I mean you know that's the easy bit which is you know we can we bring in we can bring in feeds and from you know latest football scores from the weather and geolocate that's into the storyline and that then brings it it's a moment of surprise always because not that it we're trying to make the characters feel real but we're trying to create that sense of surprise and that to me is actually the essence of what makes a good story you know it surprises it unbelievably difficult to do in the story surprise implies the huge amount of context setting up and judging all the micro movements in you and then suddenly going how about her you know and then twisting it so it's a it's almost distance of what is being human I think the judging of the micro movements and like we said this this panel is about interactivity knowing how you're reacting as the story is unfolding or as the experiences unfolding I think is critical to keeping it as engaging as possible Steve do you have any plans in the future to integrate video or any sensory element so that your BOTS can really really read how the user is reacting through nonverbal communication at the moment it is purely a text-based but it can display images and videos but it can't take in you know camera feeds and develop you know attitudes from that but what you like to and yes because lots of it is you know nonverbal communication and people just said you know we don't just speak to it you know it happened it's our cousin from just a purely text so if you can see someone's rolling their eyes and things like that that'd be great to get involved with unfortunately I don't have the technological skills to work with another computer vision side of things but it would be really useful you could tell when people get him barred you could to get them to know if the bot could change it onto a different subject and I think that is probably you know the future it'd be great to get two-way interaction rather than just a purely text-based like an on an old telephone type conversation it's about tell me about how people in this two-way conversation leave feeling if you had feedback from users with Victoria back in terms of what is the end result of their emotion after going through the process so now you said that people believed you know the wanting to take selfies but was there an underlying thing in guys example with the suspect we saw a lot of anger and like mistrust and kind of an unnerving of that person's emotional state what what did you find from your Beckham how was Vicki Vicki Beckham affecting people I think the reality is is when we design conversations to be ongoing so actually they often don't have an ending because the conversations were developing around an initial experience but then how do we retain them to maintain that conversation on behalf of the brands and that's also the way that we when we analyze real human conversations if you look at your whatsapp messages right now you'll very rarely say bye anymore or you'll very rarely say I've got to go and actually we're building conversations without ends a lot of the time I'd also say that of this panel like this is the most amazingly emotionally sophisticated panel of conversation designers and ours are probably not in that same space yet because it's is for marketing instead of for gaming or for storytelling in such as in 'we actually that's a really interesting question how are your teams i think you'd be really useful for the room to understand how your teams are constructed and the type that how do you build a team around emotion and conversation and human because there is so many things being set up to get girls into stem and to get more people into AI but I would argue that humanities linguistics psychology philosophy all of these subjects are actually equally important to the role of building AI could you tell me a bit more about your team Emily sure so our team because we're actually building a tool set as well as you know actually finished pieces we have a set of engineers who are working on kind of the tech of the simulation running the characters interactions and then we also have contributions from a data science team which is looking at how do we do the natural language understanding but also things like how our particular personality traits reflected in how people speak things like how can we read that from people's input what are sort of the meanings attached to things other than regular speech so people sometimes try and communicate via emoji and things like that so we have a spread of those kinds of resources and then we also have some people who work with us with our clients to help do proofs of concept and build initial pieces of content and those people often are coming from a writing background or writing for games background so they have some experience in interactivity but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're trained programmers we have a similar slightly similar team its developers conversation designers we're lucky to have sort of stand-up comedians on the team and we have a guy with a PhD in language studies and a lot of people are a team aren't coming at it from working in this space already so we're still working out ways in which we work together if I'm honest some people are really good at natural language processing but then they're trying to educate someone that's literally only been a writer for a year into how they can think about these conversational concepts and the way that we approach it at the moment is we are we're looking at a lot of like the last 75 years of language studies to understand what the sort of what does make a good conversation if you look at Greece's Maxim's but we're also looking at our real human conversations and saying this was an important this was literally just fluff let's gather up all the fluff how do we incorporate that into the next chatbot that we build which is speaking on behalf of a podcaster which is what one of the projects are working on right now in order to make these conversations as natural as possible yes so we have send the kind of thing again we have the study Steve yesterday in regards to it's so cool tell us how you got there oh thank you you know I've always been interested in these sort of things from watching you know as we said Knight Rider and Star Trek and that but when I was a boy obviously we have not no computer power to be able to create anything like this and once I did used to do just as a hobby was to in the entertainment world again was to make dance and techno music of a kind of boom boom boom rubbish failure here and I found was one of my fellow producers he had a chatbot on his website and I thought obviously is really cool and just bought all my childhood memories flooding back and I decided to put one on my music websites but unfortunately I found was more people were coming to listen to talk to the chat bot would say listen to the music so I kind of took that as a bit of a hint and just continue working on the chat BOTS and you know you got to the stage where people were just talking to about anything and everything and just gave me so much room for it to grow and started entering competitions it started winning and I thought you know she's really really cool got involved heavily with Pandora BOTS and now kind of doing this as a full-time thing you know and how's your team can stretch it around you Bob yet so and so working on me so quick selfie sees me just for tech you guys so make sure the platform's running but all the contents all the conversational log check in and the NLP side of it it's all done by myself I don't you like an NLP tool as such creative kind of all that sort of thing myself a lot of people said to me why didn't I use something like machine learning rather than a rule-based system and the answer is because I've yet to see chat BOTS that's any good that's been created in any other method I have total control and it's you know I avoid the sort of things you see on the news where there was a peer power bot and someone said to it I've got I've been scammed and the bots said oh good for you and you know all those kind of those kind of things do slip through luckily and I'm not sort of my representing a brand like Victoria Beckham or anything like that so I kind of have cap lunch to pretty much put in anything there that I feel and if people do kind of get annoyed by it it's only there's a lot of yours you know about brexit and Trump and all that kind of thing I can just get away with the excuse of you know it's just what the computers said and a pass it on it's actually crazy to think that the most award-winning bot is not powered by machine learning can we just have a moment for that Janine we have an entire conference about a guy and the human still winning yes I mean well when I started I mean it's taken me as I say 15 years to get to this point but when I started 15 years ago people were saying you will not be able to make a chatbot that's rule-based it's impossible you'll be doing it for years but you build the best one you know these same people are still looking for shortcuts and machine learning let's just feed it lots of data and hope it works and you know I'm kind of sitting there and laughing with a string of medals Roma guy tell us about how your team is constructed well I'm gonna answer the same question that you are Steve really which is so but to context I think we're starting to see two different types emerging one is very informational and that's great and as I talked about that you know if you've got a lot of information and you can surface that up great if you want something that is more engaging properly engaging on a human and it feels like a human that's different it's very and as a completely different experience I studied Spanish and philosophy and you know what I didn't know why at the time and now I know why because it's about language it's about understanding different people's perspectives and thinking about it and and I was very lucky to have sort of done that and I use it more that more in my day to day than anything else because ultimately what I'm doing is I'm the you know an all our team our team our team very small and we spend up like it's like a film studio right so it's a poor team that thinks about all this stuff and then if we've got a big project then we bring in the writers we bring the designers we bring in partnerships with different companies all sorts of stuff so we quite cut from that cloth rather than anything else but it's about I mean it's about being human again and I totally agree with Steve you know we can you can over tech stuff and the trouble about it is that you have intended consequences of overtaking stuff and you have unintended consequences of overtaking stuff Microsoft a unintended consequences of overtaking stuff GPT - unintended consequences of overtaking a favour ticking stops I think you know to maintain control of the narrative is to maintain control of the characters like with this well and so Victoria Beckham you can't have her say something that's not her yeah it it would kill the business and the same with anything else so you've said something only that leads me really nicely to my next question about film studios so if we change tack a little bit and think about business models for entertainment business models we're using AI in storytelling you know we've seen a lot of democratization of producing content everyone has tools now to do so but there are still these big film studios that hold the power with the majority of the content that we see in terms of stories how do you see a future for this either becoming more or breaking down do you think that they'll a I Studios will replace film studios in the future just quickly to pick up on that I think there you're starting to see that or you could argue with Amazon and Netflix you know Netflix is dominant power at the moment in a lot of ways and it's the Bandersnatch moment I mean thank God for Bandersnatch you know it cuts short every presentation I do by 20 minutes because I can just go hey Bandersnatch I don't need to explain the history but well that's different to what we do is that that you know if you've played it it's it's remote control right you're in control of the story you're not in the story and one is outside and one is inside and I think what we do is is actually when you're inside the experience and as that starts to you know the impact strength of what we're doing it starts to sort of filter out you'll start to see you know it's also the games industry different but in games and to be honest in advertising do you feel that you're now competing with a different type of organization who might fear your auto you know the way that you can automate the work that would take the months to do you can you can start Isabel so for example are you now competing with traditional film TV production companies for experiences around storytelling because that budget for the Victoria Beckham would previously have gone to something else you know a TV spot or an ad campaign yes we are we're like London's lucky because we are quite good at embracing technology but when you hear things like on an operational level YouTube has created an AI which will cut down a two-minute film trailer to six seconds to create the YouTube bumper that is many companies around the world that's what they do they create trailers so imagine a whole industry being wiped out yeah adaptation effort the digital placement of that and then if you think about a lot of what we do is paid media which is buying the but we now just use a platform which is called smartly it's really good and they use AI to optimize and target all of their ads that is even more companies that are going to be wiped out and you can already see the impact that that's having on some of the largest holding companies and then from a production level I think there is a company called Frazee for example which is using AI to generate subject lines originally an email and now they're using it to create social copy again that's more agencies being wiped out so we're trying to embrace it as fast as we can but it's already having a huge effect on the industry absolutely in every way operationally production distribution every single element that you can think of Emily how will character engine transform your traditional industry model so in the game industry they're 10 the challenge is often to create a story that is giving the player as much agency as possible so you go into the game world you do a few things you want to see the characters responding to that you want to see consequences to that playing out throughout the story but the amount of that scheme Studios can do is often limited by the amount of writing talent they have available of the amount of time that they're able to put in not just to actually composing the dialogue but doing animation doing voice all of those kinds of things and so character engine and and indeed other advances in this space are leveraging what's possible to do with human writers in order to make the games that are produced that much richer that much more engaging have that many more ways to respond and we see the piece that we're doing which is about that kind of character creation really pairing with some of the other advances that are happening so for instance improved text-to-speech having text-to-speech characters that can deliver things in an emotional way that goes together nicely with what we're doing so it's not so much about replacing teams in the game industry it's about expanding what they're even able to do and then probably also bring some of those techniques and possibilities to other industries because we're also having a lot of conversations with people in entertainment outside of games robotics education Enterprise chatbots all of those kinds of things are interested in how do we do this kind of generative text storytelling in other contexts I think the gaming industry as a whole is create so many innovations for the entire world that actually you're always at the forefront of stuff and we've just got a few minutes left so I'd like to wrap up by asking you guys to tell me about which user interface or platform you're most excited about the storytelling do you still think we'll be on our phones do you think that you know there are other ways what user face or platform are you most excited about for interactive storytelling the one for me with the chat BOTS interaction is probably virtual reality I think that's going to be the next huge thing we're pretty much in the early stages but the things I've seen kind of develop over the last few years you know are incredible and they likely suit lifelike avatars and instead of you know you know texting in our just speaking you know you actually see the person in front of you and it reacts and I think the whole way of interacting with characters is going to change dramatically through that I also think math speakers as well the things like the Alexa in the Google home are going to play a huge place in interaction there's competition at the moment Alexa prize where you have to try and create a chat bot that can carry on a 20 minute conversation and you entering it I'm not allowed to good no it's unfortunately sony for universities and so I'm long past that and for it but ya know that kind of interaction it's gonna be the way forwards definitely I still think our phones because I mean everyone carries a phone around with us but I don't know maybe 10 20 years they were gonna be gnarly in a dystopian society - everyone's just sat at home with the VR goggles on and just talking to some just thinking it well that would be scary yeah especially some of the things that people talk some that chatbots about I don't think I want to know what I'm thinking about guy what do you think is the next big platform or user interface all one that's underrated I think underrated is probably VR I agree with Steve I think and by the way I think you know for Amazon to set a bar of 20 minutes is astonishingly low you know I mean the experience the suspect was a two and a half hour experience the stuff we're seeing with perfect boyfriend perfect girlfriend they they were averaging 20 minutes and some were six hours of sessions you know 20 minutes is as low as about the reason I think VR is interesting is because it's a much more intimate medium than I think people give it credit for every new medium has a roller coaster in it you know cinema I mean literally there is a roll of film started they shoved a camera on a roller coaster and so VR has the roller coaster but you know when I'm on a roller coaster I don't do that but I think you know more intimate things more intimate experiences where which are a lot slower and you know it plays to conversation I think really nicely in characters so I do think they are I mean again then you get AR and all of those but I think there's a magic that still to be found Isabelle I think it's the smartphone because smartphone combines messaging augmented reality with fire to 5g coming it will have VR without the lag and pretty much all of the emerging technology interfaces that we have work on a mobile phone and it's with us all the time and storytelling is getting shorter and shorter and more like more regularly but shorter moments Emily which gaming company do you think are the most receptive to this type of interaction in storytelling well I think there's companies that are working in the AR and VR space really get the understanding of why we need to interact with the character with natural language but even more traditional sort of console game companies are very invested in the idea of just making experiences where the characters remember the player it's a huge deal every time I talk to you anybody at studios they're like can we have characters that remember if you cheated them if you lied to them like there's a lot of designer excitement about what's possible that's really cool last thing on the intimacy part I know we've got to end actually I'll wrap up but just by saying I am not sure if entertainment should be purely intimate one-on-one one of the best things about being entertained is a shared collective experience where we're all consuming media together but having a personalized experience I would set that challenge to you guys is to create a large-scale collective experience that is intimately personalized for the individual thank you so much guys well done you
