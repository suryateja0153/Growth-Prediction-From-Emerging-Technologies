 today on brstv investigates who hasn't faced the challenge of finding that protein skimmer sweet spot between tuning and operating depth where even some of us still can't seem to get it just right this week we start a journey of solving this issue for good starting with an attempt to answer the question does operating depth or water height in the sump even matter I am Randy with this Friday's brstv investigates where we put popular reefing gear theories and methods to the test by experimenting on our own tanks so you don't have to experiment on yours and in today's experiment we test six of the most popular internal skimmers in a similar price bracket between 150 to 250 bucks to see how they operate at different depths in the sump and also to see if the manufacturers recommended operating sweet spots are accurate so much like we did for our investigative salt mix experiments where we started with a single cost per gallon analysis test which ended up blossoming into six full brstv investigates episodes we're hoping to explore the rabbit hole of protein skimmers in a similar fashion hopefully with each lesson leading to the next question in order to select the right tool for the right job and how to optimize the performance of that tool for our saltwater tanks even further I feel that the first questions that we need to answer on our path to unraveling protein skimmer performance starts with some baseline testing of what's happening inside the skimmer body where there's an interface of forced air and water being mixed together at a high velocity in order to create a mass amount of surface area from bubbles that will eventually carry waste and unwanted dissolved organic compounds out of our tanks water and into the skimmer collection cup to better understand that relationship between air and water mixture happening inside the skimmer we'll test the air draw measured in liters per hour for a handful of skimmers when installed the manufacturers recommended operating depth and then again with those same skimmers installed at one inch below and one inch above those recommendations in order to explore the question does the operating water height matter when installing your internal protein skimmer to test today's question we picked out six of our most popular internal protein skimmers from the 150 to 250 price range which were the reef octopus 150 1:10 int classic the somatic 60s space-saving skimmer skims sn1 to 7dc skimmer he shops X 120 axiom space-saving skimmer and the reef octopus 110 SSS space-saving skimmer using the recommended operating depth sweet spot right in the middle of each skimmers operating range we tested the air draw for each one using this really cool digital air flow meter we picked up from Kelly pneumatics which comes with three eight-inch ports that matches some of the most common sizes of skimmer air intake tubing using those air draw numbers as a baseline we tested what happens when we allowed the sump level to fall outside of those optimal ranges by dropping the water level to an inch below each skimmers recommended operating range then testing the airflow followed by raising the tank water level to an inch above the recommended level for another test of airflow starting with the air drop baseline for each skimmer measured in liters per hour we have the reef octopus 150 IMT which uses an 18 watt aqua trance mm pomp at a recommended operating range of seven point nine to eight point seven inches which is a sweet spot of only around three quarters of an inch right in the middle of that range at about eight and a half inches of water we tested an airflow average of four hundred nine point nine seven liters per hour which ended up significantly under the manufacturer rating of seven hundred and twenty liters per hour the reef octopus 110 int classic skimmer which utilizes a smaller version of aqua trans pump with a nine watt aqua trance 1000 has a recommended operating depth of seven to seven point nine inches and again just under a one-inch sweet spot we placed this skimmer in seven and a half inches of water and measured an average air draw of 351 point one two liters per hour which is slightly under the 420 liters per hour rating from aqua trance up next was the somatic 60s space-saving skimmer fitted with its own somatic pump made by CJ the CJ SK 600 which is the highest wattage pump today at twenty three watts and an operating range of six to nine inches for a much wider operating range sweet spot of three inches we placed the somatic 60s in between those recommended operating depths at seven and a half inches and found a baseline airflow of six hundred and one six two liters per hour which is at the top end of this pumps air draw rating of 400 to 600 liters per hour our only DC powered skimmer in today's testing was the skims s n 1 to 7 which has a QP s 1.2 8 to 13 watt pump that's housed inside the steamer body and has a 7 inch to 9 and a half inch recommended operating depth at the highest power setting for the DC pump and placed at about 8 and a quarter inches of water we see an average air draw for 31.6 4 liters per hour which lands right in the middle of skims stated air draw rating of three hundred to five hundred and forty liters per hour the eShops axiom X 120 is next which features another pump from CJ the CJ se 200 that operates at 10 watts and is recommended for installation in seven to nine inches of water we placed this skimmer halfway at eight inches in the sump and tested the air draw to an average of one sixty eight point six six liters per hour or slightly under the 180 to 200 liter per hour manufacturer rating we've got another reef octopus skimmer in the testing pool today with the 110 super space-saving skimmer which uses the same aqua trance 1000 as the 110 int however in the space-saving configuration comes installed inside the body of the 110 SSS skimmer body again this pump operates at 9 watts and at a recommended depth of seven to seven point nine inches with this skimmer placed at seven and a half inches we tested an average airflow of 211 point seven four liters per hour or about half of the 420 liters per hour rating from aqua trance all right so now with a baseline established for each skimmer being installed at that recommended operating depth sweet spot you can definitely see a pretty large difference in the amount of air each skimmers drawing for example the somatic sixty is pulling more than three times the amount of air than the eShops but it's also nearly double the size so these are probably pumps that are purposely paired to skimmer body size so next let's compare each skimmer individually after we drop below and above the extremes of their recommended levels going back to the reef octopus 150 int at a depth of about seven inches or right at one inch below the lowest operating level we actually find a very slight gain in the air draw that rose by an average eighteen point three one liters per hour two four twenty eight point two eight however at one inch over the operating depth of eight point seven inches when we ran the skimmer at about nine point seven inches we saw a slight drop in air flow down to three ninety six point nine zero liters per hour or thirteen point zero seven liters per hour less than the baseline all in all I really wouldn't consider this one to be much of a change which might have something to do with the less than one inch difference between the low and the high operating depth recommendation in fact it looks like this skimmer would have a three-inch operating window without impacting performance next looking at the reef octopus 1:10 int one inch below the recommended seven inch threshold in six inches of water we find a significant drop in air drawdown to an average of eighty five point nine eight liters per hour for a total loss of two hundred and sixty five point one four liters per hour when we look to the opposite extreme where we place the 110 int and nine inches of water we found a similar story where there was an average loss of 104 point two eight liters per hour down to two forty six point eight four so in this example both high and low operating depths had a negative impact on air draw even with the same recommended operating variance of less than an inch between seven and seven point nine inches in this case I definitely stick to the operating range of one inch on to the somatic 60s where we found a baseline of over six hundred liters per hour air draw when we drop the water level down to five inches we average an air flow of 281 point eight two or a total loss of 319 point eight liters per hour as for raising the water level to ten inches there was less of a dramatic drop in air flow to 540 1.02 liters per hour for a loss of sixty point six from the looks of it this performance is one of the most affected by changing the operating range however they started with a three-inch recommendation operating window to begin with so really not a completely fair comparison one additional note here is that even in this tank with freshly mixed salt water and no organics at the 10 inch operating depth I could not get the bubbles below the neck of the cup which could lead to an overflowing collection cup twenty yet the somatic actually comes with an air valve so that even with this highest air draw in this price range you get the ability to scale the air draw with more or less air to further optimize its performance for your tank and individual organic food and fish load the skims SN 127 is next with its baseline 431 point 6 4 liters per hour of air draw when installed in that operating depth sweet spot below the extreme lower end of that sweet spot at 6 inches of water depth we saw a drop in 107 point five eight liters per hour to a total average of three twenty four point zero six however when we raised the water level to the higher level of ten and a half inches there was an even more pronounced fall in the air draw down to two eighty nine point two zero liters per hour or an average loss of one forty two point four four just like the somatic which had a three-inch operating range this skims has a two and a half inch range so it's not surprising that if you go further than that you see a performance loss all right up next we have the eShops X 120 we're at eight inches we saw a baseline of 168 point six six liters per hour at a six inch operating depth that baseline fell to an average 139 point seven four or a loss of twenty-eight point nine two liters per hour however when placed in 10 inches of water we see a very slight increase to the air draw by a fractional five point eight two liters per hour or a total average of 174 point four eight with differences less than 50 liters per hour in either direction I'd say that this particular skimmer didn't show much of an impact on air draw however I did note that at the higher level installation it was difficult to keep the bubbles at a manageable level that wouldn't overflow the cup the reef octopus 110 SSS with the same aqua trans 1000 pump as the 110 int this time showed a minimal performance impact to the low and high operating levels with a baseline of two hundred and eleven point seven four liters per hour there was only a drop in average air flow at the six inches of water level where we saw marginal loss of ten point three to four an average of 201 point four two liters per hour as for the higher water level at nine inches there was a slight gain to 217 point eight six liters per hour or six point one to increase total this performance by far raises more questions and answers specifically because it's the exact same pump to use in the 110 int with a different body in design which had one of the largest effects to air draw from operating depth whereas in this space-saving configuration there was little to no effect at all so what does this all mean and how can we use today's data for optimizing our own protein skimmers performance well there's absolutely some skimmers whose air draw is dramatically impacted by the depth that it's operating in and others seemingly not so much as we saw from the baseline numbers there's definitely a difference across the various skimmer pumps where some had more than two and a half to three times the air draw over others possibly hinting that those particular pumps are being optimized for that size of skimmer body we did see a pretty significant difference in two skimmers with differing body styles and pump placement both utilizing the same exact pump which might have something to do with the differences in the Valle you detach Minh to each of the pumps or perhaps the shape and water volume inside the respective bodies it's just tough to say for sure wattage may also play a factor here particularly in the case of the 150 int and 110 int where we saw little to no impact to water depth and air draw to the 150 int that uses an 18 watt pump however in a similar design and pump configuration the 110 int at a nine watt pump was one of the most affected by operating depth this is even with the sweet spot recommendations for both skimmers being less than one inch from the low to the high end in that same thought process the somatic 60 with the highest wattage pump we tested today at 23 watts was also one of the most affected by changing the operating depth the major difference here being that it allows for a three-inch variance in that sweet spot operating range out of the box and recommended by the manufacturer much like we found in the early stages of our salt mix investigative testing series we're just left with more questions than answers which I don't know about you but for me actually makes this test even more exciting meaning for the next round of testing we're gonna scale up the skimmer selections who are most popular six skimmers in the axé price range bracket of 250 to 400 dollars to see if we can start drawing some parallels to what we saw here today I can't wait because at the end of all of this I imagine will walk away with some solid information and guidance as to ways you can increase the performance of your skimmer on your own tank in this next test we're gonna switch it up a little and rather than rely on the manufacturers recommended operating depths we'll test all the skimmers on a scale of five six seven and up through 11 inches so you can make more informed decisions of where to install your own skimmer okay so to rate today's question of does the operating water height matter when installing your internal protein skimmer I'm putting this one right in the middle of our reef anissina reef certainty scale at a 5 out of 10 because in today's test 2 some skimmers it did and 2 others it didn't however as we continued further testing I might have to come back and change that you know I love it when experiments like this lead to further testing not only because it's really fun to watch and progress but for many of us reefers we get a deeper look into topics that just haven't been explored before to this degree so as I mentioned throughout today's testing our salt mix experiments were a great example of this where we started with an experiment on how much your salt mix actually cost per month continue down that rabbit hole with testing on proper mixing time mix salt water storage length effects on heat and flow on mixing and storing salt water and even icp-oes testing analysis to determine if stratification really exists if you missed any of those tests click the salt mix testing playlist over here to see all the data you need to find the right salt for your needs
