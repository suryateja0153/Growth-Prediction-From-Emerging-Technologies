 the c-4 engine was a proprietary computer game engine developed by tarath and software that was used to create 3d games and other types of interactive virtual simulations for PlayStation 4 PlayStation 3 Windows XP and later Mac OS X versions 10.9 and later Linux and iOS topic development history development of the c-4 engine was led by computer graphics author Eric Lengyel who is also the founder of tarath and software although in development sporadically for several years beforehand the engine was first made available under a commercial license in May 2005 the c-4 engine was retired in May 2015 in favour of the development of the tombstone engine topic capabilities and features the architecture of the c-4 engine is that of a layered collection of software components in which the lowest layers interact with the computer hardware and operating system and the higher layers provide platform-independent services to the game code while a considerable portion of the engine is dedicated to 3d graphics there are also large components dedicated to functionality pertaining to audio networking physics input devices and scripting documentation for the engine is available online through a set of API webpages in a wiki topic graphics the c-4 engine is based on the open goal library on Windows Mac Linux and iOS platforms and it uses a one-pass per light forward rendering model the engine is capable of rendering with several different types of light sources and shadowing methods the primary method for rendering dynamic shadows is shadow mapping and the variant of cascaded shadow mapping is used for very large outdoor scenes shaders are created in c4 using one of two available methods both of which isolate the user from the shader code required by the underlying graphics library simple shaders can be created by specifying a set of material attributes such as a diffuse reflection color a specular reflection color and a group of texture maps the engine internally generates the necessary shader code for each combination of material and light type that it encounters when rendering a scene material attributes can be used to produce effects such as normal mapping parallax mapping horizon mapping and bumpy reflections or refractions see 4 also includes a graphical shader editor that allows complex custom materials to be created using a large set of predefined operations this method of designing materials enables greater creative freedom and functionality for expert users but requires somewhat more work by the user materials created using the standard material attributes can be converted to custom shaders to serve as a starting point in the shader editor the terrain capabilities of the C 4 engine are based on a voxel technology allowing full 3d sculpting to produce features such as overhangs arches and truly vertical cliffs that would not be possible under a conventional height based terrain system triangle meshes are generated from voxel data using the marching cubes algorithm and seamless multi resolution level of detail is made possible by using the trans voxel algorithm to stitch together regions of differing resolutions the engine is capable of rendering a large variety of special effects including particle systems procedural fire electrical effects volumetric fog and weather phenomena during a post-processing stage the engine can also apply full scene cinematic motion blur to the final image using a technique based on a velocity buffer as well as glow and distortion effects the engine does not provide the capability to design custom post-processing effects topic audio the c-4 engine can play sounds stored in the wav format using 16-bit mono or stereo sampling and audio data can be played from memory or streamed from disk the engine plays sounds using a custom mixer that provides capabilities such as frequency shifting Doppler effect reverberation and atmospheric absorption topic networking multiplayer gameplay in c4 is supported by a two layer messaging system that uses the UDP protocol to communicate among different computers connected to a game topic physics the c-4 engine has a native physics engine which can be used or allows the option for implementing a third-party solution instead topic tools the c-4 engine ships with basic game development tools required to make a modern game each tool is packaged as a plug-in module that exists separately from the engine itself many tools make use of the comprehensive graphical user interface system provided by the engine so that a consistent interface is presented to the user across multiple platforms Topic World Editor the World Editor tool is a 3d content creation application that is typically used to create game environments for use with the c-4 engine it provides a large set of drawing and manipulation capabilities that he used to construct world geometry as well as many game necessities such as lights sounds triggers and special effects the World Editor can import scene information through the open Jackson co ll ad a formats this enables the use of content from a large number of digital content creation programs such as autodesk maya or 3d studio max topic script editor the World Editor tool includes a graphical script editor designed to be accessible to artists and level designers as well as programmers the script editor allows the user to place various methods into a directed graph connected by fibers representing action dependencies in the order of execution script support loops through the creation of cycles in the graph structure and conditional execution is supported by marking fibers to be followed or not followed based on the result value output by the methods at which they start the engine ships with several standard script methods that perform simple actions such as enabling or disabling a scene node for example to turn a light on or off and more complex actions such as evaluating an arbitrary mathematical expression new script methods can be defined by the game code and they appear in the script editor as custom actions that can be used by a level designer topic panel editor the World Editor tool includes a sub editor called the panel editor providing for the creation of 2d interface panels that can be placed inside a 3d world the panel editor lets the user place various types of widgets such as text and images in a panel effect node that is rendered as part of the scene panels can also include a special camera widget that displays the scene that is visible to a camera placed anywhere else in the same world interface panels are both dynamic and interactive the engine provides an extensible set of mutators that can be applied to individual panel items to induce various forms of animations such as scrolling rotation or color change a character in a game can interact with a panel by approaching it and clicking the mouse inside interactive items script can be attached to such items causing a sequence of actions to occur when the player activates them topic licensing for much of its history c4 used a license that allowed free updates for life of the engine meaning no further revenue was generated by old license holders in 2014 the licensing changed to a subscription format in an attempt to boost revenues topic academics the c-4 engine has been licensed by many universities in connection with games oriented software engineering curricula or for special research projects these universities include MIT Georgia Tech Worcester Polytechnic Institute WPI McMaster University and the University of Campton students in some of these programs are required to create their own games as part of a course using the c4 engine and many of these projects have gone on to be entered in the independent Games Festival student competition one particular university research project involved that activist technology developed at WPI and the use of the c-4 engine was featured in the Discovery Channel Canada television show Daily Planet airing on May 26 2006 topic games using c4 games that use the c-4 engine include Fat Princess adventures for PlayStation 4 world of subways city bus simulator 2010 Lego wolf3d quest of Persia lot Farley cons and the thirty first utility vehicles simulator 2012 bridge the construction game rolling wing ball
