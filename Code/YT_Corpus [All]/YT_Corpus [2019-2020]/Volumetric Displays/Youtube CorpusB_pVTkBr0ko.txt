 all right Thank You Gina for the introduction hello everyone morning again I'm utterly this sonic spray is a work by me and my colleague at University of Sussex Diego Martinez plants in seeing look I'm Emily and Sriram subrahmanyam from interact lab and is funded by EU Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia and Technical University melaka so before I continue with my presentation let's let me show you a quick about the sonic spray in a video wait so it's a quick one it's it'll give you the idea about what is sun express display a permeable permeable meter displays controlled by ultrasound and when I call permeable display means it can be reached true it can you can see through it so some examples like fog screens from work by Rocco Lennon he also created and developed portable one and Lomb at all increase improve the the death of this screen by providing fog emitters in an array and Lam also try to reconfigure or reduce the miss emitters by using mechanical actuators while tokuda create more advanced phone screens creating a curve like convex and concave using an pipe control by also mechanical actuators five of them and also can adapt with a user doing some interaction now the challenges are they are all bulky they might have a high price point because if you involve with the laser of example quite expensive and it's very hard to recall figure this result in media while retaining la manera t of this the flow and also it's difficult to get a very high-resolution reconfiguration with the minima from factor so one possible solution would be worked by Hasegawa where he the world direct aerosols to a user using a vessel beam but the problem is they found ghost in in the the work but what i mean ghost is like if he tried to steer the beam left or right at certain angle let's say up to twenty degree and he got a positive it it's like replication of the beam which will create a false beam and the other one is the work didn't really explore but is it lamina or not lamina and how to reconfigure this laminar aerosol is also question two to us luckily we've published a work and we have explored how to control a complex sound fill in actively we publish at least 2018 and we really know how to reconfigure it but we still have this a few questions for example what is the minimum size of the viscera transducers for the air source to work as a display and how to reconfigure this aerosol we haven't tried yet for this and explain and then that's the flow laminar so these few questions now this paper that we published will describe the minimum size required for transducers we call it phase rate transistors as PA t pad and will describe how to modify it and we'll verify the laminar DT of the flow so our insight on we want to share the insight on the technique to reconfigure a laminar air assault for me their displays through smaller but so if this is a best of if you can think about like transduces arranged in like a conical kind of shape now if you cut and slice of X and Z plane you can imagine like the sound source propagates this direction while this transduces propagates and the other direction when they meet at the center they will create very high intensity and this intensity will induce air flow to going upwards so we've done the 3d simulation of it in a is the 16 x 16 array creating besser beam we done a slice of x and y plane in B we see a very high intensity in the middle while C will show you all the sound pressure level of all from 16 x 16 to 2 2 x 2 now how will your uncle configure this aerosol so we have the pad the phase delay given by the equation if you don't want to think about the equation now we create the beam for example and we will create a narrow kind of mist will go upward now if we will control using a control point let's say the control point is P where you can get a head there is 0 0 0 s in this case we try 60 mm now we want to shift it and create like Delta X Y and this is the the equation for it which is C now the final will be the final phase delay will be fee at with C so you get you will be able to shift it now we've tried we shifted in first row we shift 5 mm of each like ABC and D 5 mm 10 mm 15 mm and we track the changes of sound pressure level at the second row quite good we didn't see any ghost yet but we have a problem here whenever we extend the shift from 20 mm to 35 mm we see ghosts also not good at the bottom alakay the the for troll now we thinking about how about we try is a metamaterials because this metamaterial have a very small size is less than or half of all the wave length which is really good the problem with the Hasegawa is because the speaker and also we having the problem speaker is quite large bigger than the wave length this is the metamaterial you we have like 16 of them each of them introduce different phase delays you can read more on paper now let's say I have 35 mm I introduce a better beam by using the metamaterial now I will use phaser a transducers to shift it when I shift it so the ghost gone it will be gone now we've tried we have another problem the response of this the aerosol to the Bessel beam is poor so we decided not to use the meta material otherwise it will be very very slow and the display you cannot see clearly and then we done some study on the laminar tea we found that all our transducer like 2 times 2 until to 16 times 16 they have low number of Reynolds and it's not turbulent edge which is good then we studied that 16 sorry 6 times 6 transduces array of rate this is enough for us to create the airsoft but 4 times 4 is not enough to create the airflow we compared the sound pressure level and the air flow speed only for 6 times 6 because this is the minimum transduces that we need and interested interestingly in be you can see they have like similar pattern we done a correlation between the sound pressure level and FF flow speed got a very good correlational we can say that to increase the air flow speed you can increase the sound pressure level on Nexus we've done some evolution to our sonic spree with tick we capture a photo or in long exposure of this steering the the aerosol in lateral direction and we say this is as we State this as a lateral resolution and we change the frequency of this lateral resolution so one complete resolution would be from 0 to 15 mm left and 0 to 15 mm right we found that from 1 to 8 heads it's decreasing gradually but from 9 heads to the 25 it's constant we cannot go beyond that because it's constant and we found out that the maximum we can go to lateral move the aerosols light up to 8 heads and we also do like lateralization by number of transducers but the result is like not significant maybe we thought that we have low sound power we might need to change the the transducer with the higher sound power let's say 20 volt for example and will increase lot the lateral resolution will be be larger if you used highest on power so the application you can see from the video that we tried with the like a game for example and some display in 3d position where you see but the fly can move in 3d space and also like video conference and we also state that this is not only for display for visual display but you can also extend it to like let's say in virtual reality where you can use it for notification of temperature like hot air cool we can just direct it because some of the work use a very bulky setup just to direct some hot air or cold air in their work and also sonic spray can be used to improve the current fog screen because if you see the current fog screen in be at some point a certain height there will be a turbulent flow but if we put sonic spray we can induce air flow at this region at the turbulent flow region to increase the height of the screen and in case of mechanical actuators with fog screen we can change the direction we might have better control of the screen with by applying sonic spray onto these mechanical moved funk emitters so as a tech ways we reconfigured aerosol for display using only six times six pad which is like six times six centimeter while retain the laminar flow and we provide significant benefits for example avoid enclosure so you can reach treat no problem no noisy mechanical parts and also we produce very precise control of the aerosol thank you I am happy to take any question if there's any thank you for interesting talk and um do you have any questions for him we have about couple minutes no no questions from the floor could you kind of comment on kind of resolution that you can actually get from your your own sonic spray the resolution the resolution of the display we've tried is like the team M because if you can go laughs on the left 15mm and the right 15mm so in total 33 centimeter of display currently you can go that that big but not today okay do you think it can be you know yeah if you can increase the sound power we might be able to improve the resolution of the screen and we also can improve the response rate of the aerosol the particles much more responsive because at the moment how got like 30 milliseconds of response rate okay what what do you think is the most I guess the potential application that you you wanted to use this for yeah been thinking about not replacing as but as an alternative to if you've seen this spinning display using LED because you can touch it but you can just put a mounted on the wall and now you can see a three dimension 3d object on the wall but it's very high up there but if you can put it you can touch and do some interaction with it it's quite interesting because not dangerous at all is just a smoke yeah any other questions okay yes hello sunyeong came from Aalto University one side effect may be the I decrease it increases the room humidity is a lot probably so is there any alternative and what a missed alternative then what amidst the what if missed material are using currently it's just like for fog screen it's like can't remember the name of it but you can find it like you know vape the liquid for for wait-wait-wait-wait pan we a electronic cigarette have this yep yeah okay thanks right if you don't have any more questions thank you again let's give him a big hand [Applause]
