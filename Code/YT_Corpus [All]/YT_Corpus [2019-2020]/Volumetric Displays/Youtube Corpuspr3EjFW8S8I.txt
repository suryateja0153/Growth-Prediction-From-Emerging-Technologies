 welcome to Douglas on trading today we're talking cumulative volume Delta whoa yeah cumulative volume delta what's up guys Douglas on trading we're gonna be talking the cumulative volume Delta and today it's specifically the NinjaTrader order flow cumulative volume Delta you would need a lifetime license to find this on ninjatrader it's part of their order flow suite and the order flow suite only comes with the lifetime license so let's get into it the first thing that we're going to need to know is what the hell is cumulative volume Delta well let's read what NinjaTrader has to say so you track buying and selling pressure with order flow cumulative volume Delta so what is cumulative volume Delta Delta refers to the net difference between buying and selling volume at each price level cumulative Delta builds upon this concept by recording a cumulative tally of these differences in buying verse selling volume and this is important here it's passive verse aggressive passive verse aggressive orders for traders using the cumulative Delta limit orders are considered passive while market orders are considered aggressive in other words buying at the ask or selling at the bid are considered aggressive since these orders will fill immediately this implies a sense of urgency in the market with that in mind the cumulative volume Delta calculation uses the following formula market buy orders - market sell orders equals the Delta and so that's important it's not limit orders not the orders that are waiting in the book those are considered passive buyers and sellers we're looking for the aggressive buyers and sellers so they're the ones placing the market order and once again the cumulative delta is the market by orders - the market sell orders to get the delta and one of the main uses of the cumulative delta indicator is to confirm or deny trends and they give you a little chart here to show that this looks like a small trend working up the cumulative delta is actually working down so it looks like possibly sellers are actually control at least the aggressive sellers are in control so that might mean that this is not a valid trend now with the NinjaTrader options there are two options there's a session option and a bar option I will show you both of these on the chart shortly so the session option is this top display here and so that is kind of the cumulative gathering so if over time the market buys are winning over time then this is going to be going up like you see over here to the left and over time if the sellers are winning you're gonna see a start going down like that and then you can get a big picture view of what's happened throughout the day now the other display option is the bar option which does not do this whole cumulative collection over the day it is just a cumulative collection of each price level so if this is a five-minute chart then each bar here would represent a five-minute bar on that chart if it's a 200 tick chart each one of these represents the 200 tick so on and so forth and get the idea and so this just lays it out in a flatline and it kind of tells you I guess each individual bar how aggressive that bar was with the buyer's or seller's that's really all we need to know to get started and so remember what the main use of this are really twofold what NinjaTrader says is to confirm market trends up or down another thing people use it for is to find divergence and I will show you both of those so what we have here is the es and what are we on we on the 5-minute let's get this up here like so so we're on the yeah we're on the es 5 minutes sharp and I'm just gonna take you through a number of days here and we'll find out what we can find out the first of all you want to start you know somewhere where there's actual volume so you can see at the beginning of the day you know this is this is the overnight trading there's not much volume sit down below it represents that there's not much volume going on cumulative Delta would be virtually useless in that situation so it really doesn't come in handy till about 8:30 and what you see here we're currently set on the bid-ask let's do that real quick actually now that I think about it let's look at the options for a ninja trader so these are the options you've got the bid-ask so that's market buyers market sellers hitting the bid and the ask and that's what determines the Delta and then we've got a set on session now there's another one we're not gonna look at the up/down the uptick verse down tick which is what this one is up down tick it's kind of like bid-ask but it's going to give you a little bit different data so this is when price ticks up or price ticks down it's measuring that instead and I think the bid-ask in theory is more accurate I don't know so that's up to you there's no reason to look at both of them so we're just gonna look at the bid and ask on the session and then I'll show you on the bar chart and so we start out with this trend and the cumulative Delta is moving up basically in unison it's moving across in unison it's moving up in unison so this isn't telling you basically anything it's practically useless for that day just fine we go to the next day start around 8:30 we're moving up here and you know what I found is for strong trending day the Delta there's there's not much use for it but when you get into a day like this where you've got like double tops you got ranges going on then it can be slightly helpful to see what direction the markets going in so you know it's moving in unison as it was on the previous day and then it moves down in unison but then we get here and so this is where it could come in handy and this is up to you I mean whether you want to use this tool as anything and simply an indicator it's just some information that you need to use at your discretion in context with your particular strategy so we're just trying to see if this might help your particular strategy at all so as we go up you know what they were saying earlier is maybe you think this is an uptrend but the Delta in this case is not moving up at all in fact it's moving down it's moving sideways let's mostly just moving sideways but it is got a slight downtrend going on on the Delta and on the chart you've got the uptrend so you're thinking maybe maybe this isn't a valid up and with this double top here that would be the context where you say maybe this is the area that I want to sell it might make me feel better about taking that double top that we're not gonna have a breakout because there's not enough push from the buyers to make the breakout happen and of course anything in trading is not guaranteed things can change on a dime but in that situation on this particular day it would have been helpful let's move to the next day ah before I forget this is also an indicator of divergence right all right so we've got a top here and a top here so as the market goes up this goes down that's what they mean by divergence so you're not just confirming whether this trend is valid or not in this situation on the divergence you're saying you know these don't these two things don't match up so that's why I might want to be looking for sells instead of buys so that's divergence let's go to the next day let's see if anything happens on this day we've got it's a very rough day up and down cumulative Delta is moving practically in unison so again that's a day when it doesn't really come into play strong uptrend day I said mostly on these days it's pretty useless all that's doing is just going up with the trend doesn't show you anything there and here we go so we got another one of these range type days let's see if this will show us anything you know it's pretty much moving in unison for the most part we do get divergence so this is a little sneakier a little sneakier divergence right it's a little harder to see so we can go off the tips whether you want to go off the close or the tips that's up to you but what you're seeing here the markets gone down in the the cumulative deltas going down with it and then pops up a little bit cumulative Delta pops up and it goes down and goes up and cumulative Delta's moving with it except except on the chart you see that the chart move past those previous lows on the chart we've moved past the previous lows we've come into the the low of the day but on the cumulative Delta we did not on the cumulative Delta we actually made a higher low so this is classic divergence in context so you're at the low of the day and that's where somebody might use the cumulative Delta to confirm or disconfirm that they want to take this double bottom and go along with it we get to the top and then we've got kind of a smaller divergence after this as you can see on the Delta you've got a top here and that matches with the top on the chart and then the Delta moves back up with the chart but it doesn't reach back up to the top the way the chart does and so that's another small variation of divergence where somebody might be looking to use it as confirmation to go long or short will do maybe one more day here see if there's anything we can see charts moving pretty much in unison there didn't see anything there and that's pretty much just a strong downtrend that's confirmed by the cumulative Delta so not much going on there so you can see that's it's not something that you're gonna be able to use all the time you'll have to keep a lookout for those divergences or those you know rare areas where it can confirm or disconfirm the trend now I personally don't use the cumulative Delta but I know there's a number of people out there that do and so that is all up to you so let's take a different look let's look at the bar real quick just to get an idea what that looks like you got to wait for it to calculate we need some jeopardy music there we go so on the bar you can see it's just a flat line and this gives you a better view of the volume within the specific bars so again you would have to come up with the kind of your own use for for how that's gonna play into your strategy if it could play into your strategy at all again it could be something just to confirm or disconfirm the trend you know you see this going down but it bounces around a little bit and so maybe you're looking down at these bars and notice that the Reds are obviously more dominant I guess a good way to put it the Reds are more dominant than than the greens with the buys and so that might confirm your bias that we are going to continue heading down lower or when we hit this low and start moving up you get these real solid buys going across here that might confirm in your mind that maybe we're ready for a reversal of course the chart is showing you much of the same data so I don't know how beneficial the bar version would be but maybe you'd like it better and we'll keep it short and simple we'll go back to this day just to see if there's anything on the bar chart that might show you a divergence or anything like that dont know will leave the bar up to you leave the bar session up to you you can you can play with that on your own to figure it out but I wanted to give you a quick overview of what a cumulative Delta is what it is with divergence and how people use it and again this is the NinjaTrader order flow cumulative Delta but there are other indicators that do the same thing you don't necessarily need the NinjaTrader one that's it boys good luck good trading
