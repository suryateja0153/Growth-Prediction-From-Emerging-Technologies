 This video contains no voiceover so feel free to increase the playback speed and skip ahead Skip to 03:04 for the anti-aliasing comparisons Skip to 21:56 for the brightness section Skip to 29:20 for the final result More timestamps in description First we’ll set our basic settings, and after that our anti-aliasing RE2’s VRAM usage calculation was broken on launch, and it looks like RE3 is no different The next setting you are wondering about is anti-aliasing Which is best: FXAA+TAA, SMAA, or something else? So let’s compare AA settings side-by-side after we finish our settings You will notice two things about FXAA+TAA and SMAA FXAA+TAA is very blurry, and SMAA is full of shimmer Pay attention to three things: people’s hair, the dirt on Jill’s shoulder, and the blood on Mikhail’s vest So these two options aren’t great. But we can apply &lt;b image sharpening&lt;/b Image sharpening was recently added to the Nvidia control panel, so make sure you have a recent GeForce driver Enabling image sharpening is dead simple.  Pick &lt;b Program Settings&lt;/b and find your game All these RE3 suggestions could mean we have to do this  with executables in the final version of RE3 Don’t think I forgot about Radeon owners I think the Radeon control panel can only apply image sharpening globally Otherwise let me know in the comments And here is our FXAA+TAA and SMAA this time with image sharpening (IS) You can also reduce aliasing by increasing your resolution The resolution scale setting is called &lt;b Image Quality&lt;/b in RE3 If you have GPU performance to spare, definitely turn it up. Try combining it with the &lt;b FidelityFX + CAS&lt;/b setting With AA sorted, it’s time to fix the game brightness. (Final results at 29:04) The default brightness sucks, so we are going to use the in-game calibrator We’re gonna start out testing the darkest lit area Next up, an area with medium lighting For now, let’s apply the same settings we found before Right now, the game both looks better &lt;i and&lt;/i too dark So we are gonna increase the 1.0 brightness the calibration tool recommended I am just gonna leave the min and max brightness we found This is the game with the brightness bumped from 1.0 to 2.5 This is better but still too dark Let’s increment the brightness until we strike gold These look just about right. Anything brighter will be too much This increase isn’t improving anything beyond what we already have This looks like a good place to end the comparisons I’m gonna go with a brightness of 4.0 Here is a very bright area with our calibrated &lt;i and&lt;/i tuned brightness (4.0) And this is the game’s default brightness (ew) We made it! FXAA+TAA with image sharpening and custom brightness (4.0) it is This video was a &lt;i total&lt;/i pain to make, and I hope you found it useful
