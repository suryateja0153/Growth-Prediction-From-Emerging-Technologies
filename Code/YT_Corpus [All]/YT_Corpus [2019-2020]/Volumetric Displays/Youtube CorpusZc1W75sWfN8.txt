 last year I quit my job which was super exciting and also scary and I never thought I would be that person and yet here I am in my living room talking to myself I have you to thank for it so thanks for being here when I first struck out on my own I was super burned-out and I just wanted some time to chill so I started watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe in chronological order by story from the beginning including the TV shows yeah highly recommended it was actually super fun and definitely a conversation starter linked to the CNET list in the description thanks seen it but this got me thinking about Holograms which are literally everywhere in Marvel's universe all the Iron Man's Black Panther the guardians of the galaxy the agencies of shield because you know like attorneys general yeah makes sense all the Avengers oh they love their Holograms anyway you get it these movies are all set in the near future but we don't actually have Holograms yet right do we have questions greetings programs thanks for tuning in to inner dose of trace come find me on all the social medias and make sure you subscribe so you get all the episodes of uno dos of tres would come out every single week welcome new people I'm trace that's my channel computerized tomography and fascinating to humankind it would seem because the first attempt to make a three-dimensional hologram was in the 1960s but Holograms technically aren't what you're seeing in the MCU scientifically speaking a hologram is a 2d thing that appears 3d it's got more information in a 2d space than it should a 3d thing that is a 3d thing would be called a volumetric image or volumetric display now I'm going to be using the term hologram but know that what I mean is a volumetric display it's not entirely accurate to say hologram but there's not really a quick way to say volumetric display and the acronym mm-hmm it's taken yeah so for my purposes today a hologram is a three-dimensional image reproduced from a pattern of interference produced by a split coherent beam of radiation such as a laser don't think radiation from nuclear plants by the way it's just light electromagnetic radiation bathing right now out of my face it's a 3d image that somehow is able to float in the air it was first used as a pop-culture plot device in the 1893 book the Carpathian castle by BAE Jules Verne and that's just amazing that man is amazing I love it also region but really Star Wars is sort of what made it a thing because if you look it up in pop-culture mentions of holograms before the 70s not that much going on after the 70s everywhere and Star Wars loved volumetric displays so much that they actually pegs the entire plot of act 1 on the performance of a tiny little blue volumetric display holograms are painting with light in 3d space but even though it's a long time ago in a galaxy far far away we are not quite like that yet here light doesn't just stop on its own and that's the biggest obstacle to Holograms see light just kind of tends to go in a direction until something stops it for example your eyeballs when you look at the Stars the light that you're seeing is literally physically from That star maybe it's a billion years old that's amazing right but because that light doesn't stop until it gets absorbed into your eye buckets or hits the tree or the ground or an asteroid or whatever most of our holograms have to cheat and look like this these are spinning blades that simulate a 3d object the LEDs are flashing really fast to emit light and make it seem like there's something there not unlike those stupid clocks that you use to get at Spencer's gifts that just did this the whole day oh god they were so dumb why did people buy those the effect is pretending to be a hologram and what it's relying on is the stupidity of our brains I'll get back to that in a second because the screen is moving at such a high speed you can't touch it it would hit your finger and I learned that the hard way as a kid curiosity almost took off my fingers just a story for another time but if you want to make a volumetric display without spinning blades or flitting back and forth like the stupid Spencer's gift to reflect light off of one thing you see a lot is water like Disney's water projection for Fantasmic which I love so much Disney's use of science to make magic is the best I love so much if you're watching and you work at Disney call me because I would love to work there or other solids like UCLA's augmented reality sandbox which you might have seen an example of in the recent episode of smarter every day but none of these are true holograms like you would see in Star Wars or Star Trek or the MCU right somewhat disappointing and yet there are Holograms out there in real life and I looked up all of the information let's do it there are two types plasma and particle Holograms basically our brain is lazy so all you have to do is pulse a light in a circle or move a laser around and our brain will draw the lines using those pulses to fill in the gaps to make it seem like this is a butterfly it's called the persistence of vision and it's the same thing that makes movies and TV work but movies and TV are two-dimensional so they're little light-emitting things are called pixels but we're talking 3d so we need a new word voxels yeah it's literally the exact same thing but it's just points in 3d space so Holograms today use the laziness of our brain plus voxels to make drawings in 3d space particle Holograms are fascinating use lasers to literally trap particles in midair technically they're called optical trap displays or free space volumetric displays the most well-known when is that a Bringham Young University and it's what you're seeing here it's basically a tiny particle being suspended on the forces of near-invisible laser light the laser heats the particle a bit allowing it to pull and push it around using the electromagnetic energy of the laser light a second laser is actually creating the color and lighting it up and they can make it any color you want and if you walk around the display it's actually there it's in 3d space with you which is incredible if there were lots of particles there like shooting around creating a whole bunch of different things you could walk around them and see the sides of say a person's face or the top of their head it's there it's physical it's in front of you but it's not perfect cuz right now it's super teeny and help me obi-wan Kenobi you're my only hope it's just not as good that's the one that they have they can't control lots of particles at once yet they just got the one by the way that particle not dust or plastic it's cellulose it's a plant fiber specifically made and picked up by the lasers and that actually exposes another weakness because the particle it can blow away in the wind and it's going image would disappear and that makes it tough for adoption in the military on top of that if this product is the one that comes to say CES in 2025 is like a thing that shoots out of your watch and tells you messages or like I don't know it's on the Google home or something you would probably then need particle cartridges so you would sell the device and you still have a steady stream of income just like an inkjet printer after a bit of time your TV would be like more particles is needed in order to watch the big game so you got to go fill up the old cellulose cartridge over at Best Buy or whatever yay capitalism and so if you don't want a particle cartridge you'd have to use the other system and that is a plasma hologram plasma solved that problem by just literally heating up the air here's a project called fairy lights in femtoseconds it's a display from tokyo using high-powered lasers fired for just a few femtoseconds at a time creating a tiny ball of superheated plasma it's so metal in the air it's ionizing actual air no cellulose needed which sounds a little bit like a spider-man villain but in fact it's not and you can touch it allegedly it feels like sandpaper or like a little static shock even though it's a high-powered laser it doesn't burn you because the lasers fire for only like 30 to 270 femtoseconds which is like quadrillions of a second they're also firing so fast that they can react to people as well so you could have an interactive display where you can feel a checkbox and tap it or check it and it will be able to react to that or if you think about it Tony Stark's virtual volumetric displays dude man or whatever but because it's a flash of plasma I'm such an idiot but because it's a flash of plasma the color fidelity is limited it can really just do white unlike the optical trap display that has a whole gamut of colors so both of these things look like Holograms they quack like Holograms so they're Holograms or volumetric displays right yes and no they're not ready for consumer use yet they're super tiny and they're not entirely perfected and miniaturized yet plus both plasma and particle displays have a big problem and that's being see-through just like Princess Leia's message you can see through the image no matter where you put it in 3d space and solutions are thin on the ground as much as the images appear thin in the air and while it works really well in movie that would not make it easy to use as an actual computer display so volumetric displays are real but we can't use them quite like the guardians of the galaxy yet no smooth perfect surfaces and depending on the tech the color is a bit difficult they're just pinpoints of light that our brain fills in the space around but technically the first TVs were low resolution black-and-white we commonly see 4k TVs today with flat surfaces of 8 million pinpoints of light and a huge color gamut once we figure out the technology what's to stop voxels from being able to get denser and brighter and better in every way the main thing there is data a tiny icon on your computer screen might be 256 rows of 256 pixels right but a voxel adds another dimension 256 by 256 by 256 which is a huge increase in data and I'm no computer engineer but we're talking like an order of magnitude at least imagine if your 4k TV needed to make four thousand depths as well every twenty-fourth of a second or every 60th or 120th if you're gaming the data throughput for something like that would be nutso I read one writer who did some math and they said that it might be hundreds of gigabytes per second for a very small like one 720p volumetric display because of all these problems for now we just have to cheat we use 2d displays to mimic three dimensions we call it virtual reality which is all encompassing or augmented reality which is an overlay I love augmented reality I think it's going to be way huger than VR very soon because a Ark it comes in every single one of these imagine creating virtual dimensional displays over information and advertisements games and scavenger hunts updates on specific locations or at restaurants geocaches the possibilities of the amount of data that you could layer onto the boring old reality we already live in would be amazing and you don't have to write a whole new reality there's already a lot of data out here ready for us and if Pokemon go can get people out of the house with a tiny little teeny screen if we give people glasses then there's no tiny window into a virtual world it is the world and mark my words as Queen Oprah said a billion pockets y'all also you know 50 million wrists so maybe soon a million faces you know Apple will create a device that works with the AR get to take it from here to here then we can fake it until we literally can make it making the show I spend a lot of time driving up and down the coast of California because one it's beautiful and because do both San Francisco and Los Angeles have some amazing science that I want to explore but I also want to enrich my brain while I'm driving which is why I love audiobooks there's never been a better time to start listening on audible audible has the largest selection of audiobooks on the planet and because you watch uno dos tres you get a 30-day free trial that also supports the show when you go to audible.com slash trace or txt trace to 500 500 a whole month for free this year I've decided to only read books by women and most recently I listened to buried beneath the baobab tree by Adobe Tricia knew Bonnie and this was a powerful book about girls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Nigeria it's got unusual and gripping writing a gut-wrenching story and wow what an ending anyway check it out there's never been a better time to start listening on audible now with audible originals the selection has gotten even more custom with content made for members audible the most inspiring minds the most compelling stories the best place to listen again go to audible.com slash trace TR AC e or text race to 500 500 listen for a change and remember it supports the show which is good for you and good for me so thanks now obviously VR is having and has had a big moment right now and I didn't mention it because I thought you might want to check out Milan's video the science verse he gathered a bunch of different ways that VR is being used to help us cope with the human condition while we wait for volumetric technology to catch up what if I told you that we could integrate ourselves into our own imagination with VR and even improve both our physiological and psychological well-being by doing so that's because we are VRS ability to be a game changer in neuro medicine is amazing so amazing I've decided to dedicate an entire video on my channel to explaining how so be sure to hop on to the science first in this two-part Club and of course do be sure to subscribe to my friend trace Dominguez because well his channel is pretty dope to everyone thank you so much for tuning in to inner dose of
