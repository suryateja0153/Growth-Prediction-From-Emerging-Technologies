 this video introduces passive texture displays and give several examples involving functional prototypes of those kind of displays passive this place means the displays do not emit light they do not emit photons they are able to reflect light in different ways meaning that they can change the color but it is visible only if the light is put on them passive this place is like a sheet of paper able to change its colors content etc and time Pasi display a light reflecting the main advantage is that more there is the light on them for instance during a shiny day better it is visible where do they display an example of passive display is a reading device named Kindle shown on the left side of this slide on the right side a t-shirt containing 4 pixels passive display is presented Pasi texture displays are mostly based on the electronic phenomena electroform ISM is defined as the ability of a material to change its color in reversible way when an electrical potential is applied across it the oxidation and reduction chemical processes are responsible for this color change this phenomenon can be seen in car interior mirrors or even semi-transparent curves or building windows newborn zoom liner 787 windows blinds work following this phenomenon however up to now a very few visitors try to apply like from principle on textile substrates electronic screens have a large moving angle large color palette low energy consumption and the memory effect meaning that the voltage input changes the color then even if the display is not powered the color remains the drawbacks of those displays are relatively slow color change and limited lifetim if not encapsulated on this slide Siemens patented server layer electronic structure is shown may be simplified to a four layer structure by forming an easy compound containing a missing ink with the electrolyte and iron storage material as shown in the bottom image of the slide this simplified structure is better adapted to flexible substrates such as textile fabric to flexible EC displays of the third generation developed a Gentex Research Laboratory the tents that are shown in the videos after this slide to stable color states are green and red and it is possible to switch from one to another by applying a low positive voltage of three to five volt during several seconds by applying the same but negative voltage it is possible to come back to initial State in this example a color change is well observed and other fast the number of cycles we have achieved a 10 set with this kind of display is about 800 as you can observe on this slide on both sides of this plane flexible and transparent PTX escorted by i2 are used to bring the voltage VDC compound collectors have to be transparent to make a color change visible a palette of possible colors is very large and it is shown in the next slide after videos however the hand is not texture it is rather plastic and even if our display is flexible it does not feel as textile display because of that next generation one how the texture displays has been developed in this slide it is possible to see various electronic polymer films on ideal glass and a color palette many capitals of colors reduced and oxidation states are available as explained already in order to develop 100% textile displays attention has been designed afford narration of EC texture displays composite 3 texture layers without any plastic part pedo PSS has been used as an easy ink outer layer of the fabric that may be PT cotton silk or any other are coated my pillow PSS pin spacer layer is coated vinyl actually therefore two outer text layers served as electrodes and is sink in the same time Electra helps reduction or oxidation reaction when positive voltage is applied from lower to upper electrode one electrode is oxidized in the other one the other one reduced making their colors to change when the voltage is positive from mapper and negative to the lower electrode reduced electrode becomes oxidized and the oxidized one becomes reduced and our color changes again in the following videos for generation of EC displays and their functionings are shown you
