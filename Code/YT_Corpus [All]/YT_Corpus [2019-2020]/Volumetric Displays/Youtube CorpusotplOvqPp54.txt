 The DUG Insight gather view allows you to view multiple gathers at specified increments for example these 4 Inline gathers displayed along crossline 1788 The Inline crossline view allows you to view inline and crossline stack data but also common offset planes from the gather volumes If a gather volume is selected the offset value appears in the navigation bar and allows you to scroll through the offsets near to far, and then back again The Inline gather crossline view allows you to simultaneously view the the gather with the stacked Inline and crossline at the gather location Navigating uses the same techniques as the other views for example Step through the IL/CL locations in the navigation bar Double click on the map Or drag the navigation markers on the map You can also type in a specific value in the navigation bar If the IL CL does not match a valid gather location nothing will be displayed as the gathers are not interpolated Use the right click on the number in italics to move to the nearest uninterpolated location As with the standard IL CL view I can select the gather as input to the ILCL panels and display a common offset slice through the gathers The gather offset is indicated with a navigation marker in the gather panel As well as comparing the gather to the final stack you could compare the gather to one of the many interactive process available in Insight To get a better idea of Near vs Far I can mute the gathers and display the output of a muted stack function in the IL CL panels with the muted gather in the central gather panel When I apply a 60 degree mute both panels update accordingly And now a 40 degree mute These are the far angles between 30 and 40 degrees And finally the near angles between 0 and 10 degree mutes
