 Kelly pneumatics proudly introduces the digital mass flow meter a flow sensor for oxygen and air that accurately measures and displays mass flow rate volumetric flow rate gas temperature atmospheric pressure and gas pressure unlike other flow meters the digital mass flow meter has a touchscreen interface offering immediate customization in seconds it also automatically adjusts for typical errors in flow calculation due to back pressures of up to 100 psi the unit also has an optional output of 0 to 5 volts as a measure of flow rate for use with an oscilloscope or voltmeter the digital mass flow meter has a touchscreen interface offering immediate customization for varying specifications this customization includes selecting the preferred units for each specification including many standard units typical to scientific and engineering applications for example to change your units of measurement simply click on the Settings icon on the main display and then select flow from here you can change the medium change form volumetric to mass flow and select the preferred units of measurement the touch screen also makes it easy to switch between which specification is the primary units for example it can be easily adjusted to display the pressure when using it as a pressure meter using the touchscreen interface simply hold down the pressure section for 2 seconds then click the main display button if needed select the preferred units of measurement and then click the Save button the digital mass flow meter can automatically adjust for typical errors in flow calculation for back pressures of up to 100 pounds per square inch pipe threaded ports are leak tested to ensure pressure can be held and flow rates accurately measured
