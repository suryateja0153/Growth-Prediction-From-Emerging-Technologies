 good afternoon everyone my name is Oscar Sato from Tokyo Institute of Technology today I'm glad to present our flashlight interaction system named Amelia right at first I want to present short video of this work in this research we developed information about a system using multiple rostral like devices a cold embryo right our success enables the user to display most layered information on the real world using multiple rasterize devices frustrates is one of our one hope user-friendly portable writing device it's not require any specific manipulation and the duct area can be reached only by aiming the device to the desired direction these characteristics of flashlight is called flashlight metal and has been used as real-world oriented information search and presentation methods modulus flashlights also have been used for Mochis and interactions in the module module asteroid scenario but asteroids are pointed in the same direction and naturally overlapped with each other previously statists have been utilizing the element of much flashlights information sharing is a modular communication or collaborative work in previous research in order to project information in the world like a flashlight a portable projector has been used it is easy to over information on anywhere especially especially in mods proselytes modular situation however a small projector base for a 360 melikhaya 3d position what rocky position were post tracking system in addition we use that overlap multiple projectors image the other time in is Cara who brighten his collection required so in previous works using portable projectors it is difficult to the display most layered information so the three or more rasterize devices another way to implement flashlight projection system there is a method using a fixed projector camera system broken base rasterized system is composed of an aisle for us right ir camera under visible light projector the aisle right emitted from the aisle for us right is captured by the IR camera and is mixed with over a images mixed images is immediately projected on the surface by visible light projector the advantage of program based system is a projection image are mixed with a natural right texture however this method has also have this 11 advantage it's a system trucks must be right soft spots each light spots should be trucked in the mid independently however was right over up opals rights are mix each other and a home a job is right such as shape position site or ID data roast atom and it is very difficult to separate this again previous works has been challenged to separate mix right integral system and identify multiple collage right multiple moderated right ID by using frequency analysis technique however it is difficult to apply frequency analysis to each big set of the camera another lizard such as Elizabeth shuttle utilizes utilize different wavelengths of iron light combined in its different types of iron pass filter however number available right is limited because it is difficult to create increased the type of filters so in this research we proposed the projector camera based in his over a system that supports multiple flashlights called the Emilio right Amedeo right system account separate multiple flashlights sports and project developed in information on each flush right by using radio synchronized image processing and a real-time image synthesizing technique the first advantage of Umbria right is to increase the maximum number of users and flashlights this makes it possible to use to use flashlight meter in wider projection space the second Ottoman advantage is the system can increase the number of combination of information and also increase the number of alleles of information this make it's possible for users roles in most layered contents to selectively selectively combine and over information of specific layers next I'm going to explain prototype implementation will ameliorate system a protime system is composed of a cheap projector with a scale high-speed camera with our first filter no PC and a radio transmitter the flashlight device is composed of IR LEDs but reeds and a small microcontroller with a radio receiver there are no additional input buttons except power switch on the flashlight on off state of all flashlights are remotely controlled by a wireless signal transmitted every frame from projector camera system next I'm going to explain for us right separation algorithm as I mentioned immediate system broadcast 2.4 gigahertz radio signal that contains no signal of cross lights before every shutter timing over the camera immediately after receiving a signal rasterized image fulfill milliseconds in this implementation one millisecond according to the exposure time of the camera at the same time the light emits the system triggers shutter of the camera in this implementation we develop developed two different types types of algorithm to the culture of Russia right first mode is sequence of rasterized switching mode in this mode the system turns on single frustrate of rain by turning on one only one frustrate rain the system can detect multiple flashlights separately if they are overlapping the other part is of this method is simple and easy-to-implement for higher framerate camera but the disadvantage is the scanning light of each frustrate is divided by the number of active frustrates next mode is distance based flashlight separation mode in this mode the system timers will frustrate simultaneously if the distance between writes about I will show in this figure the distance is longer than the radius value r1 plus r2 the system want to frustrate similar simultaneously and separate separate them by image processing in this image processing the system binaries input image with pre captured but along with luminous threshold on separate each right spot by rating process like this in this prototype implementation the IR camera can capture VGA resolution image at 505 150 frames per second in external SATA mode the time of capturing single frame is about seven milliseconds in this blue type configuration the system's about six rostral simultaneously up to 25 Hertz for its rush right supported right image image of interest rate is as a into the data of a fragment shader the synthesize multiple image and calculate the final color of the projection image amulet system senses are three different types of image in front of us in in fragment shader of GPU first image is about granola with RGB texture that is displayed on non light illuminated surface second image is mode multiple earths we take shots for over information for each for asteroids that are displayed on light illuminated area so texture is a light photon image captured by the IR camera that is as a brain factor of each overlay images in case of blending to image image with single flats right each pixel color of front and back texture branded linearly by the luminance body of IR image when synthesizing multiple image with multiple first rights finally pixel color are calculated according to the luminance balance of its rasterized image in order to display another image on overlapped area between two flashlights the system creates overlapped area pattern from two separated Frossard images the over abrupt area is used as a new flashlight image in this case in this light light see it is in synthesized specific image next I'll explain prototype application using Emily alright first application is over information viewer using crush lights is a scan over a additional information on the projected image like mask length second application is multi-layered information bureau users can browse most layered contents by cross lights in these applications its flashlights have different information and the other the user can change the layer or the filter by changing the flashlight light users also blend multiple information by overlapping most beautifulest right spots we also developed multiplayer entertainment application for ads projection mapping environment in this system the system composed of two sets of projector camera system and last three dimensional projection target first game is a mystery finding game using frustrate overlapping the previous try to find secret number secret number of to open treasure box by using multiple flashlights the last hint is displayed only in the play develop the flashlights each other second game is a multiplayer 2d action game using special game controller with embedded plus right in this game game object except where characters are displayed only when the players email illuminates them with a flashlight the players explore the cave while being helped by the surrounding support players that hub support rasterize devices we exhibited this game for three days last week for children without explanation the players realize that thus they could open up flashlights and this display hidden information discussion first I'm going to discuss the limitation with image processing capturing light spot photon flashlight is very important at naturally for a strike pattern to the overall image however if multiple flashes consent in one console it concentrated in one place the camera image of overlapped area is easily fight out because the dynamic range of the camera is narrower than the human eye in order to address this problem the system should capture lots with flashlights image with different exposure settings and mix image with extent dynamic the extent direct link next is about image over a method in overlapped area in this prototype the system blended multiple philostrate image in pixel unit the system also can determine hierarchical relationship during rush lights to blend multiple flash effect information answer in another way classic features such as sights while a total luminance value of each rushlight can be used to determine which layer is the upper area next I'm going to discuss the huge number of images for us right in the current system only one information is allocated to one flash right in this configuration if the user I want to change over information the user only has to change jobs right however if the number of overlay who mention increases the number of officers also increases for multiple information on single asteroid situation we will have to combine with extra input methods on the flash drive devices we also want to browse many layered information such as time-lapse imagery or amaur amaur data is system in order to avoid this type of contents with multiple reserve deposits we have to consider earlier this selection method in addition in order to Bloods really volumetric data also need to need 3d cutting free intervention was 3d pollution pose data estimation from cluster devices we redirected investigate these methods and implement in the future this is summary slide thank you very much for kind attention any questions if you have any questions will come up to the microphone and pick up your name and affiliation so let me start the question so you you explained about the the distance between two flash lights portions to determine the separation of the timings but so what happens how to calculate in the for example in this case the surface is not planar well it's planar but it has you know it is three-dimensional shape then how to calculate the distance so in this process the system calculate image binarization and the leveling process of each right spot and calculate the centroid of the area and size of the area and so and the data is sent to the rendering system in this implementers unity and all this data is is rendering yes but it's a four but on the camera image brain on the camera image brain the distance is defined on the camera image but if the surface is non planar surface then probably the distance between non-atomic brain is sometimes not working for for for for such cases or yes so we have to consider the real distance in the earth space so it's hey this is my future work yes thank you the questions so how many fresh rats can use in practice in in particular in this in the current system six right sound simultaneously and overlap each other and the fluid is 25 frames per second it's the maximum number we flashlight is depending on the plate clem later on the camera so in this implementation we use the camera this leader is on the frame rate so that's maximal right is six okay if no questions then thank you very much
