 hi folks done riff here and today I'm going to talk to you about air versus sea shipping for doing Amazon FBA and more specifically I'm going to talk to you about all the costs involved and give you an idea of when it makes sense to use one versus the other okay let's get right into so if you've made it to this video you're probably already familiar with other than FBA and what it involves but if you're not I'll give you a quick refresher so amazon amazon FBA is a system by which you can sell products on amazon and have them handle all of the distribution to customers the customer support and customer returns now when you're selling the product - and you will have to source that product from a supplier often sellers arms and will source their products from suppliers in China and therefore we need a way to get our stock from China to the destination country where were selling be that the UK the US Australia wherever it might be now until Elon Musk build some sort of interplanetary Hyperloop we essentially have two options of getting our stock from China to its destination one being air and one being sea now the main advantage with air is that it is much faster it generally takes around a month less to get from its source to its destination the main advantage with sea on the flipside is that it's generally a lot cheaper so let's jump into an example in order for you to work out which is best there are three numbers you need to know so the first number you need to know is the size of your product that is the length the width and the depth the second number you need to know the weight of your product and the third number you need to know is how many units of your product you're looking to shift in one shipment for our example let's assume that our product is 30 centimeters by 20 centimeters by 20 centimeters that it has a weight of 0.5 kilograms and that our order size is 100 units let's take a look at air first now the first thing you need to understand about air shipping is that the amount of money you'll pay to ship is based on the weight of your order and you can generally expect to pay around $8 per kilogram in order to get your products from the source to the destination in our example we have 100 units at 0.5 kilograms each giving us a total order weight of 50 kilograms if we multiply that by our $8 per kilogram then we come to a value of $400 for the total order but wait it expressed companies are clever and they realize that if you're shipping lots of light but very bulky items you're gonna be taking up a lot of space in their planes and so what they will do is they will instead calculate what is called the volumetric weight of your products and they will charge you based on that instead how does that work well what they'll do is they'll take the length the width and the depth of your item in centimeters multiply those together and divide by 5,000 and the result of that will give you the volumetric weight of your product so in our case 30 centimeters times 20 times 20 divided by 5,000 gives us a volumetric weight of 1.2 kilograms now given that our order is a hundred units we multiply 100 by 1.2 to give us a total order weight of 120 kilograms if we then multiply 120 by $8 per kilogram then we end up with a total order cost of 960 dollars it's a big difference right this is why when you do research on Amazon FBA online you'll often find people talk about your only path to success being small and light items well what they're ignoring is the other side of the coin which is C Freight the fundamental difference with C free is that the way of your item doesn't matter at all the cost of shipping simply comes down to size or volume of your product you'll hear people talk about CBM and this essentially means cubic meters and it's a way of expressing your products volume so in our case in our example our product is 30 centimeters by 20 centimeters by 20 centimeters so first of all we need to express the width height and depth in meters and we do that by dividing each by 100 this gives us 0.3 by 0.2 by 0.2 if we then multiply all those together we end up with a very small number zero point zero zero six cubic meters and that is the volume of one unit of our product in our example we have a total order size of 100 units and therefore we can find out the total cubic mere sight of our ordered bye playing 0.006 by 100 to give us zero point six cubic meters total now in my business I utilize a service called a superhero Freight today my C shipping and they offer a very low cubic meter rate of one hundred and thirty six dollars so in order to work out what that means for our example we know we have zero point six cubic meters of stock we know the cubic meter rate so we can multiply those together so it's zero point six times one hundred and thirty six dollars and that gives us eighty one dollars and sixty cents clearly this is much much lower we do have to bear in mind there are some additional costs when it comes to sea shipping first of all when your goods are manufactured from the factory you need to make sure that you agree with the factory F will be terms this means free on board our freight on board and essentially what this means is that it is the suppliers responsibility to ensure the safety and integrity of the goods from when they're manufactured at the factory all the way to arrival at the port generally speaking suppliers will pass this charge on to you and generally it'll be a flat fee of a few hundred dollars for the sake of our example we'll call it two hundred dollars there are also two charges that you'll have to pay when your goods arrive at the destination poor first of those is a terminal fee which is charged per container and that is a fixed cost of 150 dollars the second charge that you have to be aware of are import duties this is charged to you as a percentage of the cost of the goods and the shipping combined the actual percentage varies depending on type of product you're importing there are websites where you can go and look up exactly what the rate would be but on average it is around 5% so we'll use that in our example if you're bringing goods into a country in the European Union you will also be liable to pay v80 as it comes into the country however because you actually pass that cost on to your customer when you sell the product it cancels itself out and so for the sake of simplicity I'm gonna ignore it in our example if we assume that our cost per unit from the manufacturer is $5 then the total cost of the items themselves are is 100 times five dollars is five hundred dollars natural shipping cubic meter space in the container as we discussed earlier it's eighty one dollars and sixty cents we're assuming that the supplier is going to charge as an additional fee of $200 to give us F will be terms on those Goods and then we're going to be charged a duty rate of five percent when we bring those goods in into the destination country along with a terminal fee of one hundred and fifty dollars when we put all that together what we end up with is a total cost of shipping of four hundred and seventy eight dollars and 18 cents which is almost exactly half what we calculate for air shipping so which is better the answer is neither technically but really see as a general rule of thumb air shipping is great for small orders of around 70 kilograms or less if you want to trial a new product maybe you want to bring in a small amount and test your market it's a good option however once you're up and running and you're scaling your business up see really is okay if you're organized about when and how much you order and order your products the additional profits that you're able to get by doing sea shipping far away that small speed benefit that you get from air the other beautiful thing about sea shipping is that you get economies of scale so the terminal fee we discussed earlier of a hundred and fifty dollars is a parent container not their product so if instead of shipping one product you're shipping three in same container your cost per product is going to be one hundred fifty dollars divided by three or $50 per product and obviously the more you have the lower that cost gets also the more space you buy in containers that bear the price you get at the time we're recording with marketplace super-heroes if you buy the biggest amount of cubic meters that they offer at this time then the rate per cubic meter drops from one hundred and thirty six dollars that we saw earlier time to only $80 per cubic meter so as you begin to ship more and more you can buy more and more space and the cost per cubic meter just drops and drops and it drops what I do want to highlight is all of what I've shown you really only applies if you use marketplace superheroes superhero freight service if you don't use it what you'll end up using is a traditional freight forwarder and there are really two big problems with that number one freight forwarders don't really care about you that might sound really harsh but given that a standard 40 food shipping container has 56 cubic meters of space in it even if you're shifting a few cubic meters at a time you're a very small fish in make a pond and for that reason you're likely to get poor race on in your space and also if there's any problems with your shipment you're likely to get a poor level of customer service to go along with it the second problem is the number of hidden costs and charges that you're likely to face while on the face of it you might get what looks like a reasonable quote from your fake freight forwarder when the goods arrive at their destination port for example they'll end up slapping on lots of fees that you didn't and frankly couldn't have anticipated handling fees transport fees whatever I've heard so many horror stories about this that I'd really have to highlight was to you that's why I can't recommend enough that if you are either interested in starting and I was an FBA business or you already have one but you want to utilize this service to increase your profit margins that you check out the link to market lists of reviews in the description below they are the company that I partnered with starting my Amazon business and they're not just one of those online courses where they throw up

they've also got a bunch of extra learning material it's on things like pay-per-click advertising which helps you really boost the sales of the products that you watch I can honestly say that if I hadn't partnered with marketplace superheroes and star in my business I just simply would not have the knowledge the skills and the mindset to get to a place where I own and run my own business so I
