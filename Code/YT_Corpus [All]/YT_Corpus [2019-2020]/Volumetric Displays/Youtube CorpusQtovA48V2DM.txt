 my name is Thomas Howard I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the CNRS and would like to talk to you about our novel solution for increasing the workspace of ultrasound made our haptic interfaces these interfaces are tactile feedback devices that use an array of ultrasonic transducers to focus acoustic energy towards small regions of their workspace producing localized by protecta stimuli when these encounter our user skin I rapidly moving these focal points is possible to render vibrotactile shapes and 3d allowing users to feel virtual objects because of their design these arrays can only generate perceptible focal points within an elongated spheroidal region above the array plane basically they feature a reasonably large vertical workspace but quickly reach their limits in the lateral dimensions this is often constraining in virtual reality especially when users move around there are two approaches for enlarging narae's workspace the first entails increasing your a size are using multiple arrays however larger multiple arrays increased the complexity of the driving electronics the power draw and have a large footprint and cost the second approach is to make arrays mobile to maintain the best possible fit between the arrays works based on a user's hand there are two prior examples of the second solution sannen colleagues mounted a smaller array onto VR headset and Bryson colleagues used a Baxter robot to translate an array effectively increasing its lateral work space however wearable arrays are obtrusive and limited by the direction under stimuli can be literate relative to the user while robotic manipulators introduced a significant added footprint and cost to the system we followed the second approach aiming to provide the largest possible increase in work space without these limitations to descend we designed the puma a pan and tilt mount for focused ultrasound arrays which is easily adaptable to various array designs the device is an aluminum and 3d printed bracket holding a support plate for the array and driven by a pair of servo motors allowing respectively 215 degrees of tilt rotation and 180 degrees of pan rotation once we calibrate the device position with respect to the virtual environment the puma rotates the array two oriented towards attract users handler interaction region providing tactile feedback for virtual objects we ran a user study to compare usable workspaces between a static array and the puma users touch visual targets appearing throughout the virtual environment of their hand and the array would attempt to generate the tactile stimulus at the target location we then asked users to report whether they felt a tactile stimulus and if so whether it felt we were strong sampling the workspace like this gave us an estimate of the volumes of in which stimuli were perceptible at different intensity levels results showed that Puma could deliver perceptible stimuli in a volume up to 76 times larger than the static arrays work space despite inter subject variability and tactile perception the workspace room in which all users systematically detected stimuli still increased more than 14 fold furthermore repositioning the array plane parallel to the hand increased to perceive stimulus intensities compared to those delivered at the same locations by a static array in conclusion Puma is a simple versatile and low-cost device allowing massive gains and usable workspace for focused ultrasound arrays increasing their suitability for vr interaction as a final note if you are interested in using or replicating our work the Puma hardware designs and software tools on our open source and accessible on our gate lab thanks for watching
