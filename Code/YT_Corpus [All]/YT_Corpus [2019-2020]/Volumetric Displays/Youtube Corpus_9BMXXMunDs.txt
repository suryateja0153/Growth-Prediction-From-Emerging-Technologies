 [TIM]: So, I want to thank everybody for coming, and we're talking about the Creaform new and improved. What's new, what they've been coming out with, what's changed, what updates might be out there. So, some of the new stuff that they came out with, if you recall, if you people are familiar with any of the Creaform product line, here's kind of the old lineup where we had the, you know, the top-level, portable 3D scanners and some other ancillary equipment to help doing more specific tasks or bigger tasks. So, one of the main things that have been changed is the Go!SCAN and the HandySCAN have been phased out for the new versions of the Go!SCAN and HandySCAN. So, now, instead of the Go!SCAN 20 and 50, we have the Go!SCAN Spark. And for the HandySCAN, we have the HandySCAN Black line. And these are, you know, a bit different. Bit different ergonomics, more powerful technology in them. The Go!SCAN specifically has changed a lot to have different functionality, overall better performance. And the HandySCAN has just had a lot of increases to the hardware, which resulted in higher accuracy and resolution. So, let's go ahead and take a closer look at the Go!SCAN Spark first. Here's a little video that'll kind of give us a good overview of how it works. The old Go!SCAN worked by taking out what basically looked like a QR-code pattern onto the surface, and the Go!SCAN Spark uses 99 white-light stripes. All right. So, that's a quick intro to the Go!SCAN Spark. Compared to the old Go!SCAN, the accuracy is up dramatically, the measurement resolution is the equivalent to the Go!SCAN 20, which has a higher resolution version, but with a much larger scan area, and also a tighter volumetric accuracy. It's a really nice scanner. And as you saw in there when they were scanning that whole car chassis, it was picking it up like live data. The video wasn't sped up. Really quick, just picking up the surfaces as they're going over it, because it's getting 1.5 million measurements a second. On your 15-by-15-inch scan area, I mean. Now, when you're going across, for that car chassis, when it has enough unique geometry in it, with the Go!SCAN, it's actually able to track geometry and texture data along with tracking targets as needed, and it can do that kind of hybrid-level too. So, as you're scanning something and maybe you don't have any tracking targets on, and get to a spot that might be too blank, and it can't see any geometry because it's just a big, flat area, you can throw your tracking targets in there and then use both at the same time and be able to scan big stuff really easily. And it's just a very easy system to use. It's got buttons on the back of it that make it easy to change any displays you need, wrist straps to make it easy to hold, going around, you can see it's got five cameras on the front doing all different things from building the STL and triangulating the deformation of the surface to capturing teller data if you need it can always turn that off as an option to you know have as much processing time you have to deal with and it's a really fast and easy as you your skin in real time is going to be doing your mesh visualization building right up on the screen as you scan over it and when you're done scanning you can finalize your scan get your finished part but you can see as you're scanning what sections you might need to go back on and check more remaining four and yeah compared to the old scan is a three times higher resolution cameras the color camera is higher deep more dense dpi than the old ones and improve scan surface quality so you'll have less you know bumpy surfaces and other issues you might run into but it makes scanning stuff like you know the helmet or cars or anything surfaces really easily without how to cover them with targets and a fairly good accuracy to now if you need higher accuracy the next level scanner we have for the new handy scan line is the handyscan black and black delete are the main ones there's also the 307 307 is kind of similar to the folder line house the red laser lines from the new black line those scans actually has blue laser line to delay them instead of red ones and with those it's able to forget higher resolution and accuracy and deal with any hard to see colors because with these optical scanners right it's trying to lay down information on the surface to be able to see it and if it's you know too reflective or too shiny or to absorbent it can't see the laser line I'm just going to have issues picking it up but with the new black and black elite you can do extremely shiny and hard to our scan surfaces without having to do any pre coating or anything on them so in the next video we'll see it means scan chrome wheels and stuff without having to do any powder coating on it to knock down shine much okay alright now we go yeah Oh so that's the handycam black in the black elite and this has extremely high accuracy and resolution and volumetric accuracy and this is where they start considering the machine to really be a patrol degrade 3d scanner so people use this a lot for inspection first article inspection and process inspection and you can get extremely high accuracy results extremely quickly because as we're scanning your parts and we're picking up you know 1.3 million measurements per second over the surface you can see enlarged surfaces very accurately and get full surface data not just individual little points from probing with the CMM get fold sections and surface analysis apart so with that we have our blue laser lines and it's a little bit of a trade off from this from the ghost hands spark depending what you need it for so if you need that accuracy you go up to the handycam black but for scanning really large stuff it can do it it doesn't have any limitations like any other other scans out there might have work we can scan any size part the thing with the handyscan black is that you have to use tracking targets when you're scanning your part and you kind of see them on that picture and the middle you see those little dots around in the surface so it actually have to use those dots to triangulate its position so it's not grabbing a full area that in a scanner it's actually just only seeing where the scan lines are laying over so it can't track geometry to figure out where it is on its own so you have to put these targets on so if you are seeing something really big like a car chassis then you have to put dots around the whole thing but you get these extremely high accurate measurements that you can do all your control just analysis on but I think your accuracy is on isn't super high for white needs do then the ghost can spark to be a much better fit and save you time for having to dot up your part at all the times what you need to do with it and with the metrology grade all the scanners come with their own calibration plates that you can verify that your calibrations are good go up the data have been knocked out of alignment they meet the no ISO accredited and VDI standards you can actually get these sent in every year to get recertified you can keep everything current and up-to-date and the actual recalibrating of so if you're using this daily you can just run it on that example that calibration play with that scan in there and it literally takes 30 seconds to verify that all your measurements are good to go then you can jump back in start scanning without any downtime or in between worries of how long these are going to take or if things are still certified or not so it takes a lot of ease off and then with the versatility with these Adu lasers so if you scan yet chrome rims and stuff without having to do any post treatment on the part and then with that you have unlimited volume to where you can scan an entire you know Boeing airplane wing the only real limit is the computer's RAM for being able to deal with that and if that does become something like you're scanning an entire bus it's very easy workarounds where you can scan the you know a big chunk of it and then just save that out to STL file so you get rid of the heavyweight Ram intensive part of the scan data and then scan the next section and scan in sections and virgil's is together later to do your inspection alysus or reverse engineering with it so those are the two new scanners and the other thing that career form came out with recently it was an updated version of their VX element software as the software runs in the back end that really controlled the scanners for dealing with creating the live meshes doing the reverse engineering creating your inspection templates and everything all that is done directly with preforms proprietary VX element software that were specifically designed to work with all the scanners their in-house software and they've done a couple really nifty improvements on it that makes scanning a lot easier and doing any post-processing and stuff a lot easier - one of the cool things that so the scanners used to have you know they still have a vise on the back scanners to tell what you know just looking at the scanner how far away you are from the park because you have a depth of field when you're scanning apart so if you're too close you know like a camera get too blurry or too far away from get too blurry there's kind of a sweet standoff distance so a new thing now is on top of having the scanner show you if you're too far too close on the software itself it'll show you so on the scan lines from this from the man you scan black being projected onto it it'll show you green blue or red on the lines for if they're too far too closer in the good distance away so just really easy visual feedback looking at and say okay yeah my scan lines over the area I'm specifically trying to get if you're not trying to get the entire surface is in the Green Zone without having to you know do any estimating on it another new feature they added is the new and improved clipping planes so they're easier is set up easier to access and you know lets you scan things more efficiently so if you're trying to get a very high-resolution scan of a small part if you don't have a clipping plane set up as you're scanning that small part game you know getting a lot of data of you know the surface and the table or whatever that it's sitting on and that can make it a little you know count blog down system slow dances it's just more extraneous data you're picking up direction care about so what you can do is you can set up a clipping plane really easily and or from a background area and it won't pick up any data under that clipping point so you should have the cooking plane right under your part you can scan your small part now first and like your mouse for your beer buy sandals day and not worry about picking up a bunch of extraneous data from the table sitting on and just makes processing and dealing with your files much easier and quicker and keeps and lower lower weight another cool thing on top of that is a clipping reference so you can actually use a mesh file a CAD or scan has an entire clipping reference so you kind of sent like a range that's going to clip away from it so when you have something that might have reference geometry on it or a cast where you don't care about things you haven't shaped cut off of it yet you can have that as you're clipping geometry and not worry about the extraneous pieces maybe you haven't gotten around to post-processing off of it yet interfering with your actual analysis another one is being able to a very easily deal with noise reduction so when you're scanning something at a high resolution where you're having you very tiny meshes you can get this little rough looking surface like that picture on the left where it looks bumpy even though it could be a smooth surface and that's just in the variation of the you know measurement accuracy up or down but you can turn on those your doctrine settings just from a quick drop down none medium or high and then so there's a difference from that same part in none versus high just move things out makes things nicer crisper looking even when you're doing little tiny things like embossed writing on injection molded parts they also have a guided workflow so when you first get the scanner or just useful to have as you're using it so everybody uses it because they're very easy to deal with user friendly scanners you don't need a whole lot of trained actually pick up start scanning something the workflow actually guides you through the whole process okay run through the calibration so the configuration so you're you know the theme and power for your lasers orb is strong enough they get a good reading or what you want and it's not too strong or too weak scan your part and then go through the final options kinds of stuff walk you through step by step as you're running through your scan so it makes a life a lot easier for working on all the scanners and kept great for novice users if you just pick me up for the first couple months using the scanner and you're like oh or we only use it you know every couple months because you're not scanning things constantly there's a great way to not get lost and be like oh where do I start again how do I do that it's just walk you through the step-by-step there's even another guided workflow for the handyscan of black where you can do small parts where will actually guide you through the process of scanning one side of it if you flip your part over you scan the next the backside of it and then you can merge those two scans together into one parts you can get both sides of your small part that you would be difficult to mount up in the air so you can scan around in one go and that something can be a little trickier so it's nice that there's also guide workflows for that and walk you through it's happening and they also have scanning templates now in the software makes it very easy to set up clipping planes positioning targets any of the things if you have something in this picture here were a reusable jig that has targets already on the jig not specifically on the part so the targets are going in the same point every time you're clipping point reference planes will be in the same point if using the same scan parameters you can save all that into a scanning template so every time you're going to scan another on these parts you just open up that template and you can jump right in scan the whole thing in a couple minutes and you're done and then it'll kick on expect inspection report in a couple seconds and you have the entire part inspected but I'll have to fiddle around with the setting up any of these things they'd have to set up every time you just stay all the software but yes don't want to waste too much of your time so that is a quick overview of what's new with crea forms and the scanners to the software anybody wants a comment see em we're always happy to us that that kind of stuff up also you can find more information on our website cata dot-com check out our blogs to see some applications from our technical resources also check out our events page to see the scanners live we do have a what's new with 3d scanning workshop going on in Buffalo Grove Illinois and Ohio Cincinnati along with various other events throughout the country where you could guys you guys can actually see these live and maybe get some hands-on experience alright Tim looks like there's a few questions coming in here so one question was how does it do with the threading and black surfaces yeah so with black surfaces it actually says really good nowadays depending on the level of scans so that higher you move up in scanners so spark to the handyscan to the metrascan it just does better and better at them so pretty much the Handy skin shiny black surfaces like the hardest for optical scanners to deal with in general um but this the handyscan it's actually does a really great job maps can shiny fiberglass parts before without having to coat them or spray them or anything and that's always an option if you do get something that slice you know has a mirror finish on it you can always hit it with uh you know some sort of temporary spray you can just wipe off really easily to knock down the shine as far as threads go it just depends on the you know how flying there if you're talking big threads for giant stuff real easily finer threads you're going to start running some issues on when they start getting to fine detail for talking like you know machine twenty and stuff like that generally you know once you get your threads data your milling it in the scan will be able to grab the cylinder size and everything from really easy and then you can always apply the threatening for reverse engineering or something the CAD program perfect perfect alright that's it for today's webinar I appreciate your time Tim Cronin again check out our local resources for further information thank you guys
