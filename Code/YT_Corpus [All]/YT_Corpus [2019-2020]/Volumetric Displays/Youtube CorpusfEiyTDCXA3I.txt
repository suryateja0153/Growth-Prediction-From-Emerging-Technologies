 During the mix design process, it is important to optimize both quality and costs, but it is difficult to compare mix design trials when they're stored in multiple Excel files or stored separately in a database. In this lightening demo, I'll show you how LASTRADA makes trial comparison in optimization more efficient by storing every relevant measurement and calculated property in a single location. We are in the asphalt mix design module on the aggregate blend page. For this objective, we want to bring our fine aggregate angularity up and we want to bring our LA abrasion number down. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna create a new aggregate tri-blend and give it a new name, since this is replicate and we want to improve those numbers. We're going to delete some of our aggregates using the Delete icon and we will add aggregates back using the add a gradient icon. We want to normalize our combined gradation against the other aggregate combined gradations. So we do so by selecting the edit blend. I'm going to tell LASTRADA to optimize to our targets. So now that we're as close to the combined gradation targets as we can get. We will push this update to the upper grid by selecting the green checkmark. Now that we have a new aggregate blend that's projected to be above our minimum fine aggregate angularity with the much improved Los Angeles abrasion we can pull samples and test and enter our data here to do comparison against the projected analysis. Also, we can move to the trial mix design page and we can look at each aggregate trial blend and their associated volumetric data.
