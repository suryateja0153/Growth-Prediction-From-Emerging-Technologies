 okay let's spend a little bit of time talking about post-processing so modern CT scanners have a lot of opportunities to manipulate the raw data and the image data right that means that there's a lot of ways that we can play with the material that we're getting if we're if we're working with the raw data then what the term that we use for that is reconstruction right and I think about this like the civil war Civil War was a raw time right and then after the Civil where you have reconstruction so reconstruction is raw data and we're manipulating to create pixels that are then used to create an image so we don't really have a lot of user-defined ways that we can actually do reconstruction we can tell the computer what reconstruction algorithms to apply to the raw data okay to display an image but we can't do the level of control that we have when we do what they're calling Reformation or reformatting okay reformatting is when we take the image data so we've reconstructed the the raw data we've created image data reformatting is when we take that image data and we use it to produce more images in different planes like a sagittal or coronal reformat or even 3d reformatting volume rendering stuff like that okay so retrospective reconstruction a retro recon is what we'll call this sometimes so even though there's a whole lot of parameters that can be changed the images that result are always in the same plane they're always like if we acquired them axially they're always going to be axial we cannot retrospectively reconstruct into a coronal plane we would need to do a retrospective reconstruction and then we could do that reformat so it's always going to be in the same plane in the same orientation as the original images as the original data set as the raw data but parameters that be changed retrospectively are the display field of view so we can make the display field of view bigger or smaller if we wanted we can change the image center so we get it we could say we were trying to do images of a shoulder or say there's image there's something going on in the shoulder and we need a little bit more in detail we can change the image center and the display field of view to shrink it down and just get really nice high-resolution images of that shoulder okay we can also change the reconstruction algorithm that's like the way that the basically the display information the window level in the information that this reconstruction algorithm is selecting for so we can for instance we can do like a lung reconstruction or we can do a soft tissue reconstruction or a bone reconstruction we can also change the slice increment this is only on with helical helical data because the helical data is a volumetric it's a volume of data and so once we have that volume of data we can change the slice increments so say the CT scan was actually done at 2.5 millimeters we could change that 2.6 25 millimetres we can make the slice thickness smaller through a retrospective reconstruction and then image thickness itself and this is only on the multi detection CT scanners does that make sense ok so sometimes if we're wanting to do 3d reformats we need to do reconstructions that are overlapping right and this is like page 82 on our in our textbook so it's only on a helical scan this isn't going to work on an on an axial scan that we can do this and it's often done to produce overlapping images that are then used for a multiplanar reformat so like a coronal or sagittal reformat or for 3d reformations okay so when a slice thickness is less than 5 millimeters for a display field of view is less than 35 millimeters a 50-percent overlap is common okay because we're already imaging for something small and so a lot of times this machine has already been told to do the overlap so it will just kind of be pre-programmed into the machine this isn't necessary if if the voxels are isotropic now we've not yet talked about isotropic voxels that's going to be in a different section but basically voxels are isotropic if the XY direction of the material is equal to the slice thickness right so we all kind of know from computer science a voxel or a pixel is this array of information right we kind of drew an array earlier when we were talking about scanning stuff scanning instrumentation I'm sorry and what this is saying is if the voxels are equal in these directions like the X Y Direction are they're equal to the slice thickness that was attained at the it is it's perfectly lined up already we don't need to do an overlap the information is matching ok so on them on multidetector CT system data from parallel roles rows of detectors can be combined in different ways to create thicker slices for viewing or storing right that's kind of saying a lot so let's unpack it just a little bit what it's saying is if we had a pitch of one right and we acquire this information in parallel we can combine that information in a way such that we can create a thicker slice and this is actually helpful to us particularly when we're if we're sending it to the radiologist right we don't want to send all these little thin cuts to the radiologist we can keep it in that thicker slice and allow that for viewing and if he then asks for he or she even asked for life and an mpr like a coronal or sagittal view or like a 3d view we could then reconstruct it from those thinner slices that we originally had it at so the goals for using a thinner slice of scanning and reconstruction for viewing is because it maintains a high resolution having acquired it in the thin slice is going to give a higher resolution for those thicker slices and then it can create image files that are more manageable so when we send that send it then to the thicker slice it's more manageable because believe me the radiologist is going to hate you if you send like two thousand images you know I mean where you could have sent five hundred you know any mean he has to he is required by law to look at every single image that we send him or her so that was reconstruction now let's talk about reformatting it's also called image rendering or just reformatting right when we reformat a CT study the images the source images all need to be identical right they need to be have been acquired at the same d display field of view they need to be of the same window algorithms everything needs to be identical about them so there needs to be the same display field of view again the same image center that's is really critical we can't start moving the image center around in the middle of the scan and expect it to be able to do an accurate reform out of that the gantry tilt has to be identical and I don't think y'all do gantry tilts at all yeah yeah I don't think your gantry can tell so that doesn't necessarily apply to pet the pet/ct fusion but it does apply to diagnostic CT and most importantly there needs to be no gaps otherwise we're going to get artifacts from those gaps ok so the image data is going to be used not the raw data so we have to reconstruct image data and then we can change that image data into different kinds of images image data and it's going to generate images in a different plane or a different orientation right and this is really really helpful to to better display different kinds of relationships between structures one really great example is if we're looking to rule out appendicitis it can be very difficult to image the entire appendix on an axial plane but if we reformat for coronal or maybe even reformat for a sagittal image we can probably appreciate the entire appendix on a single image ok so these reformatted images can be either two-dimensional or three-dimensional and in general the thinner the original slice was like the thinner the raw data was the better the reformatted image is going to be it's going to have a better spatial resolution so let's talk about some different kinds of reformatting one of the most common ones that we do is an NPR multiplanar reform reformatting so they are still two dimensional in nature right but they're going to display the original CT attenuation values so we can do a Hounsfield unit measurement off of these images we can place an ROI on there and say the liver has 42 pounds field units in it we can't necessarily do that off of like a 3d image these are going to be images at different planes so say that information most of our information is acquired axially right or transaxial slices through this this area of the body in this direction right here right but we could then take the information and reformat it for coronal slices right and then still be able to measure Hounsfield units off of that that's an mpr multiplanar reformat here's some examples of multiplanar reformats we have a transverse one coronal sagittal or we can even do OH black planes like looking at this this is acquired at a no black plane we can actually see that because of the way the lungs on one side over here are lower than over here so we're at an angle to the anatomy but it's allowing us to very clearly appreciate the entire arch of the aorta okay we can also do curved planar reformats these require quite a bit of input from the tech okay because what we're doing is we're taking that volumetric data set and then we're curving the way that it's reformatting to the curvature of the anatomy right so what this technologist has done is they've they have told they have gone through every single slice of this image and created way points along the carotid right now bear in mind this that structure moves both medial to lateral right and it also moves ant to post so it would be difficult to appreciate it on either a sagittal or coronal image we could not appreciate the entire structure but he has created a planar of a way of reformatting he or she has created a way of reformatting that allows us to track with that that structure so that we're going to call that a curved planar reformation it's a created along the center line of a tubular organ and we most often use it to look at arteries and veins occasionally we will use it to better appreciate like the thoracic spine because the thoracic spine has such a big curve to it okay 3d reformats these are going to seek to represent the entire volume of a scanned area with only one image so it's making a 3d image for example of the heart right the heart is an area that we're very interested in doing 3d pictures up so unlike the 2d images the 3d techniques are going to manipulate or combine CT values to display an image so the original CT value information is not included we can't measure Hounsfield units off these images it's not going to give us information about linear a linear attenuation because it's averaging all that material together okay and it uses a process that draws an imaginary line from the viewer through the data volume so it is creating an the illusion of three-dimensional space right that's all that means so displays within generated by manipulating data along that visual line a really good way to think about this is like a 3d shooter video game those are not really 3d information it's just been rendered in a way such that it appears 3d to the human eye okay there's a bunch of different ways that we can do 3d reformats there's surface rendering and we might also call these shaded surface displays so only the voxels on the surface of this structure are used this is for the most part been replaced by volumetric rendering okay volumetric rendering let me let me just say volumetric rendering is going to render the entire volume right so not just the surface of the volume but the entire volume so the an example would be say say we did surface reformatting of the bones in my wrist for example the surface reformatting is only going to allow for the surfaces of those bones so I would see all the external surfaces of those bones but they might interconnect in weird ways whereas if I volumetrically render them I can even though I'm not appreciating the entire volume the the volumes are going to be more discreet they're going to be more separate from each other just because of the way that the information is being used okay there's different ways that we can project the material the information to so a really another really really popular way that we do 3d free formats is with a myth now a myth is going to still be it's still going to appear to be a two-dimensional image but what we're doing is we're taking a selection of voxels through that area we're taking a selection of values through that area and then we're averaging them all together and we're taking the highest value we're taking the highest possible value that's why it means maximum intensity projection so the whites are going to really pop on these pictures right and we use them on angio studies to better appreciate again arteries and things like that it's going to minimize other things so we can also take the minimum value across of range so again this is going to be a two dimensional displayed image but it's it's rendering it through a three dimensional volume and it's selecting just the vault the voxels that have the lowest value to display okay volume rendering we kind of hinted at this earlier so we're going to get a 3d semi-transparent representation of the image structure like my wrist right and it has become a really popular 3d imaging technique it allows us display a whole bunch of different kinds of tissues in their relationship to each other so we can evaluate for instance not just my wrist but also the musculature and vasculature around my wrist so if there was a fractured bone that also had lacerated a blood vessel or torn a ligament we would be able to appreciate that on a 3d volume Reformation endoluminal imaging this is a form of virtual reality right and the number one place that we're doing this is in a CT virtual colonoscopy right we're also starting to do CT virtual bronchoscopy s and CT virtual Asafa grams things like that what we're doing is we're using the CT image and the data to reconstruct what is like a 3d fly-through of your colon right and to do that a lot of times we are going to use some kind of rectal contrast so we may use a combination of barium and air sometimes we just use co2 or air in hyper inflate the colon scan through it and then we are able to look inside the lumen of the structure right so we're not volumetrically rendering it we are creating a virtual reality space in which we can appreciate if there's a polyp there if there's an infection there all of that we can really clearly see on those images there's also what we would call region of interest editing and this would almost be like post post reformatting this would be a case in which say we did again a volume rendering of my wrist right but the doctor says I just want to see the bones there then what I can do as a technologist and this is um let me see what's there's this really clearly shown our book bear with me here it's page 89 in our book we can see where the technologist has traced over an area and they're going to subtract out on figure 8 10 they're going to subtract out the sponge that was used beside the head they've traced an area around the sponge and then they can tell the computer remove that remove that region of interest okay we can add regions of interest to like a really awesome way that we can do our CT a post-processing is we can find the carotid artery we can put an ROI on it and say grow and it's just going to grow that carotid artery out along the entire hounsfield range that we've told it to grow from so it's going to go both through space and through value through volume and make a nice pretty picture of the entire carotid artery the problem with it is that when it hits the bones at the base of the skull it's going to start growing those bones because they're about at the same Hounsfield units right so then we would have to then do region of interest editing to cut out the base of the skull okay and typically these are 3d software packages that require a whole lot of processing power so it's going to be a separate workstation because it would probably crash our scan computer if we did it but there will be a separate workstation will send the reformatted or reconstructed images over to that workstation and then we would do the our region of interest editing from there this is one of my favorite things about my job I love this stuff it's a lot of fun ok so let's talk a little bit about the factors that degrade reformatted images and that will be it for this slideshow this is going to be on page like 90 in our book and you all had questions earlier about different artifacts and stuff and we'll get more into artifacts later on but this is that this is a good beginning so segmentation errors we can see a segmentation error on the figure in page 90 where they've they've accidentally sliced off the what is it the chromeo clavicular the electron on right they've sliced off a portion of the scapula on the image so they've had to redirect that they've also sliced off the humerus on the image so that would be editing out and important segmentation errors are editing out important vessels or structures right image noise would be excessive noise diminishing the quality of a particular local okok this is particularly evident at low contrast resolution so image noise if we look at figure eight 12 we have the arch of the aorta but it's really noisy right so in all likelihood we didn't get adequate contrast inside of the aorta from our image set and now we've got a noisy reform at a noisy 3d reformat so the original data wasn't good and now it's affecting our 3d reformat other problems that are going to degrade our reformatted images are any kind of artifact motion and that could be breathing or the actual movement of the patient or like paralysis of the esophagus or the large bowel metal so probably our most common artifact so like the streak artifacts that we identified in some of our images earlier like from orthodontic implants or from surgical implants that's metal streaking artifact and then also a stair-step artifacts so if we look at figure 8-13 on page 91 these voss these voxels are not isotropic so going back to the very beginning of this lecture the voxels are not at equivalent size to the slice increment right so now we have this stair step where the computer has tried to average for the gaps but it has not been able to average completely correctly so again we would need to go back and reconstruct images that are either either overlapped or provide enough isotropic information between the voxels to where we won't don't get this stair step artifact okay that is it for this slideshow
