 [Music] volkswagen photonics is an adelaide based startup we started about 10 years ago and we're currently manufacturing the world's most advanced 3d volumetric display we've created a new type of 3d holographic display technology that you can look at from any direction without the need for special glasses and there's nothing else like it in the world we've been working with maddens for over a decade on securing our intellectual property our system is quite complex and so they've been able to easily and effectively uh help us understand which areas uh need to be protected and how to go about doing so the benefits of working with a team of partners in an independent firm is really about the the time it takes to communicate your your your ideas and get them understood by those people with our technology it's very complicated and not having to re-communicate complicated things to many people saves time and really focuses your efforts when when documenting your ideas
