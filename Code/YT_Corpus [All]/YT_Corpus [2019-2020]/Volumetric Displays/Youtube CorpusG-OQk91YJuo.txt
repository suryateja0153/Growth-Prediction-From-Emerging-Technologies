 [Music] let us start this lecture with a thought process by Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose was very legendary scientist during independence era he says the poet is intimate with truth while the scientist approaches it akwardly come someday to my laboratory and see the equi vocal testimony of the Cresco graph which he had designed to find out that the trees are having the life and they can sense it and that's why he was talking like how the poet is intimate with the truth and scientist approaches it accordingly let us recall what we learnt in the last lecture in the last lecture we initiated discussion on hybrid propellant rocket engine and we looked at historical evolution then we moved into the various components of the hybrid propellant rocket engine and then full grain configurations and then we looked at very briefly about the complex processes involved during the combustion of the solid the hybrid propellant combustion and in the process we derived a simple semi empirical relationship for regression rate and we'll be discussing little bit more about that let us consider that this is your cylindrical grain and in which you are having a problem and this is your side views which you are showing here and let's say this is your propellant through which this is your fuel grain and this is your oxidizer which will passing through that and this is basically raw oxidizer V oxidizer and keep in mind that we derived this thing and this we call it as a G oxidizer but if you look at G total oxidizer total of G is basically G of oxidizer beside this this well which will be regressing from here due to the burning of the fuel grain and this will be also coming to that and that I can call it as a G F F X that means this G is changing along with the length and if I consider this is your length of the soil grain it is changing along with that and this G if I can calculate that by considering this is for Rho F and zero to X and our X by D H and this is your hydraulic diameter and if I integrate I can get that thing that is d H is equal to basically for a by P and keep in mind that d H is your hydraulic diameter and this P is your perimeter this P is your perimeter and this is your cross-sectional area right cross-sectional area that means it is changing and let us look at the how does the regression rate vary in a circular port and this is your circular port and this is your fuel grain and as I discussed in the last lecture the expression for the regression rate is equal to Rho F r dot is equal to zero point zero three eight G power to the N and X by mu z MV power to zero T keep in mind that I had now exchanged that earlier it was M here and this n but it is basically coefficient which will be different and if I consider this n is the zero point seven five in this case and M is minus 0.15 and oxygen mass flow rate is seven point nine five kg per second density of the fuel is thousand km per meter cube and I am considering the blowing ratio is one okay so if I look at how this segregation rate is changing with that you can see that is basically regression rate is plotted along with X and to start to it of course it will be having you know point one second which is having a very large regression rate at the front end of this grain and then after that it decreases and of course as the time increases to twenty second this is again lower down but is having similar features so this is basically region or this region where the boundary layer effect will be more because the boundary layer in this case will be small this is your boundary layer and therefore the heat transfer to the fuel grain will be higher and so that you are getting higher regression rate but as it goes on it is remaining almost constant so you can say that the hybrid propellant provides almost a constant regulation rate at the downstream of the fuel port because from the X and this is starting from your at there direction you can say and the another interesting feature you can say that X this is your M is represent a boundary layer growth and that causes a decrease in heat flux which is balanced by the total mass flux due to foil addition because of this full addition there will be increase in the G but however the area of the cross section also is increasing so that has to be balanced so that you will get a steady combustion otherwise it will be in trouble so a higher cross section leads to a reduction in the local mass flux ending to the level of regression rate because the total mass flux will be changing because area is changing much faster rate as compared to the mass flux which is come passing into the port due to the burning of the solid fuel and hence it displays a self regulating features and less likely to cause explosion due to sudden feasor in the fuel grain during its operation if you recall that we had learnt earlier that if there is a feyza here let's say if there is a freezer over here right due to crack let us say crack or a freezer kind of thing then what will happen surface area area will increase and if the surface area will increase then naturally the regression rate will be the amount of mass flux which will be generated will be higher and then the pressure may go up but here what is happening because of area is increasing therefore the flux will be reduced locally and then you may not get that effect that is the beauty of the hybrid propellant rocket engine as it is less prone to the explosion as compared to the solid propellant combustion engine due to the sudden freezer or the crack on the solid fuel grain so let us look at the discuss about little bit about the regression rate we know that regression rate of the solid fuel grade depends on the type of well it's metal loading and fuel port size atomizer design and also the flow structure because the flow will be turbulent and also it will be sometimes creating some kind of a vertices also and fluid property variation boundary layer because temperature will be changing so also mass flow rate and then other things so therefore the property of the fluid will be also changing so that means it is quite complex as compared to your solid propellant combustion engine or the liquid problem so let us look at qualitatively the regression rate which is a plot in the log scale along the vertical direction and the mass flux along the horizontal direction generally we will get a relationship which is powered to G 0.8 that we had seen earlier and due to the geometry or the scale or the additive there will be increase in both the direction but this is due to the diffuse and flame combustion or the diffuse and combustion this is basically I can say that diffusion controlled combustion in other words that irrigation rate will be dependent on the diffusion and also there will be turbulent heat transfer as I told but if I extrapolate this thing to here with the decrease in the mass flux what I expect this will be like this however this mass flux is Rho lower therefore the convection will be lower in this case the radiation thermal radiation effect will be high and there might be of course the metal loading if the percentage of metal may also increase then the convection is lower and there is a pressure which will affecting the radiation pressure into diameter that controlled the regression rate and then with increase in the pressure or the into diameter that is one case or increase in the metal additives then what will happen the regression rate will be increasing because of fact that there will be optical radiations will be higher in with the increase in this therefore the regression rate will be I like if you look at this will be higher but when the the mass flux is reduced further then what will happen there will be melting of the surfaces will be there and then the HR is being formed and there will be subsurface decomposition that can occur due to penetration of the thermal wave leading to unstable combustion and this is threshold is known as the cooking limit because beyond that you can go up this is known as cooking or the melting limit and this can cause the chopping instability you might be knowing toughing is the low frequency and pressure oscillations which may be caused by the perpetual repeating mechanical removal of the soft layer because already the there is a char is being formed and this became very subjected to variation in that chars are the surfaces because all these are being melted out so therefore there will be pressure oscillation hence it must not be operated in this range and let us look at the other extreme case where there will be very high mass flux ratio in this in this region where the chemical kinetics will be playing a role and there will be if you look at Arrhenius equations that if the pressure is will be increasing then of course the flame surface will be coming near that and then it may be a little premature flame mode kind of things and then with increase in reaction rate will be little decrease so and then regression affected and the PC at certain PC the regression rate decreases as compared to the predicted value this is below where values will be coming and with further increase in G there will be flooding remedy beyond that which is not shown in this region this which can occur for the reactive of well and oxidizer system particularly when the lithium hydride or the fluorine is being used and this has to be flooding effect has to be avoided in case of hybrid propellant rocket engine so if you will look at the range in which it can operate well is basically that this turbulent heat transfer region but you can go little further by with the decrease in the mass flux ratio or the increase in but you should not go beyond certain limit of the cooking limit or the flooding limit has to be avoided for its operation so this is the important thing that you should keep in mind and let us look at types of port configuration one can think of for hybrid propellant rocket engine and of course the several design one can think of but I will be discussing about only few of them this is your cylindrical fuel grain which is having limitation as I told that it cannot be really use for a larger rocket engine with a high combustion efficiency and higher thrust therefore the multi port people use and if you look at that this is the double D which is having two ports then it will be also difficult to design because this surface will be moving in this direction so if you look at a regression rate will be going and then this also will be curved one and then the if and this also again will be curved and then may be regressing that now one has to design properly and it is having limitation similar to cylindrical port fuel grain and it can be used for the little your thirst level as compared to cylindrical but however it is having own limitations and there is another one which is having seven cylinder clusters of course people can go for different when these are the each one is cylindrical one and that has been compact into another casing this is known as casing and totally silly seven of them people have used this is is a very good one as compared to cylindrical and we'll see and we say this the four port wagon wheels and the wagon wheel is the most popular one among all this thing and which is being used if you look at this a four port and this having curved surface and to design this is not that easy but however if we increase the number of ports to more it became triangular shape and that you can see here and this is also being used but it is having limitation also the structural rigidity will be very low or the strength will be low as compared to the four pot wagon wheel and others and there is a double rows where this will be more having that and it is a little complex to design as compared to the wagon wheel and let us say look at this as a toll earlier this port will be having a fuel support wave which will be basically having certain propellant but it is a digression with much lower as compared to that so that it will be act giving a structural support this port not being broken down due to the low strength when it is regressing so it is having of course the combustion chamber structures and keep in mind that number of well ports depends on the thrust level and sifting oxidizer fuel ratio during one as I told you that oxidizer fuel ratio will be changing along the length and along with the time as well and it it depends on the number of well ports depends on the motor length and diameter and this also depends on the desire oxidizer mass velocity or the mass flux says that you can have a higher thrust level so therefore one has to be careful about this and let us look at how does this volumetric efficiency vary and also along with the L by D of the mass of the fuel because volumetric efficiency is very important parameter to adjust the efficacy of the fuel grain and the volumetric efficiency is defined as the ratio of the volume of solid well to that of the volume of the grain at a particular instant of time when it is there so volumetric efficiency is influenced by the number of pores wave thickness and oxidizer mass flux so let us compare this data of volumetric efficiency which is plotted in along with this and the mass well is in kg is plotted along with the horizontal axis and you can see that two cases we have consider one is single cylinder Calif well gain and the you can look at this volumetric efficiency very high when this mass of the fuel is very low it is something around touching around maybe something seventy-seven percentage but unfortunately it goes on decreasing with the mass of the fuel increases and keep in mind for that one has to increase the L by D ratio so it is become it is changing from 10.2 to the 26 when you are using 2,800 kg of well so there is a large change in the L by D ratio however there is also a large change in volumetric efficiency from 76 to the Iran may be 42 kind of or 43 person but whereas the seven cylinder clusters you can see that it is of course having a little lower value as compared to single silver particularly for the lower mass but it is changing it is lowering down but with very minimally as compared to the single cylinder full gain so it will summarize that a single cylinder port has a higher volumetric efficiency than that of the seven cylinder cluster port for fuel mass flow below the 700 kg if you look at this is the crossing point kind of things but if you want to go for a larger mass of the well that means the longer duration and also the lie at rest then naturally one go for the seventh cylinder cluster design and keep in mind that that volumetric efficiency must be greater than 50 percent for a reasonable design and who is the seventh cylinder cluster design is satisfying because it is all the time it is more than that so therefore seventh cylinder cluster design is being preferred let us consider an example to illustrate how we can utilize the burning rate relationship for hybrid propellant for designing a hybrid propellant rocket engine a hybrid propellant rocket engine is to be designed and to produce thrust of 1.5 mega Newton characteristics velocity of one seven four five meter per second and first coefficient of 1.7 using STP beef weld and liquid oxidizer with oxygen ratio of 6 with chamber pressure of 5 mega Pascal and temperature of 3000 Kelvin the fuel grain diameter is 0.25 meter with well grain length of 3 meter determine the diameter of single circular will port grain to meet the thirst requirement for blowing ratio of 15 and we can take combustion gas viscosity as 2 point 1 into 10 power 3 minus 5 Pascal second this is the basically circular cylindrical port and we know that fuel grain diameter is basically given as 0.25 meter and this is your fuel grain and we need to find out basically this circular pore diameter this is the D and it is already given this diameter that is given as D capital D this is and let us look at what are the things are given this given are basically thrust F is 1 point 5 mega Newton the characteristics velocity 1 7 4 5 meter per second thrust coefficient 1 point 7 and oxidizer well ratio is 6 and a chamber pressure that is 5 mega Pascal and temperature is 3000 Kelvin and the grain diameter that is 0.25 meter and length is given as 3 meter and viscosity is given as 2 point 1 into 10 power t minus 5 Pascal second and blowing ratio that is B is equal to 5 will have to basically to find out is d that is the diameter of the cylindrical pore and let us look at how we can find out first of all we'll have to find out basically the mass flow rate of the propellant that can be done provided we know the throat area so for that let us find out basically the throat area and throat area we can estimate s is equal to F divided by C F into PC and F is given that is one point five 10 power 6 newton and CF is one point seven into 5 into 10 power 2 6 so this is cancel it out and you will get basically zero point 1 7 6 4 meter square and we are interested to find out mass flow rate of propellant mass flow rate of propellant that is equal to m dot total that is P is equal to PC 80 divided by C star and PC we know and 80 also we know that is 5 into 10 power 6 that is your PC and 80 already we have found out 6 4 divided by C star C star is basically 1 7 4 5 meter per second and that happens to be 5 0 5 point 4 kg per second and we know that is the oxidizer and fuel ratio mass flow rate of oxidizer mass flow rate of well is equal to 6 that is equation two but we know that m p is equal to m dot o x plus m dot f equal to five zero five point four kg per second this is equation one and by solving this equation by solving equation one and two we can get m dot f is seventy two point two kg per second and m dot oxidizer is basically four three three point two kg per second and in order to get this diameter we need to also find out basically the mass flux rate because we will be using empirical relationship the AME empirical for ro r dot as equal to rho r dot 0.038 you can say this is basically G this is in a diameter of the port into 0.8 that is X by mu minus 0.2 into B 0.23 so for that we need to find out G so if you look at G basically we can find out as G is nothing but your that is your mass flux rate is nothing but your m dot P by AP that is v naught v 0.4 divided by AP this is PI R I square and this is your R I to R I this is so therefore you can get this is 160 point nine by RS square this is your equation three and this is your equation 4 and when you substitute these things here we can get basically by using equation three and four we can have a row this is your F so f r dot is equal to zero point zero three eight G is already we have expressed in terms of R I so I can get 160 point nine RI square and this RI square power to 0.8 and X is your 3 meter so therefore we will take 3 divided by 2 into 10 power 3 10 power 3 minus 5 minus 0.2 15 power to 0.23 so that we can get is 0.38 4 divided by our I 1 point 6 let us say that this is your equation 5 we know that mass flow rate that is m dot F is nothing but your 2 pi R I this is your total area into Rho F r dot and if I can put this here that is m dot F we already know that is your 72 point 2 is equal to 2 PI R I into 3 into 0.384 divided by r I power to the 1 point 6 so this is your equation 6 so by solving equation five and six we can get that our I is equal to twenty one point five millimeter so therefore the D will be 43mm so we can find out this is your port area so here we have learned how we can utilize the semi empirical relationship for designing the port area in case of a hybrid rocket propellant engine and with this we'll stop over here thank you very much [Music] [Music] [Music]
