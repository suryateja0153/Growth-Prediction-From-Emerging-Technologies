 one of the promises of additive manufacturing is products that will be tailored specifically to your body specifically to you as an individual we've got an example of that on this episode of the cool parts show [Music] [Applause] I'm Pete szalinski I'm Stephanie Hendrickson we are with additive manufacturing dot media and this is the cool parts show this is our series where we talk about cool parts 3d printed by viewers like you so Pete it's been a couple of episodes since we've seen apart from you what do you have today I've got a part I got a question first what do you know about mass customization mass customization I guess I think about that in in contrast to mass production so where you're manufacturing a lot of an identical product not necessarily because it's the best fit for all the consumers but probably because you made some investment in tooling and so you're kind of tied to that design right whereas what mass customization is all about is manufacturing a tailored product for each individual and when you get to a process like 3d printing where you're not limited by tooling that becomes possible yep so I've got an example of mass customization an example right here these are custom insoles made through additive manufacturing made for my special feet these were there are two companies involved in this a Trax is the footwear company AOS is the company that did the additive manufacturing and these insoles are based on tunne data taken from a scan of my feet okay so you asked about mass customization but can we just talk about insoles for a second so I actually have a pair of orthotics that I had made the conventional way like I went to the doctor's office had to put my feet in this box of foam waited like a month to go pick them up and the orthotics that I have they're they're solid they're kind of rigid all the way through they don't like anything like this so I have a couple of ideas already about how 3d printing might change this but I want to hear more about these and what you've learned from this process this is a means of supporting our feet in a way they haven't been supported before let me introduce you to evan schwartz president of Atrix each foot you know can have different lengths that different wear and most importantly has different arch types as well as varying pressure points our goal has always been to support the foot bring the ground up to the foot realign the body and most importantly offset pressure and redistribute pressure throughout the foot and of course then help with non body alignment but getting the body back into proper position because most people don't wear the proper footwear and actually don't often pay attention to their feet and because of these variables people can suffer from things like heel pain arch pain ball foot pain plantar fasciitis Achilles problems the list goes on and on for the different types of foot conditions that are common and exist what we're excited about here is launching a product that uses additive manufacturing to sort of revolutionize the way feet are treated and allows us to offset these pressure points and bring the ground up to the foot in a very specific way okay so bringing the ground up to your foot that's a really neat way of visualizing what an insult does so how do we go from the scan to these insoles in front of us right here right so the scan is a really important part of it it it uses what Atrix calls their Albert scanner which has like 500 gold-plated sensors and 18 cameras and 960 LEDs and receptors and I stepped into that and the result was more data than I thought would ever be attached to my feet ever and data about the dimensions of my feet and the shape but but more significantly data about the pressure map on the underside of my feet the pressure of how the ground is contacting my feet now all that data the pressure profile and the dimensions on my feet that goes to EOS that's converted into the special build file just for this part just for these special insoles iOS 3d print set I'll let EOS take it from there here here is a os's Fabien Kraus so we as the manufacturer we receive the pressure scan as well as a 3d file of the foot from Atrix and this information is then converted into the lattice file how do we do that we have a large library and a simulation tool behind it to convert a physical property which the consumer would like to have an is insole into a digital phone so the 3d printing process the additive manufacturing process is SLS selective laser sintering a laser moving through polymer in a powder form solidifies that polymer layer by layer builds the part that way the material is TPU a a responsive soft polymer and 3d printing is used to create this complex geometry in their term for that is digital foam so we think of foam and the springiness comes from the air that's mixed in with the material right but the foam properties here come from the geometry of each of these little 3d printed areas basically Atrix and AOS together invented many different types of spring geometries to get different kinds of responsiveness and all of these little 3d printed Springs were matched basically square by square by Square to this map of the pressure area of the underside of my foot to get this leveled out responsiveness and the insoles all the way through so this is this is not just tailored to the shape of my feet you get in tight here and you look at all these little spring geometries this is tailored to the forces that my feet want to see all right so you had your foot scanned yo s got the pressure data they took all those pressure points and converted them into these individual spring designs 3d printed these insoles sent them to you how long did this process take right so it was fast like the scan 30 seconds like it was so fast then it was about two weeks when I got the insoles and I bet it could have been faster than that I think I was just in their system and in their queue couple weeks I had them alright so I can't help but notice that is a much shorter leave time than my orthotic experience but we haven't talked about what it's like to wear these are they are they comfortable yeah so I have been wearing them spent a workday wearing them a lot of standing a lot of walking I'll tell you at first they feel weird they feel lumpy and a little wrong because my feet are being touched in places they haven't been touched before but then I get used to it fast and then there's this energy of walking right that phenomenon of the ground coming up to meet your feet yeah I think there's something to that it becomes freer and lighter to stand to walk like using your feet just has more energy to it so with these orthotics you're not only avoiding those health problems that Evan was talking about you're actually having a better experience while you're standing walking moving around we're just a track seola's headed yeah so actually well Bay tracks and EOS had thoughts about that let's hear from both of them we believe that 3d printed orthotics can change Footwear in almost every way when you're able to take data about someone's feet collect that data and then turn that into something that's very specific to them so imagine that we can print something to a millimeter so if you have a pressure point that's let's call it a centimeter or few millimeters we can actually offset that pressure by printing a specific structure or lattice under that that spot and so that allows us to custom-built not only orthotics but eventually Footwear that takes this data and then makes it specifically to you so next steps natural next steps in the evolution would be taking the concept of an insole and combine it with a midsole taking the concept of an insole and combine it with protective Orion environment taking the concept of an insole and apply it to other parts of the body for protectors for assistive devices when P devices helmets and polite so this is really a very important step in the evolution or the revolution of products that by digitizing foam and by digitizing foam successfully you can now apply it to really any application around the human body all right so these are custom 3d printed insoles made with a totally digital manufacturing process you had your feet scanned AOS receive that scan data they mapped all these different little spring designs onto the different pressure points in your foot 3d printed them and mailed them right to you like this is what mass customization with 3d printing kind of looks like yeah that's right so Atrix gos can produce tons of insoles but none of them have to be identical and all of them can be tailored to individuals all right so just one more thing before we go I've actually been pretty frustrated with my old orthotics so I had my feet skin too no way yeah I did so pretty soon I'm gonna have my own 3d printed insoles that are kind of like yours but made just for me yeah all right all right even more mass customization that'll do it for the cool parts show thank you for watching email us cool parts at additive manufacturing dot media tell us
