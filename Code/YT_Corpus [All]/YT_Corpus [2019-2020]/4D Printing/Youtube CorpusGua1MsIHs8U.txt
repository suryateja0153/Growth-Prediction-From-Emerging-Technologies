 Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Hi everyone. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Oh, I see people arriving and waving at me. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Hello. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Let's start. My name is Marsha and I'm in the Netherlands, this is my Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: craft room or office. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And depending on how you view it and it's Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: seven in the evening here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So it's a bit later than for you guys, or most of you guys I see Manchester. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I see Silver Spring. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I see Texas. I see Lancaster County. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So hi, everyone. I'm, I'm one of the Jedi arts brand ambassadors. So if you have been on their block or if you have a few videos on the YouTube channel, you have probably seen my hands. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Um, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Yeah. What can I say we're going to Jay Prince today. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I think I'm just going to start. So let's go over to my desk and then Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: We can see what I have there. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So these are the cards that I prepared. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And hopefully you will be able to create something very similar with what I'm going to show you Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And to create these I have Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I need a jelly plates and it doesn't really matter what Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Size of Delhi plate, you have, but I'm going to use a five by seven. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So I'm going to give this one away. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: When you open the packaging for the first time. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You are going to see Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Your gel printing plates and it comes sandwiched between two minor sheets and I usually get rid of those immediately you can keep them. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: To create a sense of with Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: But Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I'm not going to use them right now and then. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Let me get rid of the packaging. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Then I usually place my plate on a piece of paper. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Just to make sure that it doesn't Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Move around and it makes it easier to Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Line the paper up most of the time, but this time. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I'm going to use Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Pieces of card. So this is card stock like Bristol paper or heavy Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Computer paper and I think it's about 110 pounds. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I got them to four by 5.2 inches and I've got them to decide because Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I'm going to be mounting my prints on these cards. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: These are recollection skirts, and the size is four point 25 by 5.5 and you can see here, it's a double cart. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And this fits right on here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So this is what I freaked out. And this is what I'm going to be printing on. However, if you don't have this prepared and you only have Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: These cards because it was on the supplier list, then you can Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Print on these just like this or you can use some Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Masking tape. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Or washy tape. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Tape of a border. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Around the guards. Let me see if I can get it straight. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Just like this. So I if I do this, I always look for what she taped it has some kind of stripe on there. This is an overall, it's probably Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Not available anymore, but I'm sure that there is something with like a stripe or a plaid or anything that you can use to align it with your guard. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So this is also what you can do. Um, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: What else do we need. Okay, so we have guards and then of course we need pains. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I'm using liquid tech basics. This time, and I'm also using Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Some Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: deco art metallic paint says these are extreme shame. Thanks. And maybe I will also use these deco art dazzling metallics but let's see. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: What I reached for Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Um, and then you will need some stencils. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I've got some store bought stencils here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I've got some that I got with my silhouette machine. So with an electronic decoding machine. You could also use a bunch to create Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: A stand so Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You could have guts. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So this is hand cut in my lawyer. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I do that all the time. So I have loads of them. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Like this. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I also use paper to cut my own stencils. And these ones are really old and I i love them. I so this is paper and I've had them for years and they still going strong. So don't worry if you just have paper to play with. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And then I also have Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This is also an option. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Like you can cut these Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Snowflakes Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And out, I got them out of parchment paper, but you could use a normal paper to Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So that's what I have and then later on. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I might need some Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Sentiments that I pre cuts. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Also with my silhouette machine and some Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: texts that I just print it. So I printed his own card, but that's for later. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Let's just get started. Okay, so what we need is some paint. I'm just going to Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Use this color. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This is light blue permanent Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I'm taking my prayer. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I'm rolling it and as you can see I'm rolling just one way. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And rolling and picking the brain up rolling picking your brain up rolling and begin the way up and I only need a little bit of pain. So this is Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Enough. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: To cover my card. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And now you can see the guard is smaller than the plates. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So I Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Use a scrap of paper or this is just normal copier paper or printer paper. What do you want to call it, um, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I also use scraps of paper. I also use tissue paper to Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Remove the Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: excess paint off the plate and to keep my hands. Some working Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Now, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I've made my first sprint. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This is nothing special, but we'll get back to that. I just need to Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Print three, two more with just a solid color. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So let's take Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This pink one. This is rosebank Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Again, tiny bits. I'm not cleaning the plate. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Because Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: All of my paper is the same size. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Remember, I got it to four inches by 5.2 and now I can see this Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Line in there. I don't know if you can see it, but I see a line of blue there and I can place this card. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I'm a bit nervous. Can you see it. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I can place this card in the middle and then I use my scrap of paper again. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I burnish it Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Um, I don't use the I usually don't use the prayer. You can use Breyer, to furnish your Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Paper on to the paper onto the plane but Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I like to feel what is going on. So, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I use my mostly use my hands to furnish the paper. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: That way I can really make sure that everything is in contact with the plates. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So that's the second one. So this is a brand new plate. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You can see maybe hopefully that I've got a little bubbles visible in the prince and that's just because this is a new place, and it's very slick and Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The paint is beating a little bit Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: But Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Once this a jail printing plates is use a bit more the surface gets matter or dollar and then this won't happen again. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I need one more. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Maybe green Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This is a bit of a weird color green Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Maybe put some No. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This is how it goes. When I do this all on my own. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Or Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Questions. I don't know. Lou Ann Gleason: It's luhya. No, we don't really have any Lou Ann Gleason: We have some questions about how what materials you make your stencils out of but about you can make stencils out of a lot of different things. Lou Ann Gleason: Yeah mylar in your card stock in the parchment paper and acetate. So, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The answer the question is already answered. Yeah, so this is like, as I already showed you this is like the normal paper that I used to print on to, and this is fine. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Once there's some acrylic paint on there, it's, it, it, sturdy enough Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And so Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Here I don't claim these rights. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You can see that Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So if you want to be able to clean it, then maybe you're better off using mylar or Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Some kind of special material. Lou Ann Gleason: But I think the important thing is you can use pretty a lot of different things. So what we have on hand. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Yeah yeah yeah And then Lou Ann Gleason: A question did just come in, um, Lou Ann Gleason: What do you do if the jelly plate is smaller than the card that you're using. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And Lou Ann Gleason: That's a tricky one. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Yeah, so I didn't prepare that but Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Let's see, can I Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Maybe, maybe in a minute, I will get back to it. Lou Ann Gleason: Okay, good. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Because right now, I wanted to show you because this is Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This is not very interesting rights. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: It gets interesting when you Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Create some kind of texture. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: On your prints. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Oh, and I forgot to tell you what Colin says this is Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Sarah Liam blue you Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I hope I pronounced that right. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So what if we place I stand so on here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And then I could just print this Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And it would be fast. Just do that. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I can print this Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I'm using my Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: scrap of paper. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Now we've got this Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Which is OK. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: But not spectacular. Then if you move this. So this is like a like a mylar Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So in the paint on there. There's still wet and now Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Hopefully, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Okay. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So this is a bit weird looking Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And then there's still paint on there. Um, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I usually do then is I pull it goes sprints. So I try to pull this paint off the plate and I have two options. I think I could do like Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I'm titanium. Yeah, let's do the titanium watch Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Because then you can see Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I only use a tiny little bit of things just to drop and that is Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Even too much. So I wrote everything that I think is too much of on the script that I have over here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And what I'm looking for is Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I want to see the image that was on the plate shine through the white thing that I put on top. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So it needs to be a really thin layer. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: On top. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So I can see a question by Paula. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I know that these demos are Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: On the michaels.com slash classes website. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Maybe not immediately, but Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Tomorrow, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So the one you missed yesterday should Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Probably already be on there. So this is why I got Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So now. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I have three cards that I can use with one go to Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Another thing you can do Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Is I had some think it's over here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I'm still not cleaning the plates, because anything extra. That is on there will make the next sprint, just a little bit more interesting. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So if you don't have time to or if you want to work quicker to Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: To if you want to work quicker than getting this kind of result in three goals, then you can also Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Put a stance on there. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Now, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Don't put some paper on there but Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The Breyer will lift some of the paint. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: From the openings in the stands. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Now, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: We will see it. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Now if you think, Okay, I don't know if this if I burnished it hard enough, then you can Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: See Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This looks a lot like Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: My second and third Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Prince, but now I did it in one go. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Okay. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So now we've got these Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I've got these Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And let's print on top of this. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And what I'm going to use is Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Maybe it's nice to put some metallic color on top of this one. And I've got here extreme Shane. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And the color is Emerald Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Usually metallic things are a bit Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: translucent or transparent. This one, this green one really isn't. But if you, for instance, take gold or silver it's smart to print do don't do. Don't just print it on white paper, but to make sure that there is some color or a darker paper on the nice so the shine really shines and Let's go for it. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Again, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Is anyone playing along. I see. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You see that the shine. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I can say that is it. Oh, this is going really fast. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I saw it. Someone took notes. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And then Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Let's see if this is Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I don't think it's still wet. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: No, I think that's dry. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: What maybe blue is a good option. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: See Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Metallic is now less visible, it's, it's still there, but the bedroom is really nice. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I hope you can see it. It's a bit hard to see. I think Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Anyway, on to this one. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I have tried this before. So, um, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Let's Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Move on to. I've got some Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Snowflakes here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: That I cut with my silhouettes. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You could also use punched out Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: punched out shapes. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Let's use white Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Going to place on top. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I have to say. Some of these are paper and others are Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I think match durable are Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So that's Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Type of Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Drafting paper, I think, oh, I'm not doing this right. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I'm thinking about the draft and paper and not anyway. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: That's and I'm printing this the white on the Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Car Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And hopefully Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Too much Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: What happens Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: A lot of this is just experimenting. So I'm experimenting to just like you are. See, this is what it looks like now. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This is my fault because depth things now on this card. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And what we can do is now. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Lift this Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And try Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: If I can print it. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So with these shapes, you do need to be careful that you don't tear them. I'm just going to try, if I can. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Print that on here too. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And by that I mean what is left on the plate. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Nope, didn't work well. It did a little but it doesn't matter. This is again a cool thing to try for a ghost. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Maybe Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This time I can use Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: A silver Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: To pick it up. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I don't know if it will work. But we'll see. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And then I'm going to print it on this blue card. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I know you can't see it, but I can see the snowflakes underneath the silver paint. Lou Ann Gleason: Hey, Marcia Lou Ann Gleason: This comment. Lou Ann Gleason: Yeah, Gina. She says what spirit to spirit sing the dry paint on the plate with water help refresh it to us up more Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Um, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I have seen it work. Um, but I, I never do that. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: No, I usually just let it dry and then I pick it up again with a new code of things. Right. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: It could do it. And if you find that your paint is driving too fast. You could use something like a retire. Lou Ann Gleason: Or an extender. Yeah. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Yeah. Next Daimler Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I have Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Some Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Golden stuff and I have some liquid tech slow dry medium. I'm sure that Michaels carries it Um, Lou Ann Gleason: Yeah, I think, Descartes has an extender to Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Yeah, so, so look for something that is called a retard or an extender. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Now, or something was slow dry. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And that you can Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: That's a medium that you can mix in with your paints, because I'm in the Netherlands and I usually don't have any problems with paint drying too fast, unless it's like Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Really hot in summer. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: But if you are in a really dry climate, then it could be a problem for you. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Anyway, I wanted to show you this. Can you see it. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: It's super shiny and it's I think it's really pretty. Yeah. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I'm not asking you, blue Lou Ann Gleason: Okay, I'm gonna go on mute again. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: There's, I can still see something of a ghost on there, but we'll just pretend it's not there. Um, I'm not sure what time it is right now. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Are we still good for time. Lou Ann Gleason: Yes, it's 132 Okay. Lou Ann Gleason: Um, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Yeah, so Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: If I go back to these cards, then you can see Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This one. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And this one. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And these are really easy to make. You just need Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Making a mess, making this Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: triangle shape or not a triangle, triangle shape. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I cut this out of Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The copier paper again. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Around shape. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I can use as a mask for Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: These to create these cards so Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Now for this one I'm going to need Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Green prints and I only have one Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So we're just going to take that and then I mean Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So I need some paint and I'm now looking for paint that is opaque and I know this is opaque because there's a little square on there and that's totally filled in. So it's a little bit black square. That tells me that these pains are opaque. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And then I need my card and my the shape that I could paper and then I'm going to use some temporary adhesive. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And this is recollections reposition double adhesive. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I'm going to Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Put a little strip on there. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You don't need much because it only needs to stay put. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: For a short amount of time. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And now I'm going to Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Put some things on here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I'm not going to mix this completely Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Because I wanted to look like. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: It's a bit snowy maybe Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I'm going to place Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: It on here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: In my paper again. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Been to Amsterdam. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Today that I love to go to Amsterdam again. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So now. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This card is finished. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I only need. So what I do is I usually Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Misty machine stitch along the edges, not going to do that. Now, obviously, but I do that before I add here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The print to the card. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And then Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I can place a sentimental top Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Like this one. And then first a card. Here's the card. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So that could be a very easy card. This is done. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And then for this one. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: We are going to take Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Maybe this will Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Just be cool. I think Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And then, of course, need to lift this mask off again and I this is now a bit. Damn. So I would Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: If you want to make this card several times. I will probably cut a few of these or make sure that you have enough time in between prints that this is able to dry because this is just copier paper. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Version. Lou Ann Gleason: Yeah, just asked about how do you machine sketch it Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I just Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Set up my Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Sewing machine and I Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So it's Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: That's Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Just like I do with fabric, however. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The paper does Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Dole the needle. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So you so you might need to change the needle more often. Or you could dedicate one needle for paper stitching. Lou Ann Gleason: Do you need a thicker thread or do you Just know Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Normal Okay. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Yep. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You do need a longer. I don't know how to explain it other than Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The host can't be too close together. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You need a longer stitch. Lou Ann Gleason: Like a basting stitch. Yeah. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Yeah but basing is maybe a bit too. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Wide but And Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The host can't be too close to get it because then you get just get a paper fierce Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: As here rights. You get what I mean. Lou Ann Gleason: That's a lot to Lou Ann Gleason: Wait, one more question quick Lou Ann Gleason: Yeah. Where did you get the sentiment. Lou Ann Gleason: That Happy holidays. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Or that kind. Okay, so I just went into the silhouette. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Store. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Where you get the Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The files the files. So these are all from the silhouette store. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I didn't make them myself. They are just bought in the silhouette store. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And then, of course, I kept them with my silhouette machine. And I'm sure that if you have crickets or Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I don't know if there are any other diet electronic Diet Coke machines, but I know that Carol of that that Michaels carries DOS two machines for sure. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: That you can do something similar. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Even if Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: It's not the exact. You could also do it yourself. But these are bought in the silhouette store. Lou Ann Gleason: Okay, somebody just mentioned that her greeting turned out backwards. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Ah, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Okay, yeah. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: That can happen. It can happen to me too. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So, um, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I have a stance on here with text. So if you want the text to appear readable. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Then you need to make sure that it's the other way around on your gel printing plates and then it will come out great. So let's just do that. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Um, maybe it's nice to use some read Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This is the right way and I need to turn it around. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: On top. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Problem solved. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Look at that. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I love this. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This is really cool. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Okay, now we're going to make Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Christmas ornaments. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So what I need to do is to so I faced a circle again on your paper with a little cup. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And I'm going to hear it with the temporary adhesive to my card. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Oh, by the way, in the Michael store. They also have Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: These little tags that you could also use to Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: mask off parts of your brains, or you can just bring text that's fun too. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So I like this color scheme. So let's use Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Oh, this is of course so on there. What am I going to do. Okay, let's put another print quick Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Some of these prints are just so pretty, all on their own, that you don't need anything else on top. You could just paste this on to Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The Guard Base. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And it will be lovely. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: That's a nice base for Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This does need something on top. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And as you can see I pulled all of the paint off. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Here there's there's only paint left Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: At the edges, but here it's completely clean Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And again, I'm now making sure that I have Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: An opaque paint. So this is the light blue permanence again. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Huh, what No, no. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: What color. What color. What color. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Maybe just Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: put glitter on it. Maria, don't worry. You could even print with glitter paint. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I I've made a video about that. Not long ago, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: But the problem with glitter is is that you need to, um, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Put it on the plate, not with your Breyer, but with Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: A brush or a sponge or something else. Because otherwise all of your clutter will be on the Breyer and not on plates. So that's a tip for you. Otherwise, you can just Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You can just put things on your plate and won't harm it Yeah, it's just Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I'm getting distracted. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: By the questions. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Now it's too late. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Now, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I still think it's nice, even if it's not cold. Right. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And now this is a bit. I can feel that the paint is still wet, so I'm not going to put anything on there but Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I have some scraps of paper. Here. Somewhere. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Let's just take this one. And what you can do is just quickly. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I'm in Dutch, it's called a trump Asia, like a trippy shape. If that's English and then I Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Cut some Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Triangles out of there. Lou Ann Gleason: Working you're doing that. Lou Ann Gleason: Can I ask you a question. Lou Ann Gleason: Yeah, somebody just asked any suggestions for when you're not using a stencil and maybe designing free form or with texture tool faxing so she wants suggestions on how to create textures without stencils. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Oh, yeah. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I've got some Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Stuff that I can show you. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Okay, so then I would. So what I did on this card I again Missy machine stitched the thread here but you can also draw that. Right. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And then Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I did that first and then I based it the they don't hang thing on top and then again. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Get sentiments put that on there and it's finished. Lou Ann Gleason: Oh, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So texture. So if you don't have any stencils. And you don't want to cut any Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You can also let me grab this Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You can Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Put paint on your plate with a brush. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Or Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Not going to clean the plates. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This is a super thin layer. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Also has these mini columns. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And you can use those to create stripes. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And different kinds of stripes. You can also make a waveform. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Have something Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Yeah, let's put it on here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So anything that would say paint off the things Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I just grabbed this. This is a rubber or a silicone Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Paint shaper. I think that's called Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: That you can use to draw your plate. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: That's what that looks like. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And you can also look around the house. Maybe you have some bubble wrap, and it would be really cool if I now use the gold want to get rid of this paint first Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: If I need to clean the plates in between. I just use a damp microfiber cloth. You can also use a baby wipes. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Or a gave the spirits of water and then use a paper towel and that will usually clean any residue right off. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Okay. Go. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This is very hard to see. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I don't think you will be able to see what is happening here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Which one can I use Well, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I don't like this sprint purple to use it just for demo purposes. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Now hopefully Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You will be able to see the texture dismayed. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Ignore this Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And just look at how beautiful just the bubble wrap is Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Right, okay so Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: OK, so maybe you are a card maker and maybe you have some of these Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: These are embossing folders and I don't really. As you can see, I don't really use them for embossing paper anymore. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: But these are great texture makers, so you can just push these into the paint. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And then get great texture. However, I understand. If you don't want to get paint all over your embossing for Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: If you don't want that to happen just enforce some card stock and the card stock will do the exact same thing. So that will work wonderfully just the paper, it will create Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Just as nice of a texture so it's Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Pushed Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: See what it does, one with snowflakes. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The race side and Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The other side and make a different pattern. So that's nice, too. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I've got that. Here I've got some cards here. So let's put that on here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I've also use Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: wallpaper samples. Those are cool, too, if you can get some Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And as I mentioned, you can also just Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Depth some paint on there with a sponge that creates a really cool effect to look how cool is that Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I really like that. Yeah. Lou Ann Gleason: So, Marcia, this is just a warning where five minutes. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: What did I didn't show you Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So I showed you this one I showed you the one with the Christmas tree. This one is good as is. So if you have a great prints just use it. And then this one doesn't need a sentiment, but sometimes you can just put a sentiment on top. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Like this, this one and then maybe Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Like that. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This one, like, like this one. See this sprint was really cool and I just put the sentiment on top. And of course, I use Daikon sentiments and those that I printed myself, like this one, but you can also stamp. You can do whatever you use what you have at home or what you can get up Michaels. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: If there's a nice sentiment stamp set that you can can use Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: That it's just a personal preference or or or what you have at home that you can use for that you could if you have the beautiful hand. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: If you can write beautifully there. Maybe you can like hands letter this right Lou Ann Gleason: Okay, one last question somebody asking if you have a favorite glue Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Hmm. For for what's for paper on paper. Lou Ann Gleason: I don't give us a few. I don't know. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And so I Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Yeah, so I use glue sticks. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: However, I must say that this is not my favorite glue stick Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: But glue sticks. I love glue sticks for paper on paper and then for the small parts like this one I have Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: A white glue and I Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: The candidates in a little bottle. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So that's just like paper or craft glue that I put in here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And this is not a precision tip, but it's Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: A small enough tip. And so I can put dots of it on the sentiments. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You could also get Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: One of these and then not the reposition double type, but the permanent type and these have little dots and if I use this Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: This dichotomy. And I can just roll this over the top. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And now the dots are Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: On the paper and not in the openings, if you know what I mean. And now I can just Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: just glue it on here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So again, this is the temporary tape. So this doesn't really work but Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: If you get a permanent typed in, that would be great to if you get if you can get a dogs roller. So you need to look for adult role or Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Permanent Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Um, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Yeah. What I didn't show you is Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Discard and discard. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: What if you have some prints that are just not your favorites, or that you think could use a bit more than maybe you can just collage. So then you just got your five sisters, they are here. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I got a little landscape. And then maybe Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Based on here. Got some trees like this and then just paste that on top. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And then again, Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And sentiments. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: And it's done. So that's it. I think I'm done. Lou Ann Gleason: I think we better wrap it up here. Yeah. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: Bye. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: So I hope you had a good time and I hope you made a lot of pretty prince and if you didn't, if it went too fast or if you need to live back Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: I think the recording will be up on the website tomorrow or in the next couple of days and then you can just Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: let it play hit stop then play again hit stop. So you can do all the steps that I did. Um, yeah, you can find jelly Arts at Jerry arts com Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: We have Facebook lives which are really fun. We have monthly videos and blog posts that are really fun tomorrow. There's a new blog post coming to the blog. Marsha Valk | @marshavalk: You can find me on Instagram. Marcia hawk.
