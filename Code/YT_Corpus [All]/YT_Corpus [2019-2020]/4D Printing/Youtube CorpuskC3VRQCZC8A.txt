 Hello everyone my name is Hongkuan Lin at Kennesaw State University. I am a ME student doing research with Dr. Ayse Tekes with the translational dwell mechanism and the paper is already published at the ASME 2018. The second paper of our updated design is also accepted to be published at the General Mechanical Science and Technology. You can find more details in my first video and right after that we came up with our monolithic design. It is simplified and 3D printed in a single piece. So these are two of our initial designs that are not working well. So here is our final design and as you can see it consists of slider, arch beam, pin-pin beam, and a motor. So when the pin-pin beam reaches is critical point the slider will snap to its second position. Thank you.
