 in this video we are taking a look at export settings for 3d printing go down to the bottom file hit the export button this dialog pops up you give it a name you choose the file type for this tutorial we are going to select a dot stl dot stl doesn't save texture information or color data it's purely the geometry often used for 3d printing so we'll use that as an example give it a name click save alright now this meshing options dialog pops up and here we go if you notice the model changed we get a live preview and you can spin around and look at all aspects of the model very handy okay so quickly let's run through these the top bar is the slider as you lower it it lowers the density of the polygons the second option display changes what the preview looks like now these last four options work together to affect the meshing density and distribution across the 3d model the first one angle you'll notice it changes as you change the slider it's a different way to input the same value this second option divide larger than when you put a number into this dialog box it's going to take a look at the model and any area that is larger than that numerical value gets divided up further into more polygons like this avoid smaller than is the third option and now this option does the exact opposite meaning it's going to look at the smallest polygons in your model and whatever value you place into here if the polygons are smaller than that numerical value it's going to increase the the size of those polygons this last option aspect ratio limit if you assign a numerical value here it's going to change the aspect ratio meaning the length and the width it's going to add density to the model in order to try and make every polygon relatively the same ratio so we can work with all of these options here and make adjustments um until we kind of reduce the size of the mesh to something that is efficient but the distribution of the polygons doesn't affect the quality of the 3d model this really depends on the type of 3d printing you're doing and the scale of the part and that's something that you're gonna have to experiment with if if this is a larger part or you have a very high detailed uh printer then these settings might not work for you or you're gonna end up you know you've got more resolution possible there in which case you know if you want you can reset all these to zero increase the polygon count you're going to increase your resolution i've got a personal preference i don't like to see these tiny slivers of polygons like you see in here i like to avoid those and the divide larger than you'll find as it's chopping up these larger surfaces sometimes it'll give you a better distribution of them of of the polys into something that uh you know it's a little cleaner so you experiment with that you get something that you like once you're happy hit okay boom it's exported and you're done so we're done for this video i just want to remind you very quickly make sure the 3d model that you are exporting out of moai 3d is a solid up in the top right hand corner if you if you see a joined surface up here you've got a model that has a hole in it now if you have more questions about how to verify that how to fix that problem check out my previous video i'm going to put a link in the comment section for you all right hey quick one next video coming out is going to look at export settings for moving a model from moai 3d to say blender the settings that we've used right now is for 3d printing you don't want to export a model this way if you're going to blender or maya or moto because you don't want to work with triangles it's it's unusable without retopology so the settings that i'm going to show you next time is going to look at maintaining quads and reducing any kind of uh rework that you would have to do so you can just export it over alright see you next time you know what to do bye bye
