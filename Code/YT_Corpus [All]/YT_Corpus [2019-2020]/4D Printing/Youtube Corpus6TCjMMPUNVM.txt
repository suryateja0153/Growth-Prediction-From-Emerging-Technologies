 Hello! My name is Andrey Azarov. I am CTO of Anisoprint and in this video I will tell you about how to print composite part with Aura I'm going to open tha part - it's a bike lever Here is it And I want to make this part stronger as the strength of plastic part is not enough for my purposes The first thing is we need to think about when we are going to print composite part is how to lay the part on the build plate It's usually important even for plastic part as we want to get rid of the support structures or at least to minimize supports quantity but with fiber it's a bit different The main feature of continuous fiber reinforcement is that it will make your part stronger only in the direction of the fibers So, for the parts like this, the best options is to lay part flat on the table so, that the fiber will go through all the part If i will leave the part like this fibers will be cut in every layer and the strength of the part will be comparable to the strength of plastic part without fibers So, I'm going to rotate this part like this and now as you can see fibers will be able to go through all the part connecting holes with tha part body Now let's go to the settings I should select plastic material I will choose PETG and also reinforcement material as well We have two options here - it's carbon or basalt, i will use carbon for this part I will also use standart profile of Aura for Composer and PETG The next thing we need is to turn on fiber reinforcement We have two possible options how to reinforce the part We can reinforce perimeters of the part or we can reinforce internal volume of the part The most simple way, that is suitable for most cases, is to reinforce perimeters The part's internal structure will look like this Fiber thickness is quite high. It's about 0.36mm and it's much higher than conventional FDM layer thickness about 0.1-0.2mm So, to place the fiber correctly and to have good surface quality we introduce macrolayer technology that allows you to print plastic perimeters and plastic external shell at layer thicknesses that are a fraction of fiber layer thickness So, I choose the number of external shell perimeters and number of plastic perimeters that will be around fibers Also, I should choose number of reinforced perimeters I can reinforced outer contour of the part or inner contour For this part I need to reinforce outer contour and I will have, for example, 4 perimeters Also, I can specify density of inner plastic infill For this part I will also need supports structures as we have overhangs here So, I will turn support on Let's look at the result So, here is the part. Let's look at the internal structure And here you can see that we have external plastic shell, internal plastic shell and between plastic perimeters you can see reinforced perimeters that i colored with blue Now I can print the part and it will be a much stronger than part without fibers I'm saving G-code for this and, moreover, if I want to save all the settings and print the part again in the future I can also save project and if I'll change all the settings I will be able to open this project in future and retain all the settings that I've used Thank you for attention!
