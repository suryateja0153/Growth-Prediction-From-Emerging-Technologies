 hello I'd like to take you on a short ride through the last four years of my life four years under the brilliant supervision serving Howard look at Willie and I'm Winfield and Ranger the here again it all begins with nature with the stunning shape formation behaviors that weakens in from birds ants termites fish bees or even cells in our bodies have graded our tissues and organs and these examples of functional shape formation also known as morphogenesis share the same basic principles a very very large number of things creating complex spatial structures by only interacting locally and stochastically one without any later telling them what to do not even the Queen and for the queen bee so what if we could have the same level of emergence and community and robustness that you'd see in the previous examples but it in our own engineered systems imagine we get haven't alien structures like several buildings or robot swarms adapting their shape to unknown conditions in a certain or ski mission or even nanoparticles using similar mechanisms to fight cancer cells this is in blue sky thinking because there's a lot of research on these applications going on so we could take inspiration from nature to engineered self-organizing controllable and functional structures letting our Olympian robotic systems and that's precisely the goal of north of genetic engineering which is that feel where the main part of my thesis contributes to now large-scale ship formation has been shown with over 1,000 robots by micro ravenous Ronnie and his team Harvard however that was an example of a top-down approach where a map of the shape was given to the Romans and they built a coordinate system now if we want to have the same level of merchants of unity and robustness so we see nature we need to take a bottom-up approach without any market a coordinate system or reprogram the robots but examples of bottom-up shaped formation algorithm and algorithms post in the stronger robotics nature have mostly been validated in simulation or using impede those robots they we want to have to check formation robot stories or real world applications we also need to show them with large number of are a large number of railroads encountered spirit so my thesis has been like a journal entry Germany that began showing that it is actually possible to have completely self organized bottom-up morphogenesis enlarged I forms of real simple roads followed by extensions to make the shapes controllable and function then as this journey was taken me a step closer to be made in Roberts tourist reality I decided to engage with potential users and the general public to understand how to design useful Roberts forms of society so let's quickly go of this contributions one by four the first one that off showing you completely self-organized morphogenesis in large swarms of little robots growing even like shapes we took inspiration from multi-cellular Volvo Genesis in particular we've used the theory of reaction and diffusion also known as Turing patterns proposed by Alan Turing in 1952 robots have to work on molecules inside them umv which create and destroy themselves and they are also diffused to and from neighbors and the LED colors would present a concentration of molecule you which is very low in gray to very high in green not beginning rabbits have completely random concentrations but ten minutes spot like pattern emerges in strong that pattern is used for robots to migrate from areas low concentration to areas of high concentration let's help shape in born of attrition it's grown within 121 simulations and 20 experiments with 300 kilowatts to show the different shapes that could be created when starting from cycle or tunnel and also the ability of the storms to recover from damage the ability to separate paths when protrusions were taught and also when the swarm was split in how this contribution was done cycle aberration with the European molecular biology lab led by James Shah Mardan in Spain we published a paper in science robotics journal where I was first offered but in the previous contribution the shapes didn't have any particular goal so if we want to have shape formation robots firms doing real-world applications we need to be able to control the shapes that are created by this I mean generating shapes that can reach further for example to explore an environment patient I took inspiration from current offices in developmental biology and combined patterning migration and local gradient patterning and migration are practically the same as the previous contribution what's new is the local gradient so the last rubber that arrives to one of those brain custards becomes the source of compound signal signal that is transmitted only inside the cluster when a new robot arrives to the cluster it replaces the a source and that's how growth happens the advantage of this approach that now we can help where most controlling those local gradients so we can control the shapes that are created from stubby shapes too thin and normal we did five experiments with swarms of 300 kilowatts to show the different shapes that could be created and also again the ability of the swarm to serve repaired when partitions were taught an in simulation actually with over 2,000 simulations who showed the Patronus could get around top spot we showed the different morphologies that could be created with different parameters those wearables and the scalability with up to 1000 robert we published this contribution in the I Triple E robotic system to measure nature's journal where I was the failures that first episode and I also presented this contribution at iris 2019 the next step was to make Swami's function shapes upon mugging firefighters will have swarm of robots that they could grease the engines building fire let them explore the antenna to find source of fire or the location of the casualties or potential hazards in the building so that they can tell the firefighters exactly where to go so inspired by this scenario I extended the controllable morphogenesis algorithm from the previous contribution to make the storms be able to explore the environment to find objects of potential interest here shown us to be through circles and connect them through the shortest path by actually lighting up the shortest path and this is an example of swarm guided navigation which is a potential use of shape connection Rob short but none of these matters if we don't know how to take it to the real world so I decide I decided to engage with potential users in general panic following the methodology of mid-walk shaping neutral trade interest rate out bi-directional relationship between researchers and society whereby both of them learn from each other to engage with potential users I organized three focus groups with a total of 23 participants from five readings in Bristol in the evening and mafia in Spain after the competitive analysis of the degree of hospice tips plus what they sent you in the first group I could see that they were really positive about using profits rooms for fire and rescue and that they would brother Roberts from Steve information gathering tests like locating victims for assessing risk or creating maps for communication links in a semi-autonomous way but really what struck me the most was that almost 3/4 of them expressed that they would like to be included in the research and development process from the very beginning so engaging with them through metal shaping was a big choice because he opened up that relationship that they apparently knew recently Chris this prohibition in frontiers in robotics and a young where I was type of first author after being successful in come study with Fire Brigades I wanted to show the juror optelec a potential application of robots for mr. may come a reality in the future and I wanted to show them in a fun and engaging way to I created from Spain which is portable educational April in a nutshell schirmer's cave is a game with a set of puzzles inspired by my research on morphogenesis birthday players became from robotics researchers help in emergency services mitigate a fictional pollution crisis good thing about the newspaper is that players learn the properties of strong robotics and a potentially beneficial use of robots shown through play in this paper through the puzzle and again after a quantitative analysis of the pre and post recession I could see and the newspaper was the catalyst for uninsured players to end up having a positive opinion towards Robert Jones assisting them world on the benefits of Roberts honest or society versus the risk the Isles organized a group discussion in session twelve participants from the general public who expressed their hopes and fears and one of the activities we did do in that session was that I asked them to come up with potential applications of Roberts want and put them in these benefits versus risk right and I wanted to show you these because you can see most of the applications are in the medium high benefits and in the medium low risks so teaming up with society and step attention to positively influence generations so to recap I made the following contributions during the journey of my PhD to show a completely self-organized bottom a pro genesis algorithm without any more coordinate system or pre-programmed seed rockets are taking inspiration from developmental biology using a large number of real roads and we showed he was virgin I extended them the orogenesis algorithm to make it controllable and I showed it was merging scalable robust I'm able to get around obstacles my father extended that controllable morphogenesis algorithm to make it functional as an example of strong guided navigation where thus one can explore the environment and find find objects of interest a light of the shortest path between them I also did a formal study with 23 participants from my readings to understand cleared their fashion their challenges under Patti Jean stored strong actions or fire rescue and finally I inserted a lot of formal stomach but 52 participants from the general college to teach the properties of swarm robotics and a potential use of electrons but also to understand their attitudes towards robotronic being used in the real world and real world issues this journey has opened palette of exciting paths to explore in the future paths that will make stronger bollocks a step closer to making profits from useful or society obtain John thank you very much
