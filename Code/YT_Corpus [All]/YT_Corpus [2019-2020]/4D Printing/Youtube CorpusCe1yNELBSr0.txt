 As part of preventative maintenance, the Prep must be cleaned and lubricated once a year. Make sure to put on gloves before cleaning the Prep. To begin, run the Yearly maintenance routine. Tap the "Alert" button. Then, tap "Run" for the Yearly maintenance routine. The routine can also be run from the Maintenance Routines page screen if alerts are disabled. Open the door and remove any labware from the deck. Then, close the door. If your Prep has two independent channels, the front channel will move into position for cleaning. Wrap a clean, lint-free, dry cloth around the lead screw on the front channel and wipe it down. Then, apply a small amount of silicone oil to the lead screw using a lint-free cotton swab. Close the door and tap "Next". The Prep will position the rear channel for cleaning. Open the door when prompted, then clean and lubricate the lead screw on the rear channel. Close the door and tap "Next". If your Prep has an eight-probe head, it will move into position for cleaning. Wipe down as much of the 8 MPH's lead screw as possible with a clean, lint-free, dry towel. Then, apply a small amount of oil to the lead screw using a lint-free cotton swab. Close the door and tap "Next". The Prep will park the channels out of the way. Open the door again when prompted and wipe down the pipetting arm's lead screw and rails with a clean, lint-free, dry cloth. Then, wipe down the two rails at the back of the Prep. Using a lint-free cotton swab, apply oil to the pipetting arm's lead screw at the front, middle, and back. Close the door again and tap Finish. The Prep will move the channels to distribute the oil. Once it finishes, you are done.
