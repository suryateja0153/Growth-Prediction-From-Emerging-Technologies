  Music  Multimaterial Multinozzle 3D (MM3D Printing), a new technique developed by engineers at the Wyss Institute and Harvard SEAS, allows seamless switching between up to eight different materials within a single nozzle. MM3D printing can create complex 3D objexts in a fraction of the time required by other extrusion- based 3D printing methods. Each nozzle can switch materials 50 times per second, which is faster than the human eye can detect. The rapid ink switching is achieved with high-speed pneumatic actuators that apply pressure to multiple ink channels that converge in a series of Y-shaped junctions inside the printhead. Precise tuning of the nozzle shape, printing pressure, and ink viscosity prevents the flowing ink from mixing or back-flowing into the static ink channel when pressure is applied. This one-way flow behavior works like railroad signaling, ensuring only one material at a time moves through the print nozzle. This preserves the quality and detail of the printed object.  Music  The researchers used MM3D printing to create an actuating soft robot with 16 "feet" composed of rigid and soft elastomers with embedded pneumatic channels. Alternating the position of the rigid elastomers between the outer and inner rows of "feet" and sequentially compressing the channels with a vacuum allows the soft robot to "walk". It was able to move at nearly half an inch per second and carry a load eight times its own weight. Currently, the research team is modifyng MM3D printing to enable individually addressable nozzles that each extrude different inks on demand to produce even more complex objects.
