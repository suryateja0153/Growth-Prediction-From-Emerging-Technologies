 What are the possibilities of a metal 3D technology like Meltio's in the Spanish market? Meltio's 3D metal technology Is a technology that has been born with the objective of being able to offer a solution that many industrial sectors haven been waiting for years. In the past twenty years additive metal technology has evolved relatively little. Very strategic sectors such as dental or aeronautics or very specific niche applications are those that are currently using additive metal technology, due to its high cost and its difficult handling. But Meltio has been born with the desire to be a new metal technology able to substitute traditional methods such as casting, automotive applications such as manufacturing of huge final parts, or making pre-final parts so that with a post process finish with CNC, machining or polishing we can have a final piece at a lower cost than what it costs today to do that same piece in a plastic technology. So if we talk about which place will Meltio have in the industrial market in Spain and in the rest of the world, it has come to revolutionize the metal parts manufacturing sector if we compare it with other additive technologies, of course, but also comparing it with traditional technologies where the cost of production for the first time in history about is below 10 euro cents per cubic centimeter. That was something that until a few months ago it was completely unthinkable in the industrial additive manufacturing sector Therefore Meltio hasn't been born to aim a micro niche of metal parts but with the desire to cover 80% of the metal parts that are manufactured on the planet. What means for Sicnova participating in a project like Meltio? After 14 years in the additive manufacturing sector with extensive experience of 14 years as a distributor of 3D technology and with four or five years of experience in development with our own R&D team within Sicnova, Meltio is the consolidation of the R&D team and the work that has been done for years in Sicnova. The joint venture created between Addictec and Sicnova with the support of Arcelor Mittal is a consolidation of all those years of work. For Sicnova it's a big leap to be able to differentiate completely Sicnova as the multi-brand distribution channel for 3d printing and 3d scanning, where Sicnova has done an exceptional job in selecting each of the leading manufacturers in every additive technology that make up the additive manufacturing universe. And on the other hand it involves the participation in Meltio as the manufacturer of own product, in this case with a disruptive technology like laser metal deposition. Therefore for Sicnova it is a great leap forward, a quality leap, the differentiation of both companies, Sicnova as a distributor and Meltio as a manufacturer, and a real pride that our R&D team that develops the software and the electronics and the factory are located at Linares in Spain, for manufacturing for the whole world. It is a great pride for Sicnova and it is thanks to the enormous effort that during these years has been made.
