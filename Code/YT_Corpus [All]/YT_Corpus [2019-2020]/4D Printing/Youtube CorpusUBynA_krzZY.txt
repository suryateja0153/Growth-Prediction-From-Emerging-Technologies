 many of us have been to traditional poster  presentations where students present their   research standing beside it on a foam board  display but let's face it 2020 is all but   traditional we have additional constraints that  make a traditional graduate showcase impractical   or even risky but we are rit students we have  a vision into the future we see constraints as   opportunities a chance to do things in a whole new  way i'm jade myers and i invite you to step with   me beyond the foam board of my poster as i tell  you a story about how we almost solved a world   problem my current research is in finding a way  to increase the strength of low-cost 3d printed   prosthetic elbows through design and doing so  by leveraging the anisotropic properties of   the printed materials we'll get into anisotropy  in a minute but first let's consider where this   research all began it all started in haiti i  was part of a team that developed 3d printable   upper limb prosthetics with local clinicians  at a rehabilitative clinic in port-au-prince   while we indeed succeeded in helping clinicians  learn to use 3d technologies to increase their   capacity to provide you know a few prosthetic  alternatives in their region you know just as they   helped us understand needs from a clinical and  cultural perspective what what we didn't count   on however was gaining such an incredible team of  quality control testers in in our prosthetic user   collaborators you know whatever harsh conditions  environmental working or otherwise that these   prosthetics could possibly be exposed to they sure  did it and it taught us that if these prosthetics   were gonna make it in haiti they would have to get  a lot stronger so while the 3d printed prosthetics   provided greater access to devices because of  the low cost they simply weren't as strong as   they're considerably more costly traditionally  manufactured counterparts the trouble was that the   3d printers we use to manufacture the prosthetics  print parts in layers and like wood grain this   makes the part stronger in one direction than  in another a characteristic known as anisotropy   this type of fused filament fabrication 3d  printer creates parts with a characteristic   weakness between these layers and that is where  devices were failing especially you know in the   fingers and joints such as the elbow you know  which may experience high or repeated stresses   during day-to-day activities we propose a process  of designing in strength to printed parts by   adjusting the part geometry and associated fillet  radii and the print orientation on our current   3d printed prosthetic elbow model to maximize  strength under a diverse set of loading conditions   then by comparing mechanical properties and parts  costs of the redesigned part to the original   we can determine (a) if a significant improvement  in strength has been achieved and and (b) whether   or not there's a significant difference in  average parts cost between the original and   the modified part design the research process  and analysis would look like this first we'd   conduct focused biomechanical research to better  understand typical force magnitudes experienced by   the elbow joint and from what angles these forces  are most often experienced we'd set up a taguchi   fractional factorial experimental design to test  the effects of changes in various factors and find   optimal levels for each in order to maximize the  strength of the elbow assembly next we'd run a   finite element analysis to simulate the effects of  various directional loads on the elbow we'd follow   this up with actual physical mechanical testing  to validate our simulated results as well as to   address the limitations of the fea analysis  as we know we're working with anisotropic   parts the fea analysis will assume materials are  tested that are just as strong in any direction   finally we'll analyze our collected data using  anova in order to discover the best levels of   every factor you know for strength and and then  evaluate the implications of this on future design   iterations in the current elbow design the spring  lock that holds the joint in a particular position   has two thin prongs that are printed parallel  to the bending load where the printed layers   are at their weakest additionally the fillet  radii at the base of the prongs is very small   in our proposed model the spring lock is single  pronged allowing more surface area for strength   and printed transversely to the bending load  the base fillet radii has been increased to keep   the stresses from accumulating in one area this  research will be the first in a series of strength   investigations applied to this elbow model the  next phase will focus on lightweighting through   topology optimization and generative design  and the final phase will look at materials and   temperature as well as other 3d printing process  parameters in all this research could help the   millions who currently lack access to prosthetic  devices to gain a low-cost and strong option that   could allow them greater opportunities for work  increase their access to education and allow them   to fully participate within the societies in which  they live low resource clinicians in collaboration   with researchers at rit may just help solve the  pervasive world problem of the lack of access   to prosthetics i'm jade myers and i hope you've  enjoyed stepping beyond the poster board with me
