  Music  Jellyfish are about 95% water, and quite fragile, which makes them very difficult to study. Most underwater tools marine biologists use are clunky and heavy, and can shred jellyfish and other delicate creatures. A new ultra-soft gripper developed by the Wyss Institute at Harvard University and collaborators at Baruch College use fettuccini-like "fingers" inflated with water to gently grasp jellyfish and release them without harm. This allows scientists to safely interact with jellyfish in their own habitat and could lead to new discoveries in biology and medicine.
