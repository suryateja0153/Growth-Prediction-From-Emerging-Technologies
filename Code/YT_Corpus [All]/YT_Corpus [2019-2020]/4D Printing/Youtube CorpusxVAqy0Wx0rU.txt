 what's up guys today I'm going to show you how you can use cinema 4d to model something to be printed in a 3d printer first of all you have to set units to standard I mean 3d printing standards go to edit go to preferences now I have this opengl problem this warning pops up every time in the preferences settings go to units and here probably you will have here centimeters by default you have set these two millimeters then close that and go to project settings and here by default you have centimeters set it to millimeters and now cinema body is ready for modeling I will show you how you can model a simple object for 3d printing [Music] [Music] [Music] now click on this view in the object manager and you can see in its properties you can see all these values X Y C value sign millimeters so 200 millimeters means that is 20 centimeters and let me show you how you can easily model something so that you can get it printed with the 3d printer this is a parametric object still I haven't converted it to a polygonal object this subject is watertight or it's a Holy Cross object in three different in terms it is manifold now you can simply export this as an STL file and get it printed as a cube [Music] suppose you want to get a print of the box a box at one side is over [Music] you have to click on this cube hit C on your keyboard and make it editable now this object is a polygonal up or to polygon mode click on these servers [Music] hit delete on keyboard now this object doesn't have any thickness on each of these walls you cannot get this as a print with the 3d printer that's because 3d printers cannot calculate the printing with an object like this [Music] so nobody has this whole feature you can go to click on the object you can go to mode and select modeling and click on this mesh checking tab and click on this enable miss check and and you can see here these areas this edges have been highlighted if you check here this abound regions now if you want to get this printed with a 3d printer what you have to do is you need to have a thickness on each of these walls or polygons [Music] [Music] for this cinema4d has this option we can go to simulate go to cloth and select cloth surface make your object a child of this birth surface and click on both surface [Music] but do it settings now right away you can see cloth surface object deforms of a cube object now subdivisions field has one you can increase this see what happens when it's zero your objectives not be formal [Music] what we need is this so set it to zero [Music] we want to see what's happening if you crank this up you can turn on lot of subdivisions are here [Music] so this this this feature this setting generates large number of substitutions here right now with our point is up tuition so we set it as zero this is the value we need here then right now it's zero images so we can crank this up to something like one millimeter to the region in the viewport you can see Paul thickness increases [Music] now check like this can easily be exported as an STL file and printer data 3d printer our object [Music] [Music] our object is one centimeter thick here [Music] we can make this object editable [Music] click on broad surface and hit C on your keyboard you can you can take out the object from this null of [Music] so let's do a mess checking to see if there are problematic areas in this model click on you go to mode select modeling press ctrl-a on your keyboard to see there's a problem laughing you can see there's no problem with everything is fine and easy to get this printer now what you have to do is support this as an STL file and now we have this export dialog set a scale s1 and units have to be millimeters press ok that's it that's how you can get cinema 4d to model something you can print with a 3d print please subscribe to our channel for new tech updates weekly comment like and share to support us thanks for watching
