 researchers at Cal and Lawrence Livermore Lab have created a new kind of 3d printer KPIX 5s John Ramos shows us not only can it produce everyday objects it could one day be capable of manufacturing life itself in this building at UC Berkeley scientists are demonstrating something that even to them feels a little bit like magic normal 3d printers work by melting thin layers of plastic to create solid objects but it's hard to get intricate designs to hold their form but design engineers at Cal and Lawrence Livermore Lab got the idea of making 3d objects the way a CT scan creates a 3d image by hitting a patient with x-rays from many different directions so we thought well let's reverse that process to create objects rather than imaging that makes that we do it with light instead of with x-rays it's called volumetric printing rotating images of an object are beamed through a conventional video projector the light is focused on a slowly rotating cylinder of gooey resin containing plastic molecules with a light-sensitive activator as light accumulates in desired areas the gel begins to harden and in about 30 seconds a solid 3d object is created not in layers but all at once and this one you see something emerging out of nowhere is really magical it is fun to watch right now the objects are rudimentary but the technique opens a world of possibilities it can create objects inside of other objects or in this case a handle around a metal screwdriver but they're even imagining ways to use volumetric printing to arrange human cells into living organs such as liver or kidneys I think it might happen in the next decade so we might actually see a functional organ ready to be implanted or transplanted yeah in the next decade yeah I believe so the labs hold the patent and are already discussing licensing the technology to the manufacturing industry as a new way to mass produce high-quality plastic products in the future but I think what's really important about it in terms of transitioning to a commercial product is that the hardware associated with this is very inexpensive the scientists say it will be a long journey before common objects are manufactured this way but when they are it will be because the first steps were taken in labs like this now that the concept has been proven the next challenge will be to increase the size complexity and quality of objects being manufactured that should open the door to all kinds of commercial uses at UC Berkeley John Ramos KPIX 5 one more advantage of the process because only the desired material hardness the remaining resin is still usable meaning there is almost zero waste
