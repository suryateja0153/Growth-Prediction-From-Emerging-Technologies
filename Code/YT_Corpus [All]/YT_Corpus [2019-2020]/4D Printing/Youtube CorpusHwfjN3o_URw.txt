 hey guys time was against me again this week so I needed to keep things nice and simple now a few of you guys have been requesting cufflinks and as this is my last video before Halloween I couldn't resist making something roughly punking shape was easy thanks to fusion 360 when it came to spooky faces I couldn't help but think of the mother-in-law I'd printed ads on prototypes on my elegant Mars resin printer to give me a better feel for how things would look and also how they would print after a couple of minor tweaks I printed them again using castable resin if you're wondering about this strange thing the prints are attached to it's one of my strange experiments that's actually working great at the moment I'll talk more about this next weekend when I have a bit more time [Music] these are a bit thin in places so plenty of small sprues should help the metal flow I'm still loving this wax pen [Music] now if you're familiar with my straw technique look at this excellent idea it comes from our friend Dick Morris in Alaska and its purpose is to really maximize vacuum reach inside a flask on a quick draft setting it prints in a little over four hours dick is currently allowed me to share this pile on Thingiverse so look out for it there [Applause] [Music] folks have been asking lightly self as a quick recap I do use a homemade vacuum system and this is it a hot flask comes out of the burn out of them and sits on this silicon pad a vacuum pump is turned on and a vacuum pulls through the plaster I did in this case by Dix lattice liner which is evaporated in the heat there something has gone wrong here the button has completely vanished into the depths of my slot boogies but luckily the castings seem to have survived there's a fair bit of flashing but that should come away easily enough [Music] [Music] one of these three guys had a little metal in his eye so I didn't bother with him but the other three turned out okay I'm still very much a novice with pewter but he does showing up really well and if it's good enough for jeweler's it's good enough for me and if you're wondering if they work here they are being modeled by my son Michael as you can see is the spitting image of me two peas in a pod we are it's like looking in a mirror [Music] just like dick I'll be sharing this halloween-themed cuff link on Thingiverse for anyone who wants to have a go printing them or maybe even cast them and if you do cast them drop me a line or maybe send me a picture it would be great to hear from you so that's it for now guys take care and thanks for watching you
