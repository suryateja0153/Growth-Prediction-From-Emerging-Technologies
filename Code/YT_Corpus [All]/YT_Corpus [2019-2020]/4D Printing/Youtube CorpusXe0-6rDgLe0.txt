 Hey everyone Dave Nord here, Account Manager at Dinsmore. I would love to introduce Dale Heuermann, our Director of Engineering and Quality here at Dinsmore. Today we're going to be talking about Imre's shoe project and some of the technologies were using for this project and how far along we've come. So we designed using the HP MJF technology, which is a rigid nylon, a lattice structure that glued on to the bottom of his shoe. It was also way "cooler" looking in the block, which you know Imre loved showing it off to all his friends. So in that we have delivered his first shoe Christmas, two years ago. So he's grown a lot now we learned a lot about which technology works better and stuff and so the second round. We're actually looking at a different technology, we're looking at the Carbon technology. So we're gonna be doing three different types of shoes, that were actually sent to us by our friends over at Decker's. This round we're gonna change the technology to Carbon's DLS technology. Where we're using an elastomeric material called elastomeric polyurethane. Why did we choose Carbon's DLS technology and what kind of changes are happening to the design? Right we chose their design because they have a basically production-ready elastomeric material, that we can print in 3D. We found from the first one it was just too rigid, it didn't have enough play and give, for an active four-year-old as he was running around jumping around things like this. Well we're really excited to see what the outcome is here, stay tuned!
