 a 10 puzzle can keep you busy for 10 to 15 hours it's yoga for your mind and all three million puzzles in this factory could mean 45 million hours of staying busy and that return on investment is why there's been a resurgence in puzzling among younger generations and people stuck at home during the pandemic category of jigsaw puzzles has grown at a rate of about 25 percent over the last five years and buffalo games has shouldered eighty percent of those those growth dollars that's nagendra the ceo of buffalo games the largest puzzle maker in north america we sell you know over 30 000 locations across u.s and canada and we sell into walmart target amazon barnes and noble kroger and others but this whole process only got harder during the pandemic because puzzling wasn't considered an essential service the new york state mandate closed this factory in march and nagendra had to furlough some manufacturing personnel we were shut down for uh two excruciating months given our agility given that we are a nimble business we were able to modify some of our supply chain and we started getting product from overseas but the team was able to continue designing puzzles from home so when the buffalo factory was given the green light to start manufacturing again we were humming from day one today due to the coronavirus buffalo games is facing the largest demand spike it's ever seen the company went from selling 1 million to 2 million puzzles a month so how do they make sure no tiny piece falls through the cracks well it all starts with the puzzle design buffalo games has six full-time designers some of the puzzles start as sketches in-house which are then digitized for other puzzles designers build upon famous works of art like this one from artist charles wysocki here's the artist's original image so if you move across you can see some of the things that we've added we've added this anchor we've added a beautiful sailing ship in the background we're definitely not trying to change the original intent that waisaki had for his piece what we're trying to do is create a more engaging puzzling experience and to give those puzzlers those incremental victories once they've got a design the team will print it out and overlay a cut pattern on top to see how the image is going to break into individual pieces they're looking to make sure there's no say giant unsolvable sections of blue you don't want to have an important element of the image cut off at the wrong spot and it's not an easy task a thousand piece puzzle all thousands of those pieces would be unique our teams will look at each of those cuts just to make sure that it's got the right um the width and the angles to really give you that satisfying snap you can actually pick up our puzzle and pieces will hold together when you're completed this team created 500 new puzzle designs in a matter of months to meet the demand during the pandemic and that's about two to three times of what we would have done in a normal year once the puzzle design is approved it heads to manufacturing here everything from 250 piece classic images to 2000 piece star wars characters are cut up the biggest puzzles can take about 30 hours to make from an uncut image all the way to a finished puzzle first that uncut puzzle image comes in from the printing company in canada this is about a week's worth of puzzle board that puzzle image is glued to a cardboard backing so it's sturdy the mounted images are put aside until the glue is fully cured usually a few days before they're forwarded on to the cutting process then it's time for the puzzle images to be cut this is one of our cutting work stations we take our puzzle mouth images that are ready to be cut they'll feed through the other side of the machine cut into a thousand pieces we trim away the scrap automatically that scrap is launched from this machine into a recycling bin what's left are thousands of puzzle pieces they get blown apart and dropped into an awaiting box underneath that box is folded together on the other side of the factory this die cutter cuts box board into box planks the main component of the puzzle boxes so how does buffalo games make sure no piece gets lost each puzzle after it's cut goes through an automatic inspection system cameras are placed on the discharge of the cutting press to make sure every single piece has been cut clean and available for packaging this is the finished puzzle on the discharge of the cutting press all those puzzle boxes are sealed up stacked and packaged together this machine is our automatic case packer automatically sorts the different images into the corrugated case getting it ready for shipment then they're sent across the street to the warehouse to await delivery this is about 400 000 puzzles in the facility that's a couple weeks worth of shipments those are put in our warehouse and then packed out to our customers help screen all people visiting and entering the facility we had to make modifications to our production schedules i also had to redesign a few work centers to maximize social distancing throughout the workplace even with all the pivots buffalo games couldn't work fast enough to meet the demand of millennials and pandemic puzzlers with the increase in demand this year we've been running the factory the full year both before and after coverage and 100 capacity we wish we had the product because we think the actual demand would have been about 10 fold and even with a two month shutdown negendra says the company will still double its sales for 2020. as a result of who would we believe there's been a massive influx of new customers into into the category i'm talking about families that may have puzzles 10 years ago there are people that have never puzzled in their lives but i think there's going to be a robust demand for this product for a long time to come [Music]
