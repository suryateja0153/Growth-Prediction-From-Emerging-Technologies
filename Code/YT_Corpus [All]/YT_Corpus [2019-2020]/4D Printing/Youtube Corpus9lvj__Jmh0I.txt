 before you export anything for 3d printing it's very important that when you click on your object moai tells you that this is a solid a solid indicates that this is watertight beyond what you can see just with your pixels every corner every edge is seamlessly attached [Music] i've exaggerated a problem that can happen in people's meshes if i zoom in here you see that gap between this edge and this edge that's going to create a hole on your screen it just looks pretty much like the one next to it if there was not this hole after they're joined it should tell me that this is a solid but notice in the top right it says join surface whenever you see joined surface that is an indication that whatever this object that you've made there's holes in it it's not fully enclosed all right so if you try to export this box on the right you're gonna have problems now to fix that you're gonna have to go in and you can use the separate button and it'll separate all the surfaces that you've joined into separate parts and then you gotta go in and you gotta find that troubled area and you've gotta redo it and if i draw the closed shape correctly and then i join it notice now that there's when there's no holes it becomes solid now that it's a solid i'm good to export this so if you've got a part that you've made it looks great on the screen but somewhere along the line you've created a joined surface and not a solid you gotta pump the e-brake depending on the type of model you're creating this issue could creep up in different ways the realest answer is it takes practice but we're not done yet this video is not over we're just getting started in fact cue the music sharpen your swords with me brethren for we will not allow the joint surfaces to defeat us join me i will show you the techniques to slay this foul of beast and together as many rise and many fall when the dust settles you and your 3d model will remain properly prepared for three day printing ah let's begin uh yeah and i'm keeping this music on because it's amazing maybe turn it down a little bit when i pick a tool out of my and it's a tool that is asking for me to provide inputs that's an opportunity for me to click wrong not connect something properly and create a hole so i drew this really sloppily to prove a point even if you're trying to be perfect and you've got your snaps on it and you're doing everything right you open yourself up to the chance to make a mistake so how do you fix that well that's where we want to utilize moai's tools as much as possible what do i mean by that let me show you let's just take a look at these two pieces just like in any 3d software there's multiple ways to do things so i could come up here to the right and click on show points and that's going to turn on these little grips and then i could select these and use the move tool to uh to snap them into place now because snap is on and i see that they kind of popped in you know 99 of the time that's gonna result in a good connection right but i just want to point out that doing it that way you leave yourself open to a potential mistake that you don't see by no fault of your own so an alternative to this is is to think of what other tools you could use that that forces moai to do that calculation for you so instead of me snapping these points on the points how about i use the tools within moai to do that for me so i can select both of these and use the trim command and now if i select this piece that i want to trim moai is going to make that cut for me and i can be confident that because moe i made that cut and removed this piece that these two pieces are seamless okay so that applies to curves as well so in a situation like this when possible if you can loft past the the zone that you actually want and then you can create the plane that is the side or the curve whatever it is basically create an intersection that you can then select and trim that's how you can be confident that you now have a piece that is perfect let's select all these i'll use the trim command again so now let's test and see if what i've been talking about is correct if i join all these together we should see a solid result i click the join button and look up at the top it's telling me it's a solid all right okay so i've taken this model and separated it so that i can select different faces and i've deleted several of them we're going to move around this model really quickly and i'm going to show you like four different techniques or fixing troubled areas of a model all right first on this back side by the way this is where the basic tutorial series really comes in handy because the real secret is everything being taught in that tutorial series is more than just basics after you learn them you'll discover creative ways of applying those tools so thinking back to that tutorial series what tool can we use to fix this side you could try to draw arcs and then extrude that out and snap points you could make a new cylinder and try and scale it to fit but some of these methods leave room for you to make a mistake so instead let's use the sweep tool if i click on that we want to select the profile and again profile in this situation would be this line here hit enter select rails rails is where we want to extrude the profile around so in this case that would be this curve and whenever possible you want to select multiple rails so in the case of this model both of these sides are symmetrical but if they weren't this process would still work hit enter and again moai completes the calculation and creates the surface for us removing that potential middle ground of us misclicking or creating a problem that we don't see all right for this one i'm going to show you the loft again because i want to point something else out i will copy these edges notice that i'm copying them instead of trying to redraw them so i'm working with existing elements that i know work using them as a fixed condition alright so select those two curves run a loft boom now when it comes to trimming it's the same thing i already showed you however i want to point something else out what i already showed you was trimming by selecting surfaces like i am right now right whenever possible it's better to trim with with the edges only because if you select the entire surface as the trimming element then moai is taking that entire surface and its curvature to bear on the calculation of figuring out what to trim so if you have a very complex model with multiple compound curves and there's an intersection again that you don't notice and when you run your trim you're using this whole surface as a trimming feature that you could end up with with like a tiny sliver of a surface that again you don't see on your screen unless you were zoomed in to the right spot and then you would have a joint surface again because that extra little piece is hanging hanging out so the best practice when trimming surfaces is to select the edge and not the surface itself okay really quickly again rebuilding a filleted edge sweep tool is fantastic for this especially because you have a curve in this direction and the curve in this direction again i will select both sides for rails hey boom rebuilding a corner like this you can use n sided underneath the construct tab and then if you adjust your view you can adjust the rounding of that corner okay now for this piece this missing piece down here flat and a little bit of curvature you could use any of the options that i've shown you so far i just want to show you another technique so you have it in your head what i'm going to do is i'm going to copy and paste those edges and i'm going to go ahead and move it out since i know and again we're relying on the pieces the parts of the model that we know are successful so i know this width right i'll create a 3d solid because i know using these tools right generates a perfect result and then i'll move this up here and now we're back to some more of our basics training that i'm sure you recognize i join those two lines together move it up so that it's intersecting this solid select both of them and run a boolean merge i've created a piece that i'm can be confident in right because we generated the width off of the existing model and we generated this this curve off of the existing model now i can select those surfaces copy and paste and pop them in i don't want to give you the wrong impression from this tutorial that you shouldn't you know trust snaps the point that i'm making however if you can think of a better tool that takes the guesswork out of your hands and puts the calculation into moai's hands you reduce the chance of a mistake all right so now that i've done all those let's see if they all worked select everything click join did we get it look at that we got it it's a solid huzzah hey you did it you crossed the finish line let me tell you something if you watched this entire tutorial we have covered a ton of information here you now know what to look for to make sure that you have a quality 3d model that's ready for 3d printing and if you have issues with your 3d model you have some tools in your toolkit to fix that in the next tutorial we're going to take a look at the export settings inside of moai 3d creating a file type just right for 3d printing so stay tuned you know what to do bye
