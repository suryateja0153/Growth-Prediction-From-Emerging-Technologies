 well it's time for another edition of space for chase I was waiting for you to have a rain segue but I just wanted you to say it okay all right so last week we talked about three finalists for the Mars habitat they've completed their competition and they have a winner but first off there was a contest before that to design it and this is where things kind of got confusing for a little while so there were three teams designing these and then two teams were actually building these mostly architecture firms putting the habit s together so started with 10 teams now they've narrowed it down to three these were the three that won last week APIs core out of New York they got first place this was their design Oh so phorus so first out of Rogers won second place nice the Mars incubator out of Connecticut took third place okay so the way this next competition worked was they went with first place to design that see if it passed all the tests or built it what's the second place third place okay all about all of them I'm not really sure I had trouble with the live stream it looked like it probably start with the first one and see oh yes yes they did like a smash test a wind test okay they're all gonna built itself and they just crush them so wonderful kind of sad so the two teams that were competing we're a team actually out of Pennsylvania State University and then another group called a eyespace Factory and of course a eyespace factory one because they design prototypes for NASA they've been in business for a while good for the students for giving it a really good shot and going yes especially Pennsylvania State we're not talking a super Ivy League school or MIT or even Georgia Tech just Penn State notably known for their meteorology actually actually so final competition at a small price of 4 million oh now they had to allocate a good bit of that to actually putting in like our reserve banks I can actually do this later when everything was 3d printed it all had to fit in way a certain amount yeah so they could obviously send it right these were actually for the moon infra Mars so they kind of needed both of them to be able to survive yeah the main issue was the fact that Mars has such severe wind storms that's what you had to really withstand that that's so crazy so would they 3d print it on earth and take it or they 3d print it on the moon the goal is to print on the moon and they print on Morrison Wow yeah like same design on Mars same design Oh Martha I mean there probably is a few tweaks yes because you know designing it and actually building it yeah can be very different but still I wonder how long that takes what 3d printers look about I want to say about eight hours it's like a four-day competition and two days are dedicated to building that's so short yeah big ol long it takes to build a real regular house that doesn't even withstand things like that yeah no this is the line printing is so cool like I did think a lot of like ancient methods like clay were absolutely yeah but still one step closer one step closer there's probably gonna be tweaks to that obviously in the design oh yeah and what NASA needs but they're gonna take their time with it hey by 2024 that's their goal so buildings on the Moon and Mars the Mars alright well up next Chase is gonna leave space come back to earth do another weather forecast cuz I'm out of this world first gas prices in Java
