 hello my name is jack forman i'm a current graduate student at the mit media lab tangible media group in my research i leveraged my background in material science as a means to explore and develop interesting materials behavior and use those explorations in the creation of new material interfaces and fabrication techniques today i'll be presenting defect styles 3d printing quasi-woven textiles via underextrusion defects tiles can be produced using a standard fuse deposition modeling 3d printer and require no modification to the hardware or software with the flex tiles we can print thin flexible substrates that are stretchable see-through and have a fabric-like feel these fabrics be printed into a variety of shapes such as dresses or with a variety of materials in this case tpu for an ultra tough bad bit in shuttlecock we can also print extremely long lengths with defects tiles in this case a 70 meter roll of textile in a single print which was produced on that printer let's get into the details in hci there's been interest in developing approaches for additive manufacturing of form textiles that combine the precise and rapid nature of digital fabrication with the soft and flexible affordances provided by textiles however many 3d printed fabric projects more closely resemble chainmail the ones that get closer to the feature size and feel of real textiles often require specialized hardware or software which limits their dissemination and are also limited in their print speeds and supported geometries in this work we present an alternative approach that allows flexible thin textiles of money materials to be quickly printed into arbitrary forms with tunable properties using an unmodified inexpensive 3d printer our approach leverages a common cause of print failure under extrusion which causes prints to look like the images on the left while defects have a bad reputation in material science they're critical to engineer materials to have new properties a defect is often seen as a feature once it could be controlled in this work we show that by carefully tuning our extrusion multiplier and print speed we can introduce periodic gap defects that afford our prints with flexibility and textile-like aesthetics [Music] here's an up-close of the printing process essentially as the nozzle moves a glob of thermoplastic builds up on the tip this glob will snag the top of a pillar and be connected to the next one with a fine strand as you can see these fine strands enable the in-plane bending which affords the flexibility and also the stretchability changing print speeds and extrusion multipliers allows us to control the density flexibility and stretchability of our textiles effect styles can also be printed at very high speeds up to twelve 000 millimeters per minute which was the maximum of our printer we also performed characterization on effect styles printed with a variety of common 3d printing materials generally we prefer to use pla it had nice strength and flexibility and was very easy to print with effect styles are also very thin around point three millimeters as a stress test we fill the print volume with a defect style roll and can produce 70 meters of fabric in a single print our approach is particularly unique in that we can support curvature along the z-axis to support more complex geometries than previously possible as shown with the miri ori structure here we showcase a variety of different applications that the defect styles design space enables an ultra tough shuttle printed with tpu a dancing man pendant actuator which required no post-processing to fabricate an interactive glam shade where the deformable lamp shade the solid supports and the conductive pads were all produced as a single print and a variety of dresses that can be used as tangible augmentation for online shopping we combine the shape complexity with the scale for full size triads in this case a skirt is segmented and compressed to fit within the printer and then once printed after 36 hours it's removed expanded heat bonded and depleted which allows the users to try on a preform of the garment and check for a general fit we can also pattern surfaces in a variety of ways here's an example of a few of these techniques the first is where the pattern of the two components are produced using the same density the second where textile and solid components are printed together the third where the density of the meshes varied across the surface and the fourth where the the pillar or the quasi-warp directions are contrasted by controlling the print direction of each segment while post-processing isn't necessary with the textiles we outline a variety of procedures including this iron-on pocket which can be fused to a conventional textile shirt there's certain limitations in future work including limited overhang angles and in future work we'd like to see more durable materials and sustainable filaments so i was looking at things like surgical meshes with tunable mechanical and shaped properties i'd like to conclude by thanking my co-authors doa dowan hamilton forsyth and of course my advisor professor hiroshi ishii and with that i conclude my talk thank you for listening and i hope that you enjoy trying printing these textiles for yourself i will now time travel to the present where i'm happy to answer any questions on the approach thank you again
