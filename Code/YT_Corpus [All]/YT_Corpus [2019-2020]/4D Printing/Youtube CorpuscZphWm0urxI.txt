 good afternoon my name is Johanna with the tightest VD I'm the co-founder of the company and Titus to EDD developing smart metal 3d printer in Silicon Valley you can see the the map in here that's what the map I live in right now that this is at the same frantic Bay Area we can't call it the a Silicon Valley as you can see there I mean there are a lot of the famous company out there so right now in Silicon Valley many company they are developing the making of 3d printer right now and also I mean the the the Asia I mean the about manufacturing powerhouse such as Singapore Korea Japan and China they're investing a lot of money in the 3d printer for the next time generation things today we want to discuss with a remarkable speaker in each industry about the Tran and then the status of the reading tree and also like the really share I mean the give some kind of idea about the future of the 3d printer so let's begin with the tactical from the fortunes so let you're welcome I could afternoon ladies and gentlemen is really happy to be here to share some of my experiments and knowledge the 3d printing and first of all I would like to give you quite briefly introduction on my company and myself our folson who is rooted in china but have global footprint investments form we have eight divisions under the roof of Folsom which are the healthcare real estate insurance private equity automation robotics fashion guru entertainment and the last one is natural resources as you see right now I am in charge of the foreign capital which is private equity and also the force and automation and robotics group first of all I would like to share some I mean general information on the market of the 3d printing so for the past five years the girls cake or for sudeep's 3d printing in China is roughly 25% in the year 2019 we expect the market size will reach the 3 billion RMB and from the second figure we just realized more than 75% of the market achieved by industrial 3d printing equipments and roughly 25 or 24% achieved by the consumer end and also for the applications so what is a market what is the final application from the customer and so we saw the figures came from the numbers of the market of 2018 so roughly half of the market they'd like to buy or they would like to acquire the equipment from the I mean international companies from Germany from America know from Japan so they can afford I mean higher price than before and also from the types of the equipment we can see most of them they have to apply to the real industrial applications but compared to three years ago if we go back to 2015 or 2016 most of the equipments they are using for the consumer end for the plastic or for the tools for others but for the year 2018 most of the customers they are more serious than before for the real applications ok the trends because we are investing lots of my general my factoring companies and lots of the our portfolios they are asking help from forcing like hi here could you tell me what is the real applications or what is the real trend for the 3d printing because it was quite hot topic it was one of the 11 directions under the national policy made in China 2005 and from my pond will there are some quite obviously trends for the future of football most of the final customers they are interested in the efficiency and more functions the transmitting they would like to buy high quality equipments or the higher quality equipment than before if the equipment of the solutions can increase their efficiency secondly of course is a the material printing survives of 4d printing it's only a concept because right now is really tricky for us to integrate the 3d printing together with the time I mean divisions the next one because the III IOT or other quite hot keywords we should and we could integrate them into the equipment's for example we have to connect each of our 3d printer together to supply the information the feedbacks for the production lines the last way is a punch marks what is the punch marks is like right now even right now after the years of the developing for the 3d printing some of the customers and the markets they are feeling confused what is the real efficiency for the 3d printing we need some benchmarks for the real application for example in the automotive aerospace or the consumer electronics or the I mean pharmacy ends to show the market to either hit the market high because of the benchmarks because of the applications of the CD printing it can improve your efficiency and improve your margins or improve your production lines the last parts the investments the trans making we can see in the year of 2017 is a peak year for the investments the tools and last year and this year it changed a little bit quiet but if we change another angle for the investment for the amount of the investments for the year 2018 even has increased a lot compared the year of 2017 the reason is in the year 2017 in 2016 most of the investment in the 3d printing they are focusing they were sort they were focusing on the early stage the city round of angle round of the pre but in the year of 2018 we can see most of the investments they are in their strategy investment round oh the a+ round or B round which means the amount of the investments are much much higher than the early stage that is why although the cases of the deals of the investments dropped slightly in the year 2018 but a month increase a lot of 2018 compared to the years and the last sentence for my short presentation is I believe for the future 3d printing will not only independent direction for the investment it will be one of the factors for the whole manufacturing it looked like the surveys platform like the AI or IOT or robotics it is not only a quite independent sector in the future production lines of the manufacturing thank you much thanks for your presentation actually the tactical heat in charging automation and robotics group in fall soon and he do a lot of M&A and investment and the activity in China in Germany right now so we can ask more about yeah it investment plan later and then that's per presenter is Alex from HP so let's rock home good afternoon any of you so my name is Alex and Amir and based in Singapore and it's pleasure to be here this afternoon I'm part of HP 3d printing and digital manufacturing and I'm in charge of the commercialization of our 3d printing solutions across the asia-pacific and Japan so HP you may be familiar with the brand you might have had a PC or printer or have it utilized some graphic solutions HP is also in the 3d printing business and the reason why we went into the 3d printing business is that we believe that we have technology that can help companies cross the chasm from prototyping to production and I'll show you some example later on now there are four keys for drivers four to enable that transformation to a digital manufacturing process the first one is technology innovation as mr. Chow mentioned earlier the speed the cost the quality of the parts are all very important dimensions that will enable companies to truly adopt additive manufacturing as a method of production manufacturers need to be able to trust the technology to print parts repeatedly inconsistently within the specs of those parts so that's absolutely critical adoption by large and global manufacturers is equally critical for that transformation to happen they set the scene they set the standards of production and the ecosystem beneath those large brands will then then adopt the technology the network of vendors for example so that's absolutely critical we drive a lot of partnerships to develop a an ecosystem and it's important to bring members of academia of the industry government bodies and agencies research centers that work together to to foster that ecosystem and build a strong ecosystem of partners pretty much every government that I've spoken to across Asia has some kind of a plan to support industry 400 particularly around additive manufacturing because everyone believes that 3d printing will have a substantial impact on the future of manufacturing and finally we need to develop expertise through education is absolutely critical that the next generation of architects designers engineers fully understand the potential of the technology and they implement that in the day to day work and they need to be able to be to have access to the technology to try test and then implement those applications within their relevant industries now I mentioned certain programs Singapore is one of those countries that is at the forefront of driving transformation Singapore has implemented a research and research innovation enterprise plan and the version of that plan for 2020 and one of the mains identified as advanced manufacturing in engineering so the goals essentially is to create good jobs sustain the economic growth in Singapore by make sure making sure that the workforce is enabled to take care of that transition from a labor intensive to an innovation based economy it is important that they strengthen and linkages between all the government funding that goes into you know institutions are indeed projects with the industry tighten those those linkages so that has a real market impact and finally Singapore is keen on placing bets placing bets on disruptive technologies that will give a competitive edge to the economy now manufacturing represents as of 20 2015 manufacturing represents about 20% of the overall Singapore economy so the government has identified a tiki verticals and also for cross-cutting technologies one of which is additive manufacturing and I can tell you the additive manufacturing can have an impact on most if not all of those eight industry verticals now what the governments are trying to do is to spur innovation to drive transformation of business models but also of supply chains I want to give you a couple of examples with whom we've worked at HP of companies that have adopted 3d printing at the very very core of their manufacturing processes the first one is smile direct you might have heard about smile direct they went recently IPO right on the new york stock exchange and managed to accumulate quite a well a good you know capitalization now this company is using our HP MultiJet 3d printing technology they are providing clear aligners and are transforming the orthodontic industry by going that by providing a service directly to the customer printing parts as mold every even one of those parts fully customized to the the exact configuration of your teeth to help you you know receive a treatment they plan this year to print twenty million individual customized parts this year alone another example is here in korea Brisbane is a startup that has set up retail shop in Gangnam and if you look carefully I am wearing whether they're customized eyewear frames they what's interesting about prism is that they have completely digitalized the end-to-end workflow of the manufacturing processes from data captured through scanning through a data capture and and management throughout the workflow and also digital manufacturing so as you can see big and small companies are able to adopt 3d printing in the manufacturing process and step by step they are changing the landscape of manufacturing Thank You inácio my name is Hideaki from a global brain since I'm not a expert on the 3d printing and that these folks have already talked about the market expectation and business models of 3d printing I'm just gonna be talking about who we are and what we do and coma brain is a venture capital and we invest into 3d printing related startups and also startups that we make investment they use a 3d printers so we're based in Tokyo one of the largest venture capital firm out of Japan and we focus on the diptych investment a worldwide and we have five different offices around the world we do have office in Korea a Gangnam and also Singapore London and San Francisco as well so we pretty much invest anywhere in the world in diptych area and thanks to Korean government our fund is invested by Korea Development Bank and also Japanese government and some of the largest corporate companies listed companies in Japan KDDI second-largest elico in Japan in a Japan's largest airlines me-tv Lausanne is Japan's largest real estate developer and the University of Tokyo as well that's some of the examples of our investors this is our five focus area for the diptych investment as you can see space robotics materials or IOT those sectors or they use 3d printers so we intensively invest into these areas and sometimes we do make investing to 3d printer startups as well it's a little bit of background by myself I used to be a aerospace engineer educated in the US I was working on the first Japanese spacecraft mission on the International Space Station project and I worked on several satellite and Japan's first lunar lander mission and I switched to the my career to the a strategy consultant and then turned to the venture capital and sporting diptych focused startups here are some of our examples that we make investment in excel space makes micro satellite and they launched a lot of a satellite into space collect data takes picture of the earth and collects data and gets inside and distributed to the investors or the corporates who wants to see the economic activities of the earth tell existence develops avatar robot which can be remotely control you can place this robot anywhere remotely and can be control and work from the cockpit so this robot can be used in the places you have a labor shortage so if it's what the Japan has as an issue because we have a very severe labor shortage in Japan linguists they are developing autonomous welding and welding inspection robot and connected robotics they make a cooking robot they are all based in Tokyo they all use 3d printers live robotics makes it they make industrial robotics arm they were a very early stage when they got acquired by phonic one of the largest industrial robotics um company they had more than hundred patents when they got acquired by phonic year ago and kabuki kabuki was working on the 3d printing platform they connect orders to the 3d printing factories and they got last year acquired by a Futaba Futaba is one of the largest molding company so it's very very traditional companies acquiring very cutting-edge startups so that's it for my presentation Thanks the world knowledge forum
