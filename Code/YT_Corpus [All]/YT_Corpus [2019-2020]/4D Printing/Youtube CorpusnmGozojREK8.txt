 (robot whirs) (crowd murmurs) - You can consider that this is like a module. Imagine if you have a bunch of this kind of module so you connect them together, and each module you can manipulate the specific motion by playing with the number of soft joints and also control the stiffness of the joints. So this way you can generate many different kind of motion, like walking or maybe swimming. (robot whirs) The concept of this shape-morphing robot is interesting. In general, if you have a robot, then the mechanical structure is fixed. If you can change the mechanical structure on the fly, without redesigning the robot, this is pretty useful, especially if the robot is very small. Because if it's very small, and then you have a limited size and also a limited weight, so you need the robot to be able to reconfigure itself, trying to use the same mechanical structure to do different tasks. They can be helpful in applications like search and rescue, or environmental monitoring. They are very small, we can build many of them, we can deploy them autonomously, and they can talk to each other and get information back for us. (robot whirs) (crowd murmurs)
