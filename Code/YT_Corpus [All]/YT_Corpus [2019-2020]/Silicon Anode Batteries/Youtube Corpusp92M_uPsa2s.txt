 [Music] welcome back to this class where we are talking about the metals as well as the different compounds of metals so now we will be talking about atypical aspects of the metals and their compounds and how we get the metals from a chemists point of view or more specifically from an organic chemists point of view because the industrial demand for metals and their processing and making all these things is the typical engineering aspects people can think of people and talk of which is a typical subject for the people who are dealing with metallurgical engineering who are dealing with materials engineering and this particular class and the following classes what we will see about how we look at the metals and their compounds as an inorganic chemist because we will be talking about something where we think about the basic and the fundamental in organic chemistry knowledge will be useful and that basic and fundamental knowledge of inorganic chemistry how it is useful for selecting the area of introducing that particular industry where you can get the easy availability of the material for the different types of processing so we'll start from the lightest metal iron after hydrogen say so hydrogen helium and then we have in the periodic table the lithium because it has a huge demand so if you go and ask any particular metallurgical engineer or a metallurgical technologist or a materials engineer that how you get or how you can start a industry for making lithium ion batteries so it's not that you go and start a lithium ion battery and all these things you should have a very good level of availability and a cheap source of availability of lithium for that particular purpose if work if our country doesn't have that much amount of supply of lithium we should not think of establishing a company which will be dealing with lithium as your lithium-ion batteries because if we think that China has a huge source lithium or any other European country as a huge source of lithium we cannot compete with them in terms of the price so always forget about the fundamental and the academic interest or the economic knowledge it is the knowledge which will be driven by the market which will be driven by the economics so the source of the material as the corresponding source of the ore or the minerals is important so we'll look at that and what are the feasibility for the typical or the very simple inorganic chemistry because everywhere we are talking the knowledge level of our inorganic chemistry how we can apply to get some useful industry where you can start this for you're making this compound of all these things so what are those lithium compounds we can have so lithium sources we should know how we can process of those for making lithium metal itself first and then the different compound that's why the title of this class is the metals and they are compounds so again we should look at the important material that means where from we get the huge amount of that thing which is visible for your interests really possible extraction process is your Purdue min SP or d ume ne is this for you mean there's a typical name basically I am NOT asking you that you should remember it nicely but so long you have the class you if you as appearing for the exam you just try to remember it otherwise how will you know this particular one once you know that what is your magnetite what is your ferrite from our school days we know that these are the iron sources or the iron materials which is available everywhere even for our soil sample and everywhere where the soil sample is reduce in color so we know that there are hematite there are magnetite and all these things so a geologist can go and try to find out the physical characteristics of this particular mineral they identify it they take it they make it grinding and they go for his typical analysis for his lithium component or any other component but this particular oxide mineral is a complex one if we now look at the corresponding formula of the material so mineral has a formula of one lithium one aluminum and two silicon so is Li al si 206 so basically is a silicate mineral so wherever we find is not that you will get as the free lithium as lithium oxide or lithium chloride is not possible like that of your sodium or potassium will come back once again under the heading of your metals and compounds the sodium and potassium but already we have discussed a huge amount of that thing that how we get sodium chloride how you get potassium chloride in the same person you will not get lithium chloride so always remember that the periodic table goes in a particular direction and always we look at all these things and basically we are looking in different categories and in terms of the periodic table also so is basically a silicate mineral there are large number of silicate minerals we know and basically the basic formula of this you can have the BI silicate or die silicate we call si tu si 3 si for all these more complex materials we have particularly some useful catalytic material when we recall at the letter part of our discourse we will find that the gia lights and all these things which are nothing but silicate as well as aluminum so we call them as alumina silicate so this is nothing but you have double silicate structure there is two silicate ions there along with one aluminum this is basically alumina silicate and alumina silicate has this particular type of charge when the whole charge is not being neutralized by aluminum or potassium or sodium because most of these silicates are sodium salts or the potassium salts like our silicic acid and all it is naturally available as your lithium salt so it is not so easy to get that lithium also because the during processing your lithium can go out can leach from the medium is very difficult to trap that particularly theum and lithium has the different characteristics different inorganic chemistry and all these things lithium has so it is also found together with some other material one is your lithium mica so mica organ has a different structure but it is again silicate so silicate structure of mica we can have and in case alumina silicate is there but there is aluminium are also bound to fluoride as well as hydroxides like your floor apatite or hydroxyapatite molecules we all know but here little bit higher level of lithium to lithium ions are there along with one potassium so try to look at the formula of lepidolite it is lepidolite LEP I do Li t so lepidolite formula will tell you that how nature is giving us this particular rich material and the way we are getting people have struggled a lot basically you have two or three different types of katar Nick part because aluminum is within the structure of alumina silicates but it is not as a pure cationic form but you have potassium as the cation you have lithium as the cation but that particular salt this lithium mica we are not getting as the pure k3 salt or we are not getting it as the pure electra salt so whenever we are getting so nature is also getting this thing whether it is coming out from the volcanic source or some other sources initially it can have a molten thing the molten thing is basically crystallizing out with time and during the crystallization depending upon the availability of your potassium salt nearby or the lithium salt nearby it is crystallizing as KLI to sample kli to 3 plus the whole charge is 3 plus with it so that particular one neither Li 3 nor K 3 is forming not even k2 Li so this is the thing that you try to remember this in this fashion because you have to take this particular material where it is economically very feasible economically it is beneficial for isolation of your lithium metal from this particular material then we have another one is your pay delight pay delight is Li L one again si four or ten so this si four or ten business is similar to that of your this si for Odin business of lithium mica but is of different type because you don't have potassium then Amla go night and Luco night is again lithium aluminum only no potassium but again one is to one and all with these your lithium component is not very less not even very more it is four to seven percent of lithium it's pretty good amount of lithium is available and you not only get as the mineral from the earth grass but it can also be available from the different sort legs so the salty water of the lake material liquor can give rise to this particular material how we get that so lithium bearing or the lithium containing brine water that means the salt water which is coming out from the different salt lake sometimes we get those that the crystallized forms also from those salt lakes as the flakes salt flecks are also available so those salt flakes also you can have and you see that know where the country which are producing huge amount of this one or the extraction is visible is only us Chile Bolivia and Argentina not even the entire US some pockets always be there it is the state which is your otah and the Nevada so uttanapada is the place where you can have the corresponding amount of deposition of this particularly Thea material then again other places we can get that so lithium during this particular process the lithium precipitated out as poorly soluble lithium carbonate so if you grind it if you make it in the solubilized form and if you try to get that lithium ion which is a very small ion which in thousands of water that means within water it is always highly solvated because the salvation power is more in lithium compared to your sodium as well as potassium so highly solvated lithium ion you have and if you try to supply either in the term terms of alkaline supply of co2 or the addition of carbonate any other carbonate salt so what you get that that you can have the corresponding precipitate of poorly soluble lithium carbonate so you have highly soluble all these things highly soluble lithium mica or lithium any other alumina silicate in your hand so you grind it you make it powder you put water so lithium will be list out from the material and that material is very difficult to crystallize it if you think of that I will crystallize it as lithium chloride or I will crystallize it as lithium nitrate or I will crystallize it as lithium sulfate is not so easy so if you just quickly compare the solubility differences of all these lithium salts nicely you just select them your natural intense and unnatural intuition rather will tell you that it is the lithium carbonate which will be very much useful for you to give you the corresponding separation from this material as lithium carbonate so we have the lithium carbonate and how you make that particular one so from the or or the mineral you get the material as lithium carbonate now your condition is that how you get metallic lithium out of it so the best way of getting these like that of your sodium as well as potassium and all other alkali metal ions we all know you should go for the corresponding electrolytic technique and melt condition not in solution condition in solution condition otherwise you will end up with the electrolysis of water only so you get the melt and for increasing the conductance you add potassium chloride so you have a lithium chloride potassium chloride mixture and at a higher temperature say is always not very easy to make easy to do is four hundred to four hundred sixty degree centigrade in closed chamber in still cells with a graphite anode and steel cathode so two of the material for anode and cathode cell very much specific because that particular potential only those material can give you the required suspense surface for its removal that means for its oxidation or for its reduction of the particular material whether you are talking about the corresponding reduction of M plus that means Li plus or the corresponding oxidation of other part to at the other electrode and the cell voltage is also not very much it is only six to six point five volt and it is formed and collects on the surface of the molten salt electrolyte so on the molten salt electrodes if you have molten salt electrolyte you are electrolyzing that molten salt through the insertion of the electrodes and whatever lithium is forming that will be floating on the surface of the electrolyte so from the surface you can have some exit if you know the height of that particular surface above the electrolyte you can have the regular exist channel and through that exists channel you can take out that particular material for its isolation then we think of the typical uses because you have the or you get it as the corresponding electrolytic procedure and now how you use it particular one particularly the metallic one the metal in lithium so one of the most important material that we know from our school days once again in organic chemistry classes and everywhere we know that lithium aluminum hydride is a very good reducing agent and when we talk in terms of the corresponding material as your some lithium mica lithium aluminum silicate but it is not so easy to understand it that there is no procedure available to our still that whether that one containing both lithium as well as aluminium to convert it directly to lithium aluminum hydride through the supply of hydrogen gas or any other I dead material or any other hydrogen containing reagent it is not so easy so that way the chemistry process or the process chemistry is completely different even the reaction will not go for this particular reaction but we can think of that your raw material has both lithium and aluminum and your compound which is pretty costly the market has a huge demand the bigger chemical companies they are producing for the laboratory use also lithium aluminum hydride so we should go to some other ways that means you have to convert it to lithium hydride first that means this lithium whatever available as the metallic form of lithium will be converted to lithium hydride and luckily we should have some mechanism we should have some procedure or the industrial technique where the lithium metal can be converted to lithium hydride then we can have like potassium amide K in h2 we can have Li in h2 these are very useful reagent for organic transformations pharmaceutical industries any other industries and for the synthesis of any other organolithium compound so organolithium compounds we all know these are organometallic compounds and most of the organometallic compounds we all know like your grignard reagent which is the organ of magnesium compound we also study from our school days that organo magnesium compound what you can have that particular organo magnesium compound is useful for some good techniques similarly the corresponding organolithium compound even the methyl lithium if we consider that L IME so methyl lithium type of thing can be very useful organolithium compounds and sometimes these organolithium or some other modified compounds are also useful in as catalysts while you are making a very small compound of all these things if you require a certain amount of bulk industrial we are producing several tones we are producing but if we require only a small amount of this for the laboratory purpose for your drug making business or the pharmaceutical industry or the perfume industry or the food industry what you can think of that the consumption for the laboratory use definitely of a high-grade analytical reagent or the guaranteed reagent form your consumption is more what your value addition is more and more compared to your bulk material of lithium and lithium metal but if you move from that material for day-to-day laboratory use or the industrial laboratory use also industrial R&D use also you can go for the making these as that useful catalyst because the catalyst requirement very small amount only some milligrams kill some time it can go to nano gram scale also but it is a catalyst which is not changed after the reaction also so it is unchanged after the reaction also so in the polymerization reaction so the whole polymerization industries the polymer industries basically will be dependent on some of these lithium bearing compounds because if you have very useful organolithium compound can serve as a catalyst which you cannot get from your corresponding organo sodium or organo potassium or organo transition metal compound as I told you that it is a very useful one as lithium aluminum hydride l.h making so is their reducing agent in organic chemistry and also in refining of metal melts in metallurgy so when you use these as reducing agents and the refining industry also in the metallurgical industry already we are talking all the time that how you handle the metal by the metallurgical engineer so in metal melts in the metallurgy we use also the lithium for its regular supply then another useful important in applications is making of lithium as I told you that organolithium compound but it can be incorporated in alloy making also because these are very useful compounds the way we say that when we talk in terms of when we'll be talking in terms of your transition metal ion say palladium and part when we are talking about the corresponding diesel exhaust the NOS removal we have seen that also we can have the catalytic converter and those catalytic converters are only on very precious metals like palladium like platinum like iridium like rhodium but lithium is not so costly because we are using we have started using we are still using the lithium-ion batteries and if you have the magnesium so the lithium magnesium alloys magnesium is a very lighter element lithium is also very lighter one but individually their characters are different but when you go for making this corresponding alloy of lithium magnesium you get a new product or new alloy material which can find a very useful application in aerospace industry because is very lighter one so for making aircraft aircraft components and other thing such that in a lighter way that means your things should not be heavy even if you make a motor even if you make a window even if you make a some structure you can use this because the lighter one so aerospace industry is very much dependent on this sort of alloy and people are also working on it how we can improve the corresponding allowing nature by using some other third metal ion or metal center for allowing process or improving the corresponding composition or the process it is also very much useful or very much applicable for nuclear application also while we make nuclear weapons manufacturing because if it is not very much destructive one and if it is highly resistant for all the different types of nuclear reactions that means Neutron bombardment gamma bombardment alpha particle burns and if it is at the typical resistance we can use it in nuclear technology and the thing what we are talking in terms of its making the lithium batteries it is functioning as an anode so making these batteries as the anode material with a high energy density because these are the typical characteristics when people are working on the electrical engineers are working then others the energy engineering is another branch of engineering because we are having sorted of the fossil fuels that means the coal is limited the oil is limited many other thing the solar cell also doesn't have that much applicability so we can go for all these things that means the lithium-ion bearing batteries and high energy density and long-term stability it is stable because you can use it for several years that is also very important so these two component high energy density and long-term stability of the lithium metal makes this very useful material for giving you the lithium ion based batteries so that is again a huge area if you are interested you can read it you can also learn it that how only that one particular metal ion which we know that how we can get it starting from your or material starting from your minerals starting from your lithium metal to get that particular lithium ion batteries now we like that of your lithium aluminum hydride what other lithium compounds we can have but most importantly those are lithium carbonate lithium hydroxide already I told you how you get the lithium hydride and lithium chloride the chloride salts always very much useful the first one how we make it and how we get it we should start from Purdue mean again so the kal science Purdue mean that means is the heated and you have the corresponding breaking and making the powder of this thing so enriched material or in this mineral what we call it as the enrichment in terms of the corresponding lithium percentage then is digested with concentrated sulfuric acid sulfuric acid is needed so concentrated high sulfuric acid which is highly corrosive one so will basically break the corresponding microstructure or corresponding alumina silicate structure in the spore domain and whatever inert material as it's an ionic part was there are only idea is that in acidic medium we should take out that particular lithium from there as the corresponding lithium ion so a high temperature is also applied so as the high temperature reaction so it is basically list with water and finally reacted with sodium carbonate so lithium is taken away through this particular procedure and taking of that particularly theum from that material is next is used for its reaction with sodium carbonate because the sodium carbonate reaction will give you directly the your lithium carbonate formation so this particularly theum carbonate if you make that lithium carbonate has huge application in different areas is for aluminium manufacture so manufacturing of aluminium is also dependent because sometimes it is the ingredient for aluminium production from bauxite then glass making then enamel ceramic industries and the medicine also because small amount of lithium can help as a medicine also because the neurodegenerative problem or the bipolar problem people have started using this one but we should not forget something that historically this particular material the lithium carbonate is functioning as the medicine and we are using say hundred years back or 75 years back now it has been discontinued because we find that it has can have certain disadvantages certain side reactions and it is may be harmful for some other organs of our life what you should know historically that how these molecule that means the small lithium center the lithium ion is useful when we know that we have in our body the corresponding channels of sodium as well as potassium whether that is hampering that or the signals the neural signals in our brain is governed by corresponding and potential of that different gradient of sodium and potassium whether those are affected by lithium so the traditional knowledge is useful you may not apply it for industrial production of lithium but future application and all these things are required your knowledge bits would be very high is not that the material what is you what is needed to know is for huge production and which has a huge demand in the market you may not know that the basic or the academic interest of all these things can have some future application so like that of your lithium which was present in your lithium mica or lithium aluminum silicate that also tells you that nature is accumulating that particular mica or the material with a lithium as its component so why not synthetically when we make or when we produce glass when you make enamel and when you make ceramic why you should not incorporate lithium that means lithium has some role definitely to play to improve the corresponding properties of this thing similarly lithium hydroxide from carbonate directly we know the inorganic chemical reaction so inorganic chemical reaction will tell you how quickly you can make lithium hydroxide so again from your knowledge sake from your query sake from your question sake what you should know that what are the materials if I ask you how lithium hydroxide can be prepared from a useful material or useful lithium compound and your choices are given so the right compound for this reaction is your lithium carbonate and why use calcium hydroxide you why you are not using other hydroxides also that you should ask yourself so you have a very standardized reaction which is known for the hundred or two hundred years and how you can lead that particular reaction for industrial production such that always you think of whenever you write a and B for a particular type of reaction why we are not thinking the other hydroxides why you are not thinking about the other carbonate materials or other lithium material for its production so industrially this particular one is important in the manufacture of greases well based thing which is nothing but your lithium sirits tear it is the long organic molecule we all know so that organic molecule when gives you the core owning lithium salt not the sodium salt because the sodium permitted sodium stearate we know the common household soap when it is lithium it is the thick one and it is the greasy material which is industrially very important then lithium hydride from the direct reaction of your lithium and hydrogen can be obtained at a very high temperature say 700 degree centigrade you have a direct reaction of lithium with hydrogen giving you lithium hydride which will be utilized for making your lithium aluminum hydride as well so getting this lithium hydride is very important and that lithium iodide for the production of lithium hydride is also very important so it is a is important source of hydrogen as a reducing agent in organic synthesis so directly either lithium hydride you use or you convert it to lithium aluminum hydride because it's very easy to use is a very user-friendly also because lithium hydride storing up the material in the laboratory storing of the laboratory and the material in the industrial sector is also very difficult so it's self life we call how long you can keep in the laboratory cells how can you can keep in the laboratory cupboard so that is also very important because the day you purchase within the next seven days you are not consuming the whole material that's why it gives stability compared to your lithium hydride to make or convert it to lithium aluminum hydride so we'll continue our in our next class that how we can finish this lithium and any other useful metal centers or the metal ions and there is full compounds okay thank you very much
