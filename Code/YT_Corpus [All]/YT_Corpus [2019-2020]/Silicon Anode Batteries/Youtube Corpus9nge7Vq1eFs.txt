 Good day everyone today, the video will be about how 15 years ago I managed to save 4 teeth, exactly the four lower incisors that, as it turned out, got sick, the doctor said that they are staggering, this is periodontal disease, in short, get ready that they will soon fall out by themselves and have to put dentures well now not 60 years means in my life I lost only four teeth were not these four incisors about which we will talk about completely different teeth in general, the rest of my teeth are mine and how I managed to save these incisors, I'm now telling you I'm going home from the doctor all in sadness I go into the staircase I look in the mailbox newspaper well I have been subscribing it for a long time here are how many of them you see, in short, it was the twenty-third issue of 2004, well, I came and cut it not these newspapers were so done that I had to cut each piece of paper, so I cut it I start flipping it look that there's new and brought here on page 7 bumping into this circuitry but since I worked in radio before I was interested in it because oh and I see what it means a recipe for the treatment of parodanthosis using electrophoresis, but in order to further understand what will be discussed, please take a freeze frame, stop the video and read this recipe, and this is what I got according to that scheme and the description I will now tell you in more detail for she needed such a 4 millimeter bar of copper wire I didn't have it at home, so I replaced it with a spare tip of 40 watts new soldering iron one end of the creeps as it was said in the description for the second I soldered the wire, I didn't twist it because the connection needs to be done rather reliably and so that the currents here are very small for a long time, a crocodile clip is soldered to the second end of the wire, which means it closes here instead of soldering with such an improvised cap it is made of ballpoint pens well worn now as for the cathode the aluminum plate is made of a protractor at the school wire is not soldered but screwed with using a steel bolt and nut by means of an aluminum washer I would also make a washer myself from a children's aluminum designer, in general, the connection is quite reliable wire, though preliminary, but I used solder so that there was no oxidation, since copper and aluminum are incompatible on an aluminum plate, and so that it does not unwind, I fixed it with a regular thread as for the battery they still have such sales, you can even look on the Internet to see two wires soldered here, the blue one is minus the red one plus the wiring you need to solder different lengths so that during the storage operation they do not interconnect if you do not find such a battery you can use this container of three batteries find from a pocket flashlight and also solder the wiring, plus or minus, and it will also work well before use, it is imperative to check the performance of the battery and it is better to do this not with the help of devices, but with the help of a load on about such a flashlight, a diode battery is working properly and I want to use it a little praise the Chinese, they usually scold them, they praise this battery for 8 years, but it is still workable, so look at the label in an enlarged form, I'm not cheating, let's go back a little to the positive electrode or anode, and in order to prevent the analysis from getting between the copper, I wound this plastic tube electrical tape where now the penetration of moisture there is excluded, and at the end of this electrode I make such a silicone cap, first I will tell you where to get it sold in the pharmacy, these are silicone nipples for children that just fit from and cut off this part, make a hole a little larger and put it on this electrode and so that the cap does not slip during operation, we will also fix it with electrical tape, tighten it tighter so that it is stronger like this, we wind cotton wool on the copper electrode like this if we treat the teeth and gums of the internal cavity of the mouth, then this silicone cap remains in this inverted form when we treat the front teeth and gums this cap is necessary like this with to do that is to close the cotton wool so that there is no contact with the cotton wool soaked with the inner cavity of the lips, otherwise all drugs will not be consumed rationally it will go to the lips and not problem areas and now perhaps the most important moment for dental treatment we need an aqueous solution of potassium iodide five percent in the past, there were no problems with him, you could come to any pharmacy to order such a solution, and in two hours it will be ready now the pharmacy does not do this, therefore you need to buy somewhere to buy such a potassium iodide powder or potassium iodide, it is white crystalline, it looks a little for unrefined sugar where to buy it in stores it is not, but on the Internet I sell and sell in such quantities that it is not needed, that is, they sell several kilograms of it there, so somewhere you need to find here a small amount of potassium iodide where it is still used in developer when X-rays show the film prize yet surely it is in the sun ex Physiokabinet and where do electrophoresis, that is, I poked dice in solutions for electrophoresis, it is used not only for dental problems, but also for other water types of electrophoresis treatment, so if you want, you can find how to make a solution very simply for 5 grams of potassium iodide you need 100 grams of water, you get 5 percent solution if there are no such exact scales that can measure 5 grand take 50 grams of potassium iodide and dilute in a liter of water we get a 5 percent solution of course this solution will be a lot of a whole liter well what to do if there are no forests, that is, such a solution will not work out of it and the water for the solution should be distilled boiled raw water from the tap spring rain will not go to the water there should not be any impurities only distilled water observing the polarity we connect the battery wires minus and this is plus we wet the cathode this is the negative electrode with water with ordinary boiled chilled water pour the stack a little iodide solution potassium about three s a thick spoon of this amount is quite enough for one procedure in a five percent solution and potassium iodide which we poured into this pile we will moisten the positive electrode of the matchmakers, that is, in no case, do not wet the electrode in the dish in which the solution is prepared , that is, if we will lower the dirty electrode there, then it will quickly become unusable, therefore we always pour a small amount for the procedure into a separate container with the help of two bank rubber bands, fix this way the negative electrode on the forearm or the cathode moistened once again I repeat with ordinary cold boiled water the last thing to do before the procedure is to moisten cotton wool on the positive electrode in a solution of potassium iodide, lower it and hold it for 15-20 seconds no more, and now we sit comfortably and begin to treat our teeth, apply this electron salads to problem areas, a slight tingling sensation, tingling, there is no discomfort, and now let's measure the current first measure the current that occurs between the cathode and the anode with direct contact , my device is set at 20 milliamperes, I close more than 20 milliamperes, I rearrange the measurement limit to 200 milliamperes, I close it again, well, the current has been established within 25 milliamperes, and now we will measure the current that passes through a person with this type of electrophoresis the electrode on my hand I set the measurement limit again at 20 milliamperes because the current will probably be small and I apply the anode where sleep and teeth as we see the current is very small, only one milliampere, that is, for a person, there is no danger of one procedure time is 10-15 minutes of procedures per day you need to do 2, that is, in the morning and in the evening, and the general course of treatment is from five to ten days after each procedure, the electrodes, especially this positive one, must be very carefully treated with alcohol, or at least rinsed with dead water, the tarnished electrode at the end of the course of treatment can be restored with an eraser, that is having lost this email The ectron with an elastic band restores its shine; the device is strictly individual; we don’t give it to anyone so as not to get infected with hepatitis, and in conclusion I want to thank Dr. Naumov for an excellent recipe that helped me for sure helped many others and wish everyone good luck and health bye
