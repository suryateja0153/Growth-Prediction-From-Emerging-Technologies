 If you want to create an electronics  project you can follow this video A diode is a semiconductor device that essentially  act as a one-way switch for current a diode is   a specialist electronics component with two  electrodes called the anode and the cathode A capacitor is a device that  stores electrical energy   in an electric field it is a positive  electric component with two terminals Resistance is the measures of the  opposition to circuit follow in   an electrical circuit resistance is measured  in ohms symbolized by the greek letter omega An inductor also called a coil choke or reactor is  a positive two terminal electrical component that   stores energy in a magnetic field when electric  current follow through it a transistor is a device   that regulates current or voltage flow and acts as  a switch or gate for electronic signal transistor   consists of three layers of semiconductor  material each capable of carrying a current An integrated circuit or ic is small chips  that can function as an amplifier oscillator   timer microprocessor or even computer memory  an ic is a small wipe usually made of silicon   that can hold any wire from 1000 to millions  of transistor resistor and capacitors Transformers and inductors are important  components in power electronic converters   they are used for energy stores filtering  and transformation of voltage and current A speaker is someone who delivers a speech  or a device that makes sounds loader speaker   has a few different magnets from the  person who address a group to the speech   of equipment that amplifies sound to someone  who is fluent in a particular language   a battery is a device consisting of one or more  electrochemical cells with external conditions of   powering electrical device feature flat  light mobile phone and electric cars In electronics and electronics which is an  electronic component or device that can switch   an electrical circuit interrupting the current  or driving it from one conductor to another   thanks for watching this video don't  forget to subscribe share like and comment.
