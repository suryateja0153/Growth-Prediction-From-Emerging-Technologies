 Hi and welcome to my channel in this video I will show you how to make a solar panel that you can use to charge the power bank phone or to make a solar floodlights When the silicon layer is exposed to light then the electrons from the material agitate in an electric current will be generated a Solar cell has a thickness of between 0.001 and 0.2 millimeters For this the cells are encapsulated in panels that give a mechanical and weather resistance I will use an old photo frame with dimensions 315 and 215 millimeters The single cell current is small by the serial or parallel combinations of these cells can produce currents large enough for use I will use 24 polycrystalline solar panel with the dimension 52 and 52 millimeters current 0.86 amp and voltage 0.5 volts wire conductor which has a thin layer of fluid on its surface to achieve cell bonding and Flux in for the surface pickling of the cell To not damage the cells I will use protective gloves Don't forget like and subscribe I Cut several pieces of conductive wire to the desired size I Clean the contact points on the cathode with the resin and I made the soldering at all cells on the side with the negative cathode The photosensitive part is the cathode - and the light shielded part is the anode + In series the cells will be stuck together as follows the cathode of the first cell will be joined to the anode of the next cell and so on as a knee above drawing I Start with the same steps by pickling up the cells But this time it is at the positive anode I will use a right bar to better guide the bindings and fix the cell better Finally, I will make six columns of four cells in series I Place the sell strings in the photo frame and to give a small voltage into higher amperage I will connect two columns in parallel and then I will tie them in series I Chose six volts with 1.7 2m for a simple reason is a somewhat normal voltage to charge a power bank a phone or using the solar floodlights To set the voltage I will use a load regulating circuit a mini voltage controller with USB output which converts from 6 to 20 volts to 5 volts and 2 amps When the silicon layer is exposed to light an electron will agitate the material in an electric current will be generated Thank you for watching and do not forget like and subscribe
