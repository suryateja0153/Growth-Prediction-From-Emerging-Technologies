 00:00 Oh Dan here I'm on top of my terrifying 00:05 [Music] 00:20 [Music] 00:37 now we're digging up the earth digging 00:41 up radioactive minerals with draining 00:43 our aquifers to get these salts that we 00:47 can get lithium out of and we're all 00:50 making the same mistake all over again 00:51 and so I've put together some 00:54 documentaries and some facts that I wish 00:57 people would look into before they get 01:00 all excited about this allegedly new 01:03 technology it's not there's much newer 01:06 technology much cleaner much more 01:08 affordable and much more available 01:10 the problem is corporations can't make 01:13 as much money with them and that's one 01:25 of the scariest things about lithium-ion 01:27 it's so rare that we're gonna be right 01:30 into Wars again fighting over it and I'm 01:32 gonna start giving you some examples 01:33 here's one mine is in rural the county 01:46 about 30 miles west of Goldfield Paul 01:48 Nelson shows us the process 01:53 so so what so what do you think is gonna 02:01 happen you know when lifting stressful 02:04 and low as it is already the demand way 02:07 outweighs the availability 02:09 we're in Bolivia trying to get them to 02:11 sell it to us Bolivia Bolivia has 02:13 refused they want 50% of the profits 02:15 they're not letting corporate America 02:17 come in there what makes people think 02:20 this isn't just gonna become the new oil 02:22 it's terrifying this is a documentary 02:27 about Bolivia's battle to try and remain 02:31 independent and they've been refusing 02:34 corporate America's you know bids for 02:37 their for their salt flats to mine 02:40 lithium it's the beginning of more Wars 02:43 and more problems because the element is 02:46 so rare there's so few places on earth I 02:48 don't understand why all the people that 02:52 are looking for a really good batteries 02:53 aren't considering that they're doing 02:55 exactly what they did with oil 02:57 lithium win it when the batteries go 03:00 dead less than 50 percent can be 03:03 recycled they they have to smelt it down 03:05 and you get a 50% loss it's not even 03:07 recyclable and it's unlimited supply why 03:10 do you think they're going after it you 03:13 know that there's over a trillion 03:14 dollars in lithium right here in these 03:17 flats and what do you think this is all 03:21 about just like oil if they can market 03:23 it and make a huge profit they will and 03:26 that's why you don't hear about the 03:27 saltwater battery you know you don't 03:29 hear you know about the the cadmium 03:31 batteries you don't hear about all the 03:33 batteries that you can make in your own 03:34 backyard because they can't make any 03:37 money off of it 03:38 and if they're making money soon they'll 03:40 make war a little continuation of the 03:44 the Channel 2 News 03:45 just listen to what's being said 03:48 [Applause] 03:56 we know how to extract a very highly 04:02 valuable specialty material six thousand 04:05 metric tons of lithium can be produced 04:07 here each year and the demand is growing 04:09 is a reflection of Nevada's commitment 04:11 to emerging technologies to advanced 04:13 manufacturing and renewable energy 04:15 production and this is the mine that 04:17 produces the raw materials Mike that's 04:21 not what it's about 04:21 it's about money there are plenty of it 04:24 batteries that I'm not nearly as 04:26 profitable but you heard him saying that 04:27 it was very profitable 04:29 and people that think that lithium-ion 04:32 is a solution are just wrong 04:35 Tesla tried to get free power for 04:39 everyone and his funding was pulled by 04:40 the Rothschild when they realized 04:42 anybody would have had free power and 04:44 instead they invested in a marketing 04:48 scheme because it's all about money and 04:51 we're being fooled now to think that 04:53 lithium ion is the only thing that can 04:55 do the job and they will block it 04:57 monopolize and stop you know like the 05:00 saltwater battery they went bankrupt 05:03 you know why and look how they're doing 05:06 it okay so what you what you're hearing 05:24 them tell you is they're actually 05:27 draining our water aquifers from 05:29 underground to pull lithium ion out of 05:33 the basalt you know doesn't that alarm 05:36 you I mean if you're a farmer anywhere 05:38 you know in the United States you should 05:40 be very alarmed okay in this Bolivian a 05:44 documentary here the writing's on the 05:47 wall 05:47 listen it's already happening five years 05:50 Marella's as reporters centuries of 05:53 discrimination against the Indian 05:56 charity mining companies were often the 05:59 worst offenders I mean that their mother 06:02 won't be very nice yes company because 06:05 he cannot even what are the few days 06:07 ever Morales is a socialist if used a 06:11 Cuba's Fidel Castro as his role model 06:14 he's expelled the US ambassador forged 06:18 links with the Iranians and nationalized 06:20 private sector energy corporations as 06:26 models for is in Euros amidala see here 06:30 is a vita competitor 06:34 with many foreign surgeons desperate to 06:38 get into the Bolivian lithium market 06:40 ever morales has so far refused to sign 06:43 any deals but lithium is a strategic 06:47 asset the first world wants it there it 06:52 is 06:52 it's starting and if you can't see if 06:57 writing on the wall 06:59 just remember the Iraq war weapons of 07:01 mass destruction look and now he you 07:04 know he's a lying our enemies you know 07:06 and questionable figures in the world do 07:09 you think our politicians and our you 07:12 know corporate America won't come up 07:14 with some kind of crappy story to allow 07:16 us to invade and take control of another 07:18 nations lithium you know supply come on 07:22 people 07:22 wake up there's a somewhat scary reality 07:27 that a lot of people don't realize 07:30 another excuse just just like the Obama 07:35 had secured a nuclear pact with you know 07:40 in the Middle East which Trump is trying 07:42 to dissect anyhow listen to this intro I 07:46 just think lithium the world's largest 07:49 metal as a seemingly mystical range of 07:53 applications in its processed powdered 07:56 form lithium carbonate and powers 07:59 laptops and mobile is used as a drug to 08:03 treat 08:03 oppression and even build nuclear 08:05 weapons nuclear weapons a lot of people 08:13 aren't aware of that fact and therein 08:16 lies an opening we can start accusing 08:19 nations of refining lithium for warfare 08:23 scary stuff man 08:25 okay here's Australia all right they're 08:29 burning up they're breaking every record 08:31 they're drought they're in horrible way 08:34 and look at this beautiful scenario they 08:38 have and remarque here in the pill drop 08:40 and rich in minerals better known for 08:44 iron ore this region is also the heart 08:47 of Australia's rapidly expanding lithium 08:50 industry isn't that pretty you mine has 08:52 recently opened you with the aim of 08:54 becoming one of the biggest lithium 08:57 mines in the world 09:04 pictures to the opportunity for Western 09:07 Australia most of Australia's ten 09:09 hardrock lithium mines are in Western 09:11 Australia driven by a growing need for 09:14 lithium to feed an insatiable tech 09:17 sector demand is expanding there so 09:21 there's one of the world's producers at 09:23 this point and this is why lithium is so 09:26 expensive you know they chose a rare 09:31 earth chemical that is hard to come by 09:33 because they can charge a lot of money 09:35 for it so rich nations get richer and 09:38 they start to try and dominate 09:40 monopolize bribe and co her spor nations 09:44 you know like in bolivia to exploit 09:47 their lithium reserves and if people 09:51 can't see how dangerous this is and how 09:54 it's just like oil it's the new gold 09:57 it's all about money it's not about the 10:00 only better they can do the job this is 10:02 about money man so one of the main 10:06 drivers of the lithium ion craze is the 10:10 fact that we're at a 411 parks 10:13 millionth carbon then the climate change 10:15 is sparking this this new innovation 10:17 while there are many sources of really 10:20 abundant elements to make batteries out 10:22 of they're all being rejected by 10:24 corporate America in favor of a very 10:28 expensive and rare mini mineral lithium 10:31 okay and look at the machinery required 10:34 to do this task ripping up the earth 10:41 digging up these rocks and then smelting 10:44 it all down 10:46 [Applause] 10:51 let's continue 10:56 in Australian government is backing on 10:59 continuing demand felicium in the south 11:14 of wi four hundred million dollars has 11:17 been invested into a refinery to process 11:20 the metal in a bid to take advantage of 11:23 this potential boom only a producer of 11:25 lithium so 75% of the world's lithium 11:31 and they can't keep up the demand is 11:33 grilling and that's why third world 11:35 countries you know are being bribed 11:39 coerced and believe me where there's 11:43 money they will find a way to exploit 11:45 and take advantage of unwilling nations 11:47 to rip up their countryside and to 11:51 profit corporate America so corporate 11:53 America will do what it always does 11:55 it'll make up stories it'll bribe some 11:57 senators and congressmen and we'll find 12:00 a reason to go take it by force just 12:02 like we always have 12:05 so the United States and Nevada 12:07 we're draining our natural underground 12:09 aquifers to get it here they're doing it 12:12 differently raelia isn't the only 12:14 producer of lithium but we do things 12:17 differently here mining hardrock lithium 12:20 which is becoming a preferred source for 12:23 battery production that's why as Paul 12:25 Western Australia with each other really 12:28 the supply of some glycol battery 12:29 markets because we have a phenomenal 12:32 natural endowments of hardrock mineral 12:34 misfortunate which in turn contains 12:36 silver inside so can you say monopoly 12:41 and nobody's talk nobody's talking about 12:45 what happens to the lithium-ion battery 12:47 when it's dead when it's depleted so 12:53 here's an alternative technology for 12:55 stationary electrical storage this is 13:00 brilliant this side away guy Donald 13:03 Sadoway 13:04 brilliant man produced a liquid metal a 13:08 molten metal battery using you know 13:11 college students and none other than 13:14 Bill Gates watched some of the seminars 13:16 and came and invested millions into this 13:20 technology Bill Gates is no dummy what 13:23 we're talking about here is a battery 13:25 that never dies we're talking about 13:28 batteries that can you know one one 13:31 single factory liquid metal battery 13:34 powering and all of New York City safely 13:38 with no contaminants and this is a video 13:41 that people should watch if they think 13:43 that lithium lithium ion is so great 13:46 sure this isn't so portable but this is 13:49 the name of the documentary and there's 13:51 hundreds of them out there including the 13:53 saltwater battery I'll try and highlight 13:55 some of the important things that points 13:58 that he makes okay here he's starting to 14:01 lead into a simple fact that a lot of 14:03 people don't want to acknowledge you 14:05 everybody so fascinated with lithium ion 14:08 and they forget the obvious truth and 14:13 what you're looking at here is the 14:15 world's largest supply chain with zero 14:17 inventory and today's bread 14:24 so crazy we have generation capacity 14:27 sufficient to meet peak demand and peak 14:30 demand is about a third to half more 14:35 than average demand so you've got all 14:37 this capacity sitting there idle about 14:40 98% of the time if you had storage you 14:44 could shave off the peeps and you 14:45 wouldn't have to build new plants and so 14:48 they say well sounds like I've made a 14:51 compelling case for storage so why don't 14:53 we have it maybe it's because what just 14:55 the dummies go into electrochemistry is 14:58 that it no no it's because this is the 15:01 toughest problem how tough is it long 15:04 service lifetime forget your phone your 15:06 phone you toss it but every two years 15:08 anybody here have a 10 year old phone no 15:11 anybody have a 10 year old phone 15:13 somebody once said I do and I said if 15:16 you have the original battery of course 15:18 he doesn't have the original battery all 15:21 right so we have to have a battery in 15:24 the last decades not months decades safe 15:30 lithium-ion batteries catch fire it's a 15:33 single phone it's a bad day for a single 15:35 passenger on an airplane scares the rest 15:37 of us but you know so what it's just one 15:39 phone but imagine a battery the size of 15:42 this auditorium lithium behind it 15:45 catches fire it's spectacular 15:47 the training with the battery the 15:50 battery can power a hearing aid can't 15:52 power an electric car but this thing has 15:54 to do everything or else you're gonna 15:57 have different batteries for different 15:59 functions and that's gonna be really 16:00 crazy but this is what kills it has to 16:03 be super little cost how low it's not 16:05 battery versus battery so don't ask you 16:07 both little batteries or other stuff 16:09 none of them work don't work in this 16:12 application at the price point it's 16:15 battery versus combustion it's battery 16:18 versus gas its battery versus diesel 16:20 because hydrocarbons Vic with us and 16:23 heavily subsidized and deeply entrenched 16:26 by corporate interests that don't want 16:30 to just willingly go away and say we've 16:32 had our day 16:33 and it's great to see this zero 16:35 emissions generation they're kind of fun 16:38 okay so there are some points that 16:42 people don't want to look at what 16:44 happens to the left EMI and when it's 16:45 dead yeah you don't want to know okay 16:47 they're not recyclable we're lucky to 16:49 get 40 or 50 percent of the actual 16:52 original investment back out of it and 16:56 just like he just said the corporation's 16:58 you know that the fossil fuel industry 17:01 look at the fight they're putting up 17:02 they don't care that our planet really 17:04 is being destroyed they don't care as a 17:06 mass extinction going on mind money 17:08 rules everything and right now what 17:11 we're allowing to happen is these 17:14 big-money interests investing billions 17:16 of dollars in lithium-ion why because 17:20 it's rare because they can make a lot of 17:23 money off of it so it doesn't take much 17:28 personal research to realize that 17:31 lithium-ion is a bankroll I mean they're 17:35 they're gonna be just like our you know 17:39 in the in the United States the Federal 17:41 Reserve its cartel man and it's all 17:44 about making money and there's dozens 17:47 it's not scores of different battery 17:49 types that are non polluting with using 17:52 only very common elements that could be 17:55 built in every single nation because 17:57 they all have the elements and here he 18:00 puts it very plainly why lithium-ion is 18:03 really dumb the whole notion today we're 18:06 gonna ship and dig it up ship it all 18:08 over the world and wait a minute isn't 18:11 that exactly the opposite of what we're 18:13 trying to do so first of all you have to 18:20 confine your chemistry to earth abundant 18:22 elements so here's a chart it shows the 18:26 relative abundance of the elements in 18:29 the Earth's crust as a function of 18:31 atomic number and we see up here it's a 18:34 semi logarithmic plot so you see up here 18:37 the abundant elements there the low 18:40 atomic numbers and you see down here the 18:43 scarce elements they're typically the 18:46 atomic number and the mandate that I 18:53 gave to my students was the difference 18:56 between the abundant elements and the 18:58 scarce elements is 1 billion times 1 19:01 billion times so I told them if we're 19:04 going to build a battery that's going to 19:06 scale for grid level storage they're 19:08 forbidden to go to the lower part of the 19:10 periodic table I mean look at tellurium 19:13 tellurium it's about his earth-abundant 19:15 is gold I don't know why people work on 19:18 cadmium telluride solar cells I don't 19:21 care that they're more efficient there 19:23 isn't enough to learn him in the Earth's 19:25 crust to scale the only reason he would 19:28 work on those was would be to learn 19:30 something fundamental but ultimately if 19:33 you're not if you're talking about 19:35 something that's going to change the 19:36 energy landscape you'd better be working 19:40 on something up here or else it's not 19:42 going to scale look silicon is what we 19:45 make us a photo voltaic sauter silicon 19:49 is why it's the second most abundant 19:51 element here's crust that's why 19:52 everybody here has one of these in his 19:54 or her pocket if the semiconductor were 19:58 made at a rhodium nobody would have one 20:01 right oh by the way I got to tell you 20:07 because you you'll understand this you 20:09 know that expression connect the dots 20:12 you know it's the business school the 20:15 business you know we're gonna connect 20:16 the dots you really you're gonna connect 20:18 the dots all right well let's look at 20:20 this lithium is atomic number three 20:23 beryllium is atomic number four this is 20:26 from a government publication by the way 20:28 why would you connect lithium to 20:31 beryllium do you know of anything that 20:33 has an atomic number at 3.4 even if you 20:36 made a beryllium lithium alloy all of 20:39 the lithium's are atomic number three 20:41 and all of the berlin's are atomic 20:43 number four 20:44 what does this mean what's crazier that 20:49 somebody drafted this or that somebody 20:51 published it and hasn't been taken down 20:54 it's still out there this is from the US 20:58 Department of Energy I called the 21:02 Department of entropy but so I say if 21:10 you want to make some dirt cheap you 21:11 should make it out of dirt and 21:12 preferably dirt it's locally sourced 21:16 because it doesn't make sense to trade 21:17 your dependence on imported petroleum 21:19 for dependence on imported neodymium and 21:24 and there there's what the valid point 21:26 is all of us people who are building 21:30 solar arrays are trying to produce 21:32 energy or getting the grid clean put 21:33 some storage into the grid so that we 21:35 can run much more efficiently already to 21:38 buy into this extremely rare earth 21:40 element that gets shipped all over and 21:42 controlled by massive corporate 21:43 corporations whose only you know 21:46 objective is to make profit when you can 21:49 literally go dig up the minerals in your 21:52 own yard and create your own batteries 21:54 that's what he's telling us right here 22:01 so I say if you want to make some dirt 22:03 cheap you should make it out of dirt and 22:05 preferably dirt that's locally sourced 22:08 because it doesn't make sense to trade 22:10 your dependence on imported petroleum 22:12 for dependence on imported neodymium no 22:15 instead of burning oil we're we're 22:19 importing neodymium from China money's 22:23 going out of the country either way to 22:25 make it easy to manufacture design at 22:28 the discovery stage has to be primitive 22:30 and easy to build why do they call it 22:32 the Giga Factory 22:33 it costs five Giga dollars five billion 22:37 dollars to build that stupid battery 22:39 plant in Nevada you know what I could 22:43 build for five billion dollars two not 22:45 one but two integrated steel works each 22:48 producing two million tons of steel per 22:51 year instead I get one battery plant 22:54 that makes yesterday 22:56 lithium-ion cells that one eight six 22:59 five old and people say was ever cool 23:06 conceptual and by the way disregard to 23:10 conventional wisdom do not consult with 23:13 the incumbent and that goes for anything 23:17 I've never talked to any battery experts 23:20 if I did they tell me all of my 23:22 aspirations were foolish everything that 23:24 could have been tried has been tried 23:25 what I want to do won't work I looked 23:28 outside the field like disregarded 23:30 conventional wisdom so I looked for 23:32 inspiration outside to feel my other 23:34 area of research what I've been doing at 23:36 MIT for the first twenty five years was 23:38 working on electrolytic production of 23:40 metal so I looked to an aluminium 23:43 smelter there's a part at the end I'll 23:46 have something that's big and cheap 23:49 everybody else is trying to figure out 23:51 how do I take this little stupid thing 23:52 and make it big and I'm saying this 23:54 thing's already big and it traffic's and 23:56 current just teach at the store you see 23:59 if that's the different way to pose the 24:01 question biology there it is the liquid 24:05 metal battery so it's got three liquid 24:08 layers and top layer is a low density 24:10 okay just to summarize look at that 24:13 basic design but he's talking about as 24:15 he purchased an aluminum factory it runs 24:18 on pure electric at four volts you know 24:23 hundreds of thousands of amperes he uses 24:26 those different metals in lava form in 24:30 the smelts them down there are different 24:33 atomic weights naturally separate just 24:35 like you know vegetable oil and water 24:37 and in between in the middle is a molten 24:41 salt brine and this is the liquid metal 24:45 battery it's all insulated runs on low 24:48 voltage and stores 24:49 phenomenal amounts of energy for use on 24:54 the fly with a lifespan beyond that of 24:58 us meet mere mortals this is the future 25:02 non polluting all of Earth's most common 25:06 elements 25:08 we could do a lot better than lithium 25:11 ion lithium ion is a scam to make money 25:15 and for right now it seems you know 25:17 pretty awesome 25:18 why because bankers are not gonna fund a 25:22 battery that lasts forever now on to his 25:28 brief description of how it works it's 25:34 got three liquid layers the top layer is 25:36 a low density electropositive model the 25:39 first embodiment was magnesium on top 25:41 and then the opposite that so that's a 25:45 really good metal a really good electron 25:47 donor and then I want to put it against 25:49 a really bad metal but not a nonmetal 25:52 because it has to be electronically 25:54 conductive otherwise things get really 25:56 messy so I want to have the best metal 25:59 against the worst metal I gives me the 26:00 voltage it's the worst battle is down 26:02 it's on a semi ballot so I put antimony 26:05 and and in between I got a molten salt 26:07 electrolyte that's my temperature 26:10 can't use aqueous but mercifully 26:13 magnesium is insoluble in the salt the 26:16 salt is insoluble in antimony 26:18 that they stratified just like the salad 26:20 oil and vinegar all you know you've got 26:22 three layers we can make a demo we can 26:25 put salad oil vinegar and mercury have 26:27 three layers sort of that up and I don't 26:33 need any membranes no separators and so 26:36 what happens is that on discharge the 26:39 magnesium wants to alloy with the animal 26:41 tea but the magnesium is insoluble the 26:43 salt is a big DZ becomes magnesium ion 26:46 the magnesium ions and go through the 26:47 salt 26:48 and then the electron goes through the 26:50 external circuit where does work and 26:51 down here at recombine so the top layer 26:54 gets thinner and the bottom layer gets 26:56 deeper and then to charge we force 27:00 current through an electoral reflowing 27:03 back so the magnesium goes back to the 27:06 top and restore the top layer purify the 27:09 magnesium purify the salt purify the 27:11 animal 27:12 battery its pristine conditions now as 27:14 the current flows on either on discharge 27:17 or uncharged it generates heat and 27:19 that's a threat and lithium-ion battery 27:21 here we take that threat and we turn it 27:24 into a attribute we trap that heat so 27:27 imagine four hours discharge generate 27:30 the heat six or eight hours at some 27:33 point later in the day for hours charge 27:36 was rest with that kind of daily cycling 27:40 you can keep this thing at temperature 27:46 so you hear what he's talking about he's 27:50 talking about something that never dies 27:52 you know it's a liquid it's completely 27:55 pure and anyway that is the future of 28:00 mass battery storage for our electrical 28:03 grid very few people know about the 28:09 technology that came out a couple years 28:10 back very promising for you know solar 28:15 and wind arrays phenomena of storage 28:18 capacity but they're big and bulky 28:20 they're not ideal for for electric 28:22 vehicles but they blow away anything as 28:26 far as cost efficiency and availability 28:29 you know in the actual elements to 28:32 create the battery so just just a quick 28:34 listen in if you've never heard of a 28:36 saltwater battery really cool battery 28:39 technology that uses saltwater these are 28:42 also called aqueous hybrid ion batteries 28:45 or sodium ion batteries although there's 28:47 a few differences either way all of 28:49 these battery types use concentrated 28:51 saline solution as the electrolyte this 28:54 is a very new technology that has only 28:56 been around for a few years in 2008 dr. 29:00 J Whittaker from Carnegie Mellon 29:02 University created a company called 29:04 aqueon energy with funding from Bill 29:07 Gates and a few venture capital firms 29:09 now isn't that funny 29:11 again Bill Gates is trying to fund 29:16 alternatives think about that you know 29:19 he's got a guilty conscience 29:21 but I really admire the fact that he is 29:25 actually funding alternatives to this 29:27 filthy you know lithium market that's 29:32 exploding you know multi-billion dollar 29:35 industry dr. Whitaker worked to perfect 29:41 his idea for a saltwater battery and in 29:44 September 2015 the company won a five 29:47 hundred thousand dollar prize for their 29:48 saltwater battery invention also in 2015 29:52 researchers not associated with aqueon 29:54 announced a sodium ion battery in the 18 29:57 650 format the remarkable thing about 30:00 this announcement was they claimed it 30:01 had similar energy density to lithium 30:04 iron phosphate batteries so what's so 30:06 great about this battery technology well 30:08 for one thing it's not flammable like 30:10 lithium ion another benefit is these 30:13 batteries are very easily recyclable and 30:15 eco-friendly 30:18 that is what we need to think about this 30:22 whole battery craze and the electric 30:24 cars and all that come on people 30:26 lithium ion is oil it's a filthy nasty 30:31 radioactive rare earth element we can do 30:35 better I also should mention that some 30:40 of the original developers of the the 30:42 blue batteries a saltwater battery have 30:44 reported bankruptcy and there's been no 30:47 I've been looking for details on it but 30:50 take a wild guess I mean just like Tesla 30:55 was blown out of the water and his 30:57 funding was cut off because of his 30:59 beautiful vision of free energy to 31:00 everyone the same thing is happening to 31:03 any company that wants to challenge the 31:06 billion-dollar industry that is becoming 31:08 lithium ion or trillions of dollar 31:11 industries anyway look at how simple 31:12 this thing is plentiful for example the 31:16 anode in aqueon saltwater battery is 31:18 made of carbon and the cathode is made 31:20 of manganese oxide both of those 31:23 materials are much cheaper and more 31:25 plentiful than lithium another benefit 31:27 is their affordability 31:28 according to dr. Whitaker of 31:30 battery the size of a dishwasher should 31:32 be able to power an average home 31:34 completely off the grid for between a 31:37 thousand and three thousand US dollars 31:39 that compares very favorably to a 31:41 competitive product like the tesla 31:43 powerwall which costs over five thousand 31:46 dollars and is not meant to power at 31:48 home completely by itself saltwater 31:50 batteries are also good for over 3000 31:53 cycles or almost 10 years of daily use 31:55 that puts them somewhere in between lead 31:58 acid batteries and lithium batteries for 32:00 longevity and finally these batteries 32:03 are very durable as they can handle a 32:05 wide temperature range and lots of 32:07 partial cycling unfortunately there's 32:09 one really big disadvantage the only 32:12 manufacturer of saltwater batteries 32:14 aqueon Energy has declared bankruptcy as 32:17 of March 2017 as of this video their 32:20 website is shut down so I'm a 52 year 32:26 old man and I've watched the United 32:29 States do some strange things namely 32:34 whatever it takes to make money and to 32:37 keep the corporation's going and how 32:40 much would it take to buy off a company 32:43 that was gonna be your competitor 32:45 billion two billion three billion 32:49 there's no way beyond went bankrupt with 32:53 a battery that's made out of nickel and 32:55 stainless steel and saltwater no they 32:59 were paid to shut up 33:01 and let the lithium ion bankroll the 33:04 world so to close out and conclude this 33:12 here's another little heartfelt video QB 33:15 to title I would encourage people to 33:18 look into lithium ion before you jump on 33:20 the bandwagon anyway and nearly 13,000 33:26 feet above sea level not much grows up 33:28 here in the thin air of the salt flats 33:30 in Northwest Argentina but underneath 33:32 this ancient desert lies vast reserves 33:34 of lithium metal it's an essential 33:36 ingredient for the batteries of 33:38 our phones laptops increasingly aircars 33:41 and since 2013 when Tesla announced 33:44 plans to build a massive Giga factory 33:46 Nevada demand for the mineral has 33:48 skyrocketed to watch the post 33:50 investigation which shows that his 33:52 mining companies race to tap Argentina's 33:53 living we need to live along himself 33:55 let's Maine lose out on the well created 33:57 by this new gold rush the res so as 34:03 usual the rich will devour everything 34:08 globally to make a profit and that 34:12 breaks my heart it means that we haven't 34:14 learned a thing I mean we practically 34:17 destroyed I mean we don't know how 34:18 severe climate change is gonna be before 34:21 we finally get alternatives to fossil 34:23 fuels but boy we rushed into that 34:25 headlong and now for thousands of years 34:28 inhabitants of this planet will be you 34:31 know paying the price and that just it 34:33 breaks my heart 34:36 so our corporations have managed to 34:39 secure somebody else two different 34:43 countries land for mining here's a 34:46 little quick this is one of the two 34:50 lithium is currently operating in 34:51 Argentina the salt of who who we plant 34:54 open in 2015 the first new lithium Brian 34:57 plant anywhere in the world in the last 34:59 two decades so there it is it's starting 35:06 as a as a person that lives in America 35:11 you know we're we're like this really 35:15 bloodthirsty warrior race that like 35:17 attacked our our bankers and created the 35:22 United States of America at the horrible 35:24 war we enslaved people we we go to China 35:28 and use their sweatshops to produce our 35:31 goods even at the expense of our own 35:32 people here our capitalistic views don't 35:37 have a cost 35:38 it's they we don't seem to care who we 35:40 hurt and those of us that are bearing 35:43 the fruits of this like I'm sitting here 35:45 my computers are on air conditioning is 35:47 on all using solar that was produced in 35:51 China cheap labor and running a GM's you 35:54 know from from China what a hypocrite I 35:56 am you know but what can I do and one 36:01 thing I can do right now for sure is 36:03 tell you that 36:04 lithium-ion it's just another bankroll 36:07 and it's just another way for them to 36:10 maximize profits that's what it's about 36:13 you know we have all kinds of clean 36:15 options we have options that don't 36:16 invade other countries we have options 36:18 which we could do it locally you know 36:21 every every state can have their own 36:23 battery production system out of local 36:25 minerals you know and and I just hope 36:28 people that are you know considering 36:30 getting lithium-ion at least look into 36:33 it at least you know for an automobile 36:36 or something like that it's lightweight 36:37 yeah we can see the practicality in that 36:40 but for God's sakes let's limit it to 36:41 that at least for now until they come up 36:43 with a better alternative for a 36:45 homestead you know you turn your solar 36:48 array on your property you don't need a 36:49 lightweight battery you don't need a 36:52 radioactive combustion you know the 36:54 lightest metal on the planet and you 36:56 certainly don't need to our corporations 36:59 and bureaucracy to raid other nations in 37:02 the name of profit using our military 37:04 and economic might because it's always 37:08 the helpless that suffer so that we can 37:11 you know live like kings and I feel 37:14 wrong about that
