 OK. Now lithium is melted and reactor is red and hot. So lithium is ready for absorption of CO2 made of carbonate. We should close this vacuum valve. switch Off vacuum pump and insert the reactor to the deepest  position. Control if it is cooled by water. And now we may go for walk or for tea and we have about half of hour free.
