 good afternoon everyone and thank you all for coming to today's seminar so it is my pleasure to introduce our speaker today professor Juliet career and actually welcome her back to MIT campus she did her undergrad here in a chemical engineering department and after that went to Stanford for PhD and after a few years at Intel and Parc joined Cal Tech faculty in 2007 and since then she's been at Cal Tech so professor Curry's research focuses on design fabrication and characterization of classes of materials with multi scale micro structural hierarchy that combines three-dimensional architectures with nano scale properties to lead to many unique applications both scientifically and also with many technological applications so her outstanding career and research contributions have been recognized by many prestigious awards and honors I'm just going to name a few of them here she's been the recipient of the 2018 heger Award she's also been named Vannevar Bush faculty fellow by the Department of Defense and one of CNN's 2020 visionaries professor Greer is a director of the Kavli nanoscience Institute at Cal Tech and also serves as associated associated associate editor for nano letters and extreme mechanic's letters what is very interesting to know is that beside her outstanding career in research julia is also a concert pianist and really very very well accomplished in that area as well so it is our pleasure to have Julia here with us today and we're excited to learn more about her research in three dimensional architected metal materials well a huge thanks to all of you for coming a huge thanks to Fonda's for inviting me here and a huge thanks to all of you for being here it's always such a special feeling to return back to my alma mater like I'm going through all the same quarters like this used to be my life and now I'm gonna call you crazy so I'd like I usually like to keep my seminars interactive so please don't wait to ask your questions please ask me as we go all right all right let's begin so you've been staring at this title for some time now materials by design so perhaps that part makes some sense to you and then you look at the second button that says chemically derived three-dimensional nano architectures kind of maybe wondering like I think I know what each one of these words means individually but why they belong in the same sentence might be a little less obvious so the goal for my talk today is it that to convey to you why they do belong in the same sentence so imagine a situation like this I suspect many of you're familiar with this you go to the store and you get all these things that you absolutely need to get and the bags are just not quite strong enough for that and this is not the only example from the wineglass that never makes it to the toes to the helium-filled balloons that pop all too easily to the have four children situation so these are all examples of materials that are lightweight and because they're lightweight they're very easy to damage and to tear turn on them on you okay how about now is this working can you guys hear me everybody I've never been accused of being too quiet alright okay so these materials are a lightweight and because they're light they're easy to damage and to tear so let's look at the opposite end of the spectrum let's look at the materials we know to be strong and we know what to trust so here's I am particularly intimately familiar with one of these but many of you travel of course right so Boeing 747 weighs nearly a million pounds so when you do our back of the envelope calculation at five gallons a mile for about two dollars per gallon my trip here should have cost about thirty thousand dollars so thank you very much for reimbursing me so this tremendous expenditure in the airline industry comes of course from the fuel that's required to propel such a heavy machine so the air and of course the Dreamliner is already you reduced the weight by about fifty percent and that's what enables it to do some some serious fuel cost savings now another example of materials that are specialized they serve a particular function a solar cell we know in California we have a lot more of the fuel for the solar solar cells so you imagine if either one of these falls off the roof accidentally slip stops this can be bad news of course for everyone so these are single crystalline silicon so very brittle material rate so this would be bad a bad situation so speaking of materials that are too heavy remember how in the last decade we were discussing this concept of space elevator well as far as I know there still isn't one and the reason for all of these problems is this this is a busy plot so what I'm choosing will all walk you through this what I'm choosing to plot here is the strength but it can be any other mechanical attribute so if you plot the mechanical resilience of some sort as a function of density what you see is that there's these colorful domains of all the material classes that we know today so the picture that emerges right away is that we're very good at making materials that are simultaneously strong and heavy or simultaneously lightweight in weak but we're not so good at is making materials that are very very lightweight but also mechanically resilient so how do we do that if everything we already know how to make today he's already plotted here how do we get into the so-called white space now this is a log-log plot so even a small increment within this space already represents a substantial change so the way we do this is by utilizing the concept of architecture in material design so when you look at the largest this is the largest stone man-made monument right so the Great Pyramid of Giza you can see it's it's very heavy it's very it stands about 150 meters tall and it weighs about six million tons that's very very heavy weight so in contrast to the Eiffel Tower which stands twice as tall and uses a thousand times less material to construct it in this just as mechanically resilient and presumably used a lot fewer slaves to construct it so that's the idea so when we first began this research it was these nickel micro lattices and this was a collaboration with hrl now there's nothing special about this dandelion this is the world's most normal dandelion not the strongest aniline nothing and you can see that this nickel micro lattice is hardly perturbing it at all and in fact if I were to hold an micro lattice in one hand and a feather in the other and to release them at the same time that feather would fall down faster they're very very lightweight but what we're after is not just the light weight but it's the combination of the light weight in the mechanical strength and for that you have to go down three more orders of magnitude and dimensions to the nano scale and I believe this is what the unifying theme here is of all of you here is that you care about different nanoscale phenomena so what I'm showing you here is it possible to dim the lights by the board by the way is there is there just a separate yeah I'm showing I'm going to show a lot of SEM images and SEM images and so I think it might be better to dim these lights but anyways you can Oh perfect thank you is that too dark is that okay just don't fall asleep I'll try to keep the other way but I think this is a much better quality images so the first thing to show you is that we're not limited to periodicity so this is those of you who are fans of Doctor Who this is a micro TARDIS so it's about one ten thousandth of you hair diameter it's very small you could see the rest of these architectures that were made in our group are examples of cellular solids and so there's an obvious level of porosity that is immediate to see and that is that their cellular solids and so mostly they're comprised of air they're very open architectures the less obvious level of porosity here is that the beams the tubes that comprise these are the nanoscale building blocks that comprise these three-dimensional architectures are hollow and the wall thickness here can be on the order of 5 nanometers maybe 10 nanometers or something like that so when you look at these materials they embody every length scale from some nanometers to hundreds of nanometers to microns and then eventually hundreds of microns and eventually we'll scale them up to 2 meters someday sure so the largest dimension of these solids is just the wall thickness so when it sits on your hand it looks like a solid cloud that's sitting on your hand and you can see the versatility of these architectures so because of these different link scales that a single material embodies it's no longer possible to describe them from just a structural perspective or a materials perspective because of those length scales everything is coupled together and here's what I mean by that nearly all common metals exhibit size dependent properties so this is a so-called size effect when you look at the metals we're all familiar with so copper and nickel gold something like that and in their single crystalline form so no green boundaries so defects no problem but no grain boundaries what we we and many others have now demonstrated is that as you reduce their dimensions there are strength increases tremendously in a power loss fashion and what I mean by that is that if you take a chunk of gold which we know to be very malleable and you reduce its dimensions to about 200 nanometers it becomes as strong as steel so strong smaller in this case is stronger now take exactly the same metals and deposit them using a different technique using CVD using sputtering using all these wonderful tools that you will eventually populate your beautiful facility with and all of a sudden this effect is reversed all of a sudden the smaller becomes weaker it's a more modest-sized effect it's no longer in a log-log plot nevertheless it's real so what you start to realize is that it's the combination of the atomic level microstructure in the reduced dimensions of materials metals in this case they give rise to the two nobility in strength now the size effect is actually more powerful than that we all know glasses to be brittle materials right if you look at this special kind of glass so this is a metallic glass now the dimension here is about a 150 nanometers and you pull on it what is supposed to happen is that it'll shatter right so we all know the glass can't possibly be extended so watch what happens here and especially you look at this region right here so this is 150 nanometers I am at a glass and you can see it's forming a neck so it thinks it's a metal and in fact you can extend it by about a hundred percent before failure the last example I want to show you is the deformation of a single unit cell of a ceramic nano lattice so just a single unit cell now this is titanium nitride it's a very very brittle ceramic and you can see what's happening here each one of these beams is bending and if you were to calculate the Mises stress and then to extract the tensile component it exceeds 1.7 GPA no ceramic should be staying intact when you apply 1.7 GPA of tensile strength tensile stress to it in this particular material not only is it staying intact but it's doing that over many many many cycles without failure so the takeaway message here is this sometimes materials get stronger sometimes they become weaker and sometimes you can suppress brittle failure but all of these effects emerge only at the nanoscale so the question was can we somehow harness all of these beneficial sized effects the nano scale phenomena and proliferate them onto the three-dimensional architecture so that we can make large dimensioned materials that retain the nano sized properties and so just a few words about how we make these so we use a technique called two photon lithography and the instrument that does this is called nano scribe do you have a nano scrape here so how many of you have used a nano screen well I highly recommend it in case you don't the advantage here is that so in contrast to the UV lithography which I think as many of us are familiar with the light in a in the to funnel entire field of light is focused in a voxel in this voxel is submicron and it can be raster in space so in 3-dimensional space so in each individual femtosecond laser pulse now the constructive interference so exactly two photons gives rise to this type of resolution and then you can rest earth at that voxel in three dimensions to write whatever shape you want so there's no masks there's no periodicity this is why we're not limited to periodicity and complexity comes for free so I can write a nano vladimer in the same amount of time as I can write a nano cube so a very simple versus very complex here comes at the same amount of time which is not very fast but that's a separate challenge so when we write this scaffold we often write it in this kind of form so it could be periodic three-dimensional architecture but then this is made of a photo initiate able polymer resin so we're not gonna go and build airplanes out of polymers right so we then coated with a material we actually want in some parts of our research so do you have an atomic layer deposition system here how many of you are familiar with Ald okay so in the Ald community you know how they say oh we can deposit anything you want as long as it's alumina so here's some alumina Ald depositing conformally around these complex architectures and then what was so pay thinking lis written this entire scaffold can be etched out in what you're left with is a replica a hollow replica of what we had designed so here's the real-time process and so first we align it in the microscope of course and then we start writing and so you can see that you can label very easily you can write things very easily so this is defining in fact an architecture in real time so it's not slow but it's also not exactly manufacture ibly fast so we have to torture all of our samples that we produce in a special instrument because you can't exactly see them and this right here is just an SEM chamber and with all the whistles and bells that we attach to it we it enables us to perform different kinds of experiments so this for example is a nano mechanical module that's similar to an nano inductor so we can perturb things mechanically this is a cryogenic module so we're able to conduct these experiments at different temperatures and this is an electrochemical module so we do quite a bit of work in electrochemistry in situ and these are all the different Inquisition devices so we push on them and pulling them and torture them in various ways just to show you the difference in length scales difference in length scales for example the opening here is about 200 nanometers so it's very small now back to our hypothesis can we harness the size effect and proliferate them into the larger scales right so this is an octet nano architecture so it's a it's supposed to be particularly stiff the wall thickness here is 50 nanometers so they're all straws imagine like your straws and so they're comprised in these 3 dimensional cellular solids and we're going to to compress it so it's 99.9 percent air very very brittle ceramic right Ald alumina very brittle and we're going to compress it so what do you think is going to happen it's not a rhetorical question it's gonna shatter of course it's gonna shatter right it's your coffee mug with a severe case of osteoporosis so we're loading it loading it loading it and bam it shatters it doesn't even try to recover this guy is dead we have a little nano Seminary in our instrument but the walls are only 50 nanometers thick so that's pretty small that's pretty nano right so shatters the crushes and dice wow your VGA connector here's wonderful thank you sorry about the the videos so he crashes and dies right so now in Contra oh my gosh in contrast to that this never happened before in contrast to this kind of situation so now let's repeat exactly the same experiment and the wall thickness now is only 10 nanometers so we're reducing the wall thing is by a factor of 5 and let's see what happens so where it should crash and die even more readily right and so we're compressing this very very brittle alumina and almost to 50% and we're expecting it to crush and die even more readily and and it fully recovers so if that doesn't convince you that there is in fact a size effect I should just go back to the arm RS right now so the only difference between these these two is the wall thickness it's exactly the same microstructure exactly the same everything else so that fully recovers so now since that time we've actually uncovered quite a bit of complex they were built in quite a bit of complexity both to the loading stress state as well as to the actual architecture so here's comparison between periodic in a periodic so this is this by continuous labyrinthine architecture you can see that it recovers and absorbs energy in a very efficient way just like a periodic architecture so it's it's very much random conducive to randomness as well as to periodicity and notice how this part of the sample doesn't even know that it's being compressed now you can build different densities and you can build in gradients you can build in trajectories in such a way that for example here the lower density part of course deforms first but not only that it deforms fully before this part even realizes that it's being compressed and so you can see that this is being manifested in the stress-strain data as well so you can build in the trajectories of deformation that gives you the two nobility in that now you can make your architectures be very complex for example this is a fractal type of a nano lattice where each individual beam is now comprised of self-similar unit cells and you can see that this kinking is starting to happen in the lowest order of hierarchy and I'm watching and this is gonna snap if every time i watch this video it kind of hurts and you expect it to snap right there and it fully recovers so you can see that this recoverability just one second prevails under complex stress states in complex architectures over many many cycles yes the first cycle is not invite continue that one is in the cell in the other one the orange one I think is the cell is the cellular it's the first cycle first of all is always different because that's why you build in I think it's the architecture its the layer by layer collapse so each individual undulation corresponds to the layer by layer collapse and you introduce just a tiny bit of damage and so after that it's just elastically sitting in cycling many times but the first cycle is always different because you introduce the initial pre-damaged into it all right so skipping through all that okay so would you like to know why this happened I mean this recovery is very surprising and ceramics are not supposed to do that so let's tackle this from the mechanics point of view so this is a hollow beam based architecture so the only way that beams especially hollow beams can undergo an elastic instability and recovery eventually is through shell buckling so this is a special type of buckling which is effectively through these well then it's a it's called shell buckling and the idea here is this that if you have a beam whose wall thickness is T in the radius is a if you can set the failure criterion such that yielding would occur of course at fracture because it's a brittle material versus local buckling and you can you can determine what this ratio is the critical ratio of T the wall thickness over a such that such that below this critical ratio your material will buckle and above it it'll fracture so let's see if this is what happens here so at the ten nanometer wall thickness that critical ratio is 0.01 six which is below 0.03 below what we calculate for this material and you can see that sure sure enough it recovers for every single type of unit cell this is the image for after deformation you would be able to tell because it looks identical and as we increase the wall thickness and get close to and then exceed the critical ratio you can see that the deformation becomes much more stochastic much more Turkey and there's certainly no more recovery well if that is the case in mechanic's has all the answers that means that if we were to build a building whose wall thicknesses 10 centimeters and whose radius is 3 meters as long as T arrays below point O 3 if we were to build a building like this it would totally snap back if some giant came and stepped on it it would spring right back right I'm so glad that you're laughing because good because that would never happen right I'm sure there's a building like that in Singapore somewhere why not so if the mechanics has all the answers T over a is scale invariant so something else the size effect here is manifested through something else that's implicit so how does it manifest itself here why is it that the 10 nanometers thick structure would recover but at 10 centimeters thick building who has everything that has everything else the same would not also not a rhetorical question yes hi this is it more it's just aluminum yeah no it's an amorphous material there are no green boundaries but there also no dislocations or anything like it's just amorphous brittle good guess though any other ideas it's a brittle material are there any Mechanical Engineers tech people here material flow you are professor you're not supposed to know yeah that's exactly right so brittle materials fail it flaws the probability of finding a flaw a thousand a million flaws in something that's ten centimeters thick is 100 percent you're going to find a distribution of many many flaws there's some weak ones some some strong ones but the point is that under a globally applied stress the local stress field ahead of one of these are many of these defects will exceed the fracture strength so before these tubes ever get a chance to experience buckling your material will locally fail in contrast to something that's only ten nanometers thick first of all the size of the largest flaw is only ten nanometers and secondly the probability of finding a flaw is much much lower so this size effect manifests itself here by our ability to make much more perfect materials if we were to make something that's only ten nanometers thick and then to fill up this whole room in the same volume versus a monolithic material we will make a much higher quality material and so that's what gives rise to this to these unique phenomena so the right answer was no in case you were wondering okay so the reason the original question was did we hit the white space remember that and how close can we get to the theoretical predictions so this is the original plot and this is some of our data so this data this data is from a while ago it's from six years ago and we can do much better now and hopefully maybe some of you can do much better now here's an interesting data set these are the fractal nano lattices and you can see we bought ourselves two more orders of magnitude and reduction in density and so we certainly have ventured into the white space that hasn't been uncovered before at that time and then even here like I said even a modest increment within this log-log space already represents a substantial departure from from from current what we also shown much more recently is that some materials are in fact much closer to the theoretical strength so for example carbon and I'll tell you a little story about carbon these are all the new data points that just came out I think this year you can see that in the higher density regime they can actually get to the theoretical limit and one should always question what exactly is theoretical limit how do you define that well of course you can't be stronger than the atomic bond but once you start talking about something that's a nano ribbon that's wrapped around a three-dimensional architecture it's not quite a 2d material because it's not just a single atom thick but its thickness is very limited and so your surface to volume ratio is very high so theoretical strength possibly needs to be redefined for these materials and I'll just leave you with that okay so this of course all of everything I've shown you up to this point brings up quite a few mechanic's questions right so what is the effect of architecture what is the fracture behavior so I only showed you compression experiments we've done quite quite a lot on tensile deformation and on fracture behavior defects very very important how to optimize this and then I call the second and third harmonics of these questions because of course each one of these questions bring it brings in its own hierarchy but that's not what I'm going to do right now what I'm going to do right now is take a little poll in the audience here because I'm going to tell you only one of these two stories and I managed to classify them into two one story could be it's called more mechanics so I can tell you a bit about making the mechanics of batteries and energy storage systems I can tell you quite a bit about the dynamic impacts in fact we have a collaboration with Keith Nelson's group here doing lipid experiments so laser impact type experiments I can tell you a bit about fracturing about flaws or another story I can tell you is the story of additive manufacturing so this is the story that gives rise to the chemically derived part of the sentence that I aim to explain and that is how can we create these kinds of nano architected materials out of knock polymers and out of not Ald ceramic Ald alumina how can we make them out of metals how can we make them out of metal oxides how can we make them such that they exhibit unique nano photonic properties or some other or energy storage kind of properties so that's what this story would be about so this is more and I will tell you us I will finish with a story that come all of it together so we'll so nobody will feel cheated okay so could you Siri this for maybe like two more seconds and then prepare to vote so everybody can vote once and has to vote once and only once all right so who wants to hear more more mechanics Wow all three of you okay great and who wants to hear about additive manufacturing all right I guess that's what we're gonna do so this is the only time I actually need to touch mic and those of you I will be happy to share the mechanics story as well later okay um okay so one um feature of nano scribe is that they're a little bit you can buy the instrument but what they really get you with is the resist that you have to buy from them so there are these two commercial resists the IP dip and IPS and those are the ones that they pretty much control but if you have very clever Caltech graduate students you realize pretty quickly that you don't have to be a slave to these resists and so what my student Andre demonstrated is that actually you can take em off which is a metal-organic framework and so what you can see here is the nickel ion that's that's embedded into an organic shell and you can undergo it can undergo a ligand exchange reaction where you can take this nickel iron and now surrounded with acrylate groups and they occur it's the acrylic based polymers that enable the photo initiator will react ssin so the question was can we then take this nickel aqua late and combine it with a photo initiator this is we tried this maybe a couple of years ago this is relatively new approach and just to to see if we can even print something with it so that's what Andre did so turns out that you can you can incorporate this nickel resonant to the acrylate as long as it's able to cross link and undergo the photo initiate able reaction and watch what happens so the unit cell here is on the order of 10 microns and the beam diameter here is on the order of 2 microns so that's the resin that's the nickel containing resin so what do we need to do to get rid of all this organic junk because really ultimately what we want is metal right we want the nickel what do we do with the organics we burn it off in the fancy word for burning is pyrolysis of course right and nitrogen dodging free nitrogen free environment so turns out what we learned is that when you pyrolyze something and you volatilize all this other stuff it shrinks tremendously it shrinks by 30 percent in each linear direction which means that volumetrically shrinks by about 90 percent and so what we end up with is an additive Li manufactured nickel nano lattice whose unit cell size is 2 microns in the beam diameter is below 500 nanometers it's tiny so we just additively manufactured a very the smallest additively manufactured nickel material well the question of course is well alright how nickel is this nickel this is all chemically derived you know that so we did some EDS analysis so this is energy dispersive spectroscopy that shows that there's quite a bit it's pretty much all nickel 9 more than 90% on nickel with some oxygen and carbon well okay it's not really sufficient to know the chemical composition we really need to understand what form this nickel is in so how many of you have ever prepared TEM samples I saw a beautiful Titan instrument down below so you must have some TMS so how many okay so you know it's pretty painful to make the TM samples right how do you take a tiny little structure with 400 nanometer beams and then convince them to go on to the TM grid so that you can analyze it well you can use the fib but then you're introducing gallium ions right so that's bad news so Andrei was particularly ambitious and he said well what if I write a grid and a grid and then just really hope that one of these beams happens to subtend to holy a hole in the holy carbon TM grid and sure enough he did so this is the most unadulterated nickel additively manufactured nickel beam that happens to be here and so we're able to do quite a bit of TM analysis and what you see here is that it's pretty much all nano crystalline nickels so here's the diffraction pattern with a mean grain size of about 20 nanometers and then there's also some nickel oxide and nickel carbide just a very a little bit of each and the knick the oxide probably formed just a surface native oxide so let's look at this at this nickel so it's nanoporous you saw it was very porous it's nano grained that's bad news for any of you who do metal or Joe for any of you who are material scientists or mechanical people that's a really really poor qua in a bulk scale that would be a very poor quality material right now nobody wants pores because they're all flawed flaws and nobody wants nanograins because that makes the material be brittle so let's see how it does mechanically okay so here we are compressing this compressing this nano architected nickel and okay so it looks like it's behaving exactly like it should this is the tell-tale layer by layer collapse that's very characteristic of cellular solids you can see that it it it densifies in this port part and then you see look at the stress level here it's about ten mega Pascal's well okay let's see how what does it we don't really know how porous it is right so let's compare it to some other additively manufactured materials metals out there and here's the picture that we were very surprised to see if we were to apply the specific strength here so that means strengths normalized by density right of all these different metals that were necessarily additively manufactured and so here's some titanium alloys there is some silver I think there's some aluminum based materials and we plot them as a function of beam size and that is the smallest dimension that they created what you see right away is how rapidly the strength deteriorates additive manufacturing processes are terrific at one millimeter length scale and above right and then as soon as you start reducing the dimensions even from one millimeter to a hundred microns you can see the strength Falls by a two orders of magnitude and you can if we were to continue this trend our nickel nano lattices should be we had to put in a break of like seven orders of magnitude down below in what you see if the results of our work shows that at the beam dimensions here which is a below 1 micron right so 500 nanometers not only does it hold its own but it actually compares quite favorably to other additive manufacturing processes on the order of 500 microns so it turns out that nano scale allows you to be much more forgiving against defects so even though I had the bulk scale this material would have been terrible and it would have had terrible mechanical properties it actually can hold its own pretty well all right now of course after we did the nickel Andre decided hey this is actually quite yea enriching and maybe we can we can venture into other materials so the next suit using this ligand exchange reaction was the titania so I guess I'm giving away the answer on the slide here but well there's one interesting property that titania has of course it's photocatalytic so what that means is that if you expose it to sunshine it'll generate reactive oxygen species which can then go and kill microorganisms like ecoli or bacteria or something like that now the big distinction here is this look at the scale right here this is not a typo it is actually five millimeters so these weren't used weren't created using two photon lithography these were actually 3d printed and so when you speed so they're much larger so now you imagine you put one of these things that you can hold in a dirty water bottle and then you just put that water bottle and leave it in the sunlight and it'll kill all of your bacteria and so you can make that water is actually safe to drink you don't need to agitate or do anything else right now these titania this type of titania exists in the form of nanoparticles and you can't extract them out of the bottle after they killed the bacteria so you're gonna have to drink them I don't know how many of you want to drink titania nanoparticles I certainly don't so the advantage of this is that it allows you to extract the filter after it's done it's um its function now here's Andre demonstrating that so this is the part that contains then micro lettuce this is the part that doesn't and so this is methylene blue so it's effectively like an e coli type of bacteria and you can see sure enough it actually deactivates as you can see here here's the fluorescence spectrum now titania is not only photocatalytic and actually titania has quite nice photonic properties so now when you take this type of titania process and reduce its dimensions down to the nanometer length scales what we can make so this is titanium made using two photon lithography so it's quite personal right 3d printing or two photolithography and pi realize that what we were able to achieve is the unit cell size spacing here in a wood pile architecture of about one and a half microns which of course is optically near-ir optically relevant and so what my students were able to demonstrate is that you can actually not only elicit a bandgap here hold on I haven't gotten to the bandgap yet right this is just to show you that this is this is rutile titania so titania comes in two different phases and a taste and rutile and so what we made is in fact rutile titania and here's what's interesting about is that not only can you generate a band gap but this band gap shifts so this is there if the reflectance spectra it actually shifts as a function of periodicity so you can now additively manufacture these to tune them properly to be whatever whatever dimensionality you want and so here is the actual here's the calculated spectra that shows you the dispersion relation and then here is the actual data that shows you reflectance versus transmitted in the FTIR instrument and then it shows how it shifts as a function of periodicity so there's some interesting you know photonic effects now many of us in California and certainly in the world are concerned with sustainability right so when you look at these acrylate based chemistry's they're not great there you can demonstrate some neat phenomena but it's not the best waste product so another student of mine Darryl decided that he was interested in designing hydro gel based synthesis of these materials so we just used water and so what he was able to demonstrate is that sure enough when you can combine them the photo initiators in the chemistry's just right you can start working with metal salts and so in this particular case he's working with a zinc ion salt and you can swell in and out of the hydrogel so using the same process of two photon lithography you can actually write a zinc containing Nano structure now in the presence of oxygen so without the oxygen the burning is called pyrolysis in the presence of oxygen burning is called does anybody know calcination yeah so apparently I also have to learn that so when you cal sign this you generate the zinc oxide nano architecture and so let's see did we actually saw the same thing do you actually make a zinc oxide well looks like we did so here's the zinc signal here's the oxygen signals there's a bit of carbon of course this one is even more nano grain this one is five nanometers grained remember the nickel was twenty nanometers these are very very fine grain ceramics so what's so interesting about the ink oxide why should we care is anyway piezoelectric that's exactly right we all know zinc oxide to be piezo electric and it's single crystalline form of course right this is as from single crystalline as one can be so this should not be piezoelectric right so let's see alright so don't look at the bottom part only look at the top part so here's the resin this is the zinc containing resin so I showed you the cool instrument that we have right so it's able to apply mechanical loads and to measure the electrical response so when we apply so here's the displacement so when we apply apply a step in displacement by about 350 nanometers nothing happens in the voltage signal when you just have a zinc oxide resin just as sorry zinc ion containing resin once you've converted it to zinc oxide and you repeat the same experiment let's see what happens so now we stop it by about 200 nanometers and sure enough we're getting a very consistent and reliable voltage drop so it is piezo electric we just fabricated a sensor that that is very responsive to displacement right so it is Paige lecture why is it piezoelectric it's not single crystalline what's going on so all of my questions are really not rhetorical they're I would welcome your input it is is anyone else surprised right it's suppose so the way piezo electricity works is that once you apply a strain that polarizes the units all right and so you created an electric field so all of your positive charges going one direction negative going the other direction but it requires as soon as you have two grains in there oriented differently it's going to cancel each other out right so the electric fields are going to cancel themselves out why is this working isn't that what a it's a tiny that you're on the right track that's exactly it is it's tiny it's supposed to be more so anybody else wants to develop that idea it's not a lot so if you were actually to look up the change that piezo electric coefficients all the D matrix this change is tiny so it's something like 1 millivolt right something like that and happy mister happen that's fine half a millivolt so that's so it should be changing by 2 volts for example or something yeah that's exactly right it's simply the stochastic statistical distribution of the c-axis within this militant multitude of these 5 nanometer grains so if you were to just do our random tribution and calculators using very simple analytical calculations simple rule of mixtures this amount of voltage drop simply scales with the number of grains that are oriented whose C axes are oriented along the compression direction actually when you calculate how many five nanometers you can shove into a beam that has certain dimensions it actually all checks out so that's where they pay electricity comes from so this was yeah our diffraction the yeah it's blocked right now yeah so you can see them light up so you can see this is the 100 planes this is the wonderful 101 planes 1 or 2 woman they're all labeled they're circumferentially there's the auto plane they're randomly oriented the only one that matters is the orientation of the C axis so o1 direction with respect to the loading direction and that you wouldn't see in a diffraction pattern because you're just taking a cross-section yeah so it's pretty random and that's why you do I see brightness variation within the ring no we don't see that so it's pretty randomly oriented okay now we've made some metal oxides so the question then of course is can we then reduce them back to their medals right so we made the nickel using the ligand exchange reaction which is all awkwardly based can we now use this hydrogel based chemistry to create metals well we know how to make the oxides so can't we just reduce them and so here's the idea that you basically have this metal containing polymer and it's a hydrogel so you can swell all these metal salts in and out and you can actually make multi-component systems and sure enough you can then reduce in the reduced atmosphere and so here we go does anybody know what this metal is copper very good in that one nickel we needed to demonstrate that we can make nickel using hydrogel base synthesis so where you can see is that here's here's a copper ions swollen hydrogel which has this pretty blue color and then you oxidize it so here's the burnt side and then in the same furnace you stop flowing the hydrogen gas or the forming gas and then you switched to oxygen-containing or the other way around the oxygen-containing versus the hydrogen containing reducing atmosphere and it turns into this perfect copper pattern and the same thing from the turquoise to nickel oxide to pure nickel so this is a new development in our group that we're able to produce these quite reliably and there are also multi-component metals not just a single material now once we've learned how to make all these different kinds of architectures we are also interested in investigating the chemistry on the surface so can you functionalize these these nano architectures were you seeing here is that my student Darryl showing off basically he's making all these different chemical functionalities from Teflon to aromatics to very long alkyl chains and different types of architectures so he's showing you the versatility both in the architecture and in the chemistry and the reason why we would want to do that is so that we can attach these so these would service tremendously penetrable membranes so if you were to say work with some kind of membrane either either for water purification or in your body working away excess chemo therapy medication so what you're seeing here is a pattern of doxorubicin which is a very effective chemotherapy drug unfortunately it's toxic not only to the cancer cells but also to the rest of the body and so this is this is a demonstration that one of our membranes is able to capture the excess doxorubicin in the blood stream while allowing the red blood cells to flow through and then to be able to wick away the adverse the adverse chemicals now this is some of our latest pursuits and that is working with shape-memory polymers so there's quite a bit of work that's done on shape-memory alloys like nitinol for example right for your stunts but 9l can't first of all it can't really be made at very small length scales so you can't really put it in the eye like I stunt for the eye for example or anything like that and it's a metal so it's very very stiff so what we're interested in is is is this can we elissa this shape-memory effect in a polymer and architected and so my student Lucetta he's working on this so she figured out that if you come up with just the right chemistry with cross linkers and chain builders and then utilize the glass transition based mechanism for triggering the shape-memory response she's using dynamic mechanical experiments to identify the glass transition because who knows what that is right so you have to actually identify it and sure enough she's able to demonstrate that flowers for example can open their petals and can close their petals she's using this lattice to compress it and to open it and so she can she can measure the recoverability ratios so she was able to demonstrate that there is actually the shape memory effect that you can elicit in polymers and then start making useful biological devices and then like I said I was going to talk a little bit about a battery electrode so one of the directions in our group is to try to make an all solid-state three-dimensional architected battery so one problem so we can do the so the most important thing is the solid-state electrolyte but there are some electrolytes that can be used with that but what do we do about the cathode and so this is a demonstration of using this metal oxide process to create lithium cobalt oxide so this is a 3d architected lithium cobalt oxide the first part was the first question was can we even convinced the lycium and the cobalt in the in losing when the cobalt to coexist in a hydrogel integrate this problem material and sure enough first we created just the slurry it's not architected yet so it's just a slurry to show you that look and charge and discharge they're not great but they work as a battery and then and then can we then add some photo initiators and the UV blockers here at some more chemical chemistry's to try to under to try to see if we can write in create 3d architectures so here's our felicium cobalt oxide this is this is as it's going from the ion containing solution to the actual solid state electrode and then when we when we put it into our real coin cell battery so here's what you see so the Columbia columbic efficiency is actually pretty okay not great but pretty okay and then you can we can demonstrate the cycling capabilities based on the rate at which were cycling okay so in the last few minutes I'd like to tell you a little story about batteries that combines the mechanics the electrochemical reconfiguration and most importantly the defects so and a former student of mine who's now a doctor dr. Xiao Jing Shah wanted to understand this problem of lithium anode so the silicon anode for lithium ion batteries so silicon is a very brittle material right so when you when you Lisi 8 + D Lisi and there's such a tremendous amount of lithium ions that are going into the diffusing into the silicon material of course it's experiencing tri-axial stress is very large tri-axial stresses and trying to expand by about 300% volumetrically and they can't because it's it's very it's a very brittle material well it turns out that nano silicon can in fact do that so what Xiao Jing did is he built a tetragonal nano lattice that's made out entirely of a current collector which is the the nickel here and the nano or a hundred nanometers thick ribbon of silicon so this is the top view here and let's see what happens when you Lizzy at it so now he's Lisi ating it and he's litigating it and you see this pattern forming so some people some people may think that it's sinusoidal I'm a musician so I think these are violins whatever whichever way you want to look at it here's the here's the what form so here's the top eunice in a tilted view and so from the top view you very clearly see these sinusoidal patterns so these beams are buckling in response to litigation and that's their way of hurting this catastrophic failure and in fact because they can accommodate the strain and Alesi ation by buckling out of it within the plane you can see that the there are these nodes and you can see how the beams that's obtained the actually buckle between them but here's um well and just to prove to you okay this is not just a bunch of pretty pictures it is in fact of a battery it's not the world's best battery but it's it's a respectable battery and what I'm showing you here is that here's da lisi ation at different voltages and here's an image after 10th Litigation here's a de Luci ation as we're increasing the voltage and here's the image after tenths deviation seems like it's doing quite alright and so here's a we learned that the cutoff voltage should be about 0.6 and under those conditions in fact I think here here's the point six volt cutoff voltage at C over six rate and different rates actually and you can see that we've cycled it all the way up to about may actually be on 50 cycles so it's a respectable bet yeah not the best battery but it works now what's jarring really noticed is that yeah okay it's a battery all right but really what's interesting here is that look at this there are these little domains that form and in fact the formation of the domains seems to correlate with the charge and discharge rate and so what we noticed is that when you when you look at and delineate it very slowly so the C over 120 very slow rate right it it seems it tends to form one large domain these are not simulated these are actual SEM images that are trans that are transformed into pixelated images so this is all experimental data these all the red and blue things are all experiments and so where you can see is that as we're increasing the litigation rate the domains become smaller and they become more of them right so that's what Xiao Jing became interested in then he said well wait a minute there's some kind of a coupling between these within this buckling pattern and maybe what we can start thinking about in terms of anti ferromagnetic fields and the Ising model and maybe some of you are familiar with this to look at the coupling between any random any two pairs of nodes whether they're what what is the amount of coupling and the strength of that coupling and so what he was able to do is to conduct Monte Carlo simulations and now of course we don't have vilification parameter because the Monte Carlo simulations are using a thermal knob tuning knob and so we have this KT parameter and sure enough it seems like the domain formation here scales with a KT and so what we were what we were starting to learn from this is that you can actually look at these different materials so silicon and this is somewhat Lisi ated silicon lithium three silicon and an intermediate and then some other form of silicon they form differently period different periodicity within the same structures through these buckling buckling patterns and actually since lolwat is here I want to show you something this is that this is a collaboration with Professor Claudia delaio who is a former student MIT student and as soon as this thing comes up there's a mechanic's slide that I wanted to show I wonder if it'll let me show it is it doing I'm gonna unhide it oh this one yeah oh yes thank you okay any day now it's gonna show up really yeah we'll just takes time here we go right so we collaborated with Claudio who then well in we showed him this we said look sometimes they buckle collaboratively cooperatively where the nodes rotate in two different directions but when the two nodes call rotate it actually leads to a very frustrated type of buckling right and so the beams now buckle using with this to mow with the second mode buckling right so this is the energetically favorable buckling this is the energetically unfavorable buckling and so Claudio Hakeem helped us come up with this model that explains this behavior in what this is what's what he discovered is that as the lithium is going to the silicon it's not elastic buckling it's actually plastic buckling in the color here corresponds to the lycium concentration and it shows that it yields almost right away and so it won't snap back so the novelty in these materials being reconfigurable is that after you Lisi ate them and you remove this stimulus it won't snap back so whatever pattern is formed will be retained until we deliberately delineated and so that's a big difference between the toggling switches that have been demonstrated up to this point because we can fully control any transient state so this slide is for you of load I usually don't show this mechanics part ok so right so the Ising model the band gaps so these are for Nanak band gaps so my student Carlos was able to calculate these dispersion diagrams and so what we're able to show is that upon different phases of litigation you can actually induce different acoustic band gaps and so that gives us the different reconfiguration all degrees of freedom and so for example we can utilize rotation so this buckling can lead to a pattern rotation it can lead to out of plane buckling over shape so you can go from from a planar architecture to a hemispherical one of course you can bend you can expand and do all these other things and here's the most important part the reason why all these domains really form is because of the deep right and so you have this coupling between the two so I showed you that sometimes they beams buckle collaboratively sometimes they don't there is something that governs that right so it seems like the alliteration rate or the KT parameter governs that but it's really all about the defects so there are some defects that are randomly distributed there's nothing you can do about it right there fabrication defects those of you have made devices of course know this but you can override them and that's where the Ising model comes in you can actually program your own defects once you understand how they are formed in their effect and so what Shao Qiang did here is he actually programmed a pattern into this but you don't know about this and so all we're gonna do now is Luthi a tit and see if the pattern will show itself so let's see what happens as you Lisi 8 it is Ulysse ated and hopefully you see the pattern forming and hopefully you see the resemblance this is what inspired me when when you showed me this the named the MIT logo that's created out of MIT L M names so this is not quite the same level of complexity but hopefully you can see the resemblance here all right so this is a good point to finish so just to summarize as you walk out of here thinking oh my god she showed us all these pictures and there was a lot of information and I'm not really sure what this was all about I'd like you to walk away here with one key message and that is if you are clever about three things one of them is the atomic level microstructure of your material is it amorphous is it nano grained is it single crystalline what is it the second one of course is how your particular material responds to the size effect and that is if it's a metal it'll it might become stronger it might become weaker if it's a glass it might become not brittle and the third one of course is what kind of architecture is optimal for your application do you want it to be particularly lightweight and also particularly stiff that's one thing do you want it to be compliant that's another thing so there many design parameters that go into it but if you are in fact clever about those three things you can create entirely new classes of materials that are exceptionally lightweight and have unprecedented properties but not only properties but combinations of properties that have never been possible before in the reason why you would want to do that you saw that our kids grow up in the world where they're no more he because we'll be able to just write the little cochlea bone we can we've already I didn't tell you anything about this but we've actually been writing tissues for example bone tissue on these kinds of scaffolds at the right scale with the right architecture so that your iPhone 83 of course will hold its charge for about a year without needing to be recharged ever the balloons will not need to be filled with helium because vacuum is lighter than air so you can evacuate all the air out of it right so as soon as we figure out how to make them not be porous well we'll be right on that right the Christmas ornaments oh this is very much for the season right the Christmas ornaments will never shatter again but here's the most important pursuit so maybe you have some of these for your seminars maybe you don't but eventually people generally tend to like brownies right so all right so what we're working on now our chocolate nano lattices which 100% taste 99.9 percent in point of 1 percent calories so with that I think I'd like to finish and the years IQs my group and all the and all the wonderful funding sources that have enabled us to do this so I'm happy to take any questions are there gonna be brownies a different point of view so when you grow your the macroscopic size of your structure you increase the likelihood that one of the trusses may have a early failure so do you see that trend like as you make a bigger that will fail or have a degrading in the in the performance that's a terrific question so like I said it's all about the defects right so what if you take it so the question is this what if you take out one beam is that a defect what if you take out two beams what if three beams are missing is that a defect so I think we have to really rethink what defines a defect in a discrete continuum material and so you chose not to hear about the mechanics but I would have told you about that so it turns out that these materials actually have a unique response to flaws and so so so that's what the fracture is so we've done quite a bit actually in terms of fracture experiments so the probability of having another defect of course increases just because by the virtue of making a bigger materials but not by unit but not per layer so it's the same density of defects if you think of it this way because the process doesn't really change so what does need to be changed is that two photolithography is not scalable so you can't create a sheet as big as this screen or a textile so we're very much into textiles now right or any kind of a protection personnel protection right you can't make it at scale using the Nano scribe so you have to rely on a different type of technology and that technology might be more susceptible to defects so what we're learning the good news is that it seems like at the nano scale all materials become more impervious less sensitive to flaws in terms of the mechanics in terms of failure but the probability of failure very much depends on the defect so you can either override it with programming your own defects into it or you can create a different process that will be that more amenable to that yeah but that's an excellent point yeah oh sorry yeah go ahead you're the chair it's not just you compress the structures to dislodge hysteresis and then it gets smaller but there's still something Sarita's yeah oh yes we're stuck going and trying to figure out what's happening with that lifted energy yeah so the first cycle like I said is always different right that's where you build in a little bit of the pre damage and then what ends up happening is that at the nodes you have these little tiny microscopic cracks and then they open and close open and close open close so the second through nth cycle are very similar and just as you depending on the integrity of your structure it it should pretty much be the same but just sometimes you have defects and sometimes you have fabrication details and so it decreases ever so slightly from second 2nf first to second is always a big trap second to Anthes about the same yeah yeah yeah but it's the history it's they anticipated energy right so he's dissipated through heat through acoustics I guess but it depends on the material because challenges is like making transparent optics that can focus on multiple depths and in terms of Meadowlands Azure metamaterials like have you done any experiments with kind of transparent optics we have but right now they're all in the neo IR so not so much in the visible yet to the visible you have to reduce the dimension some so much more so we haven't been able to do that although by realizing and general heat treatment is certainly providing a pathway to shrink the dimensions so that's probably the right approach and in fact we collaborated with one of Carl's old students who created structural color so you can change the color but we're just not quite in the transparent in the visible range yet yeah but that would be amazing yeah it's a related question is since thinking about the skin depth and metal materials you said you've done near-ir experiments is there a refractive index a composite I guess refractive index value for some of these structures the metal ones in particular yeah well so we don't usually work with metals because they're quite lossy so we go for the high index so we've worked with germanium which is a nightmare and then titania is our next best so I think it's two point something is that so we worked with high index materials and then we yanny IRS basically is as good as we can get to now but eventually I think the combination of the high index material and a much tighter much tighter periodicity will give rise to the to the visible to the photonic effects in the visible range yeah we're working on it you
