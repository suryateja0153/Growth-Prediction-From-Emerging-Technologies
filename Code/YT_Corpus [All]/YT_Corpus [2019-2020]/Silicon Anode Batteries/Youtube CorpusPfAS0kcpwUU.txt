 who is Cillian battery located in Broomfield Colorado and founded in 2014 there a small start-up with less than 10 employees and have been privately owned with a focus on lithium ion battery tech and have been recently linked to Tesla don't let the smaller size fool you they are an extension within the pre-existing lithium ion ecosystem meaning their technology has a much shorter path to commercialization than the next generation solid-state tech they've been awarded five small business innovation research grants for about two million dollars from the Navy do II and the National Science Foundation according to the abstract from a work documenting an award sea lion won in 2017 the broader impact in commercial potential of the small business innovation research project Lydon prototyping and scaling a high-energy lithium-ion cell for commercialization that would directly enhance defense energy storage markets such as aerial and underwater drones and global consumer device markets while also proving the technology for further development in the global evie market the aim was to provide three to six months of continuous drone flight time to create opportunities for the communication and defense industries or providing batteries that take up half the space as the current generation as we know to date and speaking in a general industry-wide sense lithium-ion improvement has been slow but the demand is now far higher than it's ever been specifically this project proposed to enable a non flammable high-energy lithium-ion cylindrical cell with a silicon anode and nickel rich cathode upon optimizing the prototype cell design the anode was to be scaled for integration into cylindrical cells built for cycling and safety performance in which iteration improvements would be made as necessary and those cells were to be incorporated into a drone ready packed design for delivery to an unnamed aerial vehicle manufacturing partner of course with success proven in other markets that paves the way for technology to be accepted in the wider reaching evey market the team at sell I own is beginning to rewrite the rulebook for lithium ion battery design not only do the cathode and anode materials need to be next generation the entire battery also needs revamping they're shifting their focus to auxiliary battery materials building a support system for the modern silicon and nickel rich electrodes using unique electrolyte compositions and electrode binders while maintaining the advantage of decades of manufacturing expertise by premises their designs on compatibility with existing lithium-ion battery manufacturing methods as dr. Molina Piper explains enabling the next generation electrode materials will mean enabling a next-gen lithium ion system design moreover the strategy for attaining next-gen performance must be commercially viable silly on sell tech through utilization of lower-cost materials and manufacturing compatibility will be 30% less costly in terms of dollars per kilowatt hour than the state-of-the-art lithium-ion cells by approaching the problem from the view of the battery cell system Salon achieves its breakthrough energy density and performance over the past few years lithium-ion battery design changes have only been achieving five to six percent energy density improvements each year Szalai onset out for a drastic break from the status quo and shifting away from the adherence to the same electrode materials that have been used for years they're using a higher component of silicon material in the anode and a very high amount of nickel in the cathode silicon has roughly ten times the capacity of graphite being used in battery anodes but it also expands threefold during charging cycles for comparison most graphite anodes and commercialized batteries expand between and thirteen percent while silicon expands roughly 300 percent this of course can cause massive structural damage to the battery and compromises the solid electrolyte interface or sei between the electrode and the liquid electrolyte this phenomena has limited widespread adoption of the few technologies but saleon has developed additives for the silicon anode which function to preserve the battery cells physical integrity these chemical additives also improve the nickel cathodes thermal stability they use a non flammable liquid electrolyte in contrast to the flammable carbon electrolyte used in many lithium-ion batteries today if you could use a refresher on batteries check out the next episode titled battery investor day preparation that you'll see on the left at the end of this episode the drawback of these modifications is that they require intricate and costly processing methods making this approach less appealing in the manufacturer of commercial batteries as dr. Evans of Cillian explains quote most of the published work around silicon anodes focuses on complex material modifications that ultimately will introduce manufacturing processes which are very difficult to scale and quote a simple scalable solution to the silicon anode is one key to higher performing batteries by improving the anodes performance you can increase a battery's maximum energy output by twenty to thirty percent however in order to unlock the true potential of the battery the cathode needs to be similarly enhanced in terms of the cost of producing lithium ion batteries the cathode accounts for roughly 30% of the total expense on average more than twice that of the anode most conventional lithium ion batteries use expensive and toxic cathodes containing large amounts of cobalt limiting their widespread application to electric vehicles silly owns first-generation pouch format cells are supposed to be 350 watt hours per kilogram most commercially available lithium-ion batteries are well below 285 watt hours per kilogram they do also have a generation of cylindrical cells that are in the process of being tested to scale to become commercially available their business model is essentially to license the cell designs and tech to the existing markets because of the ease of which it would transfer to existing manufacturing lines this way they wouldn't have to build or own costly and expensive manufacturing operations as a point of reference most in the easy industry believe lithium-ion batteries will need gravimetric energy densities of over 350 watt hours per kilogram in order to begin gaining mass market adoption of course there are plenty of other factors that go into this but that has served as somewhat of a benchmark for some time of course many OMS will ultimately want next-gen tech like solid-state batteries but lithium ion batteries will remain essential for decades to come so lion could allow the transportation industry to jump to a higher performance energy density with less thermal issues leading to increased safety and lower cost they should be able to do this without disrupting the existing supply chain equipment or processes that are in place today Cillian has shown that when integrated into their unique system state-of-the-art nickel rich cathodes and silicon anodes demonstrate a much improved structural stability and safety even at high temperatures dr. Molina Piper also says that Cillian has created the first viable 80 percent by weight silicon lithium ion battery anode capable of integration into standard electrode manufacturing processes they have worked with over two dozen types of silicon active materials all showing marked improvement in capacity retention and columbic efficiency when used in salons and ode systems regardless of the size or shape of silicon particles this ability to turn so many commercially available silicon materials into effective in could send shockwaves through the industry making the current over-engineered silicon anodes look overpriced by comparison around two years ago ed Williams the CEO of the Colorado clean tech Industries Association said the salon tech had the potential to be ruled out within 24 months subject to refined engineering for charging rates and improved cold temperature performance this quote was just over 24 months ago as of April 2020 Williams also said that aviation and defense were initial target markets but the demand was very high for the tech and they were in talks with many industries of course many in the Tesla community have speculated that Tesla may have recently acquired a lithium-ion battery start-up in Colorado as Tesla was looking for a sell technician in Louisville Colorado but that job posting has since been removed additionally employees of saleon simon Hafner Daniela Molina Piper and Tyler Evans the cofounders have expressed interest in Tesla or added Tesla to their job experience outright Cillian has also taken down their official website which has in some historical instances been a sign of takeover or acquisition the exact details of Salons battery design remain confidential but the problematic expansion effects that plagued modern silicon anodes appear to have been overcome as dr. Evans stated the anodes display a minimal decrease in capacity after hundreds of charging and discharging cycles and exhibit high columbic efficiencies meaning that the charge is reversibly and effectively transferred through the system this efficiency has been tested and proven with a variety of electrolyte materials including the coveted non-flammable electrolytes which also shows the flexibility of the Szalai on system ultimately through development projects already underway and in the pipeline saleon is targeting a battery prototype that is predicted to deliver roughly three hundred and 90 watt hours per kilogram far greater than any commercial lithium ion battery currently available and finally the time has come to give away this light-up Tesla sign I apologize for the delay in getting to this no excuses here that being said here's the list of all the names that we entered into the drawing take a moment to pause and look for your name if you'd like to now up next will be the drawing that we recorded live alright guys here's how this will work we're gonna roll two virtual dice once it lands on a number adding up to more than 4 we will randomize this list with all of the entrants that number of times and whoever lands in the number one slot on that number will win best of luck 4 plus 3 is 7 so we're gonna randomize this list 7 times I did add a few of you in there multiple times just to say thank you to our patreon supporters so that's 1 2 3 four five six and the winner is whoever lands in the number one slot right here James Leonard pains congratulations my friend thank you for entering go ahead and reach out to me in this youtube video or on instagram or shoot me an email and i'll go ahead and get this sign out to you just in case james doesn't see this doesn't reach out to me i will do this again exactly one week from now if I don't hear from James thanks guys
