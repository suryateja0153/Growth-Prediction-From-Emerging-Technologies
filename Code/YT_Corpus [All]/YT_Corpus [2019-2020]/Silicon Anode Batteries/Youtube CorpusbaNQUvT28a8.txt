 [Music] okay so on behalf of all of the audience's I again appreciate a great presentation from two invited speakers thank you very much again so now we have learned how the what would be the cutting edge and next-generation semiconductor technology is about s in BTS and the battery technology future better tech knowledge about B then now we need to connect and bridge between B and s so it's time to do connect and make a bridge between B and s BTS so professor King I ever some one of the representative are questions from followers is this as you explained in presentation the number of transistors a number of components in integral circuit microchip has been doubled every other year every two years however the power supply voltage has not been well scaled down maybe if I remember correctly when I was born in 1980 it was a five volt to run the microchip but now the theorem lpddr4 five theorem is still running with one point export so only 80% reduction of power supply voltage but in terms of the number of transistors in microchip is exponentially increased in the it has been logarithmically exponentially increased a lot then question is how come the power supply voltage cannot be scaled down you know at an explanation race why is that we would like to hear your you know some deep knowledge and wisdom it's a good fundamental question the way that the transistor operates is by changing the potential barrier electronic potential barrier between the source and the channel region so it just turns out there is a fundamental limit when you change the gate voltage by at least 60 millivolts you need to change the game voltage by at least 60 millivolts in order to change the current flow by a factor of 10 and so the difference between on current and off current if you want many orders of magnitude let's say six orders of magnitude that fundamentally means you need to have many tenths of volts gate voltage swing to turn a transistor on and off so actually for the more than ten years the research community has looked at alternative transistor designs where you do not change the height of a potential barrier but maybe change the tunneling distance between two regions in the semiconductor but the problem is that alternative transistor designs like tunneling transistors quantum mechanical tunneling transistors and cannot provide the on state current that matches CMOS and so the circuit performance is not as good but this comes back to my comment that this is a when people working on devices they focus on just making devices smaller and operating with lower voltage they don't communicate with the people in the upper the higher levels of abstraction so actually Tunnel transistors even though they can turn on and off with smaller voltage the current is not as good also they are not as versatile they can only conduct current in one way and that affects the circuit architecture and so this is one reason why no progress really has been made in trying to lower the voltage of these CMOS chips over the last 10 10 or so years so a much more dramatic change is needed so that involves people who work in architecture and algorithms to work together with people who design future switches okay thank you following up those questions I guess in developing the new CMOS technology well many people are saying that there are two ways in in developing future similar technology one of them which is a revolutionary way and the other of which would be the evolutionary pathway so would you please are some give us some example representative example on each variable an evolutionary one so evolutionary is just continuing to try to extend the era of Moore's law so trying to make transistors smaller without increasing the manufacturing cost too much stacking transistors on top of each other to fit more on the chip because each transistor performs a very simple function but if you have many of them then that the system can can have a much more complex function so that's that's evolutionary and that will that can continue for at least ten more years but of course if the voltage is not coming down what happens is if you fit more transistors on a chip then the voltage is the same so energy dissipation per transistor is the same but you're fitting more of them on chip so power density goes up so then the cooling of the chip has some limitations also so this is one reason some of you might have heard about the dark silicon problem where you actually cannot operate the circuits in all the parts of the chip for too long you have to turn off different blocks of the chip once in a while to let the chip cool down so that's a fundamental problem a revolutionary approach would be to have completely different computing architectures so you might have heard of like neuromorphic computing so the way our brains work they don't have you know high and low voltages and so the neurons the the fundamental cells the building block in our brains are neurons one neuron has many many inputs and many many outputs connects with so one neuron can connect with thousands of neurons the transistor circuit I showed you it's really very few transistors that are connected together and drive only one output so the architecture is much different if it's more like a brain Norfolk there's also quantum computing but we know that quantum dots or quantum bits qubits it's not easy to make many qubit systems function correctly and they require depending on the technology the qubits might require very low temperature so refrigeration takes an energy as well so cute quantum computing potentially can be better than conventional computing for only specific types of computational problems so neuromorphic computing is good for certain types of problems quantum computing is for good for different types of problems the oscillator based like if we call missing architecture different kind of computing architecture also is good much better than classical von Neumann architecture only for certain operations so you probably will see it diversity of computing architectures implemented with a diversity of technologies and all integrated with you know advanced packaging in the future so I think it's just the diversity of approaches will be needed to achieve the optimal energy efficiency and performance ok great alright and another I guess a student from s kku has asked delivered these questions the future in future in the near future I guess a smart city or hyper connected the society will be implemented that is coming to us then the fundamental technology to run and implement the small cities more hospitals more highway smart Factory I didn't ABCD is necessary so a indicates a I me in the case big data but I guess better it definitely and C's cloud service and these data or data analysis techniques so to run operate a small city without any technical issue what kind of you know future memory technology or a system I see technology would be necessary and what about the battery technology to run before the small city in the near future for the young students they're gonna leave actually I think the the technology today already is good enough to implement some smart smart cities so I think maybe artificial intelligence so ok autumn autonomous driving I think there's still some some challenge in terms of energy efficiency and computational speed to really achieve you know the level for you know automation for the cars but I think first basic smart cities to come to optimize the distribution of energy and water and to control traffic I think the technology is already there so it's just a matter of implementing AI gathering with the Internet of Things more data so the AI can operate with more accurate models and now I think the computing capabilities there yeah I I think as chairman chey had mentioned I think the grid will have to become decentralized I think that 40 years from now if we look back there will be no central grid anymore and part of that has to do with reliability part of it has to do with security I think we in California had now like a third world country we had to mandatory power outages by our electricity company because they were incapable of guaranteeing safe power delivery so I have a tesla powerwall and solar so I was fine but what you find is that I had was fine an electricity with the lights on but all communication services were out so I think that once you become that integrated you need to have at least enough fragments of communication hubs on at any given time so that traffic can be routed when when all power goes out in a region I think then everything would will essentially break down so in my brain that has to go together with a decentralized power grid and one question from floor is um I guess this kitchen is a slightly out over this scope but anyway to become a paradigm you know breaker in future what should a student prepare and what kind of future technology should he or she major in in graduate schools proof I think it's perfectly qualified to Angela please recommend a few list of you know topics research topics for students then it will be very helpful with a new paradigm I think the future engineers would be well served to be trained in a variety of disciplines so not only you know material science and physics for the in electronics and and so on in computing but I think you know at least at Berkeley what we're trying to do is change some of the requirements for the engineering degree to make it easier for our students to also major at the same time in some other discipline whether or not it's the sciences or maybe the social sciences or in the arts and humanities because I think the people since engineers really we're designing the systems that people in the future are going to depend on engineered devices and systems and processes are going to have intimate or tremendous profound impact on the way that people live the way that children develop the way the society operates even like what we believe well what we learned when we grow up I think it's actually more important for those engineers the students of the future to to really be trying to learn as much as they can about about humans in a social behavior as well as on technology because we redesign these engineered devices for humans if you think about what is the Chairman joint meant why are we doing this it's really to benefit humanity and we don't understand humanity we see today in the United States you know with social media you know the technology platform was intended you know for usually for it to be beneficial but we see all kinds of unintended negative consequences of society of technology today and so I think in the future engineering students really should be prepared to become leaders in society and that means you have to be socially aware and socially engaged so I think that will become more and more important for for our society in the future okay great I guess the discussion is for professor Khan I guess you can start with the discussion with professor it's like so you renew palms okay then let's say I get a little bit too and then discuss about the battery I think you have a very interesting talk purpose leader in your top you had a very interesting analogy between silicon technology from the semiconductor and the lithium-ion battery technology is it actually perfect link between BTS from the history are in the development of the semiconductor silicon technology and non silicon technology were competing very hard and in the end because of the mass scalability and other kind of kind of issues silicon technology has become dominated and then those like a non silicon technology has kind of you know still working but still all the industry is dominated by this technology and some of the battery scientists also think that lithium-ion batteries will be like the silicon technology while the postally to my embarrass technology luckily to mayor little surfer or solid-state batteries even though they possess great promises with respect many properties because of the scalability and in the electric vehicle market is growing very fast and then the company is building a lot of factories and cutting down the cost so then even though there are some demerits of lithium-ion batteries in the end the demand battery is going to survive and dominate this market so what's your comment on that well I'll give the background so when I was a graduate student actually in Berkeley I remember a speaker coming from the micro electronics industry from a company and it was late 80s and the speaker predicted that first of all silicon would be completely replaced by gallium arsenide and more importantly the processor speed of processors would be limits to about five megahertz and I think we're doing what 3 4 gigahertz today so I think one thing I've learned is scientists we're often very skeptical that things are not possible but what I've seen in from a distance in silicon and from closer up in little mine is that a lot of things we said that were not possible we're not going to happen 20 years ago did indeed happen I can tell you that nobody would have said that little mine would be used in the grid nobody would have told you that little mine would be $100 per kilowatt hour at the cell level so that's one thing and that is really I think a tribute to the power of industry that once they take a technology that you know an industry incremental improvement is not a bad word in academia it may be seen as a bad word but if you improve things by 5% each year that really adds up and lithium-ion is sort of on that curve right yes 5% here 2% there 3% there it is a very tough competitor now I do not want to be pessimistic about new things but I think that the the most successful new innovations will be things that attach themselves to the known technology for example you can do lithium ion with different capital materials you can even solve your mind you could really just see as a Saudi mind can inherit 80 percent of lithium-ion technology and manufacturing so you don't when you do these things you don't have to completely reinvent a new supply chain a new manufacturing capability and and I think that may give industry that more traction and more willingness to go behind it whereas I think if you invent something completely new especially when it's based on on matter on material so it's not a software thing it has to be really a whole lot better to to to justify enormous investment and lead time or it has to have really niche markets that can be used to get the cost out and that's a bit maybe while it in mine is so strong not at anything new you will make today that any of us will make today will cost a thousand dollars a kilowatt hour not a hundred and so that means we need to find special markets that can be used where we can get $1,000 per per kilowatt hour until it comes down I worked on magnesium batteries I had a start-up on my knees in batteries which should in principle be a lot cheaper than lithium I'm today well not if there's no no supply chain behind it we had to buy magnesium specialty and this and that and our battery was going to be $2,000 per kilowatt hour because there was no industry behind it so in the end we made lithium-ion batteries okay so you see your Nobel Prize was give I'm in last year was given to the discovery of into collision chemistry which kind of enabled the current modern lithium battery Oh and now keeping us in mind and if you look at the cost down of the lithium battery and performance enhancement from the commercial sector for the past two decades the innovation has really coming from the packaging level or like a fabrication level not the innovations in the new battery chemistry or materials I mean it has changed the fermenting cobalt oxide to NCM basically almost same crystal structure the same material and from the graphite to another graphite in the anode so and then also even though we have gone through from cobalt to NCM material and then has gone through many optimizations many people in Barry field kind of agree that the limitation is just ahead of us I mean is right here because we are now utilizing almost all the theoretical capacity of layer 2 structure so do you see this kind of a limits of inter collision chemistry and if we if the lithium battery wants to dominate for the next 10 20 years then this should be somehow should be solved resolved so what's your idea about this so I'm not sure I agree with the first part of the question because I think it is may be true if you take a short term view but if you look at for example intercalation was invented in the 1960s and 1970s by people who had no idea that would make batteries with it it was invented by people who were trying to modulate the charge in layered materials to make superconductors and then it was people like the earlier view like Stan Winningham who decided oh I can make a battery with so I think that while it is true that industry has all done all the optimizations I think the invention of every cathode was done in the academic world a graphite intercalation was known from the 1830s and 1840s and so I think that sometimes gets gets forgotten I guess the second part of your question was that is there a limit to intercalation there probably is there is no theoretical limit but there may be a practical limit the questions are how far do we have to get right so today we're at 600 in some cases 7 to 800 watt hours per litre if you believe my picture that 1,400 is possible so at 1,400 watt hours per litre we are essentially at about 60 percent of the usable energy density of gasoline right everybody always quotes the energy density of gasoline but that's the enthalpy of reaction that's not the actual energy you get at the wheels because of the Carnot efficiency so the usable energy density of gastly is about 2000 watt hours per litre so if we reach 1400 watt hours per litre then the question is do we need to do a whole lot better right I think we will already reach an enormous amounts of market I would actually argue that today little man is good enough for many markets that we're already addressing it seems to be good enough for portable electronics it's good enough for you know power tools in automotive we clearly want to see some more efficiency right once you if we could put in enough battery to hit 500 miles so 6 700 kilometers then the game is over right then then everybody will drive electric vehicles the only area where I think substantial improvement is needed is in-flight electric flight right so in electric flight you can really only foresee one to two hour flight today so short hops in Europe parts of Asia but not the long distance flight so so I guess my long argument here is if you were to hit 1,400 watt-hours per liter which is possible I think in the solid state side I think the game is over I think no tech no other technology will compete that's so then it becomes silicon for the next 30 years or so um there is one question phone floor is a little bit politically could it be sensitive question because we are talking about the electric vehicles you know if you do the I mean maybe ten years ago there was a debate whether electric vehicle is going to be growing that fast and then there is market forecast it's going to grow at 20% every year there is a skepticism but in the end it turned out to be really true the electric vehicle is going to realfact but if you calculate the amount of electric city to run all of the electric vehicles which will occupy about 20-30 percent of the whole car industry then we have to worry about how we're gonna you obtain those electricity so recently we in Korea we had a little bit of debate how we're gonna supply those electricity we're gonna replace this current nuclear power electricity to the renewable energy sources like wind or solar power but if you do the simple math it's very very difficult so what's your opinion about using this arena of energy resources to generate electricity and to power the electric car so first of all I think the question is very good because I think it it points that the most important thing I would argue that the limitation of electric vehicles today is not a vehicle anymore it is actually the infrastructure even in California where we have large penetration of electric vehicles most people don't complain about the range of their car they complain that they cannot find chargers that are unused so that is an infrastructure issue but then the question is also about the larger issue of electricity demand so today that's not a big deal yet right the amount of electricity used by electric vehicles is not that large but it could become but I would see rather than seeing that as a problem as an opportunity I showed you this electricity demand curve for California we could solve that problem completely if we have to some level AI combined with charging algorithms so if we don't charge cars just when people wanted to but if there's some kind of algorithm that says you know maybe you tell your car well I'd like to be charged but it's not really that important because I'm only driving home and so I only need 30 mile range then the car maybe will charge when there's excess production in the grid but maybe you want to tell your car I absolutely have to be charged because I'm going to drive 500 kilometers this afternoon so with that kind of AI you can actually moderate the demand on the electrical grid and this will be much more effective than actually building these big batteries on the grid so if you take all of cars in California and you assume that 30% of them is electric that will be much more battery capacity than we will ever ever put on the grid in California so if you can control to some level demand from those vehicles you ride away have built-in storage and you don't even need vehicle to grid you do the storage simply by controlling the demand or by somehow mitigating the demand so so I see it as an opportunity I think more than as a challenge most people now that we have vehicles that can go for 500 kilometers already most people don't need to immediately charge they just today they just plug in and it charges because there's no benefit to wait but but I think our grid and our grid operators I think have to become smarter and more up with the times right grid operators are extremely conservative they are extremely unwilling to change their algorithms and their cost structure but once you do that I don't think this is a problem so like a in the gasoline car they have like a very intimate network from the oil crude oil to the gasoline those kind of infrastructures have been built for the last many decades and now according to your kind of vision I think it's very important and the visionary but do you think is going to be realistic like we're gonna have a electric vehicle maybe in ten years and then we have to rebuild this kind of infrastructure to in that kind of way do you think this is going to be realistic kind of picture well I think it's realistic or not I think today is not a technology which is a political question I think that cities you know and and countries have so far subsidized the purchase of electric vehicles it's very time to put that money in infrastructure because you know maybe the the purchase will suffer somewhat but if you don't solve the infrastructure problem you will have a real problem soon right you need access to charging capability everywhere you need access to fast charging capability people who live in apartments don't have access to easy charging capability this today is already the biggest problem it's not buying the Eevee's you can buy some really very good EVs I I recommend the electric Porsche just kidding okay test-drive it it's really wonderful we have many more questions remaining but because of the time limitation I think we have to wrap this up and thank you very much for the talks and then I'd like to thank all the audience's who gave a very important question thank you very much thank you thank you speakers for the captivating lecture
