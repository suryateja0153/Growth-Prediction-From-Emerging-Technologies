 tesla is expected to host its battery day shareholder meeting next month elon musk has informed analysts that battery day will include a big reveal of development in tesla's battery efforts and the battery day will blow your mind and make your sword swords if you haven't been living under a rock then you have probably heard about graphene the most popular and well-known type of new battery tech in this video we will explore how graphene will reform tesla's battery technology and how you can help to know more about tesla's lead in graphene batteries at battery day so what are graphing and graphing batteries graphene is a tightly packed layer of carbon atoms that are bonded together in hexagonal honeycomb like structure it is only one atom thick but up to several micrometers in lateral extent graphene shows many remarkable material properties due to its two dimensionalities like it is a million times thinner than a human ear but 240 times stronger than structural steel and 50 times stronger than strongest steel it is the best conductor of heat and electricity it can hold energy density 6 times higher than copper it is also really flexible very strong and extremely lightweight and can give a longer battery lifecycle when it comes to batteries graphene's capabilities can be used in a number of ways the ideal use of graphene as a battery is a super capacitor super capacitor restores current just like traditional battery but can charge and discharge at incredible rates which means faster charging and tesla vehicle advantages of wrapping battery over lithium ion cells graphene conducts heat better than lithium ion that means tesla's graphene enhanced battery will cool faster and have a prolonged lifespan which will be many times longer than a million mile battery gripen batteries are also lighter and slimmer than lithium-ion batteries that means tesla's battery can get slimmer while maintaining same capacity or having larger capacity in the same form finally graphene is safer while lithium-ion batteries have very good safety record there have been a few major incidents involving faulty products overheating overcharging and puncturing can cause a runaway chemical imbalances in lithium ion batteries that result in fire graphene is much more stable flexible stronger and is more resilient to such issues it is important to note that you don't have to have either the one or the other lithium ion batteries can use graphene to enhance cathode conductor performance these are known as graphene metal oxide hybrids hybrid batteries result in lower weight faster charge times greater storage capacity and a longer lifespan than today's batteries graphene can be added to almost any battery without affecting its attributes this means we may see a world with graphene enhanced batteries first simply by adding one layer of grapping the batteries would result in significant performance enhancement graphene could cover both the cathode and the anode resulting in such times four to five times faster than currently possible because normal batteries would degrade quickly at this charging speeds as lithium doesn't like a lot of energy in or off due to its resistance so for such reasons the first consumer great graphene batteries are likely to be hybrids so why aren't graphene batteries here yet graphene is really hard to make imagine that you are trying to perfectly position a bunch of carbon atoms into a hexagonal honeycomb one atom thick with no defects making two dimensional compound in their true forms is extremely difficult job because even the slightest contamination or defects can dramatically affect their properties and that kind of atomic precision in manufacturing has yet to be achieved on top of this they will likely stack up due to van der waals interaction which is how graphene becomes graphite which is basically a symbol of defective references stack on top of each other pristine wrapping or pure graphene is extremely difficult to make and is typically done by chemical vapor deposition of carbon atoms onto a copper sheet which stabilizes the honeycomb like structure there is a pretty wide gap on going from lab to mass production so for these reasons it has been joked about as the graphene can do everything but leave the lab so where are we today commercial use of graphene with demand for fresh water around the world also on the rise graphene may be the answer to this challenge too physicists in china and the u.s have invented a graphene-based desalination membrane that can remove salt from seawater it's a combination of single graphene seed and a carbon nanotube mess which creates a centimeter sized membrane which helps to filter salt from seawater italian motorcycle helmet manufacturer momo design now offers a range of helmet with graphene coated exterior cells according to the company the presence of graphene improves the distribution of impact force and dissipates heat faster than conventional materials could a company called real graphene has created a graphene enhanced lithium battery that is available for commercial use which you can purchase right now and the link is available in the description anyways it can cut phone charging time from an hour and a half to 20 minutes and it lasts three to five times longer than conventional lithium batteries and generate less heat too this was achieved by mixing wrapping in with the lithium and introducing a composite layer of graphene revolutionary graphene nanotechnology can be applied to paint glasses plastic wheels etc so graphene has been used in commercial form one way or the other but where are we right now conclusion for tesla and your part when graphene is ready to be mass produced and implemented in ev batteries in a cost effective fashion tesla being the leader in the ev battery tech and production will be ready and waiting for graphene batteries if elon musk doesn't mention about graphing at battery investor day then we need to get a shareholder to ask him directly about tesla's plan and thoughts on graphene if you like to help ensure this happens feel free to share this video so we can increase the chances of learning about tesla's true thoughts on graphene so there we have it what are your thoughts on tesla and graphene let me know in the comment section down below thank you so much for watching and i'll see you again in the next one
