 this year's Nobel Prize for chemistry was awarded to good enough wit Ingham and Yoshino for their work on developing lithium-ion batteries so what are lithium mmm buying batteries and what how do they work well a lithium-ion battery is a highly power battery so they typically consist of two layered electrodes with an electrolyte in between one of these layered materials is a transition metal oxide system and the other is typically graphite and now we're going to invite Lizzy in to help me demonstrate how a lithium ion battery works on charging so when you charge your phone you were removing lithium from one of the layers its materials into the other one so we've charged a Pho and now we want to use the phone so when we use the phone the lithium's move back and so this ease of movement between these two different layered materials is key to their long life and they're efficient recharge ability so lithium ion battery technology was actually first investigated in the 1970s in the oil crisis then when people were trying to develop alternative efficient energy technologies and it's quite significant that today's Nobel Prize award actually ties in with the fact that they're gaining further momentum with the push to replace petrol and diesel powered vehicles with all electric cars which will also operate with a lithium ion battery and that Burmingham we are researching all aspects of these types of batteries from developing new cathode materials to new anode materials and also investigating ways to recycle these safely and efficiently so when we get end-of-life electric vehicles we can take these the battery pack we can recover the materials safely and efficiently and we can manufacture new cells this year's chemistry Nobel Prize is an example of something that you can literally say I've got a Nobel prize-winning discovery in my pocket
