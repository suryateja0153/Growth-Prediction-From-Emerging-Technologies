about how to use 2201 to get out of apartheid South Africa so I got told this story when my cousin was about to get married because he needed a diamond and he was gonna go buy one and his dad said don't so back in the 70s when my uncle and his family were living in South Africa anyone who wasn't Dutch white so that would be blacks Jews including us anyone else was considered second-class citizens by the apartheid government and you were allowed to leave because they didn't want you there but you had to surrender all of your funds to the government in order to leave which is you know give me everything you have and then you can leave the country penniless it's not a winning proposition so my uncle and his brother devised a pretty brilliant idea to get their funds out of South Africa unnoticed they were both dentists or radiologists or some sort of medical doctor that requires x-ray reading so one of them gave the other one all of his money then reported bank statements to the apartheid government and said I'm pretty much piling up penniless my practice went broke I want to leave the country and they said okay get out of here so he went to the u.s. established a dental or radiological or some other sort of practice I forget which one and started requesting his brother back in South Africa to send him x-rays to read to help boost his business because that was their actual business it was pretty legit so then my uncle would send him packets of x-rays to interpret and send back except that every you know there would be ten x-rays on the front and ten on the bottom and the middle eighty whidbey hollowed out now that would that would have ordinarily have tripped off alarms because any change in density would trigger a change in x-ray contrast because these packages were being inspected by x-ray and if it looked like these x-rays were Hollow and you're smuggling something out they'd be caught and confiscated so what sort of materials are valuable that you find in South Africa that are pretty similar in x-ray contrast to other light media like film diamonds so the remaining brother went and converted all of his life savings into diamonds which is something that you can do in South Africa because this is where diamonds come from he then slowly over a period of months or years sent packets of hollow x-rays full of diamonds to his brother in the States knowing full well that the mass attenuation coefficients of soft tissue and carbon are pretty similar and so are their densities so their total attenuation coefficients are pretty similar to let's pull those up so we can check it carbon graphite I'm gonna have a new tab and bring up soft tissue and we can compare them let's say what's the what's the most similar as long as you can see it thing to film what should we call film here x-ray film photographic emulsion how about that is there something Kodak okay where's the Kodak standard nuclear I don't think that sounds right let's go with polyethylene and plastic carbon plastic carbon plastic carbon plastic basically identical so this is a way they were able to smuggle wealth out of the country without x-ray contrast tripping off the guards and once all the slave savings had been converted into diamonds he then went to the government and said I'm penniless my practice won't grow it broke I want to get out of here and they said good riddance yeah so they were able to restart their life in the States with all of the money that they had had in South Africa and when my cousin wanted to get married and said I'm thinking of buying a diamond my uncle just said oh don't he's like what don't get married no don't buy a diamond here let me take you to the diamond drawer yeah because there was something left over so he said pick out an extra diamond and that's the story of my cousin's engagement ring as well as why part of my family's here in the states yeah very very nuclear diamond story you know diamonds aren't forever as the finish have shown us but they can get you out of repressive regimes okay back to the DOS stuff so today and for the rest of the course we get into biological and chemical effects of radiation as soon as this pops up and so in the first slide is everything you need to know about dose and units don't worry it's not up there yet I know that different units of dose are a common point of confusion so I wanted to put everything on one slide so you can refer back to it like a cheat sheet so you've probably heard of the roentgen before you've definitely seen the roentgen as a unit because you've all looked in those pen or pocket dosimeter z-- that you actually had at the nuclear reactor when you guys took a tour of it and control the control rods the Renkin is not really a unit that we use much anymore for for very careful calculations because you have to do some tissue equivalency stuff in order to go from Ayana stations in air which is what it actually measures it's a mount of charge dissipated or built up in air to some damage to soft tissue and the way you actually calculate renkins from first principles linking the physics and the biology part is remember this equation here stopping power which is some energy transfer divided by the energy required to make an ion each one of those will give one electron unit of charge towards those coulombs and so this is the direct link between the physics and the chemistry biology in this course it's not something that's done that carefully in any of the readings which is why I'm gonna harp on it here in lecture is these two parts of the course are often taught differently and they're actually totally related and everything's all the same which is kind of nice you don't have to just relearn a whole new lingo in field then there's the SI units of dose the ones that when you do calculations in the homework and the rest of your life I recommend that you use whenever possible because they're in units that we're familiar with in standard units the one where you start with all along is the gray a gray is the simple measure of absorbed energy in joules per kilogram of whatever and so calculating it is fairly straightforward - for example if you want to know what sort of dose you would get in gray from absorbing gamma rays you can use this old equation from the first third of the course and if you integrate this from the let's say over the range of whatever object or person you happen to be a radiating you'll get some fractional difference in intensity that multiplied by the original intensity of gammas which could be given and maybe gamma rays per centimeter squared per second maybe times time to get total number of gammas per centimeter squared multiplied all that multiplied by the energy of each gamma divided by the mass of whatever is doing the absorbing equals your dose and great so you can use all the old stuff from previous parts of the course directly to calculate dose and grain and this is the starting point for any calculation if you don't know what tissue is exposed what type of radiation provides what biological effectiveness it doesn't matter you just start here then the other unit you may have seen is a unit not of energy absorption but of increased risk for something going wrong in the biological sense it's called the sievert for simple things like whole body dose from gamma rays sieverts equals gray because sievert is multiplied by this quality factor or this effectiveness factor that q factor is actually a couple of factors there's a queue for the type of tissue and there's a queue for the type of radiation and the total quality factor for whatever you're trying to calculate is just the multiplication of these two and so it's fairly easy if you're ever dealing with whole body gamma dose GRA equals sieverts if you're dealing with pretty much anything different gray does not equal sieverts there'll be just some factor to add in which can be looked up from a lookup table but as you've told you before I don't like that explanation look it up in a table we're going to explore why the look-up tables are constructed the way they are and then there's the CGS units the ones that are based in centimeter grams second instead of kilogram meter second the rad is a simple measure it's let's say a hundred rad is just one gray where the rat actually comes from as its defined as a hundred eggs absorbed energy per gram where an ERG is ten to the minus seven joules and a gram is ten to the minus three kilograms and so you can do the mental math there to make sure these all work out and then a REM a roentgen equivalent man is just a hundredth of a sievert so there's historical basis for this back in the day more folks to use CGS units there's been a push to SI units which I happen to like because everything works out and you don't have to remember things like ten to the minus seven joules or whatever like that so I'd say when in doubt for equal comparisons always use the SI units and always start with the gray because that's something where you can take a physical calculation of energy per kilogram and go into some increased cancer risk by using the dose quality factors so let's take a look at how these appear first of all gammas x-rays electrons positrons of any le t le t as i mentioned before is linear energy transfer and to put this mathematically you've actually seen this before which would be some change in energy over some change in distance it's the stopping power it's not like the stopping power it's the stopping power so with the formulas you got in the second half of this class you can calculate linear energy transfer now why are these things given in let's say discrete tables or now what's currently recommended is these functions does anyone have any idea how many of your course seven friends know the formula for stopping power or could parse it even her understand it you don't have to not everybody has to so for the rest of us there are simpler empirical relations or relations that get the numbers right that aren't necessarily based on physics so a simple lookup table for those who don't have time to take 20 201 or something beyond is the easiest thing to do and in most cases it works it's not exact but it's probably close enough given uncertainties in the amount of radiation that one could absorb or the weight of a certain organ or the energy of some x-ray tube I think these these empirical things are pretty much good enough and what this tells you is that there's some effectiveness of different types of radiation and different energies of radiation at imparting energy to the parts of cells and organs that cause damage to say that in a little smaller sentence different energies of radiation can have different effects biologically and these tissue factors account for that it's also a table I want you to keep in mind because you're going to have to do a calculation about it the principal elements in soft tissue in unit density otherwise known as number density what you've seen before if you want to calculate the dose using a stopping power formula to a human you have to know what this human is made of and this is a pretty good assumption and this is something you'll be doing on homework number eight is finding the dose that you're giving to each other in a particular situation if anyone's seen the particular situation check OCW for last year's course and you'll see what that situation will be has everyone gotten your whole body counts at the EHS office if anyone hasn't do them in the next week because you'll need that data for the homework you'll also need this table because if you think about it if you want to say well what's the damage by electrons to soft tissue and you want to calculate this from scratch you have these four number densities so we'll keep those in account and let's put up the formula for stopping power for ionization stopping power again comes out with four PI K naught squared little Z squared big Z number density e to the fourth over MeV squared log let's see what goes on top again oh yeah two MeV squared over the mean ionization energy the nonrelativistic form which of these terms vary depending on the atom that an electron or whatever would strike a circle of this there's a couple big Z what the electrons hitting and the number density yes the iron is mean ionization potential so these three terms are the only things that changed when you're doing a stopping power to dose calculation so if you want to get the total dose in gray to a human you have to sum over these four different isotopes actually wait let me put all the other junk in front to make it quicker so the four PI K naught squared little Z squared e to the fourth over MeV squared is just a constant times the sum over all your isotopes of zi the number density of isotope I which inside there has the element fraction of that times the log of 2 MeV squared over the mean ionization potential of isotope I and in this case notice there's no isotopes given they're just given as elements why do we do that why don't we care for humans how many isotopes of hydrogen tend to exist in you one pretty much one two about five significant digits you'll all have a little deuterium something like one in every twenty thousand atoms of hydrogen is deuterium but it's it's not a lot I think it's even less than that carbons just carbon-12 except for the tiny amount of carbon-14 you're used for radiocarbon dating oxygen oxygen think what sixteen nitrogen's nitrogen 14 so as long as you know what isotopes to use you'll know what Z's what I bars and the number densities given here so this right here is how you calculate dose and gray to a human over some distance then all you'd have to do is integrate that over your let's say thickness of the human whatever that happens to be and you get the total amount of dose imparted to them so a lot of questions came up in last year's class how do we actually do these calculations well this is how right here first separate out everything that's a constant because you only have to calculate it once as I hope problem set seven and six taught you guys is separate out whatever you can first and don't repeat yourself then sum over all the things that are unique to each isotope and inside this number density is the fraction of that isotope at every human so it's all built in so these calculations aren't that bad since you know how to do stopping power you can take out two-thirds of the terms I don't know I still have this it's not terrible so can anyone not see through how to do this alright yeah question the mean ionization potential can be usually approximated as about 10 electron volts times Z except for the very light isotopes like hydrogen it's somewhere between 10 and 19 Evy I would say one you can just look them up or two you can use this empirical relation to get a good approximation and empiricism definitely enters into the biological world because uncertainty is abound and it's not always worth being ultra crazy exact although you can't hurt any other questions on how to actually carry out a dose calculation using stopping power hopefully it's pretty straightforward guess we'll find out on the homework the other quality factors to mention there's been some different there are some different ideas about these quality factors notice the scales are fairly coarse so again there's a lot of uncertainty or slop in these values but notice that for let's say x-rays gammas betas of all energies and charges the quality factors one why do you think that is let's go for the case of x-rays or gamma x' what tends to be the attenuation coefficient of any photon in soft-tissue of considerable energy pretty low and the amount of energy that can be transferred by those photons is variable anywhere from pretty low to pretty high and so the resulting electron cascade isn't going to be that damaging and it might not even be that localized so let's say if you really want to know how much damages are going to go due to the DNA of a cell where it could mutate and cause cancer not that much most of the gammas passed through you and the ones that do get absorbed can have rather long energy deposition tracks neutrons however interact nuclear stopping power well so they just interact with the nuclei of you or whatever they are radiating and so when you knock out a nucleus it can then slam in two other atoms causing a huge and dense cascade of ionization if that cascade happens to be near the nucleus of a cell you better believe it's going to cause a lot of damage and that's why these more energetic neutrons have a much higher quality factor because they're much better at causing damage until you reach some sort of threshold why do you think it goes down at higher energies yep absolutely right around 2 MeV or 1 MeV these cross-sections tend to go down if we look at the cross section for neutrons and anything let's look at hydrogen you guys still that I do the screen Cloney thing again just bear with me let's look at any old cross-section for let's say neutron scattering and I don't know oxygen we've looked at hydrogen enough already cool see that oxygen-16 we have incident neutrons elastic scattering the bouncing off let's look at the form of this cross-section right around one MeV things start to dip and so yeah the probability of any sort of interaction is going to go down in addition the atom that's struck has a much higher energy and therefore a higher range so so chances are even if the neutron strikes an atom near the nucleus it will have a higher range and can travel farther before that secondary cascade ends up depositing most of its damage at a lower energy so if you remember for the stopping power for ionization or nuclear stopping power they both look the same so I'm not gonna label which one it's fairly low at high energies peaks at a rather low energy and then comes down so it's at the end of the range of whatever particle whether it be the neutron or the atoms that it's struck that it does the most damage so you can kind of think like all forms of radiation except for photons as armor-piercing bullets they don't do damage right where they enter they do damage right where they stop and explode in the case of armor-piercing bullets it's a literal explosion in the case of neutrons electrons protons heavy ions it's at the end of their range they have the most stopping power and that's where the dense Cascades gonna be so chances are again if the neutron happens to interact with the nucleus of a cell say that's the simplest cell I can draw if a neutron comes in and strikes another atom it may move far away before it's armor-piercing explosion let's see the other ones for protons depending on which book you go to you get a different effectiveness it's higher than that of gammas and x-rays and electrons because you get a big cascade at the end and alpha particles really really damaging and energy is like even a few MeV they have a very short range they tend to deposit a ton of energy and that's why they have a huge effectiveness is also why alphas are the that's the one cook you don't want to eat if you guys remember this before cookies problem never eat the Alpha it's not gonna get in through your skin but if it gets into your body and incorporated into the material directly surrounding your nucleus that's how things go really bad that's why smokings so bad did anyone end up getting into a smoke shop to do that measurement I did check the one by my house and they just put up a sign that said no one under 21 so you guys are right about that that weird law whatever now let's look at the tissue weighting factors we've talked about the issue they've talked about the factors for different types of radiation it also matters what tissue it enters so for things like skin or bone surface you think of these tissues as not that critical if you get a scratch and you lose some skin it's not that bad for the body same thing if a little bone chip flakes off you might get shin splints but it's not so bad not for the same reason these tissues aren't dividing very fast the surface of your bone the hard part it's basically standing still it's just calcified minerals with some osteocytes trapped in there not much happens what's happening in these tissues constantly gonads bone marrow colon lung stomach yep this is where stem cells and fat rapidly dividing cells tend to be found so there's been some theories in some papers saying whatever cancer you're going to get you probably already got it in the first few years of life when you're just a big rolling sack of stem cells this is part of why occupational hazards for infants and pregnant women are much much lower because they are giant sacks of stationary stem cells and you don't want to irradiated Steve IDing really really fast and so the older you are that's more okay it is to get more and more radiation dose because a lot of these effects take a long time to manifest because they all start with a single cell and it takes a long time for that single cell to exponentially grow and divide over a long time scale into a mass that'd be considered a tumor so it's you know a little worrying to think okay probably most of the cancer I'll get I got when I was five but then again it means don't worry about it what can you do you can there's what it's for yeah it's free it's done not all of it you can still limit your dose because will one any acute radiation exposure will have short term health effects and to your cells are still dividing a you know as what am i as we had a seminar speaker say a biological organism at static equilibrium is not very interesting it's dead it's not dividing anymore so your cells are still dividing it still means you should minimize radiation exposure but a lot of what happened already happened and if you can see here the pattern is well the more rapidly the cells are dividing the more it has this tissue equivalent issue quality factor because the more the more quickly these effects would manifest themselves and the more quickly the cells may divide with that mutation before the cellular repair mechanisms fix that mutation before a division we'll get into a lot of that when we talk about biological effects probably next week so now how do you do a calculation of dose in sieverts first you can take the dose in gray like we have over here multiplied by these radiation weighting factors and you get a total amount of dose to that tissue where that tissue may be a certain organ a part of your muscle whole body if it was a broad you know blast of radiation from a bomb far away or something like that and you get these single doses to tissue where each of these radiation equivalent factors can be equated to this average quality factor where you integrate the quality factor as a function of length times the dose at that length this is where the stopping power formula comes in is you'll have a stopping power as the energy decreases as the particle moves through the material and it's stopping power will change so then you have to integrate that stopping power times some constants and stuff over that distance times the quality at that distance to get the simple weighting factor you then take these weighting factors plug them into your dose to tissue and sum up all the exposures to different tissues so each tissue will have its own dose and sieverts it'll have its own tissue weighting factor you sum up all the tissues exposed and you get the total effective dose to the whole body this means that some organs incurred dose faster than others for the same radiation exposure so the whole body dose should sum up to one and I believe I remember doing this calculation but it may be worth your while to just try it these numbers should sum up to one because all of these individual organs plus the remainder of your body should constitute the whole body and so this is in a nutshell how you do these dose calculations so let's take an example from the actual reading let's say a worker gets 14 milligram whole body dose this would just be from background radiation cosmic rays food whatever plus a targeted dose of 8 milligram from alphas plus a hundred eighty milligram betas in the thyroid anyone know why they chose alphas in the lung and betas in the thyroid what's the most likely sore of those iodine and let's say smoking yeah yep exactly is as we saw a lot of the radon daughter products tend to be alpha emitters and you tend to inhale those through the lungs and iodine is a beta decay with about a half with about an eight-day half-life and that gets preferentially absorbed in the thyroid so this is a pretty realistic scenario and we'd say how much effective dose did this person get to do this calculation you first the list goes through those steps you look at the dose to each tissue times the effectiveness for that type of radiation so the dose got eight mil agree Alfa's so you multiply by 24 that quality factor and the lung gets 160 millisieverts you do the multiplication for the thyroid the multiplication for the whole body and then you do a summation of these single tissue doses here here and here times the tissue weighting factors which you then look up from that table or calculate from the cell division rate here here and here and you get a total dose of 42 millisieverts so I want to point something out to you guys his thyroid got a hundred eighty millisieverts he got 42 millisieverts interesting sounds a little counterintuitive but in this case these doses for each tissue are calculated for that tissue so if you have a probability of organ failure or mutation you can now then know how much increased risk he may have of thyroid cancer specifically or sum it up to an equivalent whole body risk and it just so happens you're only allowed about 50 millisieverts of exposure so he'd only be allowed another eight but we'll get into limits and what this I see are you whatever whatever means actually show you the document it's also posted online this in term at International Committee on radiation you I forget what the U is but this is the whole document that for that has the basis for these recommendations the numbers and the reasons and that's all online for you guys to check through so anyone have any questions on a example dose calculation cool let's look at some of the ways that you'd actually measure dose one of them we looked at the first day of class the old Chadwick experiment send radiation through a fixed amount of area so you know the flux if you know the total amount of gammas being produced by this x-ray tube you know the area then you know the solid angle you know the flux then you have just a free air chamber with a high voltage to suck up those ions before they recombine and that's how you can calculate things like dose and roentgens you also have pocket versions of these things sealed tubes with two electrically insulated electrodes and that cannot discharge unless ions in the gas allow them to and this is the basis behind these civil defense air wall chambers one of which I happen to have right here so I want to pass this around and let you guys take a look at it like the ones you saw in the reactor you can look through and see a little needle that will tell you the not dose but the amount of ionization this thing has received in roentgens which can then be equated with some calculations to dose and soft-tissue and also there's the base for the civil-defense dosimeter I want to tell you guys how it works it's a battery that's it you open that thing up there's a couple of big D cells in there and I ran a voltage divider and you just turn the knob which sounds complicated all you're doing is turning a potentiometer to decide at what voltage this wire end inside of the tube will be and that voltage deflects the wire a little bit by just cool ah back attraction or repulsion bends it and gives you the dose and it stays there nothing can get in or out of that sealed chamber except penetrating radiation when gammas or some are neutrons get through they can cause ionizations in the gas those gas ions can move to these electrodes partially neutralizing them making the needle tilt a little farther and a little farther so the interesting thing is when that needle reads zero roentgens it's fully charged and as the detector discharges from radiation interactions the needle moves higher on the roentgens scale because you can paint whatever scale you want on it as long as the physics works out so it's kind of neat to think that the charge is highest when the dose is lowest because all the charges doing is deflecting that little needle quite simple design and quite robust these things were designed by civil defense in case of a the case the Cold War became a hot war and they'd have to last for a very long time so having had this one for about ten years I can tell you I've not yet filled the meter which is probably a good thing and I took that on flights across the world and hiking in Nepal where the background dose was considerably higher and the needle moved like half a roentgen for the entire three weeks up at elevation and plane rides and I got more dose on the plane ride than I did on the hike interesting fun fact like the ones use that's pretty much exactly what you should see and so Alex tells me these things are starting to get kind of rare on eBay and that's a shame because this is the best possible teaching dosimeter there is if you understand 802 and a little bit of radiation you know how these work and can predict what the dose is actually going to be now how do you do things like detect neutrons if you want to detect neutrons you want a good moderator because well moderated Neutron deposit all their energy in the detector instead of bouncing off transferring a little energy and leaving if you want to know how many and what energy neutrons you have you can fill a similar chamber that's got a high voltage it's got wire on the inside but instead of air or you know some other gas in there you can fill it with things like ethylene or propylene or some sort of very hydrogenous hydrocarbon gas something full of hydrogen to act as a good moderator that hydrogen ion then becomes a proton which then damages a lot of other ions causing an ionization cascade and leading to some current pulse just like any other detector there's going to be some movement of current which is picked up as damage you might then ask also why is that alpha source there anyone have any idea that's your calibration source so as that gas in this chamber is attacked by neutrons you will be blasting some of the hydrogen ions there hydrogen atoms out of the ethylene or propylene or whatever gas you have the gas will change in effectiveness over time the energy of the alpha particles will not so that is your absolutely fixed energy calibration source so you know exactly if let's say three point seven two MeV alphas make a current pulse of a certain height then you can equate that to a three point seven two MeV Neutron that would strike a hydrogen atom and because the gas degrades over time you have to recalibrate with that built-in alpha and any sort of shutter like a you know a little piece of foil will block the alpha so that you can use it as a neutron detector quite clever design in my opinion it accounts for the degradation of the gas in the detector anyone seen one of these things before okay then there's the Geiger counter which is an ionization counter run in avalanche mode you can use these free air ionization chambers or other counters as a an energy proportional counter where a higher energy particle will impart a bigger ionization cascade and you can use that to get energy resolution or you crank up the voltage like crazy so that any count of any energy causes an intense ionization cascade and a huge current pulse and this is the basis behind chief geiger counters like the ones we build in our department those old Soviet SPM 20 tubes that we've actually bits actually been survived being stepped on and crushed as long as the electrodes don't short out they still work so there's a few folks in the department that have clearly bent geiger tubes that one of them looks like they've been chewed but they still work because any sort of anything interacting with the gas will cause an ionization cascade which is immediately sucked into the electrodes by a high voltage and collected as a current pulse and that's just a cutaway of what it looks like on the inside and this is the circuit for a Geiger counter there is a voltage a resistor a capacitor and a tube that's all you need everything else in the MIT Geiger counter is there to make lights and sound it's just for fun but the actual Geiger counter itself can be made incredibly compact the bigger the tube the more radiation it will catch just cuz of its size but otherwise as long as you get the voltage high enough to cause this ionization cascade it works it's really really robust so I want to skip ahead for some of that stuff and then talk about how do you measure dose in humans who here has seen one of these TL DS or thermo luminescent dosimeter before our reactor trainees have and you've worked on nuclear stuff too right you've got one in the vault wait Kristin what about you since you've worked that's exactly what this is yeah and you can shake it at rattles right yep exactly so that's this is how these work that stands for a thermo luminescent dosimeter and converting from Latin to English that means if you heat it it produces light proportional to the dose that it gets so these little crystals aluminum oxide or some sort of a salt or whatever have you something that creates permanent ionized defects will relax when you heat them giving off light and then you use a light counter to tell how much dose this crystal has received and by putting different filters in the way for different pieces and looking at the light coming from different parts you can tell different types of dose so one works for beta's because betas can get through the little hole in the detector whereas this may help you figure out gammas or neutrons of different energies and who here seeing one of these ring badges yeah so again the reactor trainees great if you shake them you hear a little rattling try it next time they're usually pretty loose it's a cheap plastic crappy casting with a thermal luminescent crystal in the inside so again shake it it should rattle if it doesn't the crystal might be missing and you should probably get a new one so when you read a TLD it's they use this fancy machine all it does is heat it very carefully and allow the electrons that are trapped at a higher energy to jump back down emitting visible light that's it we've seen this process before what happens after the photoelectric effect electrons fall down an energy and release light in the form of x-rays or visible light same thing and then let's talk about how can you use dosimeter x' for dosimetry in medical applications and let's take the example of proton beam therapy the new and more upcoming replacement to x-ray therapy it relies on the fact that the stopping power of protons is extremely low until they reach the end of their range like we talked about here so again we use protons as armor piercing bullets to get through the person drilling a little hole in the process and exploding once they reach the tumor it's a nice quirk of physics it's really an elegant use of the stuff in 2201 to do damage where you want it to there's all sorts of other methods of cancer treatment let's say you simple and you can just go with exigent which means cutting it out chemotherapy which is a pretty nasty process and it's usually used as a backup for radiation therapy to catch whatever else might be floating x-ray therapy which is still used a lot but hopefully we'll get phased out a bit brachytherapy where you implant a little seed of a beta emitter into the an area near where the tumor is let's say you have an easy route of entry like that way then you can implant one of these seeds right where the tumor is but if you can't have an easy route of entry that's where proton therapy comes in and as we talked about x-ray therapy if you want to damage the tumor more than the rest of the brain or the rest of the person you have to come in from different angles so that the sum of all the dose to this target is less than anywhere else and x-ray therapy tends to do a lot of damage well you hear of x-ray therapy causing hair loss and people well yeah you're going through the head it's not good for your hair follicles either and then there's proton therapy we've talked about it before but not in the strict medical sense and actually going to reveal to you guys a invention that we've got out of our department that might help this go a little better the way it works is you start with a cyclotron which I've already explained something that accelerates charged particles to about 250 MeV and we have one of these across the river at Mass General Hospital send them through bending magnets and bend them up so that they hit the patient then you move the patient on this gurney or table so then the gantry can rotate anywhere to come in from any entry point minimize the dose to the rest of the patient while frying the tumor yep quite big yeah it's pretty to scale yeah so time on this instrument runs in the thousands per hour if you go through the back door and know the folks that run the thing and know when it's not being used for cancer treatments proton therapy can run in the hundreds of thousands of dollars this is one of the millions of reasons we have medical insurance because when you need it you want it and these cyclotrons aren't cheap the way they work is pretty simple you inject ionized particles through these D magnets and they go faster and faster and faster every time they cross this electric field they Bend at larger and larger tracks through these magnets as their energy increases then they exit out the other side getting delivered to the patient and why protons versus x-ray this well I made a quick desmos graph to say let's say you started off with equivalent dose of protons and x-rays and you're trying to get to a forty millimeter deep tumor this is why this is the amount of dose that the x-rays would give compared to the protons in this highlighted tumor region then you look at the dose where x-rays and protons give to the rest of the person it should be graphically obvious and you can do some tricks with proton therapy if you have a long tumor you can vary the energy and time at each point such that you give a uniform dose to the tumor so you can move that Bragg peak by degrading the proton energy by putting filters in line with the beam you don't tend to like to change the energy of the beam so you can put things in the way of the protons to slow them down and because when the stopping power is very low the protons speed is very high and forward scattering is preferable putting things in the way of the beam pretty much just slows them down but doesn't change their direction that breaks that assumption breaks down when the energy gets low but when the energy gets low you better be in the tumor anyway and you want them to change direction and explode out and blast everything in sight the problem with proton therapy is that humans are not biological organisms that static equilibrium in other words they're alive they tend to move breathing is something I like to do every few seconds swallowing maybe once every couple minutes and most of your organs move around and dance without your controlling them that's really hard if you're trying to hit a tumor on a moving target that is the main problem with proton therapy the the solution right now I like to call it spray-and-pray you fire into the person hope that things don't move we know that they do though those proton beams are very narrow and let's say for abdominal patients let's say you happen to be digesting something your intestines will just go crush lock like that and get lunch where it's going this is one of those reasons that they say don't eat anything before these procedures if you're not actively digesting things then your abdomen won't be moving as much thorax six patients better known as the lungs or your thorax if you're from France my wife likes to make I like to make fun of my wife that's right she still refers to this region as the thorax and I was like I am NOT a giant beetle but it is the it is the medical term for this you tend to breathe and if you actually measure how much you move when you breathe in and out let's say you're trying to fry a lung tumor that's a tricky proposition so how do you keep the protons on track ideally some dosimeter would be able to determine absolute dose and it would be able to where on this list of things is oh there's even more things I'd want here so ideally if you'd want a proton dose immuno you want to be able to measure things provide some data not be orientation dependent and things like not be toxic be cheap to build but also be able to turn on and off if the tumor moves out of range and this problem hasn't been solved yet existing dosimetry methods include making calculations and hoping which is what we do now we do complex Monte Carlos calculations based on scans of the patient try and map out how much energy is going to be lost and where to go in there's conventional port films which means you put a film on the entry of the patient which gives you an idea of where the beam is but not necessarily where the organ is let me get into some pictures of these things so you know what they look like anyone ever put one of these in your mouth the sort of electronic dosimeter their x-ray images that you get at the dentist you bite down on one of these and you get x-rays of your teeth that's great if you have a place to put them but doesn't quite work for proton therapy there are tissue equivalent gels where you can cast a person in gel fire in the proton beam and see how deep it goes and then hope that your tissue equivalent gel is equivalent to the tissue usually is pretty good there's silicon diodes you can implant a tiny little diode or other semiconductor device near or in the patient and measure the change in bandgap or the voltage required to turn on conduction in the semiconductor the problem is you can only use them once once you array D 8 AP s-- of silicon its irradiated and then you would have to take it out and stick another one in with a big needle to keep going there's optically stimulated luminescence which means protons hit stuff stuff creates light light can be measured in real time so you could implant a little crystal like this TLD or thermo luminescence emitter attached to a fiber-optic cable and in that way you can measure the amount of light and pre amplify it PM means what is it photomultiplier tube and use electronics and software to calculate that light and turn it into dose problem is this scintillation it's not very strong there's a lot that can go wrong between where the radiation is done and where it can be collected also implanted MOSFETs are these metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors same problem you can look at the change in difference let's say I'm sorry the change in bandgap as you--as radiates these things or in the mosfet voltage but again you can only use them once it's not like you can reset them so the problems with all of these is we don't know what dose the tumor gets if we know how much we need to fry it but we don't know if we fried it the cancer could recur or it may not respond to the radiation these are liability terms to say it didn't work but you can't sue us because we don't know why and you don't know why or you may apply too much dose to the surrounding tissue and induce secondary tumors this is one of those things that's not talked about very much except in medical circles and my entire family happens to be in medical circles so they confirm yeah this is true we don't know how many times if you treat a tumor do you induce another one that will pop up five years later in the same site all you may think is okay it recurred despite being dead for five years it might not have recurred it might have made a new one you don't know the dose rate versus time the existing in situates haven't worked very well so we had another idea that I'll go in the last negative one minutes what we call the integrating F Center feedback dosimeter we just got the patent filed on this not accepted but filed with the US Patent Office it's pretty simple you send in calibrated light into a little crystal of something that creates these color centers or F centers when it's irradiated look at the light coming out see what's absorbed you know how much dose you've received and so the look at these three these parts a is just an alkali halide salt better known as table salt sodium chloride B is some biocompatible casing so your body doesn't reject it calibrated white light source fiber-optic connection cables and a spectrometer to read the absorption these can be little compact USB spectrometers and it relies on what's called F centers when you were radiate ionic materials they change color these defects produced by let's say blasting out a chlorine ion or a sodium or potassium ion are optically active because you get differing regions of electron density and you absorb certain wavelengths of light changing their color if you then send calibrated light through it you can tell what happened how much dose there was an F Center creation versus radiation is extremely well known we've actually done some preliminary tests on the Dante accelerator here to show that the amount of dose that you give in a fractional cancer treatment on the order of a kilogram so does cause these salts to respond very strongly and produce a color and the best part is they relax on their own after anywhere from five seconds to a few hours the color just disappears because the atomic defects relaxed so you don't have to employ remove re-implant remove and you can able dose rate information by putting multiple salts in a row that have different response levels to this these protons so by looking at the amount of absorption in each wavelength you can tell not just the dose but the dose rate calibrate your beam current and I want to skip all the way to the end to say how this would work so let's say you had one of these I F 2d dosimeter z' implanted in your tumor and your heart was beating or your lungs were breathing or you were digesting something you could then feedback this information to the proton accelerator to shut the beam off when the tumor moves out of range and send in tiny little pulses to say hey are you there little micro second pulses to say like microsecond of - of protons isn't going to do much but if it senses the aia i f2 was at i f.2d back and range it then blasts continuously and as soon as the I F 2d says no more dose it starts just putting those wakeup pulses back on so this would be a the first feedback way to apply proton therapy without screwing it up you can also install if2 D dosimeter z' near the tumor outside the tumor and play the work for a world's first game of radioactive proton operation don't hit the sides if you wonder if your beams on target you then steer it until it doesn't hit any of the I f2 DS and you know you're right through the gates on the tumor very important for certain sensitive tumors like chordomas spinal cord tumors which tend to happen in infants and young children yeah you know the work there's various ways of treating those other than removal of the neck what you don't want to do they're extremely difficult to operate on you don't want to give radiation therapy so highly targeted proton therapy like this making sure that you fry the tumor without the surrounding spinal cord and medulla would be probably the way to go for this so I'm gonna stop there because it's exactly 10:00 it's also the perfect stopping point and we'll pick up with background radiation tomorrow I also want to let you guys know that we'll be doing our nuclear activation analysis a radiations Friday at the beginning of recitation and we'll finish off recitation by doing the museum review you
