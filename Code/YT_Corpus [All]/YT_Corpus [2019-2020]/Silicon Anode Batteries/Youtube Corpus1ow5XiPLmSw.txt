 Good morning, welcome to Tel Aviv About the most important element in the Ivy Revolution electric vehicle evolution is the battery and store dot is working on defeating the range anxiety which is the problem of the driver and Not making sure not sure that he will have enough mileage to go So the experience of the driver in like a hundred years ago was roughly five minutes going and filling up the tank Right. So should we provide the same experience to the driver today? And we say yes, we should be able to do this. You don't need to charge overnight if you charge overnight It's inconvenient and people don't want to actually adopt an electric vehicle cause of this problem If you look at what's happening with with batteries and the prices, they're actually coming down dramatically today We are looking at roughly at a hundred and seventy five dollars per kilowatt hour and it expected to go down 60% by 2030 and this is where way after the harvest is gonna and heat actually, so the electrification electrification Is a major problem where you are trying to Get the perfect storm of the shared Connected and autonomous driving. In fact is in this So when you're doing slow charging we are looking at three to five hours of Charging and we are working on the five-minute charging for that You would need a much better infrastructure in order to enable this actually up to 750 kilowatt of a charging station, which is very dramatic so It's important to understand that if to enable ultra-fast charging this would only be possible New battery technology, okay So in order to do this we've assembled the team experts in chemistry in material science data scientists They are working on a new generation of lithium-ion battery. So this still eligium ion battery, but with a new generation So we are inventing methods that will never These materials can actually revolutionize the world of batteries because what we are trying to do is to get rid of the problem that Graphite and lithium react together and if you remember what happened to note 7 as an example This is something that can be a real safety concern so in order to enable fast charging we are taking out the graphite from the battery and Introducing something that is very new So why this we call this the flash battery technology and this is the only technology that enables safe and real ultra-fast charging of the battery so first of all Five minutes is what we are allowing the battery to be charged. And in those five minutes, it will be fully charged So in order to do that, we need to add some organic materials that protect the nano particles of let's say teen Silicon germanium. These are active materials that are known to have fast diffusion of the Lithium ions into the anode so in order to do this, we have innovative formulation that is optimized for cycle life energy density and the safety of the battery and Then we are also working and we'll talk about this in few minutes about the production facility, which will actually allow us to scale This production because there's going to be huge demand for batteries over time So the team that we have assembled and we are 110 people today and here in Celia, this is organic chemistry Nanotechnology and state-of-the-art data science that enables to walk on all this Data that is coming from the cyclists that are running charge and discharge of the batteries. So We are working in six teams. Each one is headed by a top scientist a Researcher one is the anode which is the most important when you charge when you charge all the ions of the lithium Moving to the anode right? So we are reinventing. How you Insert the ions into the anode Then you have the theme of the cathode that needs to balance the charge and discharge with a high rate of charging of the anode Electrolytes are also very important. This is the mechanism of how the ions move from cathode to anode So it requires to have some high voltage capabilities and low resistance and so forth the data science as we've mentioned that needs to give us information about the requirements for the artificial intelligence and the machine learning of all the vast data that is coming from the thousands of batteries that are being recycled and then of course you have the Structure of the cell how it's being built and then the electronics around it how you manage it? So just to give you an example of what these innovative materials can do You always have this a problem that the material itself is getting distorted and and there are problems with the structure it's getting into a cracks and if you can see in the bottom once you go through the cycling you get the the formation of the material is getting Very non structure in order to enable it and to protect it we are doing something that is called 3d binders that are like polymers that are self-healing that allow the Cracks in the material to actually heal itself in order to enable it to go through more and more Recycling as you as you move forward Inside the car it looks Different because you have to stack together Many of these modules in order to have a full pack So a project with Daimler for example, which is one of our lead investors is to introduce Hundreds of these modules into the pack each one of them can charge in five minutes and all of them together Also, of course are charge in parallel in five minutes So it's a question of the charging station in the infrastructure That should allow it and BP British Petroleum is also one of our key investors is working on the entire Ecosystem and infrastructure that would allow this high power to be introduced into the vehicle So Scott is only focused on the key element which is the the missing part is the battery All the rest is done by our ecosystem partners and investors So we work on the back row compatibility with the AC charging at home Which will always be slow but also on what is required from each gas station that is now becoming a charging station and BP has 18,000 of these stations that over the next decade they're gonna repurpose in order to be charging stations so just to give you an example of what can be done with a 750 kilowatt station and this is the prototype that we are currently experimenting with. So if you look even on a Tesla In five minutes, you would get three hundred two hundred and thirty two miles And this is of course without taking into account some losses in on the on the heat on the network and so forth But theoretically we are aiming for roughly two hundred and thirty miles That you would get in five minutes in a car like a Tesla. This is our goal And this is what we are going to demonstrate in in a couple of years As I mentioned we are also working on a production facility. We call it the one Giga We are only starting with one gigawatt. Our one gigawatt hour is roughly thirty thousand cars Per year, but it's gonna scale We are already designing it for 10 gigawatt hour, which is 300 thousand cars per year So this will scale we are currently raising 400 million for that facility We are looking at several locations preferably in the US So basically the future, you know, people say fast-charging will happen it's already here We are demonstrating it in our labs. This technology is something that was considered impossible Just until few years F Even five years ago when we first presented it people say that this will never happen, but the world of batteries is changing Prices are coming down and you will be able to charge your car in just a few minutes our Grandchildren will not believe that there was a time that we actually charged overnight This will be something that will be really archaic and people won't imagine that this was even possible And one more thing that I want to stress about the corporate culture that we are operating in and you can look at our website It is very important for us to give back to the community Because we are working on on green energy and in the the planet we are also Donating our options same way that we are giving options to our employees we are giving options back to the community through a public service venture funds like yet moi and other efforts that we do in order to make sure that the entire Communities is being supported Thank you very much You
