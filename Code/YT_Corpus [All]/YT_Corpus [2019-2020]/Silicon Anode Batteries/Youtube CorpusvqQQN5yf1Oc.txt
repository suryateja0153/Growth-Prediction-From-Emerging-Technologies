 the diode is a mainly resistive nonlinear passive electronic component with two terminals whose function is to allow the flow of electric current in one direction and virtually block it in the opposite direction the two diode terminals are called anode and cathode the electric current conventionally goes from the anode to the cathode following this direction opposite polarization of the diode will oppose a virtually infinite resistance the diode blocks the current reducing it to zero diodes are passive electronic components in fact they do not introduce energy into the circuit in which they are inserted and do not require an external power supply apart the input itself there are many kinds of diodes depending on its use they can be used in various electronic applications and they indeed are an integral part of many electronic devices. JAES in its catalog offers a wide range of diodes of the major manufacturers but how is a diode made? we can see that here inside is a semiconductor material in this specific case silicon theoretically pure silicon crystal has no free electrons in conduction band for this reason the silicon in question has been doped for doping we mean that the impurity inclusion is made by diffusing of certain elements in general this is obtained by using a very small percentage of atoms spread within a silicon crystal lattice these impurities even in negligible amount change dramatically the crystal electric behavior these atoms are called donor atoms since they yield electrons to the crystal lattice of silicon this creates two distinct parts within the diode with two different charge levels one part is doped in order to obtain an excess of electrons and therefore it is negatively charged while the other is doped in order to obtain an excess of holes and therefore positively-charged we will call n the negatively-charged part and p the positively-charged part thus distinguishing the so-called PN Junction now we can see that in the end part of the diode there is a majority of free electrons while in the P part there is a majority of electron holes which are the lack of an electron in a position where one could exist in an atom or atomic lattice in this situation the part n will have a tendency to release excess electrons since these will naturally move towards the holes available on the P side so the border region of the P side is slightly negatively charged and the border region on the N side is slightly positively charged a current called diffusion current will flow between the two parts and will try to balance this difference in the charges we can thus see the so-called depletion zone as there is a positive and negative charge in this area an electric field will be created which will go from the cathode Kay towards the anode a this electric field causes the generation of another current the drive current which will try to balance the previous diffusion current in case of an electric field an electrical potential will be created and consequentially a barrier potential the barrier potential is created when the electric field opposes a further migration of electrons from park n to park P this phenomenon creates some sort of barrier against the flow of electrons this barrier value is usually around 0.7 volts for silicon we here now connect the cathode to the positive Pole and the anode to the negative pole of a current generator in this case a battery by doing this an inverse polarization or an inverse bias condition is obtained the electrons and the holes are attracted in such a way to polarize the PN Junction to increase the region and consequentially prevent the flow of current the effective reverse polarization is to enlarge the depletion region if we try instead to connect the positive pole of the battery with the p side of the diode the situation changes completely the diode will be in a forward biased condition and the depletion region will shrink supposing now that our battery has enough voltage to overcome the potential barrier this will cause the movement of the electrons driven by the electric potential imposed by the battery when the electrons crossed the potential barrier their motion no longer meets resistance and will thus more easily occupy the holes in the P zone now the electrons that have moved from the inside to occupy the P side holes due to the attraction of the positive pole of the battery will move further going to occupy the nearby holes and so on until they flow through the external circuit this condition is known as direct polarization or forward bias condition of the diode in a nutshell the diode behaves like a non-return valve only in this case the flow is not represented by water but by electricity now let's try to vary the input voltage and observe the diode response with inverted voltage we can observe a negligible current in direct polarization and voltage lower than 0.7 volts a negligible current is observed but as soon as this potential barrier is overcome there will be a strong increase in current in any case we note that the voltage across the diode cannot exceed 0.7 volts very much even in the case of a high input voltage this depends on the forward bias condition in this case the diode places little electrical resistance in the reverse bias condition if a very high voltage is applied the diode could be damaged due to the rapid increase of the current for small increase of reverse voltage applied the diode characteristic of running the circuit in one direction only can be applied to many electronic devices such as the rectifier bridge in the positive half the circuit will run the current is shown these two diodes will find themselves in an inverse bias condition so they will block the current flow in the negative half the opposite occurs so we will get the same current direction on the load the output can be smoothed further by introducing a capacitive filter and a regulator finally if you found
