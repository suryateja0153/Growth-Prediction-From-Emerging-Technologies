 hello everybody and welcome back on september 22nd tesla plans to hold battery investor day at fremont facility everybody is going crazy with this background image that tesla updated on its official website i got curious about this background image when i first saw this post in facebook and the first thing that popped on my mind was graphene nanotubes and solid electrolytes and there are also many rumors about this silicon nanowire anodes as well therefore in this video we're gonna connect all the dots and look from different angles as what this technology is and what it means for tesla also real quick i really appreciate a thumbs up as it really helps with the youtube algorithm and these videos do take a really long time to make thank you and let's dive right in silicon nanowires now that image by itself is on the huge hint but there are some other really exciting things that we have uncovered by looking around and doing a little bit of digging south korean battery expert park soon wang said the battery may hint or silicon nanowire anode a breakthrough technology which can potentially increase both battery energy density and battery life sharply it is widely known that tesla has a facility in fremont called the road turner project this is where they build advanced battery technologies that are going to power the future tesla vehicles the really interesting part about this is an advanced lithium-ion battery company called amperiors recently moved about 25 months and ended up in the next block from tesla roadrunner battery facility that is too good to be a coincidence it's highly possible that tesla has already acquired the company but hasn't announced it yet and is waiting to unveil at the battery day ampere's technology is a company that is currently producing batteries utilizing silicon nanowire silicon nanowire when used as anode in battery dramatically improves the battery in terms of weight and density amperage technology also claims to deliver the highest energy density lithium ion batteries in the world if you take a look at silicon nanowire then we can see the visual similarity between the technology and the background image on tesla's website let's see how we can achieve such results silicon has been researched for a long time as its potential used as an anode because compared to graphite silicon can hold 10 times more lithium than traditional carbon based anode and that is where you get the energy density so why isn't everyone using silicon in their anode well the major drawback is that they are really difficult to work with and we cannot get a long battery life out of it because silicon expands a lot as it takes lot of those lithium ion which can cause a lot of problems particularly known as cracking which dramatically lowers the energy capacity so obviously there are some technical challenges to overcome what tesla does is they are making a compound by mixing smaller percentage of silicon with graphite which results in higher energy density elon actually talked about this back in 2015 when tesla first unveiled duri grease mode on the model as you said quote we are shifting the cell chemistry for the upgraded pack to particularly use silicon in the anode this is just sort of a baby step in the direction of using silicon in the anode we're still primarily using synthetic graphite but over time we'll be increasing the amount of silicon in the anode okay so tesla is clearly trying to integrate more silicon in the anode it is certain that silicon nanowires will be utilized in next generation batteries but as of today it cannot be done at a commercial scale which leads us to the next hypothesis graphene batteries if you take a closer look at the background image and compare it with the lateral view of graphene and graphene nanotubes you will see some noticeable similarities if you didn't know about graphene then here is a quick summary wrapping is a wonder material of 21st century simply adding one layer of graphene could result in significant performance enhancements in batteries it is the best conductor of heat and electricity and by covering both the anode and the cathode with graphene results in charge times 4 to 5 times faster than currently possible while some of you may argue that graphene can do everything but leave the lab a company called real graphene has created graphene enhanced lithium battery that is available for commercial use so it seems that graphene has also taken some baby steps out of the lab but when it comes to batteries especially the batteries that are used in evs it doesn't make a lot of sense to use graphene as they are really expensive and don't make sense economically at least for now however when wrapping is ready to be mass produced and implemented in ev batteries in a cost effective fashion we will definitely see teslas powered with wrapping enhanced batteries you can check out this video where i cover more in depth about graphene batteries but before graphing batteries hit the market we will be seeing a major breakthrough in solid state batteries around the world solid state batteries it's no surprise that elon musk and tesla are going to announce some major battery breakthroughs at the battery day sandy mourner believes that this could be a solid straight battery announcement since he thinks that tesla already has a million mile battery that may actually already be in use so you might be wondering now how this image relates to a solid state battery well when you take a closer look at what's inside a solid state battery it becomes clear the solid line like structures look like anode cathode and solid electrolyte as well i may be doing some extreme level speculation right now but if you take a closer look at advancement in solid state batteries from toyota and other companies around the world we won't be surprised if tesla is developing their own version of solid state batteries which will be announced at the battery day in summary we know that tesla is planning to announce its own plan for large-scale battery manufacturing of its own sale using maxwell dry electrode technology we also know that tesla plans to announce some updated battery chemistry but the extent of the improvements tesla plans to announce is unclear i believe in order to avoid the osborne effect this lab may not be revealing the full potential of the batteries however i will take all of this information with the grain of salt as there are not any official announcement from tesla but there are a lot of inferences that can be drawn here it is exciting to see what tesla reveals at the battery day in september so anyway thank you for watching let me know what are your thoughts on the comment section down below do you think that tesla will not reveal any more information about the next generation batteries as it could affect this last current sales do you think we might see something different on battery day and of course if you have any idea for future videos then let me know plus if you are still watching then you are awesome have a nice day and i'll see you again in the next one
