 [Music] thank you Thank You professor Kang for that very nice introduction and it's a pleasure for me to be here at the second che symposium in honor of the founder and chairman of of SK I am the bee in BTS unfortunately I forgot to color my hair this morning and I can also not sing unless there's karaoke and and and other drinks so but but I think as you got from the previous two talks batteries play a quite important role in society so what I'm going to do today is talk to you about battery technology where it is where it is going why it's so important but then towards the end and hopefully I can keep you awake that long because two words I will show you really I think new vision of the future of how we accelerate innovation in this space I am lucky to be associated both with UC Berkeley and LBNL where there's a very large ecosystem of people doing computational modeling working in energy storage working in AI so it's an extremely productive environment in that space just to tell you who we are we're sort of a group of about 40 students and postdocs but like I said we are embedded in a much larger ecosystem what's maybe a bit unusual about this is that we kind of mix a lot of fundamental science also into applied science so while we have large applied programs on energy storage we have people who worry about quantum mechanics we have people who worry about AI in the group and that creates a sort of intellectually very stimulating environment that on occasion allows us to do something new so one of the reasons I think that everybody's interested in batteries that if you look at the outlook of the world and I've taken as an example here the BP Energy Outlook report that predicts that by 2040 70% of all primary energy growth so primary energy is basic all the energy inputs to the world whether it's for heating or for industry but 70 percent of that will be for electricity generation that's a remarkably large number right today electricity is only about 30 percent of primary energy use and 40 percent of that primary energy growth will be satisfied will be renewables right which is really meaning if you read it carefully more than half of all the growth in electricity will be satisfied will be rubles 30% of all miles driven will be electric that does not mean 30% of all cars will be electric but there if we believe in autonomous driving and if that will go electric the miles that people actually drive will be heavily electrified okay so it shows you that energy storage is needed at all scales right we store energy to carry our laptops and phones around now you have cordless power tools that are actually much better than the ones you plug into the wall we have the first generation of electric cars and we see energy storage appearing even where we didn't think it would appear in the grid and these days there are massive there are very large programs even in the aerospace industry the areas that if you had said this in the battery field 20 years ago that we were going to worry about batteries in airplanes people would have laughed you out of the room but today we see it appear for short-haul flights at one hour to two hour flight as an enormous interest in electric flight because of efficiency because of pollution because of noise control for example one benefit of electric flight is that you may be able to land in airports when the airport is closed because of noise or between midnight and 6 a.m. in many city airports but even the grid the grid was one of these topics where people did not even want to talk about electric energy storage here is in April 2019 the load curve for one day I think this is April 1 this is the load curve the amount of electricity used to throughout the day in California but the blue curve is actually the generation we need because the rest is made up by solar so this difference here is all the solar that's active in that's active in California today this is not planned solar this is already active today and I know that in the back you cannot see the scale but it's important this is in thousands of megawatts so gigawatts and if you don't know what a gigawatt is a large power plant a really large power plant is about a gigawatt a big nuclear power plant many you know gas fire power plants is smaller so this dip here from up here to down here that's 10 massive power plants you need to shut down between about 7:00 in the morning and noon and then you've just shut them down you need to RAM them back up in three to four hours this is how bad or how good depending on your point of perspective the electricity situation is now in California state with solar energy this is not only California's future right I don't know if you read about thirteen million dollar solar plan being built in in the middle east they will have exactly the same issues right we are not talking about building many gigawatts of solar we're not talking about 10 megawatts anymore the Solar plans being builder of the order of many gigawatts one thing that I want to stress that this looks like an impossible problem but if you do the math that with today's cost of energy storage moving sort of cutting this valley in half and moving storage from here to here will take about it would take about 13 will take about 20 22 25 gigawatt hour so in money that's about 20 30 billion dollars that may seem like a lot but the revenue of all electricity companies in California today is about thirty-five billion dollars so if you think of doing this over the next 10 years this is not such an impossible problem so when people tell you that we don't know how to do deal with the intermittency of wind and solar it's actually not true with today's numbers of what's already available on the market it's actually already possible so the question is what technology does it you know small stuff is all lithium-ion and this is already an amazing progression lithium-ion which was developed for poor of electronics has already moved into systems that are a thousand times bigger in terms of storage volume you know your phone is about 10 what our cars are many tens of kilowatt hour but now we're actually going into the grid as well which is another scale of a thousand so between the original invention of lithium-ion to where we now put the team on is a million times bigger so this is a technology that essentially in application scale has gone up by a factor of a million and it's still largely the same technology again to show you that this is being done here's the Tesla plant a hundred and twenty nine megawatt hour in horns Dale South Australia this is the one where Elon Musk made a bet with the Australian government that he could build it in a certain amount of time I forgot what it was eight months twelve months and he did in its first year it made twenty five million dollars in arbitrage that's specific to Australia because Australia has very high leave fluctuating energy prices and the plan cost about a sixty nine million this is in our own state California California is planning a bad dream about two megawatt two gigawatt hour of energy storage to replace gas peaker plants and there's a few things you should notice what's the technology it's all at their mind but there's another thing that's important on this graph this was approved in 2019 by the legislature look if you can read it the online date basically this is like December 2020 October 20 19 December 2020 you can build a lithium-ion energy storage plant online a year it can be online a year after you've gotten you can never do this with many other industrial technologies right you cannot build a power plant you can definitely not build a nuclear power plant in a year and so here's another advantage of electrochemical energy storage technology all you need is all you need is a concrete is a concrete pad and you put essentially a bunch of batteries on it so to me I always compare lithium as the silicon of the battery industry everybody always says it will be replaced but it's really hard to replace it's the incumbent technology it's remarkably powerful it has come down in price tremendously and it has gone enormous market growth right in 2000 we barely had 2 gigawatt hour of production today we're probably around 200 gigawatt hour and people are projecting that that in 2028 we may produce one terawatt hour of lithium ion battery technology so what are the challenges if you go to a terawatt hour they definitely will be appearing the main issue will come on the cattle side it is probably not the lithium ion side but cathodes in the battery field has always been winner-takes-all once we have a good cathode we kind of make it for almost everything with minor variations and today the winning technology is what's called oops what's called the NMC series nm n stands for nickel M for manganese C for cobalt and essentially depending on the application we mix them in different ratio Electronics is still pure lithium cobalt oxide early plug-in electric vehicles where n MC 1 1 1 which means equal amounts of each and now the standard bearer in automotive is what's called an MC 6 2 2 which is 60 percent nickel 20 percent manganese 20 percent copper and people want to go to even higher nickel content like 8 1 1 and 9 55 and that's mainly a to replace Cobalt which there is not a lot of in production we produce about 120,000 tons of cobalt in the world and it's more expensive but higher nickel condon also gives you slightly higher energy density actually not that much but I want to put this in perspective because we don't want to get lost in the fight between more cobalt or more nickel whatever you're gonna use cobalt or nickel if you want a terawatt hour of lithium ion production in the world you will need about 1 million ton of one of these metals or two of these metals combined it doesn't really matter which one with cobalt that's impossible the cobalt production today is about a hundred and twenty thousand twenty a year nickel production is about 2.2 million tonne a year so if you want to make a terawatt of lithium-ion you're going to need forty percent of the world's nickel production so now you are competing with the building industry stainless steel right stainless steels today the biggest user of nickel you are competing with everybody who uses nickel in stainless steel in catalysts in all kinds of alloys and what are we gonna do if we need to terawatt-hours right now we're sort of well beyond what is even known about the profit production capability of nickel so this is something to keep in mind you're fine for now but not for much longer so where does this problem come from why are we so reliant on cobalt and nickel and here I have to dig a little into them into the material science all cattles today are layered structures they're here's a cartoon of them they're essentially oxygen layers with either a metal in between so that would be nickel or cobalt and then lithium and what you do when you charge a battery what's so brilliant about the lithium ion technology is that you sort of pull lithium out you pull it out and you deposit it on the other electrode which is graphite and then when you discharge it you bring that back unfortunately with most metals what happens so you create all this empty space in the material because you want to pull a lot of lithium ion out because that gives you a lot of capacity per unit weight and volume and what happens is that these other metals start to move around and when they move around they have high valence so they contract the in layers around them and what that actually does is it actually kills the mobility of luteum because luteum needs to kind of move around here to get out on some side and as these oxygen layers contract luteum can actually not get out anymore and your battery has no rate capability anymore so you can effectively not charge or discharge it in a reasonable amount of time a funny tidbit here it was actually one of your colleagues professor Kissel Kang who when he was working in my group who kind of actually figured out this problem maybe not the solution but they figured out this problem now almost 14 years ago so that means that if you work with today's cattles you basically can't use most of the periodic table basically you can use cobalt nickel and actually manganese not really because you cannot use it in an electro actively useful state you can only use it as a stabilizer so while people always tell me you know I design materials people tell me there's so many possibilities to mix things and so I you tell there's not enough right because here's a basic physical limitation you cannot engineer this away this has to do with the electronic structure of the elements you cannot engineer this away if you work with today's cattles you will need cobalt and nickel and to some extent manganese so either you're willing to live with that then you're going to find where you open up your next nickel mines or you take over the Philippines but otherwise there is no option here so the question is how do we break this curse so that we can go to cheaper and even more energy storage technology so this is where computational materials design came in that's a field that I've been in for a long time computational material science is sort of when you're a young student and in college it's your dream right you learn all these quantum mechanics and physics and you wonder what it's all useful for and you go like well we understand all the quantum mechanics can't we solve the equations and predict everything in the world right and and and we can't predict everything in the world but what we have learned to do in the last thirty years is that we got very good at predicting materials properties so that means that today you can build a virtual laboratory you can essentially come up with ideas make calculations on these hypothetical materials and predict things about them that's a field that grew tremendously in the 1980s and 1990s as a just as I finished had finished my PhD and what we added to that later on is then realized well anything you can compute you can easily compute many times because computing is one of the easiest things to scale you write some scripts and now suddenly instead of calculating it once you calculate a thousand times ten thousand times it just depends on how much computer power you have and that's what we did in the mid 2000 we developed it was called high throughput computing to the point where we now sometimes in a few days can have evaluate a property across all known inorganic compounds really all known inorganic compounds there are something like a hundred thousand known inorganic compounds if we really want to and you say I want the dielectric constant you can have it in a week if you give us a computer okay that led to the materials project which is led by my colleague Christine person at UC Berkeley and LBL which today is the most used computational material design environment in the world it has multiple thousands of users access that everyday it is also the largest source of data that is used for AI driven efforts in material science it's led to developing new ionic conductors new cathodes new T seals and so so what I want to go with this is how do we design novel cattles with this so the whole idea was to understand that if you want to make layered cathodes there's really not much you can do you can try to make the NMC materials today better but you will always be stuck with this limited chemistry so our idea was well you know let's forget about layered cattles I don't care about the cations being ordered I'm just going to let them disorder so I'm going to work with what nature gives me but I'm going to try to make that work as a cat if I can do that I can use the whole periodic table not just cobalt and nickel and that's what we did in sorry in about 2014 I worked with a Korean writer Suh and ginger plea from seoul national here who was doing his PhD with me and what we understood was that we looked in with great care at the diffusion mechanism how does luteum actually diffuse in these kind of materials and we found that if we disordered materials that there's some environment that would appear where lithium is surrounded only by other lithium's and we we found and this would get a little more technical to explain that that environment was very independent of structure littie was essentially always be able to go through whether the structure was small or big or whatever and so all we needed to do was create a cathode in which we had enough of these environments so that they would percolate through the structure in a statistical way and that's sort of what you see here this is actually a disordered material it's a crystalline material but the cations are all over the place so they're not these perfect layers and this shows you the statistical percolation of how lithium can actually move through there so now we have a material rather than having well-defined diffusion paths the lithium can diffuse through there and it sort of fairly ran away but it can go through the first proof came in this material which jinwu Klee worked on and was published in size in 2014 which this is actually a material that starts as a layered material you can actually see the microscopy here you see the perfect layering but after one cycle it became almost completely disordered but it still worked this is actually a discharge curve and a charge curve and it has a very high capacity so this was the proof that you could make disordered materials and that it would actually work really well again that's an interesting academic tidbit but the real reason that that's important is that it's not opened up chemical space so today in the literature there are tons of disordered rocks all cathodes and we only stopped collecting this in 2018 and what you see is there's not all kinds of chemistry's manganese there's iron titanium there's molybdenum there's no oven there's chromium there's actually flu arise chemistry so certainly we have a lot more chemical flexibility to make new cathodes and this is important from the resource perspective but these cattles also have very high energy content so if you look at some of these materials we cannot get up to a thousand watt hours per kilogram three hundred million powers per gram though the voltage profile is quite different and layered cattles materials if we're going to use this we will have to do some things somewhat differently in in batteries they have quite good cycle i've have we learned now although that's not been tested in any sort of large-scale commercial cell but they also have some remarkable attributes because they can be fluorinated your classic battery cattle today and your phone in your car can not be fluorinated these can be fluorinated and and and fluorine in electrochemistry fluorine is one of the the most useful elements but it may be because it is so hard to pull an electron of fluorine and so it creates extremely stable environments so most capitals are oxides today and oxygen can actually be you can pull electrons of oxygen we make oxygen unstable and that's actually one of the negative reactions in a battery then oxygen gets released and it burns the electrolyte the electrolyte is an organic solvent which burns easily when it's exposed to oxygen radicals so here you see an oxy fluoride cathode which is being charged to very high voltage to five volt and this is the amount of oxygen coming off we put this in an apparatus or you can actually see the gas come off and look at the gas and this is compared to a normal oxide cattle where if you hit four point three volt we already see quite a lot of oxygen come off so these materials are very high very stable to high charge and will therefore likely be safer as well so today there been a lot of these oxy fluoride DRX as we call them now disordered rock salt developed all with very high energy density but one thing I want to say right this is very exciting and this is very intriguing but it takes a long time for materials to make it all the way through commercialization and I'll come back to that point later that even when we have good things in the lab when you go to industry with this there are you know a material that somebody wants to buy from you I've learned has to be good in almost all ways you can't just be an academic and say well it's good in this but not in that but to make a product everything has to be right and so there's a lot of steps here to be taken before you can commercialize something like this and I'll come back to that in the end but basically the important thing of this this invention is that I think it allowed us to unlock the chemistry and resolve the resource problem for lithium-ion batteries in the future so the question is can we go beyond lithium-ion we're looking at will lithium mine truly be the silicon of the battery industry and and still be used 20 years later so there are various directions one can go here I think it's going to be very hard to find a technology that supersedes lithium ion in every capability but that may not be needed so depending on whether you want low cost or higher safety or higher energy by volume or higher energy by weight you may want to pick a different technology so for lower costs there are things like soda mine and potassium ion and I'll say a few words about this which is really intriguing and I think maybe not enough attention paid to them I think on specific capacities so this is where weight is important like in airplanes lithium sulphur might be particularly interesting maybe lithium air on high energy density and high safety there are probably things like magnesium mine and in particular salt state lithium which are probably of some interest so I'll quickly walk through some of them I don't really want to discuss these these are not really in my area of expertise so much so sodium ion in my opinion sodium ion is a is something that the industry really should spend more time on because it is really a great replacement for solar mind when you are calm conscious of cost and resources the reason is a sodium I matter looks just like a lithium-ion battery except with sodium so you can manufacture it on existing infrastructure you don't have to build new factories but there are three main advantages the cost of sodium is much less than the cost of lithium but on the cathode side right where you have to buy cobalt and nickel to make cattles there are many cathodes for sodium that is that don't contain cobalt and in many cases don't even contain nickel so today already a third of the price and sometimes more of lithium ion battery is set by the cost of the cathode and that will likely not go down that price so on in in a sodium system you could imagine really inexpensive cathodes you can use aluminum current collectors instead of copper and they function in many cases at very high rate I think our frustration is that that the reason that sometimes I think industry has paid very little attention to this so far is that lithium ion is so dominant today it works so well and if your time horizon is five years maybe even ten and we could argue whether a company should have a five or ten year horizon that's probably fine you will be selling lithium-ion batteries in five years still in the long term those sodium looks like really attractive technology for low cost applications like grid other applications for example one that's that I've worked on quite a bit is magnesium ion this is farther out of the technology but the real interesting benefit potential for magnesium that it could have really superior energy density so by volume so in applications where you care by of energy by volumes things like portable electronics automotive and that's because the magnesium annulled has an extremely high capacity density it stores an enormous amount of charge per unit volume we work on this in the Joint Center for energy storage and there has been progress but progress in this era is slow the original battery was built in 2000 by Doron Auerbach who showed for the first time that you could cycle magnesium quite well in this molybdenum sulfide and actually this matter could be cycled several thousand times so off the bat this cycle already better than lithium at the time this was the year 2000 Lutie mine actually could not do two thousand cycles at the time but since then two things were needed electrolytes to raise the voltage of this and better cathodes to get the energy density of I would say that the electrolyte work has made tremendous progress if you haven't followed it today we have electrolyze you can go to four volt and so really what we're missing is a good catalyst we have done enormous computational work in this area the biggest problem in making a good cattle to magnesium is that because it's a divalent ion it has two charges on it it's really very hard to make it move quickly through a host which is what you need to do charge in this charge but a few years ago working together with a group in Waterloo we at least came up with one new cattle that sulphide spinel which cycles extremely well doubles the capacity of the current loonies in battery technology had a similar voltage but this is still while this is great it's still too low to be competitive but maybe one number that you have not realized this cell has the largest capacity density of any cell ever made it's even in so it's not energy dense its capacity density it's much larger than Ultima and cell so to translate that to higher energy density we would actually have to be able to raise the voltage right because volt energy is voltage times capacity and that has still is still a challenge so far so finally I want to say a few words about solid-state allottee mine which is really all the rage everybody's very excited about solid-state probably for very good reasons and there are two reasons to go to solid state one is safety and one is energy density again we're all familiar with several safety incident the Boeing 787 one the net samsung note seven one which is probably the two most expensive safety incidents we've had in the battery industry if you remember this led to the recall of essentially every node seven phone you imagine what that costs hoverboard fires this was usually this was largely due to improperly manufactured batteries in these cheaper devices but what's common in most safety incidents is that the origin of fire is actually the electrolyte combustion so the electron is an organic solvent if anything causes a flame or heats it up the organic electrolyte essentially catches fire and then heats up the rest of the cylinders the rest of the cell and the reason is it is an organic solvent it's essentially gasoline right the electrolyte and so the what the what the field wants to do is replace the organic liquid electrolyte by a solid which cannot burn and then we would make a full solid device sort of like a like a semiconductor device there would be no liquids no moving parts we would just have all solids in the battery so we would do that mainly for safety but there's a feeling in the field that we can also get much higher energy density that's still somewhat under debate but I want to sort of show you where our projections put that if you put a classic lithium ion battery today at 600 watt hours per liter we like this unit of energy per volume because that's probably one of the most important ones not per weight my prediction is that solid state will come out at the same energy density because it will probably use very similar electrodes but that there is a curve here where you move up solid state might enable the lithium metal anodes if you remember today a looking battery uses graphite as the annulled but you might be able to use the lithium metal annulled and that will make the big jump from 6 under to prolly of the area of a thousand watt hours per liter we think you can over time go higher by modifying the cathode you would use cattles that are not possible in liquid electrolyte sorry my pointer is running away here cattles that are not usable in liquid electrolytes and then even go what's called an odorless and best-case scenario we think you can reach 1,400 watt hours per liter so solid state will not do that on day one but it is essentially a new trajectory for lithium-ion it is a trajectory that may actually lead to ultimately doubling the energy density you should not expect it on the year one again the batteries is remarkably conserved and will probably come out here and only market the safety issue there's much you can do there's much work and promise to be solved on the timeline these have been said many times you need very good ionic conductors - you need solids that transport little minds very well oops you need to work with a lithium metal anode which tends to force itself through the electrolyte and short it you now have a cathode that is made out of electrolyte carbon and sulfate conductor there are no liquids so you have problems that when the cattle breeds it swells and contracts that you lose contact there's all these kind of practical issues that still have to be fully resolved in the industry we work on all these components but the one I really wanted to show briefly is that computational modeling is extremely well suited to work to find really good ionic conductors you can actually simulate down a conductivity directly and in some sense we can probably simulate it now faster and better than doing experimental measurements and that has actually led to the discovery of we go a little faster here to the discovery of actually multiple novel ionic conductors either for lithium and sodium and several these actually have been made in the lab and validated and in some cases very quickly this conductor was discovered in 2011 I was already validated in 2013 so a much faster way for us to get into in developing new materials you can actually make batteries this is actually a charge discharge curve of a fully solid-state cell okay but what I want to end with a few slides that are maybe seem unrelated to the battery field but but hopefully that relation will be clear in the end that my frustration is that in the end that while we have gotten better at the design of materials progress in materials development is way too slow in general and that's why companies are scared of it you know material development and leading materials into commercialization is often a 20-year effort and if something takes 20 years it's really hard to find people to put money into it actually Tom eager who's a long time ago department had that at MIT he quantified this for some real materials things like Teflon and velcro and titanium alloys and found that on average the development time for commercialization was 18 years for materials so it's actually in many cases worse than pharmaceuticals and medical drugs Lydia mine is actually been ahead of the curve the first lithium battery was made in 1976 by Stan whittingham who is one of the Nobel Prize winners and commercialization essentially started in 1991 so lithium-ion batteries of all only about 15 years and to address this problem we worked in 2011 with the Office of Science and Technology Policy of then President Obama to come up with what's called them but became the materials genome initiative and it was really to develop software and computational tools new methods open standards and databases to make discovery and development of materials faster and less expensive and more predictable I think this this initiative been remarkably successful but maybe only on the front end of development we are we have become extremely good at design today we can actually computationally design almost anything you want the problem is then after you design it you have to make it you have to characterized and you have to test it and that's where we spend all our time today so imagine that you know you have a good idea for a new conductor or a new dielectric so that's your design now you have to make it see if it's did you make the right thing and then does it have the right properties and in many cases what you do right oh no you didn't quite make what you wanted to make so you have to iterate back oh you made what you thought you wanted to make and now you test it and it doesn't really have what you want then you iterate back and if you look at a materials design exercise you go many times through this loop and time is essentially number of cycles you go through at times time per cycle so the question is how do we do this better right how do we do this where it doesn't take 20 years you know if it takes 20 years I can only do three materials in my academic career and I think I want to do more so how do you decrease the number of cycles for that we have to be smarter right if we learn more if we're smarter maybe if we learn how to do synthesis better maybe we can do less of this loop if we learn how to predict better maybe we can do less of this loop but how do you decrease the number of times per cycle you know what was amazing when I got into computation we were we were we were floated by the enormous increase in computing power I saw the difference in how people work because computers got 10 times faster 100 times faster in experimental research we have not had that you know doing experimental research a day takes almost the same amount of time then it took 20 years ago it is still largely the same process so to be faster I think we will need to start think of things like robotics in scientific research to be smarter we will have to try to think about using AI in academic research so I'm not talking about doing research on AI I'm talking about in using AI to think of our scientific research process so let me give you an example of how we envision the lab of the future and I apologize for my extremely limited way ways that I can make cartoons I spend many hours on this so so please do not make fun of me so imagine that I have my great design machine here right I could now input that to some chemical handler and these exist today right you can have liquid handlers power handles if I tell it to make a certain composition this handler can put all the precursors together that's not a problem so then I make a sample or a batch of samples right he's the great animation right I have to put that in the furnace right today that's a graduate student a grad student takes some sample you know puts that in the furnace okay then it's done in the furnace I have to put it in the diffractometer right and they usually let that sit overnight even though they don't have to but at some point I want to go and eat and so and that of course comes the hard part now comes data out right what do I do with data that a human has to look at the data okay you even have to look at it which means this was done at 3:00 a.m. in the morning but now it's like really I was gonna say 8:00 a.m. when the student comes in it's really 11 a.m. when the student comes in and looks at the data and now the student at OU has to decide hmm I didn't make what I wanted to make so I got to change something right so really if you want to automate this loop what you need to do is you need to have some smart decision making here so you need some kind of AI that takes output and decides what the next step is to take if you can do this if you can build this fully automated lab so you have robotics to do the manual operations but don't forget this step right this is robotics but this is knowledge gathering if you can do this you can build a lab where you go to an iteration multiple times a day I have seen prototypes of this and it is not unreasonable to expect that you do innovation on there times faster so this is the problem right today we've gotten great at computing we've gotten great even at AI but in the end humans go in the lab and humans are slow you must don't work 24 hours humans don't log their behavior right robots do so I think what we have to build if you want to innovate faster is this automated lab of the future so I think that if you do this I think this will become the competitive advantage research you know in the past the competitive angels' money and smart people but if I build a lab that can do things 100 times faster I be better than you whatever the money you have whatever the smart people because I can try things so I saw a prototype of this that I helped build and you know the people were ready to go home it was 4:00 p.m. I don't tell you which company this is where they go home at 4:00 p.m. but you know what they do before they went home they sat around said what will we make overnight and they just type in some commands to the computer and twenty four samples ran overnight and were analyzed by the time they came back in the morning imagine that now you have the AI loop on that where you know at midnight it says this experiment wasn't working so well I'm going to modify it now in the morning they don't just have a result they might have de result that they were asking for okay so we have robot the size if that's a word robotised we have company we have robotized the way we make things in companies if you look at an assembly line of cars but we have not used that same kind of idea in research and of course on an assembly line it's easier there are predefined tasks what is so much harder in research is that you you need from humans to be flexible right when the outcome is this you need to do that when the outcome is something else you need to do something else but I think that with modern AI we can actually build in that flexibility so this is what we're very excited about in UC Berkeley and something we are planning to build we already have done a little bit of that we have built machine learning and AI that can essentially read papers for you so we have built an engine that can read papers and essentially tell us what's in it and sometimes it's really good the way it does it one thing that we have trained it really well on it can tell us recipes to make materials so we have read four million papers by machine reading and essentially from that we have extracted codified recipes right so these are recipes that a computer can work with it knows what the ingredients are to make something it knows the operations to do okay sorry and it actually know so instead of text which a computer cannot do anything with right computer doesn't really want to use words interpret them we have codified recipes so we we have synthesis of materials now out of four million papers in flowcharts so you can imagine how you would use this right you would use this to drive robots if if I want to tell my robot hard to make lithium titanate it not knows exactly what to do okay because it has the recipes out of the literature and so we have very large data sets on how to actually make materials okay let me enter that because I believe my time is up I started this presentation with energy storage because you know when you talk about social benefits energy storage is obviously one of them writes there will be no clean energy revolution without energy storage but I hope I also gave you the message that this is already very much possible we are not really that far away from having a clean electricity production lithium is the thousand pound gorilla in the room it has shown an enormous ability to renew itself to make itself better to make itself cheaper and so as you come up with alternative technologies you have to keep in mind resource constrains will be real I am not the right person to tell you whether they can be overcome you'd have to talk to your experts in mining and so but they are real we will need an enormous amount of metal to store all the electricity we want to store and that's why we looked into these novel DRX cattles solid-state lithium is an exciting new technology it will probably not be cheap on day one which means it probably will be introduced in portal electronics but I also made some general more general comments that I think you know as we look towards the future I think the winners will be those that can accelerate the innovation path right today the innovation path for materials is way too long you know our joke used to be that it is the third company that owns the startup that makes the money the first one loses the money the second one loses the money and when the third one finally buys it and fifteen years have gone by that's when anybody makes the money and we are planning to do that with a combination of modeling robotics and AI so with that I thank you for your attention
