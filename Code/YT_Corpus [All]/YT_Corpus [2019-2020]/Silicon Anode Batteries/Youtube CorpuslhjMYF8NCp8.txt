 Hello and welcome to HSC's second online lesson today we'll be talking about LEDs so first off what are LEDs? LED is an acronym for light-emitting diodes to the right are the parts of a conventional LED the flat bottom surfaces of the anvil and post make up the LED frame that are embedded inside the epoxy lens slash case to act as anchors to read the conductors from being forcefully pulled out as well as making the LED different colors and enhance the brightness the electronic symbol for the LED is below, the left side is the anode, and the electric current runs through the right sides the cathode you can pause this presentation if you wish to examine the parts of the LED in the diagram so now we're moving on to the history of LEDs electroluminescence as a phenomenon was discovered first in 1907 by British experimenter HJ round of Marconi layups using a crystal of silicon carbide and the cat's whisker detector however not much was done after the discovery of the phenomenon until a Russian inventor Oleg Losev reported the creation of the first LED in 1927 his research was distributed to Soviet German and British scientific journals but no practical use was made from the discovery for several decades more improvements to the LED followed and in 1962 the first visible spectrum LED was developed by Nick Holonyak Jr. while working at General Electric so the first commercial visible wavelength LEDs for commonly used as replacements who are incandescent and neon indicator lamps and seven segment displays first inexpensive equipment such as laudatory and electronics test equipment and then later in appliances such as calculators TVs radios telephones and watches until 1968 visible and infrared LEDs were extremely costly around $200 per unit so it had very little practical use Hewlett Packard's was engaged in research and development on practical LEDs between 1962 and 1968 at the same time HP and Musante organizations launched a collaboration into developing usable LED products the first usable LED product was HP's LED display and Musante LEDs indicator lamp both launched in 1968 the early red LEDs were bright enough only to use us indicators as light output was not enough to illuminate an area readouts in a calculator were so small that plastic lenses were built over each digit to make them legible later other colors became widely available and appeared in appliances and equipment now we are moving on to resistors so what are resistors exactly a resistor is a passive two terminal and electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element an electronic circuits resistors are also used to reduce the current flow adjust signal levels and to divide voltage is among other various uses so what goes on inside a resistor if you break open the resistor and scratch off the outer coating of the insulating paint you might see an insulating ceramic rods running through the middle with a copper wire wrapped around the outside a resistor like this is described described as a wire weld the number of copper turns controls the resistance very precisely the more copper turns sympathetic to copper to higher the resistance and smaller value resistors designed for lower power circuits to copper winding is replaced with the spiral pattern of carbon resistors like this are much cheaper to make and called carbon film generally fire wound resistors are more precise and stable at higher operating temperatures the electronic symbol for the resistor is this Charon as below they do not have an anode and cathode side and can be interchanged report one of today's project we're going to be making an LED and resistor circuit so let's first take a look at this schematic remember how I showed you the symbols for the resistor and the LED before this is exactly what it is and this is a battery so the electrical current starts off with the plus and then runs through to the resistor where lowers to voltage and then it goes to the LED which emits lights after the rest comes back into the battery however instead of a battery at this time we're using an Arduino so the requirements for this project is an LED and are doing them jumper wires and the resistor oh and don't forget your red boards too if you want to try solving this by yourself you can pause the video here and try to figure it out so here is our physical representation of the Arduino and our breadboard SCADA so in this case I'm going to go follow through with where the current runs through it starts at the thirteenth pin and power is provided by the Argentine to this wire and in first it goes through the resistor and then it goes to the LED goes through the anode and comes out the cathode and back into the ground this completes the circuit now that you have finished your circuit you would want to connect your are doing now to your computer using the blue cable provided by the Arduino toolkit that you have after please open up you're a sketch pads for our doing though called Arduino IDE it should be on your computer if you have a Windows and if not it should be an online program that you could open up so first off we're going to let our program know what we have inserted into the Arduino and on our case on pin 13 we need that are doing them to provide energy so we're going to let them know that we have integer LED a pin number 13 after we're going to go to our setup will be a pin modes polythene output and now this is declaring that's this pin at number 13 is an output and here is where we put our executable code what we're going to do is take it all right LED high which turns to LED on now that you have done this please verify say it if you must now that we have done this we could upload to our Arduino and let it stand uploading your LED should have been turned on once you finish with this you could move on to our next and final project for this week for our next project we're making a traffic stop led which will consist of three different LEDs and a slightly more complicated programming so let's first go through our electrical currents so what we have here are three differences of energy from pin number 10 through 12 and what we're doing is each one provides electrical currents to each of the LEDs now how this works is because they're from each of the different leg if one gives energy and the others do not give energy when the number 10 which is connected to the green LED will light up now let's follow one of the LED currents to find out how it works so number 10 it goes through this wire and go through the resistor to reduce the amount of voltage that's going to go to our LED after this comes into your day eyelid up through the cathode and to our receiving line which will come in back to the ground now the same logic applies for the rest of the LEDs we have a working circuit so now we move on to programming first we have to declare our variables these are going to store our data that we can reference throughout our code number one for example the green variable represents depend that the green LED is connected to now in our case our green LED is connected to like number 10 our yellow ones at 11 and our red one is at 12 so you just have to set them up by keeping in mind which pins are which now we're going to write our delay functions these ones are going to be how many seconds each color should be apt for each LED now this time is in milliseconds so we're going to want to put ours at let's say five seconds that will be five thousand milliseconds for yellow it stays hot yellow in a traffic light for less amount of time than green or red therefore and way to make this two seconds now and spread is going to be five seconds again now we're going to be moving on to our setup we need to set up the pins so they act as an output and not an input for electrical voltages the pin modes function accepts two parameters the pin number first and then the mood separated by the commas and calling in outputs declares that this is an output now I'm going to copy this and make it the same for yellow and red also now we're going to do our loop functions the loop function creates the loop that the program will run through so every time we call a function it will turn a light on and then we could set a delay so it doesn't change until that time stops so there's multiple ways of doing this but I'm going to make it as simple as possible so that your little writes tells us at what power voltage we will be providing electrical energy to the wires in this case we're giving it to green and it will be high and then we're going to give a delay so the ring LED stays up high and remember our delay function we have defined already at top as five seconds therefore we just need to write delayed green next we're going to turn off the green light and then turn on the yellow light so we're going to go back to our digital write function and then green comma low which is going to stop providing the electrical current that the LED needs to run next we're going to turn on the yellow lights so yellow and we're going to do hi which is turning it on now we have to put the delay in and remember or delay again let's defined here then now we turn it off like we did for the green that we repeat this again for our red and with this our code is finished and now again we could upload it once we're done writing this code you'll need to upload it to the Arduino using the USB cable that should've come with your kit the light should start blinking in the pattern we have to find using the function calls and the delays you should always test your Arduino by verifying your code with this button up here and after sending it over by uploading it if you have any questions about this I will see you in tomorrow's chats have a nice day
