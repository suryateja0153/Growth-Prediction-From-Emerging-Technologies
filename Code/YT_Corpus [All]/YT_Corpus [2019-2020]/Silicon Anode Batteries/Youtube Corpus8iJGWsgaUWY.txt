 lithium-ion batteries are used in more and more devices such as electric cars buses drones and they are almost safe to use however there might not be enough lithium for every application look at this reaction of water and alkali metal sodium is much more reactive does it give more power from batteries to Lisa my batteries are being manufactured in various form factors mobile phones for example the iPhone are using a flat battery type with safer polymer electrolyte laptops have technically custom batteries which consists of a cylindrical is Amman cell this little man cell was taken from a Tesla let's see what's inside it has a stainless steel container which is pretty difficult to open now the lectroid starts evaporating and it's smells bad the electrodes are rolled tightly together here is cathode on aluminum foil next layer is porous membrane and finally a note that is laminated on a copper foil typical actuate consists of xo4 phosphate dissolved in a mixture of organic carbon its ahnuld consists of graphite which can integrate lithium ions you can throw for example lithium cobalt oxide with lithium between cobalt oxide layers during charging cobalt is oxidized and lithium will move out of the crystal structure on the graphite side the electrode is negatively charged and positive lithium cation start diffusing between graphite layers when the battery is discharged the reverse process happens however we can't use graphite as a negative electrode in sodium and batteries because sodium does not integrate into graphite as easily so a different carbon is needed carbon from sodium ion batteries can be obtained from different organic precursors for example sugar this autoclave uses high pressures and temperatures to synthesize spherical carbon particles sugar solution is poured into the autoclave which is then sealed and tightened firmly to withstand high pressures heating up to 200 degrees Celsius causes pressures up to 20 pours next autoclave is inserted into the heater we are at elevated temperatures and pressures porous carbon particles are formed the product is washed with water and is black infiltrated at this point the powder contains various oxygen containing functional groups so we need to treat it further now we're ready to paralyze this carbon using this furnace and we do it in argon atmosphere so the material would not burn in this process all other elements are removed from the carbon structure and the carbon becomes further graphic taste which will create more sites for sodium absorption here you can see scanning electron microscopy image of hard carbon material these particles are spherical with a very narrow size distribution first the active material is weight then the binder and the conductive additive there are all mixed together to make a homogeneous mixture after which they're all put into a while and then the solvent is added to make sure that all mixture becomes like a slurry one of the biggest advantages of sodium I batteries is that they do not have to use copper foil for the current collectors then the electrode slurry is cast onto the aluminum foil a device called the doctor blade is used to make sure that the coating is even on the surface then the electrode is tried to evaporate the solvent once it's dry it's measured for thickness and consistency and then the electrodes are cut out of the current collector in proper size for the next step next they're put in so vacuum furnace to drive the electrodes completely to get rid of all water that can be trapped inside because the battery is very sensitive towards water Kathir material is produced using glycine nitrate process in which all the vanadium salts are first dissolved and then the mixture is dropped into a hot crucible which will lead to our oil and combustion reaction to form fine particles in the SEM image you can see that it's made of particles with the varying size distribution everything is handled in a glove box so I contact with moisture and they're inside the glove box there's argon gas the components are taken inside using a vacuum packed antechamber to get rid of air and moisture before putting everything inside special rubber gloves allow operating the glove box now the electrodes are weighed to establish the exact amount of electro material coin cell is then assembled first putting in the cathode then the separator the seal and the membrane electrolyte is sodium perchlorate dissolved in mixture of ethyl carbonate and diethyl carbonate I drop some of the electrode on a separator then anode is added with the spacer and washer to make sure that everything is in good electrical contact finally the cell is sealed now it's ready for electrochemical measurements the cell operates at 3 point 4 volts and a lot of them had to be tested it can easily light a white LED light however this is only a small prototype and it's relatively new technology however so the Mayan pattern yourself has 20% lower voltage which leads to lower energy density than lithium ion batteries the reason for developing sodium ion batteries is that sodium is more abundant and a lot cheaper than lithium so if you want to store wind and solar energy that is not always available we need to have huge battery banks for the future in order to make battery safer lots of companies are developing solid electric batteries this could also allow using our treatment without a fight in order to further increase energy density next generation of the mineral derivatives are being developed to enable electrical air transport
