 hi chicken gang and friends i've been getting tons of requests to cover quantum skate this is going to be a short video as it's pretty easy one to cover contentscape developed the only lithium metal solid state battery they have jb's trouble the guy who helped build tesla up with elon musk 10 years of r d 200 plus patents energy density higher than lithium-ion sales the ones tesla are using fast charge and the only battery that enables mass market transportation so should you buy or not buy no don't be a donkey for me to invest in any stock i need to be comfortable with the fundamentals of the business there are so many red flags don't get me wrong if there is a technology that is better out there i will cheer them on the competition is healthy and coming from what i did previously competition is necessary else the industry works technique quantum scape is bad it's not as bad as nicola but bad so why no i'm going to cover the two big obvious reasons thereafter stay on to the end if you want i have taught you in multiple videos this applies to any companies the two criteria must be fulfilled before you invest so number one the proof of concept where the product or service works people like it adoption is real number two is the ability to scale the product or service because it is so hard to scale anything it could be software could be service it could be manufacturing you name it it is hard but you know what is easy clicking the like button for our furry friends i thank you so much has quantum scape fulfilled the two criterias not even the first one they are still sample testing all the way to 2023 if nothing goes wrong production starts end of 2025 so for the next four years they are going to burn through tons of cash oh no no no no me stay far the next big obvious red flag is that any technology that's going to gain market share has to be cheaper and better fine if quantum skates technology is better but more expensive at least it's better right but it's not this is what they claim tesla cells now are above 300 watt hour per kilograms so this is false tesla have a very clear path towards 500 watt hour per kilograms with maxwell technology quantum scapes tops out at 500 watt hour per kg so quantum scape is not only more expensive hard to manufacture it is also not better it's not better in five years too it just blows my mind that this discussion is even on the table these are the two main red flags i'll cover the small ones quickly i don't want to waste your time the 300 mile range fast charged and across all these claims tesla has achieved next year the 25 000 tesla ev will be unviewed for battery lifetime you'll notice that they didn't mention any charge cycles because solid-state batteries have very very poor charge cycles charge cycles are the key to robot taxis lower cost this is donkeys lower cost versus other solid state technology and not tesla's technology look no mention or charge cycles again oh my god look at this bs revenue growth is higher than tesla of course year 27 production zero and year 28 production starts any donkey can hit 101 i mean what look at this showing tesla is expensive and quantum scape is cheap of course quantum scape is cheap piece of third wrapping up there is a reason why tesla skipped the acquisition of quantum scape look stock price may show up over the short term i've seen stories like this a million times one day the company is going to blow up i told you nikola is going to blow up well i told you so i know i'm going to get quite a lot of hit for this but i'd rather say i think new is going to blow up if not for government intervention for quantum scape they need to show me fulfillment of the two criterias before i seriously look into the company i don't buy into an amazing sales page beaten so many times i hope by sharing my thought process hopefully you don't make these mistakes appreciate the thumbs up invested and don't be uh
