 before I start I would like to introduce a special guest of ours of mine professor Ralph Parkman from San Jose State University is here ralph was a graduate student here a doctoral student in the late 40s he taught for a time in the department in the early 50s and then he went to San Jose State College at the time to start the metallurgical engineering department the department from which I was the first graduate it later became a materials department he sent more than half dozen of his students many of you are here up to Stanford for for PhDs Ralph is celebrating his 99th birthday and I think we deserve to have so it's so you've seen the book and so it's it's really about the people and events at least some of the people and events that have made up the history of the department and in a way so you haven't read the book and and now you're gonna hear the talk about the book it's sort of like watching the movie before you've read the book and it's the usual case you know that the book is way better than the movie so so I I hope I hope you find the book better than the movie you're gonna be watching here so so I would like to cover some of these events now actually even before a materials department was formed there was a course that I want to specifically describe it was called metallography and physics of the metals it was offered by Dorsey Lyon and let me just read this and this is the course description it said work this is 1903 now work will include a study of the microstructure of the industrial metals and alloys and of the influence of chemical composition thermal and mechanical treatment upon their structure and also the relation of the structure of metals and alloys to their physical properties and I argue in the book you could hardly create a better working definition of the subject of material science and engineering at least for most of the of the 20th century so we had a very very early early start and for those of you who are metallurgical historians I noticed here that I note here that north sea lion had studied with Albert so there at Harvard and some of you will know that know that name okay well the department head in 92 20 19 1919 it was found as as a mining and metallurgy department in 1919 it was the predecessor as I'll describe of our our department and the first head executive head was Theodore J Hoover he was the older brother of Herbert Hoover who of course was the 31st president and here's a sketch of the of the of his he was a mining engineer just like his younger brother was and he was mainly involved in extracting minerals from ores and he he also the department joined the newly formed school of engineering in 1925 some six years after it had been founded and Hoover the head of mining and metallurgy became the Dean of engineering was the Dean for some some eleven eleven years now in the 1920s it was there was work on on various aspects of mining and metallurgy I'm focusing on those parts that link into material science physical metallurgy was pursued in the 20s well Jake crook was a key figure that many of you will have known he graduated in geology and mining in 1911 and then started his career at Pacific stucco steel and became a steel metallurgist and his contributions in the twenties involved writing about and making inventions in getting patents and writing papers about the uses of steel in various applications including oil drilling oil bits and and the sucker rods for that so that was that was the beginning in the in the 20s Cutler Shepard another name that many of you will have known Orson Cutler Shepard was a giant within the department he started his career in metallurgy and of gold and silver and he became the future founding department of the material science department when it was created he came to Stanford in the early 20s and you've got his mining and metallurgy degree in 1925 and shortly thereafter joined the faculty in 1928 and so he led students in metallurgy a number of things brought x-ray diffraction to the department in the 1940s he encouraged the development of transmission microscopy and as I already said served as the department head in the late 50s and early 60s here's an interesting picture of that's Cutler Shepherd right there on the left with a bunch of his students this is outside the back of the mining and metallurgy building some of you might recognize the texture of that wall to notice that it's in the back of that old building and I like this picture because it includes Alden Greenwich er some of you folks will remember we used to use Greninger charts to measure the angles between crystallographic planes from the spots on Maui Maui Spa allowi patterns and that's the grin that's the grandeur of Greenwich Greenwich er he actually did that at Harvard after he left here so he didn't do it at Stanford but shortly thereafter he created he was doing crystallographic work in alloys at Harvard and created the grin under chart that many of us many of us used now I'll be talking about the department and the various school affiliations I thought I'd show this little chart here to explain the kind of the torturous history of the department we all know it was founded it's mining and metallurgy department 1919 and for the first six years there were no schools at the time there were a few schools anywhere at Stanford there was no School of Engineering at that time so it was a standalone department as were many departments then when the school of engineering was organized in 1925 with Hoover as Dean the mining and metallurgy department became one of the four principal departments of that of that school the and the metallurgy was dropped for a while in 1929 it became the mining engineering department still in the school of engineering but the the geologists were never quite happy about mining and metallurgy being in engineering they thought it should be connected more to geology which is connected to mining and so on so there was always a tug-of-war about that and by the late 40s they managed to to bring the mining engineering department to the new school of mineral sciences so we left the School of Engineering 1947 and joined the new school of minerals it's now the earth earth and environmental sciences mineral sciences and were there for about ten years Fred Terman who had just become Dean of engineering was not entirely pleased about that and he angled for years and eventually did bring the department back well it's it took on various forms first of all it lost its department status and there were only programs in in the school of mineral sciences finally in fifty-eight it became a full-fledged department that's the department that that Craig was talking about and that he'd he joined and and with that Enco fellowship and still in the school of mineral mineral sciences but by 1960 Fred Terman had managed to pulled metallurgy back out of that school and into the School of Engineering changed its name to material science and then later in 71 we added the and engineering so that's the kind of tortuous history of the department and its various school affiliations just just thinking of of that time here's the 1940s here's a picture of the Faculty of mining engineering in the 1940s and on the left is Cutler Shepherd there's Welton J crook the principal people and then the others here Humphrey challenger and to quell the three here covered mining engineering extractive metallurgy and and also petroleum engineering to kill at the time was executive head of this mining engineering department so we were a part of that mining engineering whoops there we go now by World War two or after World War two atomic energy and federal supported research really came into vogue and Cutler Shepard acquired some some grants from the Office of Naval Research Atomic Energy Commission and NSF also for work on creep of metals in controlled liquid metal environments and liquid metal corrosion was a was a key part of that as well I think and and this was partly driven by Hyman rickover who was was interested in high temperature heat transfer systems for a nuclear nuclear submarines so there was a drive for for that and a number of students joined in this effort with Cutler Shepard including Ralph Parkman as I've already briefly mentioned but Thomas Paine was one of the key people to join in that effort and he he was kind of a leader of it and Paine Paine was the principal graduate student in this in this period and it's just as an aside here Tom Paine was later the administrator of NASA at the time of the moon landing so he rose up through General Electric and later on became the NASA Administrator now in spite of the engineering relevance of this kind of work in spite of that as I've already mentioned in 1946 or 47 the the mining engineering moved to the School of mineral sciences and back with geology something that Fred Terman was not entirely happy about but he angled he kept pushing on this and by the 1950s we're now talking aerospace and electronics and I would say the coming of material science and as I indicated here Fred Terman really pushed to bring mythology back to the School of Engineering he could see the need for materials in his school it was no longer his school he was the promise at the time but in these school of engineering and as I'm gonna explain a little bit more Sputnik in 1957 really provided the spark for this but but in in preparation for this Fred Terman as as promised asked Bob Huggins who was then an untenured assistant professor to conduct a search for we need more people conduct a search for a faculty member in metallurgy and so Bob did the usual thing and had I don't know how many applications and he wrote to everyone and and did a proper proper search and he came up with three names and he just couldn't decide among the three and so and the names were Oleg Kirby I picture here Dave Stephenson and Vik Makris who for whom I could not find a photograph so Huck Huggins found those three and he was a dilemma what to do and he went over and told this to Fred Terman he said well leave me the fire let me look through these files panda so a few days later Herman calls up Huggins and says firewall this thangka and this was this this indicates the aggressive the bold bold nature of talk of those times and in Fred Terman in particular higher mall and he did hire mall and so we went from a faculty of two at the time it was just Huggins and Shepard that we were left and we went from a faculty of two to five and so and also in connected connection to this push as I've already said we moved back to the School of Engineering so the Department of interesting the Department of metallurgical engineering left the school of mineral sciences and became the Department of minute material science in the School of Engineering so kind of a mixture of words there and you you all recognize this this place here is the the old mining and metallurgy Department I write about it in the book later later on when it was renovated became the Petersons laboratory and that was the traditional traditional home now I've already alluded to the fact that that things were happening in the late 50s and the thing that really provided the spark for what happened was happened on October 4th 1957 if I'm not showing you this and I asked you what happened on October 4th 1957 half of you would know Sputnik that was the day Sputnik was launched and that people's hair was what were on fire about that and here's a just a short list the president's Science Advisory Committee P sac published an article just a few months later strengthening American science and there was something called the interagency Coordinating Committee for materials research and development that recommended that we build research activities at universities not necessarily giving it to companies but giving it to universities in the hopes that the future would be created by doing so and eventually the Advanced Research Projects Agency ARPA was created in 1958 and it was designated as the lead agency for this new effort called the the interdisciplinary elaborate IDL program and it was created in 1960 the first universities were Cornell Northwestern and 10 we weren't we didn't have big enough boots to make it the first time but the next year Stanford was included in 1961 and the Center for Materials Research was was created so during this very short period of time the material science department was created the Center for Materials Research was created and we were sort of on our way to to becoming something more more more prominent well that led to just an explosion of faculty appointments no time to tell what each one did it's it's in the book as I keep saying it's in the book you read the book you know the book okay so here are the people that were all appointed in the 1960s and if you count them all up we went from prior to those three that I mentioned coming we went from from a faculty of two to a faculty of twelve in ten years so huge huge expansion there in a ten-year period 1958 1968 so it was a major change now you of course oh you met recognize me instantly right there you're not supposed to laugh at that you actually see me you probably do recognize a little bit more which just makes me kind of sad but there's Craig Barrett and and the others you see the names all those folks were appointed in the in the 60s now other things were happening there was kind of a demise of the industrial research labs in the 60s and we benefited from that and here's just a list of the people dick view Bob white bill Spicer bill tiller Ted jabal clay Bates all came from industrial labs so the the sort of the decline a little bit of industrially sponsored research fundamental research led to our benefit and they're still the focus focus of all this was on material science the science of materials now let me just mention a couple of things that were happening in in the 70s one of the really seminal events was the founding of failure analysis associates later on change to exponent this is really an important thing allen Telamon was the key person here's how on tatelman and john shine and marsh pound and two others were involved in creating creating failure analysis associates and i indicate here that the capitalization there were five of them capitalization were five hundred dollars they pitched in five hundred dollar at the oasis I think in 1967 they all met at the Oasis they pitched in five hundred a hundred dollars each there's the capitalization when I last look the revenues were exceeding north of three hundred million dollars so it's a huge huge impact here are the three three principals from the department and then here's a picture of a marsh pound right there with several students not all of whom but many of whom worked with him in this failure analysis activity now another another event that happened in the early 70s I call almost a Nobel Prize one of Dave Stevenson's students herb maryska who had come from RCA at Stanford developed really the first blue was really violent light light-emitting diode that was he did they did that in nineteen seventy two here's the reference and this is significant because by mixing red and green and blue light you can get white light and that leads to flat plant panel displays a very big deal and here in fact is herb murska here and Bruce Lee Burt holding in fact this this gallium nitride LED that they developed that's I mentioned almost because in twenty fourteen others after this had been perfected were awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics for the development of the of the blue laser so herb Morasca and dave stephenson and their colleagues came very very close then now I mentioned that microstructure was mentioned in in God or sealions first course so microstructure has been kind of a central to the field and and so I thought I'd show a couple of pictures up until up in the first half of the 20th century and maybe a little longer optical microscopy was the principal instrument for for microscopy and and here's Welton crook at his bench metallic graph and and here's a what we were all very proud of this is probably in the late 50s a new metallurgical microscope that we got and here's Cutler's Shepherd with a student doing some optical microscopy but as Craig Barrett mentioned by the time by that by the 60s electron microscopy was coming into play and I mentioned before that that color shepherd encouraged the development of electron microscopy he worked with a lot of sloths Martin Bill Martin who was at Stanford in the electrical engineering department trying to build an electron microscope and here's Martin bill working on his electron microscope here at Stanford in the mid 40s and I think Bob Sinclar tells me that that Martin might have been the first to image some babo of biological structures and and you already seen this picture here by the by the early 70s we had microscopes and there's our our friend Craig Barrett and but when he left he was replaced by Bob Sinclar who brought electron microscopy to a whole whole new level as indicated here by by both Ann Marshall and Eileen Koh on various modern using various modern microscopes so microscopy has had a central role in in the department now here's an the story to tell of this time I call it solid-state electrochemistry and the coming of lithium-ion batteries Bob Huggins after after he had done his work to create the department and create the center he went on took a sabbatical in the mid-60s and came back and started work on solid-state electrochemistry and one of his first really seminal papers was his work with his student when on the thermodynamics and kinetics in the lithium silicon system it's the foundation for lithium ion batteries based on silicon and at the same time in the early 70s when Bob was back in Washington taking care of of the interdisciplinary laboratory program Stan Whittingham was one of his postdocs and he carried on with his with Bob students work on solid-state electrochemistry and this is significant because two weeks ago many of you know that Stan whittingham was named as a recipient Co recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for work that he did on titanium dye silicide for lithium-ion batteries that would that work was done at Exxon after he had left here but he started that his career with Bob Huggins here and then and then about ten years ago Bob teamed up with E and one of his students and had developed really high-performance lithium-ion anodes for with using silicon nanowires and the key thing was that there's a huge volume expansion when you lay the eight something like silicon because it's it's volume changes by 300% huge amount and so by using silicon nanowires you could accommodate this volume change and and get many cycles of life in that way now there was many other there was many other things many of you remember Ola Kirby and his ultra high carbon steels he and and Jeff wodsworth developed quite improbable II that ultra high carbon Steel's that you would think would be brittle as heck under the right circumstances can be made super plastic so here's an example of one of his ultra high carbon steel that's I think that's if I can read it's 1.8 percent carbon and for all of you who remember your steel phase diagram that's a very high carbon content and you expect that to just be dead brittle but he did the way he did it you can get this kind of this extensive super plastic deformation and that that led they found similarities too and that led to kind of the rediscovery of the Damascus the art of Damascus steels how one could work materials in such a way as to produce those now it was it was not all work it was fun and games too here's a picture in the book taken from 1968 this this this team is the dislocations naturally and they were the touch football champions of the intramural League here at Stanford in 1968 and you see forth forth from the left there there's our speaker Craig Barrett he's kind of hidden back there and met many others the ones that the ones that are here well not here Fred Ferrer Fred Ferrars on the right and Tom Reid and Bud West I guess none of these Bob Johnson is there they're worse Bob Jones Bob Johnson's right there so anyway that was the that was a touch football league they were very successful now there was also a famous one and a half mile run there was a challenge by the students to challenge the faculty on a one and a half mile run that would be six people each running one time around the track and so here's the picture of the faculty now this is Steve Robin and he was sort of drafted he was a postdoc at the time he was drafted to become a rep you know masquerade as a faculty member so there's there's Craig Steve Robinson the ringer Dave Stevenson Oleg Kirby Bob Huggins and clay Bates and then here the here are the students I've got the names Hugh van der PLAs Mike music Jerry Lawrence dick lund Thomas Mike Mike Thomas and Kim Mitchell so they had this race and and here in fact of the picture of its mid-race actually Turgut turgid gur standing here and he's timing it and at this moment you see this is Bob Huggins right here you can't see it but Dave Stevenson is right behind him so stated Stevenson has given them the lead so they're ahead right now and the students are behind but actually the students one another thing that I write about and I think is important is about the pioneering women that have played roles in the department for the first 60 year 50 years of the department there was really only one woman to get a degree and that was Janet SAFF Riggs who got a degree of engineer in 1933 and she went on to have a very successful career the steel industry and was elected to the National Mining Hall of Fame so the very prominent prominent person but after her there were no women at all until the early 60s and I just write the names of the early masters students that that came there in the sixties these were the very first really pioneers because they were entering this male-dominated activity also about that time in the early 70s carolyn Fouts alice fisher colbry were almost alone we had so few students anyway and they were they were they were just by themselves fighting their way and earning their their degrees both bachelor's and master's and in Carolyn's and then Alex Fisher colbry went all the way to the PhD working with working but they've with party beanstalk and just one other slide on this and Malka Kinley arguably is the first woman student of craig Barrett's first woman to get a PhD so here's a little chart of the cumulative number of student both men and women and you see women start here in 1973 and there's hardly any and they gradually go up but still still the change here is small compared to that finally in 2004 Sarah Hiles horn became the first woman to be appointed to our faculty and then not too long thereafter Jennifer dye own who will speak to you this afternoon became the second woman on our faculty so we're making slow progress along these lines I mentioned you already heard this but I mentioned Jennifer just it was announced I heard it a couple of weeks ago she received the 2019 Alan T Waterman NSF award and it's it's the highest award in all of science for anyone under age of 40 so so the numbers are small the numbers of small the quote numbers are small equalities high now it but but I've been talking to you about research mostly and it came with a kind of a neglect of the undergraduate program that I've that have already sort of hinted at here is a cumulative number of bachelor's degrees granted by the department as a function of time since kind of the beginning of time and there's a period here where there were just none we just weren't producing undergraduates and that led that was not appreciated and and that that led to a loss of one billet and a relatively flat faculty headcount for at least a couple of decades so that had serious consequences and in an addition we were slow the department was slow Kraig noses to adopt silicon technology we knew about it but we hadn't contributed much to it and that began to change in the 1980s John Robin was appointed for work on electronic materials stake Hagstrom came and did surface analytical work that was relevant to that area of technology and Bruce Clemens came and started started doing work on thin metal films but thin film thin film science and thin film technology so we made some progress now for a long time a lot of us did work on mechanical properties and it was mostly on bulk mechanical properties not-not-not materials related to silicon technology but that started to change in the 80s and Paul Flynn came from Intel with Intel support and built instruments for measuring stresses in thin films as a function of temperature so you could really monitor what was going on mechanically in very thin films and I was involved in bringing nano indentation at the Stanford and that that also had a had an impact on characterization of thin films and then when Reiner das cart came in the 90s he developed interfacial fracture mech methods that that that would be applied to thin film structures microelectronic films but then later on found that the same methodologies were useful in studying the stratum corneum the skin adhesion of skin so things were changing in mechanical properties and I'll just also mention that Bruce Clemens brought the technique of measuring stresses in films while they are growing while they are being deposited and you can see from this little plot here there's some measure of how the stresses are evolving as the film is being being deposited and finally Paul Flynn again working with John Bravo built a high voltage scanning electron microscope to be able to directly detect the voids that are created in interconnects and watch how failure takes place well but still in spite of those efforts there were what I would say and I write about this in the book there were troubles for an aging Department I already mentioned that there was almost no faculty growth here in almost a 20 year period and then about the time I became chair which is right about there you know the senior faculty from the 60s we're reaching retirement age so they this the the ranks were being depleted very very fast and so I was the one holding the bag so my my tenure runs from about here to about there so but they they were smart enough to get rid of me oh I don't want any more of that and so Bronfman followed me and Bruce Clemens and and Bob Sinclar served for many years Bob and Paul MacIntyre and finally Alberto sorely oh and they were the ones who who brought about this rebirth of the material science and engineering department and it did involve an aggressive plans to to make better contacts with electrical engineering mechanical engineering and just involvement of other other engineering disciplines was a hallmark of that of that recovery trilby would have retired probably in the late 70s yeah I wish I had a way to retrack all of the staff people but I did haven't done that so by that by the by the by the 1990s we were getting ready for the rebuilding of the 21st century and John Wong came with and has done brilliant stuff on using magnetics Reiner Dow scar fracture and fatigue which we badly needed of Fritz Prinze in manufacturing and Paul McIntyre and electronic ceramics so those were the the beginnings I call it the beginning rebuilding for the 20th century the beginning happened in the 1990s and then the explosion happened another explosion here in the in this century beginning with Mike McGee in 2000 and extending all the way to here and two more are coming so there's no time to describe all of these folks in their work but if you just read some of these things solar cells photonics biology thin films of course biomaterials nanophotonics energy production storage even I can't read that even neuro technology even even so big change big change and I'll just end then with you know I observe here a kind of changing definition of material science and what I would say is that there is a traditional definition put here in in perhaps modern form let me just read it it the traditional definition would be the synthesis and processing and modeling and characterization of useful engineering materials to control their properties and behavior through the control of composition and microstructure and I would call this engineering of materials or engineering the material now to that I think now we should add here's here's the addition its utilization of materials and material science to address pressing and exciting societal problems in technology the environment biology and medicine and I would call this largely engineering with materials so there's a different element that's come and that has come in the last 20 years that has broadened and has led to all the excitement that you find so let me just say thanks for coming and helping us celebrate the century of material science and engineering and I hope you liked the book better than this movie you
