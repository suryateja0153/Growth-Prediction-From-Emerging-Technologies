 [Music] I'm unwrapped andin Director of Product Management for end user applications including our graph visualization product colony o4j blue so what we find is graphs are inherently very visual right so whenever somebody is expressing a problem as a graph they just end up standing up getting on whiteboard drawing up a graph and and then it's also very useful when you want to think about a problem it's useful to have a conversation maybe I'm presenting something to you about the problem as a graph it's useful to investigate explore get insights and then also to actually solve the problem and so because it's all very very visual we felt that visualization is something that a practitioner of the graph database needs to have not just as an afterthought but from the very beginning I feel like flexibility is the is the thing that strikes me as most useful about graphs like I'm constantly amazed at how many problems can be expressed as a graph right I've become a convert I've been more from a strop from the structural side of things we're thinking tables and rows and columns but I'm just amazed at how many things can be modeled as a graph and then I guess the second part is businesses constantly are changing their model they're how they look at data how they look at how they actually model it in their in their own environment and graphs provide that flexibility that resiliency that they can change and adapt to those changing parts [Music] so I'd say pretty much anybody who's interacting with the graph can use blue we have created it with the user in mind who wants to quickly get at the graph and not have to think about writing cipher so it could be people who are already knowledgeable about cipher but they don't want to constantly write it it could be people who you know see it as a hurdle to learn cipher as language and so whether it's developers data scientists business users and users really it's the the idea is anybody who's interacting with the graph should be able to use it with just a point-and-click interface and not have to think about code think about query language etc I think the easiest way to get started is if you go to our website there's a bloom web page and we have a blooms sandbox that's available with a prepackaged data set that people can go and get started with and if they want to try it with their own data I recommend you forge a desktop as a tool that they can go download and then they can ask us for a bloom trial in terms of best practices we have some documentation we have some a great video series that you know they can watch to kind of just learn the basics of bloom and get started but otherwise it means meant to be very intuitive and just easy to learn and so I recommend people just get started [Music] their army so I mean all of the or most of the new fridge a use cases whether that's in the area of front detection whether that's in the area of network topology management master data management knowledge graphs our you know our use cases that people use bluem it one of the ones that have recently remembered from the nodes online conference we did was a Cancer Research use case where this individual got public data based on clinical trials and enhanced it with other you know sources of information to create a graph of which companies are going after what you know diseases and what drugs are coming up in their research that are targeting certain molecules therapeutic molecules with a specific types of drugs and being able to research the graph of that particular disease or that company and what kind of drugs they have in the pipeline or you know what kind of molecules are are being targeted by these rods so that I found to be very very interesting use of so with bluem our idea is to showcase all of the Graf goodness that neo4j has to offer and we really are looking to build a much much more powerful graph which position and exploration tool that is still very easy for users to get started with and so we're gonna continue to innovate an operator here [Music]
