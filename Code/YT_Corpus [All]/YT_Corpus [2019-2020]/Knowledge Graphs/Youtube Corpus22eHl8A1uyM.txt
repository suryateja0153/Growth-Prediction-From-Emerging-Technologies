 welcome everyone and thank you for attending our webinar graphs the secret to see CPA success my name is Marilee and I'm part of the webinar team here at neo4j and I'm joined by nav Mathur Senior Director of Global Solutions we're super excited to have you here with us a few housekeeping items before we get started we invite you to submit any questions you have throughout the demo using the questions tab located at the top of your screen will answer as many questions as possible at the end of today's presentation and if we don't get to them all someone on the neo4j team will reach out to you directly with that I'll go ahead and hand it over to now hello everybody this is a nav mater Thank You Marilee for that introduction and I have with me today Yasser Ali who's part of predict leader he is CEO there and he has an interesting perspective on CCPA as well so together we will be doing this webinar and I welcome all of you here it's very interesting times right now and I appreciate all of you joining in while you know we are worried about our families and in what's going to happen but we thought it would be prudent to go ahead with with this webinar and and you know provide information to folks who are probably stuck at home and and you know looking for some interesting information besides the coronavirus information that everybody's digesting so anyway we we decided to move ahead with this webinar and I appreciate all of you joining in so today what we're going to talk about is you know what are the key highlights of the CCPA regulation the California consumer Privacy Act what other solution requirements for this you know why we think that CCPA needs a different kind of solution regarding connected data what is sample solution architecture look like and then we will actually go into a couple of demos so we will be demoing predict data's technology as well as your new for J's privacy shield framework and talk about how the two come together you know to solve this CCPA regulation this is being recorded and you know you will be getting all these slides in your in the mailer back to you so no worries no need to take screenshots and things like that and then we will kind of end with a return on investment type of a message you know how do you sell it within your organization's and why this makes sense to do it with this graph based approach and then of course we will take some questions time permitting we the sessions going to be around 45 minutes alright so yes sir do you want to just briefly say hi hi guys yesterday Lee hello from New York yes pretty hard world experience here but customer privacy and regulations are a reality in today's world so it's a good time to actually start thinking through some of these issues for later part of the year or planning around it great so just wanted to start out by kind of studying the context a little bit so you know we have all heard these stories right we in the press in 2016 Yahoo was a poster child they settled recently in 2019 four hundred and seventeen and a half million dollars for the data breach but in addition to that settlement you know they got bought by Verizon right but that that deal while you got reduced by four hundred and fifty million as a result of that breach so they had to renegotiate that deal because of the breach and and so there was a immense loss brand value right and that's fairly consistent with what we have seen with all of these data breaches the the loss of trust and the immeasurable of hit to the brand value right lots of other breaches t.j.maxx Marriott Equifax Home Depot Sony over the years target in 2014 right but also from purely from a data privacy perspective we have seen with GDP are the finds adding up in you in Europe not only large companies like Facebook and Google but also mid-sized companies have have been fine so what has happened is especially as a you know we've been seeing all of these things happen over the last two three years but in 2014 when you know Alexander kogane now infamously you know amassed over 50 million Facebook users profile information and then cannas old it forward to Facebook so - sorry - Cambridge analytical and you know they used that information to to basically target political ads which was gross misuse of that information you know they didn't have any permission from any of the underlying subjects or consumers to actually use that information for that process these are all the factors that you know made California really take lead in promulgating CCPA and you know if you look at studies out there you know this because I was mentioning the consumer trust cost really run up in the trillions per year so this is pretty key and you know requires to be understood by by corporations that are now required by law to to adhere to CCPA so with that what is CCPA so I'm gonna just sort of highlight this from a scope rights penalties and process and data perspective you know so from a scope perspective obviously anybody that has a California consumer or resident in their database needs to adhere to CCPA no matter where the company is across the world the business needs to have 25 million dollars in revenue or higher and anything that is linked to directly to the consumer any information is considered you know personally identifiable is is part of CCPA it obviously excludes public records and and health information at the moment and you know it does not apply to aggregated or be identified information from a rights perspective right consumers must be given access to the data they need to know what data the organization has on them and and and what it is being used for ok they have the right to block the sale or transfer of this data and they can revoke consents that they have provided previously for the use of this data so all of this has to be seamlessly provided to to consumers and then the penalties actually can be quite stiff you know on the surface it's like twenty five hundred to seven thousand five hundred dollars per violation but that's just the fine imposed by the authorities and per violation it can it can add up right but the bigger piece that is being overlooked I think is it's the hundred to $750 per person per violation so imagine if you have a million records of consumers which is not in this day and age not not the not big at all right lots of companies have millions and millions of California consumers information and so that will add up very very quickly if you if you multiply that with a with anywhere between 100 and 750 dollars per person per per violation and the enforcement actually starts in June so we haven't seen anything so there so people might be have a false null you know not seeing any any penalties being awarded right now so they might feel like nothing's happening but actually the enforcement is only gonna start in June so so so there's a period a grace period here and you know even if this gets delayed because of because of what we're seeing with the coronavirus and and business is not being able to to function normally that just gives us more time to actually get a solution in place so I think this is important to understand that there is still time and and with the solution that we are talking about today we can implement a customized solution for any organization in in in in a three to four month period and and one thing I'll add now since I you know we saw this story play out about three years ago with gdpr in our experience and like in the industry experience it started off in a very slow fashion but ratcheted up pretty fast by the EU and technology partners in general so it ended up being that good data management practices was considered an essential item for even startups or even with organizations with which have less than the given hurdles of revenues under the EU regulation so just like history repeats itself and and the way this is gonna probably play out is going to be similar to what happened in at you great and then finally if the process and data so so what's the process you follow with the data you have so first of all you need to classify the data right you need to all the data elements that are tied directly to the consumers you need to classify them and we'll show you that in the demo as well but that's really the first one of the first steps right and then you need to go discover all this data a you know and yowzers going to talk about that as well in in in his piece then you need to kind of see if there is duplication of the data you know if nav Mathur is in one place in math or knives another place or it's misspelled or you know you know all of those kinds of things right oh there is a middle name somewhere right you need to deduplicate all the data you need to merge and cleanse the data you need to associate the data that you have tie it back to the consents that have been provided you know from your marketing team right by these consumers then you need to start tracking each consumer data event so as consumers come in interact with you as they provide a consent as they update their data as they give you permission to share the data with a partner and so on you need to start tracking all those events you need to start tracking who in your organization has has accessed this data right because that might be important in the case of a data breach so all of those events need to be tracked and that's really where the power of connected data comes in and then connecting all of this consumer data in the right context together right to understand the interconnectedness in this data that that wrote that is key to solving for CCPA and obviously the regulatory environment is changing right they're not only going to be changes within and the California's you know regulation going forward more data items might get added or the regulations changed we have seen that to some extent at gdpr as well but also other states are looking into this right New York Texas you know all all at they actually at least 11 different states that are actively looking into having their privacy compliance law enacted besides other countries obviously Brazil already has something on the books that is going to go live very shortly Mexico is looking into it Canada is looking into it India is looking it into it so so this is coming from from multiple different sides the federal government is actually looking into having a federal standard as well so this is definitely going to be changing and you need something that can adapt to the changes and just to add to that the you know in the past a few years the regulatory environment has kind of evolved into its the businesses fault if they not if they have not discovered a data which has been reverted back to the customer if a customer is asking what data you have and what are you using it for or what category of data is you have on me the owners of complying is no more no more oops we forgot about it but there has been quite a bit of ratcheting up in terms of if you missed out or data elements within your enterprise it's ultimately your responsibility and we see that a little bit in your shield which is upcoming your privacy regulation is as a data breach victim you're not a victim anymore you're actually in line for a potential fine because you did not enforce or put in place enough safeguards great do you wanna just take this slide on quickly yes sir yeah so fairly similar blueprint of CCPA which we are you know it's it's a CD pass limit more broader it includes public bodies and nonprofits also CCP is more specifically for profit although there's a little bit of a barrier for the non profit area it is a codified in law in a much more stringent manner for GDP are however we feel that CCP will probably get enforced in a similar fashion as aggressively as the office of the privacy office in California and other states kind of ramped up the violations obviously in GDP are much much higher and and they are being enforced now which is which is which we can see in the fines for Facebook and Google although they've not even come closer to 2% number but they have been in hundreds and and billions of dollars the one the right of access in terms of being able to provide on the website two methods of the customer reaching out to you to provide or request access or requests for deletion that's a moving target a little bit initially it was codified in the law that there needs to be a email for example and a phone call to be supplied that's kind of has probably gonna get modified into maybe one method so there are some of these things moving around however in in terms of randomization anonymization of data it's which is kind of what we'll get into a little bit later on in the conversation is it does not apply to that so that that's a big benefit and that's pretty much it now on this slide yeah so then going into some of the key requirements I kind of talked about this on that first slide there but you know you know we need to obviously you guys probably understand the regulation you know somewhat but you know why I'm showing all of these things is what is the entity is behind this right so what what are the different data elements that you have on the right where is this store why do you have this data right and what are the data sources you know where did you obtain this data from all that lineage is important right because you need to be able to prove that you know you got this data from a legitimate source and that you had the consents to do that right so so do you have the permission to use the data and for what purpose right and also you need to track how the data travels through your systems because you need to go and then remove the data if the consent is revoked so all of these things are connected together right including security right so why is that important because if you look at the underlying entities behind those nine blocks it it's these entities right so you have the person in blue here and you have their their data classification and the critical data elements that are part of that classification right here you are also tracking the system's applications where this data is stored or can be accessed from folders that have you know documents PDFs Word documents and whatnot Excel files that that have PII information and again Yasir is going to show you how we we can discover that and bring that into neo4j you have on the other side of you have the consents that the person has provided how the consents linked to the type of the consent what is the usage of that concern you know some in some cases the consent may allow sharing with a partner so the partner entity is here right you are tracking each and every event there are multiple types of events that could be data data import events data export events happening from and to partners you you you could have data update from the person you could you could have them sign up for service so data moves from your system a a to system B you know so you could have a person a user that's here in in in dark green or teal whatever this color is an employee in your organization that has access to this person's data in different systems or you know not only just access but if they have accessed that data in the last so many so much time right and obviously a location location of the person location of the system location of the data location of where the event happened all of these information needs to be tracked to be able to create what I call a lineage or a journey of how the customer has interacted with the organization and that's absolutely key to trace back when a breach happened how it happened and and also to provide that confidence to data protection authorities that you have a full lineage of the events of the journey and so you can trace back if there's a complaint from a customer you can trace back to that point and say yes the customer did provide this consent this is where they revoked it or this is and during that period of time this is what happened and we did when they revoked it we did remove all the data and you know you have all the background information to prove it yeah I think the one thing I will add here and might be somewhat controversial in some ways is you know every organization has technical debt over the years the older the organization the more technical debt they would carry and being able to re-engineer a full back-to-front enterprise architecture based on these privacy regulations is almost impossible in almost all the cases and you know graph database basically provides this glue I which can essentially connect these heterogeneous sources of data into a one common frame which now we'll get into and essentially of smoothes out some of these friction point between your synapses of data transferring from different organizations within different teams different organizations different systems and databases okay fine so then if you just zoom back out what does that picture look like right so underlying you have all of these systems you have your marketing systems you have your CRM systems customer service you know all the systems in your enterprise right and what we're doing is we're basically going in there to identify all the PII information and we're bringing not the p.i information specifically but we're bringing the metadata associated with that so what is the record identifier you know and bringing those metadata back into new Herge and connecting that together right so we have a interconnectedness and understanding of how data in marketing is linked to the to the loan data for example or the CRM data and when we when we when are when a consent is revoked that we can tie that consent back to pieces of data in marketing in CRM together and then remove remove that information right that's just one example but but that's the idea is that we're not bringing all the underlying data into neo4j but we're just bringing the metadata so that we aren't have understanding of where what lives and we can reach it so as you saw with with that with that connected data model that it's really imperative to have all of these entities connected together and this is why you need a graph because what you saw there was a graph right and and so it is absolutely critical that you know in order to trace data through all of these enterprise system you know that you use a graph because if you use traditional approaches like a relational you know the the queries get super complex even with three or four table joins and we're talking here about ten fifteen and the data model I showed you there was a simplified version you know it actually has a lot more detail in the real system that we that we will that we will show you here in a few few minutes and if you look at you know nonce no sequel databases other no sequel like columnar or you know key value or things like that you know the challenge with those is that you know you can get broken data paths because they're not acid compliant for the most part and so neo4j being acid compliant and really fast at finding patterns and and going through these traversals it is the right solution for compliance regulations that require lineage and and you have even a single broken path in your lineage your entire lineage is basically suspect I think in the one thing rod is for traditional relational designs specifically and to some degree no SQL schemas if you know what you're looking for setting those environments of those schemas up is is best in in disconnected systems disconnected databases and data stores the me the main challenge is you don't know what you're getting into what what kind of way the data resides or weird might be residing two months from today and being able to plan for that ends up delaying projects with requirements and ends up delaying implementation and very expensive change management hence the easy fast and affordable I guess is the bottom line which now is talking about yeah so let's talk about the solution architecture right so this is the architecture of our privacy shield framework so I start with the bottom right so in the bottom you have your system specific adapters and connectors so those are adapters that connect on to your underlying systems and the purpose of that is twofold one to bring that metadata as I was talking about earlier into neo4j which is in the middle here through this data integration approach and also continuously ingest that data right so as the data changes we have you can have a Kafka queue or batch updates or whatever mechanism to bring that data back into neo4j constantly and then secondly you know when there is a consent being being you know exercised or consumer is exercising their right to not sell the data or remove their data that needs to go back to these underlying systems and the data there needs to be removed so so that it's the back and forth that's happening there and then then we obviously have the data model here within your 4j and that's really the crown jewel of this solution and then all the queries and stuff that you've written on top to to then provide dashboards that we will show you in a few minutes so we'll have a subject dashboard or a consumer dashboard that they can come in and look at their data what data does the organization have how are they using it if they want to exercise their rights they can do that there's a management dashboard that has interesting analytics and can trace the lineage of this data that can also be shared with a Data Protection Authority or the data protection officer so they can look at reports and so forth so that's the overall architecture for the framework let's get into that that bottom part first so how do we do the data discovery how do we do the data ingestion what does that framework look like so yes sir oh do you yeah now thank you for that I will just go through two more slides before jumping into the demo just to be able to explain our solution just as we have background our i-team started playing with neo4j around 2016-2017 we were doing a GDP on implementation project at a large European bank and what we discovered was some of the things now I was talking about of broken data connections and the unknowns in within your enterprise table if we discovered SharePoint folders we discovered data lakes we discovered things which were being used in having to kind of create a brand new architecture around the was ending up being very expensive and and we were thinking of a new 4G at that time and that's how kind of we got involved in it and in me specifically let me just share my screen so yeah so basically our our product is polymer it's predict data and polymer so it's a little confusing but what we essentially do is in any kind of data set we are identifying PII and encrypting it this could be data at rest or data in motion so imagine sending a PDF file to someone if you push it through our process it would automatically detect the I I encrypt those elements within your PDF document or you JSON object or your skype chat or your slack-jawed even and on the other side the receiver of the information would be able to unlock these pieces of information depending on permissions so we're essentially creating these polarized views where two or five or ten different or however many people can be looking at the same data set but they'll see different elements of that data depending on their permissions just a brief process flow do not want to kind of bore you guys in this but we started up started with the simple kind of connections with neo4j initially to kind of do a POC back last year and at this point essentially we've connected a pipeline where any kind of data source including streaming can be pushed through our API services we're able to create a catalog identify what's PII user can define it also encrypted and then dump it into either a relational format or back to the original format and underlying all of this has been neo4j and and that's kind of what what I will kind of demonstrate to you in a second so this is our enough you can see the screen right yeah well not yet okay house one second yes oh yeah sir has basically you know his demo is basically gonna pull up discover this PII information it's going to yeah there we go so yes sir go ahead yeah so this is essentially a skin of our API services we build these for clients also but real magic happens behind the scenes what you see here is a essential knowledge map of various sources we have explain that in a second if you have a catalog summary which essentially is traversing summations and different groupings within a knowledge graph underlying all of this information sets so we are pulling in data from structured unstructured data a semi structured data and be able to compute it back into a common data model in a graph database to be able to kind of aggregate this information using a the same pain essentially so in the the beauty of being able to kind of putting it in this format is we can then pretty much do whatever you want to do with that data we can kind of create all sorts of local reports tabular reports we're able to even think about in terms of basically you know dump it back into a transaction database and what's happening is as the data is passed through this dashboard is a combination of all the mini knowledge graphs created for your various runs which are catalogs and anything which is considered PII is encoded or encrypted at a node level and hence why you see only person here and nothing else and the idea basically is that we are controlling at a very micro level in who can see what information and maybe linking a customer also in that fashion where if I ever go back to it in terms of being able to start deleting a request for deletion comes from a customer and I'm able to delete it some of this there was a question by Swimathon this some of this data can be dealing and be stored as anonymize information just because it sits in some cases it's very hard to actually do a full delete in a database record in some cases so let me just kind of go through one kind of quick run which I'm going to let me just show you what data and I'm actually going to be able to I'm gonna just reshare my screen here now you can see that not yet now we can okay perfect so what we have here is essentially data are coming in from different sources so this is like an s3 bucket dump off these are retirement prospects potentially these are just perspective kind of relational database here we have another group in terms of which is providing a subset of that customer data to target from their CRM we have this cold call list coming in from sales from another channel financial prospects is another one from different channels and then we have this like restricted accounts and being able to kind of marry those are what we're basically going to do is essentially push it through our process and create a compute that into our knowledge map and be able to actually encrypt it to do things with it so this can be coming in from the purposes of this caller pushed it here but this could be coming in from pretty much anywhere and it could be in any kind of format which is which is the beauty of this where we can essentially do schema-less kind of dumb in a staging area of a knowledge graph and even used Arthas is but you can also think about dumping these raw sources in an object store except it's not an object store but it's a graph database and being able to then push it out after curating it a little bit if you need to but schema-less by itself can work just as beautifully and home but here we are essentially creating a key this password will expire but the idea here is it's going to scan through link them up dedupe the information because we want to have like one view of a customer in terms of being able to see where the customer resides in different location this is a run which was already run for a bunch of email emails coming in because Mills is part of your enterprise kind of data set come to github servers so we have this knowledge map created here but let me just open up in terms of one of the emails and what we see here is like these related files these are the based on actual the duped information around customers or could be around key terms or around key values that is being able to create this recommendation engine out of the bat without doing any extra work for the related information sets out there and in those kind of relationships if I explain that a little bit here and it could be as simple as like in this email Washington Post is mentioned in in two places and for us to be able to if we decide to we can create this to be a common link between different kind of data sets and and frankly it could be not just Washington Post but you can define what that is in terms of what entity data is so this is a run we made I'm just a little bit over time so I'll just try to wrap up real quickly this is an organization which links up these different kind of data sets we can go back to this in a much cleaner view sometimes knowledge maps can bite themselves could get fairly messy but we like to just create specific kind of reports on top of that just by graph QL runs or just pure surf activities for example and essentially what the user on the other side once this data set is pushed out is being is able to then unlock this document or the system where their access since in accessing this data from is a lot so now is there anything else specifically or I think this is good so basically this is polymer then a data catalog built on top of neo4j that's exactly right so this catalog essentially is a summation of a simple queries we're running on the graph and which can get pretty much expanded into finding common patterns or common important PII links between different data sets great great great so we're running short on time so I'm just going to try to move along rather quickly so this is kind of a marketing slide but really kind of shows what privacy shield is all about so it has role-based dashboards you know tracking data movement patterns you can kind of look at threat patterns you can look at anomalies in your data and that can help your business you can do consent management help your business again to track how well you are doing and consents in your marketing department do what if analysis and so on right so now to to get into the privacy shield demo let me share my screen and here we go can you guys see my screen yes sir it's loading right now yeah I can I can answer some of these questions I do agree one the graph view with very large data said we like to create filters on top of that which essentially groupings with a drop-down that you can create which helps and we're able to also done that directly into a snowflake or Postgres database some of the kind of data set to be able to visualize it through tableau or some of the other use cases also proxies Mike had a question possibly define proxies such as IP addresses or cookies are considered to be linkable datasets and they are considered VI answer kisses and never would you great yeah so what you're seeing here is essentially the the front-end dashboard for an individual for the consumer to come in right so it's like a self-service dashboard where they can come in and look at all the data right so as I was mentioning classification this data the consumer data is classified into three categories there's personal data there's classified data and there is app data app data is really in this context we have sort of mocked up a fictitious company called net films so kind of similar Netflix I guess but you know there's data that is being generated by the company for the specific consumer that is also under CCPA right so because that is directly tied to a particular consumer so things like things that have recently watched the history that genre is that their likes the shares so so on so forth so that's again needs to be managed in the same way as the rest of personal data right so they can go and view the data you know they can look edit their data by the way the data base behind this is actually very large it is over a million records if we have time we can we can show you so it has over a million people in there and I think something like 15 million relationships and 15 million nodes so it's it's pretty significant and it's it's behaving in real time as you can see so here you can go and and you know change information here and update it so that that event is then being tracked inside the database again the skin is just a realization our imagination of what this looks like you know your imagination your company's imagination might look different and we can totally customize that that is why this is called a framework and not a turnkey solution but the crown jewels again as I said is the data model you know the the queries that we have pre-written reports that have been pre-written but we can skin at any which way you you like right you can also see who this information is shared with here right you can change all of that stuff you have a summary of all the accepted concerns the activities the here you could look at the consents that have been already you know provided by this for this person Roger Roger can also then say hey I it's okay for my location to be tracked right and you can agree to all the terms and conditions and then now that consent is is is updated in the system right and you can see that change here right right away and now you can actually go and see in the personal data map there Rogers information as a graph right so here you can see all of this information you know and you can see all the consents so this is the consent when this was consented to you can see this is for information subscription this is another consent so this is the one that we just stared right so here's the time now today's and then you know this is being used for tracking location so you can see all the updates that have been made you know the systems that that those in that information is stored in you know you can control this due to the extent that you want the users to see and this is not all that all the information there's a lot of internal events that are not being shown the user that's only in the management for you so this is also a tabular view of this you can look at it chronologically you know so all of this is you can also have like messages to the user and so on we also then have the management view which is you know how this information can be seen by management you can have a lot of interesting business reports that are provided to management by with using this connected data approach right so you have consent trends how well is the organization doing consents we don't have data like from 2019 so so yeah anyway yeah in the in the project we were doing for gdpr this started off it like these kind of dashboards but they quickly evolved into business metrics which was the when coming up for creating these connected datasets which was actually it was business empowering in many ways great and so yeah you can then slice and dice those consents by location you can look at you know your employees and how they have accessed data from what location you can you can have a lot of different things here we haven't put everything here but you know you can analyze the data underlying this in many different ways and give management interesting reports to run the business of the make decisions this is the full data lineage so if we go back to whose ID was a thousand and and search and we get now we start getting you know interesting other interesting like internal data movement right data access who has accessed the data right all of this you know is additional information in the management view so this is like the complete lineage or journey for that particular consumer right you can also see that in in s graph and and you know you can start analyzing you can then also hit this button and an open up bloom and which is our visualization product and explore this here so we can look at you know complete lineage for for this user solace and see that that's going to come up in a few seconds again it's going through all this underlying data not simple going through you know over a million users and fifty million relationships even the context of this particular user it's it's a little very significant so as you can see that's 111 nodes across all of those entities being brought together you can also now start doing ad hoc exploration so you can like look at you can look at like a file for instance here and look at the relationships you can you know open reveal the folder that it's in like for example this this folder here and you can kind of double click that you can trace that back to other files in that folder then you can trace it back to other individuals that might have files so there's a way a lot of ways to explore this data in an ad hoc fashion sorry I'm rushing through this there's lots of other queries that I defined in in the in the perspectives here so you you can define these perspectives which are sort of natural language perspectives and like you can look at a consents and so on and and run that here in bloom so this could be interesting for a business user the DPO or the DPA to look at this data in this way going back to the the slides then we are over here so here is another query that you could have done in bloom that looks at all systems shared drives containing individuals data again this is the data that has brought up by polymer into new for J and now we can start exploring the data in this fashion you can look at all the employees who have accessed the individuals data right and in this is really valuable in finding in the case of a data breach and one thing which I'll add in this what is actually quite skilled the scalability factor comes in that let's say you discover five attributes for a source let's say shape on folder people who have access to it or people what fast they are in that folder for example but tomorrow you discover another attribute let's say we bribed permissions on the individual files for example and being able to bring that in in graph database it's an easy as like a few lines of of basically on the command line or just a query to be able to kind of inject or rebuild your schema on that additional attribute and that could just propagate throughout your your graph database without impeding too much performance which kind of makes this the scalability factor alone actually was why we measured in this ecology and learning and and and building a product on it right and this is the same complete lineage and I just showed you so just to sort of conclude from more presentation perspective right we I think in the first slide I talked about the trust dividend right and that's really kind of critical right so so building this thing in the right way and not piecemealing it like marketing building their own solution security and IT building their own solution right and legal building their own solution to solve for GD P R does not actually solve this for GD P are in in the way that the regulation has been written up right you need to bring all of these different constituents and stakeholders together to build a single solution and and I think that graph is the right way to go because of how all of these entities need to be connected together to to answer the questions right that are being posed by CCPA so but besides that it's you know having a really beneficial impact to your brand it's giving you competitive advantage because now you can do a lot of you can provide your business with interesting information about about this data you can do an analysis of the Custis customer journey or the consumers journey you can bucket or you can categorize customers that have similar journeys together and as new customers are coming along you can analyze that and say hey which journey are they likely to take and you can already sort of market to them appropriately right so all this is a lot of benefit so you're making your spend strategic and not just trying to reduce a compliance risk right by spending money on compliance and and making the problem sort of go away but you're actually spending that money in a more strategic way and an increasing your overall ROI and Rand evident that it's gonna pay yeah and especially from an OLAP investment perspective having a graph database you know as part of that suite for any enterprise just gives developers and this is much more agility and scalability to be able to view things differently and be able to kind of thing up in terms of being able to see connected information sets now we have a few questions here do you wanna start or three or four questions I think we're really over but let's do that yeah node level security yes the 4.0 version u4j allows four node level security highly recommended to take a look at that choice in terms of JSON as an input yes complex do stones yes although you might need to do some work hamid in terms of being able to parse through some of the information said we went down the path of looking at some complex j zones and and we do handle it but occasionally there are use cases which comes in and poorly designed JS ones can be a problematic so nothing out of the box you might need to kind of unpack of yourself a little bit in terms of to the peter ask a question removing data using a graph database that gets a little bit more on the operational side generally IT teams do not like or admins DB is not like outside kind of queries coming in and deleting rows out of a system you know if you have to kind of design something along those lines being able to create staging tables where your deletion queries can be stored as a line item that can be then run overnight or then the TPA can look at it and execute those might be a somewhat more elegant way of being able to handle that especially in somewhat like organization with more than 20 people in it anything else now the kind of comes a polymer app is is is there it's it's a real working up polymer HQ that IO would recommend you guys taking a look at the website this is a material on some of the regulations also there are do we get started so I think the answer to that is you know you can reach out to to us and you know we can engage with you in your specific situation and you know we can draw up a plan of execution we can give you a more detailed demo of this solution and you know we have had customers I execute this in three to four months as I said depending on your particular situation and we can customize it completely for you and with that I think we are at an end Murli did you have any closing remarks no thank you so much to everyone for participating some great questions and again is nap and I said at the beginning if we didn't get to your specific question in our Q&A session someone from the neo4j team will reach out directly to you and follow up with you and everyone stays safe and thanks again for joining us today thank you everyone thank you you said
