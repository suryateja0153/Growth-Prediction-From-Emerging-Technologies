 so here's a summary of the three different types of spectra that we've talked about today the continuous spectrum is up at the top you have a hot dense light source emitting light of all colors of the rainbow and actually outside of the visible range although all of these images just so what our eyes would be able to see with a diffraction grating or a prism so this is what's known as the blackbody a spectrum that peak corresponds to the temperature of the source the middle one corresponds to an emission line spectrum so you have a low density cloud of gas still relatively hot that is emitting light that it has previously absorbed so we see the light being emitted at very distinct specific wavelengths or colors if we graph this as you can see down below from the image with the colored lines you can see tall peaks of light in the graph of intensity versus wavelength so the wavelengths correspond to the colors that we see above and the intensity the higher the peak the brighter that particular color would be in the very bottom we have the absorption line spectrum so this is essentially what happens when you have a continuous spectrum or a blackbody spectrum pass through a low density cloud of gas that cloud of gas will absorb very specific wavelengths from the continuous spectrum so we see that visually as black bars on a colored background or if we graph it we see that as dips in the intensity compared to the continuous one at the very top so you can see that there's some missing color and if you notice not all of the light if that color is absorbed varying amounts actually so some of those dips are deeper than others all of it could be absorbed but just because you see it as a black line on a colored background doesn't mean that all of it is absorbed so those features are known known as absorption lines and in the emission line spectrum the bright Peaks as opposed to the dips Peaks are known as emission lines dips are known as absorption lines
