 some of the graphs have numbers written next to the edges one number per edge well that's that's a sentence fragment right there but one number per edge these numbers are called weights these numbers are called weights so the graph is a weighted graph the graph is a weighted graph the numbers represent the cost of something I used the word cost you'll hear me say give the total cost the numbers represent some cost I'm gonna put cost in quotes right there the cost could be the time to travel from one vertex to another it could be the distance from one vertex to another it could be that if this graph represents some construction the city's planning to do put in some roads it could be the cost of building certain roads so that's three examples there are others the cost could be time mileage dollar-cost I'll put etc' etc other things you might think I'll draw a weighted graph I'm gonna make one up this will be a complete graph let's label these a b c d e a to be I'll put 9 B to C is 3 a to e is 15 a 2 D 10 I could use some of the same numbers it doesn't have they don't have to all be different e 2 D is 3 C to D is 7 e to C is 12 a 2 C 4 C what am I missing B to D 19 1 2 missing B to e b 2 e I'll make it 8 so there's a weighted graph with numbers next to the edges one of the questions is even something as simple as this what is the weight of edge CD what about that seven others will say something like this find the total weight of it's a Hamilton circuit I'll start it E I'm gonna go to D then a B C and then back to e as I wrote that I didn't even look at the graph to see what the weights are I just said I just need all those letters and not repeating except start and stop at the same one I traced that one out e to D then I went to a then I went to B C and then back to E well that would be 3 plus 10 plus 9 plus 3 plus 12 13 13 plus 9 is 20 to 25 37 so the weight of that Hamilton circuit is 37
