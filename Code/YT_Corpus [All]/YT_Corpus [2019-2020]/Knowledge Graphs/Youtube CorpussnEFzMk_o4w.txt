 in this video we're going to work on all the bits and pieces that you need to know about a straight line graph so if this is 100% new to you or you're literally looking for like a mini crash course this is definitely the tutorial for you hi guys Levi here from bright young brains so as mentioned we are working on a straight line graph so when we refer to a straight line graph we know that we may all be visualizing something that looks like this so apart from us keeping in mind that this is basically what a straight line graph looks like we know that with all straight line graphs they have a standard form so with this standard form what that means is any straight line graph that we're ever going to get it will basically have an equation that is in this format now this equation we can clearly see it as like four variables there's y mx and then a C there apart from it having four variables only two of them are basically fixed they basically give like the DNA of your straight line graphs so those two are m and C M being your gradient which gives you like the slope or the steepness and C which is your y-intercept so C is the value there this is the y-intercept that would be C so this is like the basics of your straight line graphs however in our case right we know that when it comes to gradient this formula basically says if you have any two points on your graph you are basically able to throw those two into your equation of the gradient of your straight line graph and this will basically give you the gradient your value for M your C so now that we have looked at this standard form what we also need to keep in mind is things like domain and range so when we speak about domain and range what we are basically referring to is where do you see your graph on the Cartesian plane so what we mean is this graph if you look at our arrows this is basically showing us that our graph is going to extend all the way to infinity that way and all the way to infinity this way now we can clearly see that this graph will have a coordinate for every single spot on our Cartesian plane so what I mean by that is firstly when we think of domain domain will basically be asking you if you're going to be looking at this graph from left to right where do you see the graph so firstly if you look at it from let's say your y-axis going all the way to positive infinity that way you can clearly see that your graph you will always be seeing it right now again if you try that going to the left hand side if you go to your y-axis and you look going to the left hand side all the way to negative infinity you can clearly see that you're still going to be seeing the graph you can visibly see it right so what that means is from left to right you will see your graph everywhere it just means your domain you're going to have it as X as an element of R now what that means is your X values for your graph will be any possible x value as in any x value that you will throw into your equation will always have a corresponding Y value for you there with range it's a question that will be asking you if you look at the picture from top to bottom where do you see your picture or where do you see your graph now in our case we can see that if we go to like our x axis right and we look above it we can see that our straight line graph we can see it there and there are no restrictions there's nothing that is stopping our straight line graph from going all the way to infinity there are no asymptodes or anything like that so our range again if you look at the graph from your x axis going all the way to negative infinity there are also no restrictions, as in this line here will extend all the way to negative infinity what that means is our range for this graph we need to answer it in terms of Y domain we answer it in terms of X hence why we looked from left to right range we answer it in terms of Y hence why we look from top to bottom so we said it goes everywhere from top to bottom what that means is your range is going to be Y is an element of R what that is saying is again it just means there are no restrictions from top to bottom and your straight line graph will basically go everywhere on your Cartesian plane so now that I've mentioned all this your gradient can either be a positive gradient or a negative gradient now what that means is firstly our graph is going upwards you can almost think of it as if you're walking right from the left-hand side you are going to be going up this line so this means that your gradient for this graph will be a positive so any equation where your gradient is a positive your line has to be inclined going upward if your gradient is a negative it means that your line will be going downwards almost like you're going down a slope so these are the basics of everything that you somewhat need to know about a straight line graph.
