 Today we're going to be looking at quadratic functions and their graphs. The first graph is f(x) equals x squared and it's done for you. And it's this parent graph is x squared. This one down here the graph g(x)= x squared plus 5 is graphed on the same graph up here you can see it's shifted up to 5 on the y axis. So it is a vertical shift up. Again we have the parent graph x squared drawn for us right there. The graph x squared minus 4 is here and again it is a vertical shift down to negative 4. Now we have x squared which is our parent graph again but it's x minus 5 the quantity squared minus 5. We would think should be over here but it's just the opposite when you do a horizontal shift. So minus 5 is a shift over here to the plus 5 for x. Then by the same way x squared is our parent function. Again drawn here and g at x plus 5 again is that horizontal shift. And we look at it as the opposite so it is here at negative 5, x value. Again our parent graph is our x squared and we're looking at the graph x minus 1 squared that quantity squared which moves it over here to one like we had said we would think that that should be a negative 1 over here but when we do horizontal shifts it's just the opposite. So we're here at x equals a positive 1 and up 4 because it's also a vertical shift of up 4 on the y axis.
