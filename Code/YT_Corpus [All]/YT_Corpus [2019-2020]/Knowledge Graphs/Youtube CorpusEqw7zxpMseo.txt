 starting from a table of data we can easily create graphs in Google sheets first we want to select the data in the table by left clicking in one corner of the table holding the mouse down we're going to drag to the opposite corner of the table and then release notice all the data is now lightly highlighted in blue then we're going to go to insert and chart and Google automatically selects what it believes is the best chart for our data and displays it often as soon as we create the chart the chart editor will appear if the chart editor does not automatically appear click on the chart and then click on the three dots and Evon chart to get the chart editor up here the default graph here is a line chart if that's not the graph style you wish to use you can select another option here under chart type chart type in the chart editor click on the drop down menu and you get some other options some of them are essentially the same charge is visually different but we can also create bar charts pie graphs and one doesn't look very good does it let's go back to the line graph when we're here in the chart editor take a look at was at the data range the data range is b4 : see 41 let me just slide this over here a moment so our original data started in cell b4 and the opposite corner of the table of data was C 41 so this is how Google is communicating where the data is and that can be edited if that's not the data you wish to use if we click on the customize tab we get some more options chart in axis title we can modify the default title of the text we can also clean change the font title or font size under series we could change the color of the line the type of line see back on the chart and axis title I'm looking for there we go vertical axis title can be then changed horizontal axis title we can change from here to something else and play around try some of the other changes what do you think will make things look nice
