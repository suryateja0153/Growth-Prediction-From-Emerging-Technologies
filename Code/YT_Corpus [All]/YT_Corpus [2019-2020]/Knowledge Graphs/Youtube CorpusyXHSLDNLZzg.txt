 this video is going to show you how to find the  equation of a line from a graph so i need to find   my slope my y-intercept and then i can write my  equation so i'm going to look for two good points   on my graph now this graph gives me two nice  points there's a point here and a point here   well remember when you find slope on a graph you  have to do rise over run so we're going to draw   in my rise first you always go up or down first  in this case i'm going down and then i run across and now i can count it so one two three four five  down since i went down it's a negative five and   then i count to the right one two three four so  over a positive four because i went to the right   which means my slope is negative  five over four now my y-intercept   i look for where it crosses the y-axis well that's  right here so now from the origin that is one   down which means my y-intercept isn't negative  one and i can write my equation this is my m   this is my b and i write it as y equals mx  plus b so y equals my m negative 5 over 4   x plus b but it's a negative one  so minus one let's try number eight   start by finding slope so we rise first  this time we're going up and then we run   so we go up one that's a positive one and then to  the right one two so it's a run of a positive two   which means my slope is one over two my  y-intercept where does it cross the y-axis   that's right here it's on my x-axis which means my  y-intercept is zero so i can write my equation y   equals one half x and a plus zero at the end  doesn't change it so i don't have to write it   now let's look at number nine this time i'm not  given points so i have to find some good points   so i'm going to look through  my line and find a good point   that would be considered a good point because  it's going right through the crosshairs   and if i keep going there's another  good point right there well now that   i've got my two points i can do rise over  run remember up and down first so we go down and then we run across and we count so one  two three four five and one two three i went   down five so that's a negative five and then  i ran three so over three which means my slope   is negative 5 over 3. now i find my  y-intercept so i'm going to look at my y-axis that's right here now from the origin  that's up one so i have a y intercept at one   which means my equation is y equals negative five  over three x plus one 10 same process start by   finding slope so we have to find some good points  here's a good point and i can go across hey look   here's another good point so we can draw in our  rise and our run and we count it remember up   and down first so one two up that's a positive two  and then i run one two three four so two over four   but two over four can reduce to one  over two so my slope is one-half now i   find my y-intercept so i look at the y-axis  that's right here from the origin that's 2   down so my y-intercept is at negative 2 which  means my equation is y equals 1 half x minus two
