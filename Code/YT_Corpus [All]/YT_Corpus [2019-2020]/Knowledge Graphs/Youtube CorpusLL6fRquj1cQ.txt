 look at this graph this is called a connected graph and look at this graph this is called disconnected although self-explanatory I need to add in a comment here you can have 20 friends and they might be part of let's say two groups where this group does not talk to this group at all right but this as a whole is one graph it wrote two graphs this Group A and Group B maybe some football team a football team B they don't like each other across the teams but within the teams they are friends so this is a example very good example of a disconnected graph where the vertex set involves all the vertices here and the edge set involves all the edges here but you see there are two components here similarly look at this graph there are all these things from the vertex set and of course the edges are all the lines put together but it has three components now what about this graph with five notes and absolutely no edges as you can guess this has five components every single node here is a connected component you see so a graph can be connected or disconnected if it is disconnected it will have more than one component
