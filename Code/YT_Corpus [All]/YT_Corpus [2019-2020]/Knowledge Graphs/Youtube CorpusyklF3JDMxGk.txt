 [Music] you [Music] you so in this lecture we will learn about planar graph we'll start with the puzzle so imagine that there are three houses let's just say a B and C and there are three Wells w1 w2 and w3 what we want is to construct parts from each house to each well but these people a B and C do not get along well with each other they don't get along with each other so they want their own individual paths they don't want their paths to ever cross okay so maybe for a1 we can draw it like this so we can have parts of this kind a to W 1 a 2 W 2 and a 2 W 3 and similarly we can draw a path from B to W 1 B 2 W 2 and B 2 W 3 and C 2 W 3 C 2 W 2 but once this has been drawn somehow at least in this drawing W 1 is inside a region and there is no way we can go from C to W 1 without intersecting one of the already existing paths now is this an artifact of our drawing did it happen because we drew it in a certain kind or is it the case that no matter how complicated we draw the paths we still cannot manage to get non intersecting paths okay so in that case so we want to answer this question so we can reformulate this in a graph theoretic fashion by asking the following graph is planar or non planar we could think of this is a B and C W 1 W 2 W 3 and we have the following graph with all these edges present we are interested in knowing whether this graph can be embedded on the plane so we can talk about what is called as a graph drawing a graph drawing we mean we have to find so position the vertices in the plane and and if a comma B is an edge then connect them by a simple curve okay and if we can find a graph drawing in such a way that the edges the curves corresponding to the edges do not intersect then we say that the graph is planar if we can find a graph drawing so there's no crossing then we say that the graph is planar so now the puzzle can be reformulated s is k33 that's the graph that we are interested in is it planar okay so we will develop some tools by which we can answer this question we will what we will show is that K 3 3 is not planar and what will help us do that is something known as the euler's theorem let's see one more example of planarity so let us say we look at this particular graph on 5 vertices okay so this is five vertices and nine edges it's the complete graph from which exactly one edge has been removed okay so we can write this is k5 minus one particular edge let's say if we call that edges a B that's the graph that we're looking at is this a planar graph now if you look at it there are a lot of crossings in this as well so here there is a crossing this is another crossing so there are lots of crossings in this graph okay but can we redraw it in such a way that all the crossings can be avoided in fact so what what I'm trying to emphasize is that if one drawing involves lot of crossing that doesn't mean that we cannot redraw it to get another drawing where there are no crossing in this case we can do that and that can be seen in as follows so there's an inner star which we can think of it as a Pentagon so a is connected to C is connected to E and E is connected to B B is connected to D and D is connected to a so that takes care of the inner Pentagon so fiber just taken care of the other edges that are missing as BC CD de and ei so those also we can draw BC is an edge and CD is an edge and de is an edge draw it in this way and EA is an edge okay so this is an this is a redrawing of the same graph in such a way that there are no crossings and once we draw a graph that in this particular fashion that's called as a planar embedding so what we see here is a planar embedding of the graph G now once we have a planar embedding let us imagine then so we have the entire plane and we have the these particular embedding and if you just remove the edges and the vertices from this picture okay what happens is the plane may get split into disjoint portions so basically you can think of this I see we are removing this particular region and we could ask this question how many geographically connected regions would remain okay so we will give a name to those regions that will basically be called as a face okay so here in this diagram there are going to be this is one face and the green colored region is another face pink is going to be another face this is yet another face okay so in all you can see that there are going to be one two three four five six phases the outside is also going to be a face okay the outer region the entire outer region that's going to be an infinite region that's going to be the sixth face okay so Oilers theorem basically relates the number of faces the number of edges and the number of vertices okay so let us state euler's theorem before that let's write down the definition of a face so we will informally think of it as the connected regions in planar graph drawing this is called a face so now we are in a position to state the Euler's planarity theorem so this says that the number of vertices so if V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges and F is the number of faces and V minus E Plus F will be equal to two because how do we prove this statement the proof is fairly simple we can use an induction on the number of edges so this will be true for connected graphs so take a connected graph it can either be a cycle-free graph or it could contain cycles so we will split the proof into two parts so k is 1 let's say G is our graph the only other cases when G doesn't contain cycle so the connected graph without cycles that's called as a tree so G is a tree now when you have a tree and if you embed the tree into the plane then the rest it does not create any regions and therefore the number of phases will be 1 so case 2 proof is easy V will be equal to number of vertices if we call it as N and E will be equal to n minus 1 and F will be equal to 1 so V minus E Plus F will be n minus n minus 1 plus 1 and that's going to be equal to 2 that's the easy case another case is also fairly easy so if you have cycles then one edge that is at least so if you have cycles and if you embed it you're going to get some particular region which is a phase it could have any number of edges we don't bother about how many edges are there in a particular phase but of course what we can conclude is that there is going to be some particular edge which is part of some cycle and there are two phases on the other side of this edge so let's say that that's F 1 and F 2 if you remove this particular edge from the graph you will get a smaller graph and in that smaller graph what we can say is the number of vertices do not change number of edges have reduced by one the faces f1 and f2 is going to coil as interesting single-phase so we will now be N and E will be let us say me Prime so if you think of this as a reduced graph the number of vertices in the reduced graph is the same as the original one and E prime will be equal to e minus 1 and F prime will be F minus 1 and by induction hypothesis we can say that V prime minus e prime plus F must be equal to plus F prime must be equal to 2 so this is equal to V and this is equal to e minus 1 and this is equal to F minus 1 ok so that can be rewritten as V minus E Plus F is equal to 2 ok so that's a straightforward proof of Euler's planarity theorem let's try and show that K 3 3 is not planar this is what we had this is our main objective let's try and prove this in order to do that what we will we will try and derive a corollary of Euler's penality theorem so now if we look at simple graphs that is graphs without self loops or parallel edges so let us look at any planar graph and any planar graph will have drawing or an embedding in the plane now if you look at a particular edge any edge is shared by at most two faces so let's look at a face and if you look at any face there are some number of edges that is bounding this particular face ok so if this is a planar embedding of a graph the number of faces here are let say this is f1 this is f2 left 3 and the outer face is f4 now if we look at f1 these edges e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 and e6 are the boundary edges and you can do this for each particular face for f3 the boundary edges are going to be e 5e 1011 d2 note that any edge can act or serve as the boundary edge for at most two faces okay so so associated with each face we can have this number F I this denotes the number of boundary edges so if you sum up these FIS over all the faces what you will get is 2 times the number of edges okay now if you take a simple graph each phase is going to have a boundary with at least three edges for a simple graph every face will have at least three edges okay so here in this we are assuming that every edges mean while writing this particular formula we are assuming that there are no vertices of degree one we can we can argue that summation F is two times the number of edges because if you have vertices with degree 1 the edge corresponding to that is part of only one phase so the two term does not come okay our objective is to show that K 3 3 is not planar in order to do this we will obtain a corollary of the Euler's planarity theorem now let G be any graph with so concept of a connected graph without any vertices of degree one okay so this would mean that every vertex is part of some particular cycle okay now if we further assume that this is a planar graph it is an embedding okay so consider a particular embedding on the graph and if you look at the faces if we denote them by f1 f2 f3 f4 and and so on we can associate with each phase its boundary edges for example these red edges are the boundary edges of the face f4 now let small fi denote the number of boundary edges for the face if I so note that every edge is part of precisely two faces for example if you look at this blue edge that is a boundary edge of f3 + f1 okay and therefore we can conclude that summation fi over all the faces that is going to be equal to twice the number of edges because each boundary edge is being counted twice once for each of the phase that it belongs to so now if you take a simple connected graph we can argue that every phase will have at least three boundary edges three boundary edges then efi is greater than or equal to three therefore if F was the total number of faces three F is going to be definitely so summation F I is at least three F this is equal to 2e so we can conclude that F is less than 2 e by 3 okay now if we substitute this in the Euler's formula V minus E Plus F is equal to 2 what we get is e is equal to V plus F minus 2 and that's going to be less than V plus 2 e by 3 minus 2 therefore E is less than 3 week - 6 so this is a corollary that we can use and if we assume that graph doesn't have any cycles of length greater than length less than 3 so then we can conclude that every phase is at least four boundary edges so if the graph is triangle free then what we have is every face must contain at least four edges so for F will be less than summation fi over all the phases and this is equal to 2e so f is less than e by 2 and in that case if we substitute in the formula is equal to V Plus F minus 2 we will get E is less than or equal to V + e by 2 minus 2 so there we can conclude that E is going to be less than 2 V minus 4 so these are the two things that we can use in order to show that various graphs are non planar so let's do that so the first thing we will show is k33 is non planar so this is six vertices and nine edges okay if we substitute in E is less than 2 V minus 4 E is equal to 9 and should be less than or equal to 2 times V that is 2 into 6 minus 4 that's equal to 8 so 9 must be less than 8 K 33 was planar it must satisfy this particular relation because K 33 is a bipartite graph it is triangle free and therefore this condition applies and if it applies the 9 should be less than 8 and that's not the case so we have our contradiction if we look at K 5 that's another graph that we can show to be non planar we showed that particular graph obtained by removing this one edge from K 5 was planar but if we include that edge into it we have K 5 and K 5 we will show as a non planar graph okay again it's simple application of this particular corollary number of edges in k5 is 10 because there were two Pentagon's and 10 should be less than 3 times the number of vertices the number of vertices was 5 minus 6 so this is 15 minus 6 the 10 should be less than 9 if k5 we're planar so that is a proof of non-linearity of k5 look at a slightly more complicated example but essentially the same principle if we look at our Peterson graph this is a graph with 10 vertices so V is 10 and number of edges is 15 okay and we can show that this I mean this is certainly not a bipartite graph because it is an odd cycle so the only condition that we can hope to apply from the car all the two corollary said we had drawn us E is less than 3 V minus 6 but that condition unfortunately it doesn't lead to a contradiction because E is 15 and 3 V is 30 minus 6 so the condition holds but the condition holds doesn't necessarily mean that the graph is planar but here what we can do is we can look at the original condition that says summation F over all phases is equal to 2 e so here I mean there are no 4 cycles or 3 cycles ok so if you so Peter Zenger graph doesn't have three cycles or four cycles there's something that you can easily check and because of this every face must contain at least five edges so five times F is going to be less than summation fi that's equal to 2e so we can conclude from this that F is less than 2 e by 5 now if we look at E is equal to V Plus F minus 2 we can conclude that you should be less than and if it were planar then e must be equal to V Plus F minus 2 and these should be less than or equal to V Plus 2 e by v minus 2 so 3 times e by v should be less than V minus 2 or in other words you should be less than 5 V minus 10 by 3 now if you substitute the values in case of Peterson graphs a is equal to 15 and that is less than 50 because V is 10 minus 10 by 3 you get 15 is less than 40 by 3 that's clearly a contradiction okay so it's seen planarity and we had seen multiple multiple applications of euler's parity theorem to prove that various graphs are not planar to prove the non-linearity of various graphs we'll stop here you you [Music] you
