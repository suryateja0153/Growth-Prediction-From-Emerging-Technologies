 Why do we use graphs in statistics? Graphs are visual representation of data. They're a quick way to show a trend in data or to compare variables. It is worth noticing that there is no regulations on the way to present data graphically in statistics. That's why we may see some misleading graphs. Here are some ways that lead to misleading graphs. First, the scale on the graph does not start from 0. Second, too may need data on the graph makes it difficult to make sense of it. Three, images on the graph misrepresent the information. You can Google misleading graphs images and have a look at some examples. Although, graphs are widely used and, in many cases, are very helpful, they have some limitations. Because graphs are visual presentations, we will not use the graphs to convey our message if people cannot see them: like blind people, for example. Or if our audience does not understand graphs, for example, if we talk to our dog or a baby. In these situations, we will use another way to communicate with them. During this week you will have a look at different ways to organize information graphically, such as a bar graph, a pie chart, infographics. You will also watch a video about challenges in visualizing real data. Enjoy playing around with some online graphing tools and learn about innovative way to solve our world's problem.
