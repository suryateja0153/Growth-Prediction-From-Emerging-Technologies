 when it comes for searching for buried treasure any child has ever dreamt of being a pirate or a great adventurer can tell you x marks the spot later life bags of doubloons and rubies are a little harder to come by but we're still on the hunt this time for answers today we've traded in our treasure maps for graphs there's a wealth of information hidden where two equations have the same solutions and graphing and seeing where two curves intersect can guide us there faster now some of these intersecting questions shop where you might expect like in high-stakes decisions made by people such as economists contractors or air traffic controllers but they're also woven through the fabric of everyday life in the form of criss-crossing linear equations or equations that describe a relationship between two variables where we can multiply one variable by constant to get the other we call them linear because they form straight lines when we graph them linear equations like a compass tree our fearless swashbucklers are essential to algebra and describe fundamental relationships like the ones between distance speed and time or price and cost so let's see what clues we can dig up and having a solve equations just by graphing g'day i'm james Tatton and this is study hall algebra presented by Arizona State University and crash course linear equations shop all over algebra so it's easy to feel like you either already know everything about them or like you should already know everything about them but neither of those things have to be true for example here's a surprisingly hard question to answer what makes a straight line straight now we can close our eyes and imagine a straight line or just drawn with a ruler but how to describe that picture in the language of math now we can start by looking for patterns that are unique to graphs of lines for instance look at the angle between the line and any other horizontal segment I'm gonna wear you out along that line that angle will always be the same and compare that to a graph of a quadratic equation that angle keeps changing or you might notice how the line moves across the plane if I were to run a fixed distance to the right nor where I started I'll have to rise the same amount each time to get back to the line and so on doubled my run that have to double my rise so to answer our not-so-obvious question a line is straight if the ratio of rise of a run which we call slope is the same number no matter where you choose to measure that ratio along the line you can also think of the slope as measuring steepness this line has a sharp slope of 4 this line has a gentle slope of 1/2 if the rises and runs we draw look like an upstairs to right we have a positive slope they look like a down staircase then we have a negative slope now textbooks give this formula to find the slope of a line does really no need to memorize it after you pick any two points on your line the bottom part tells you how far you've run and the top part tells you how far to rise and the line is straight if we get the same ratio no matter which two points we pick now there are two types of lines that cause trouble in the slope department one is a perfectly flat horizontal line like this one this line represents all the points that make the equation y equals 3 true so no matter where I start I run some distance to the right how far do I need to rise or fall to get back to the line 0 I never left so the slope of a horizontal line is 0 the second challenge is in the other direction so to any point on this vertical line and run any distance to the right now try to rise will fall back to the line will never get there vertical lines break our rules for slopes to recall the slope there undefined but since this is a valid line the language of math is still able to talk about it in this case this line represents all the points that make the equation x equals 5 true now if you've taken an algebra class before and someone left out of the crowd the you tell them about graphing linear equations have a sheer muscle memory you might say a y equals MX plus B but the person next to you might remember getting something about the slope from two points another person might remember some equation with a B and C on the sound of it we've now got a whole scatter plot of knowledge the fact we're all talking about the same thing it turns out there are lots of ways to write linear equations with math and they're all useful in different ways but I'll be straight with you this is just one of those things we had to learn like different tenses while learning a language math is a language too so with practice you learn to recognize these forms now in a textbook we might see something like find the equation for a line with slope true that passes through the point 3 comma 4 okay we could put those pieces into our slope equation for any point X comma Y on the line the rise over the run must equal 2 over 1 and we can plug in 3 comma 4 for one of the points in the formula then Y minus 4 over X minus 3 equals 2 okay this is a fine start for an equation but it needs some adjustment the way it is now it actually has a fatal flaw we told that 3 comma 4 is on the line but we plug in x equals 3 what happens oh my goodness we're dividing by 0 now we can't get around this floor by multiplying both sides by X minus 3 and use the equivalent equation y minus 4 equals 2 times X minus 3 instead now even the point x equals 3 y Chris Bourg is a true sentence crisis averted because we built that equation up from just a single point and the slope that general strategy is called finding the point-slope form but thanks to how graphing calculators work and because we tend to like pictures you might be more familiar with a slope-intercept form in the slope-intercept form some key parts of the graph actually easy to visualize from the equation like the slope and the y-intercept or the point where the line crosses the vertical axis now looking at a horizontal axis we see the y-intercept is always where x equals 0 and that's how we can solve for it if we already have the point-slope form we can get the slope intercept form pretty easily by putting everything except the Y on one side the slope of the line is 2 and replaying an x equals 0 we get the y intercept negative 2 there's one more linear equation form standard form here we rearrange the equation so we get all the variables on one side and all the constants on the other now standard form is useful because it doesn't focus on slope and we can still use it for those pesky vertical lines for example the line x equals 5 is really 1x plus 0 y equals 5 and it was in standard form all along so linear equations can come in a few different forms and no form inherently better than any other you can write it as y equals MX plus B or X plus B y equals C or some other clever way you like mathematics cares more about representing the truth than about convention all you might switch it up depending on the situation for comparing two lines we might choose a form where the slope is clear because it hints at how those lines behave together for instance we can think of two lines with the same slope as moving at the same pace if I start on the line and run one unit to the right and then rise two units to get back to the line I have to do the same thing on the second line the two lines will never intersect and are parallel perpendicular lines are somewhat the opposite they cross at a crisp right angle here's a line with a rise of 3 and a run of 2 rotate the picture 90 degrees and we get a perpendicular line now it has a run of 3 and a rise of negative 2 in general perpendicular lines have slopes with opposite signs that are reciprocals of each other I mean if we know the slope of one line we can flip the fraction and swap the side to get the slope of the second so there are two more equations in point-slope or slope-intercept form we'll be able to tell right away if the lines are parallel or perpendicular before we've done any graphic so what about lines that aren't parallel or perpendicular they're not parallel well they must intersect somewhere and the trick is figuring out where in fact hunting for the place where x marks the spot or were two curves intersect is a big deal in math not just with linear equations instead of chess of gold the spot where two curves meet is a treasure trove of information whatever relationships were graphing they only have the same values where the lines cross finding these intersections is actually solving simultaneous equations which are sets of two more equations that all use the same variables we're looking for the values that make those equations true at the same time if you have to solve by hand there's a standard forms chance to truly shine but we can usually find the answer just by graphing instead so start our treasure hunt with a word problem how many gallons of 50 percent salt solution and how many gallons of 10 percent salt solution would have to be combined to make four gallons of 20 percent salt solution the weight this is word problem deja vu we saw something like this before with pictures now we can try it with graphs so it's focus on this through X Y and grid ray vision we know we need to end up with four gallons of solution that's 20% salt or has four times point two equals point eight gallons of salt and to graph we'll need to turn our information into equations they'll call the amount of 10% solution we have K for kind of salty and the amount of 50% in v-fib very salty then K and V added together need to sum to four now we need a second equation to bring in the salt the amount of thought from the kind of salty solution will be 0.1 times K because 10% a sword and the amount of salt from the very salted solution will be 0.5 times V because it's 50% salt added together that's our total amount of salt we're more likely to make mistakes with decimals so let's multiply both sides of this equation by 10 and get an equivalent equation to start plotting let's put V horizontally and K vertically if we find the V&K intercepts we can use those two points to sketch the line that's easy for the first equation and the K intercept for the second equation is pretty easy to when V equals zero K equals 8 what about the K intercept when K equals 0 V equals 8 fifths I mean that could work but integer data is much simpler to work with instead we know that when V is 2 the K has to equal negative 2 now does that make any sense of the real world nope we can't have negative volume but it's fine to extend our map to help us out and the drum long moment do they intersect they do and our asses sounds familiar from our last sort scenario 1 gallon of 50% salt + 3 gallons of 10% salt equals 4 gallons of 20 percent salt solution and so for the second time in a row we've solved a solution dilution problem just by drawing a picture of its relationships but this time we did a little more formally and we can use this graph to get other information about the situation like if we want to adjust the ratios now if you are asked to find the equation of a line even buried in a word problem here some starting points the slope formulas just find the rise over the run between two points use it to find an equation for your line with you already have one point and the slope or just two points and if you're solving a system of linear equations graph them and see where they intersect and a quick way to get a couple of data points to work with is to set each verb or equal to 0 next time look at the graphs of other Crashers haven't drawn yet like logarithms and see what else we can learn from graphs to help us in the real world until then cheerio thanks for watching steady for algebra which is produced by Arizona State University and the crash course team at
