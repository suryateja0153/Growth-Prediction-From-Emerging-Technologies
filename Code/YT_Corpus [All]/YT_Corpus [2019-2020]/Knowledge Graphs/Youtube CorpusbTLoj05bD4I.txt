 around 10,000 BCE before the first Agricultural Revolution there were only a few million humans on earth in 1804 see either about 1 billion of us and just a couple of hundred years later in May 2020 there's around seven point eight billion people living on this planet it's getting a little crowded here our populations growing faster the more people there are that how fast is it growing right now how many people with a B by May 2015 now we could sit down and do the algebra to calculate the exponential growth and get precise predictions but to see the big picture the thing to do is well draw a picture a graph look at a graph we can see how the human population is growing determine the number of rabbits a habitat will support long-term or compare the GDP growth of different countries many kinds of crucial information are easiest to absorb with pictures today we'll treat the techniques we learned in our last two episodes on graphing like employing symmetry and plugging in points to plot data to graph just about everything else we might ever encounter in college algebra today I'm James Tanton and there's a study hall algebra presented by Arizona State University and crash course it might feel like we reached the end of our graphing by hand careers now that we're facing trickier things like logarithmic or rational equations that rember have graphs of quadratic equations were all just fancier versions of y equals x squared once we find the core structure of these new equations we'll see that we can plot just about anything so let's start with exponential equations equations where exponents are variables as we learned in episode 7 exponential equations could take lots of forms but the ones we use to model things like population growth all have a couple of things in common for one their functions so in plug in x values and get just one Y value something like negative three to the x equals nine is an exponential equation but it only has one solution x equals two I'm not going to get a graph out of that and second the exponential functions we're interested in have positive bases a graph of something like y equals negative 3 the X will be full of holes since not all X values are allowed without imaginary numbers and it won't necessarily help us understand a real-life situation so let's start by graphing our old friend y equals two to the X now if we plug in easy to check numbers like 1 2 3 or 10 for X and solve for y we might start to see a trend or 2 to the 1 is 2 to the 2 is 4 and 2 to 3 is 8 but 2 to the 10th is a thousand and 24 and we keep going to the 20 is in the millions says 2 is bigger than one bigger exponents will always mean bigger Y values so you see that the graph with this equation Rockets up very quickly as x increases and we can plug in easy to check numbers on the other side of our graph 2 anything raised to the 0 power is 1 great the negative exponents move our powers of 2 into the denominator so 2 to the negative 1 is 1/2 true the negative 2 is 1/4 and 2 to the negative 10 is 1 over 2024 and so on even if the X values are negative the Y values will always be positive but they get closer and closer to 0 as X decreases now I think you here have relied on our basic exponent rules not the base so all other exponential graphs will follow this pattern even if we take on a coefficient like with y equals 8 x to the x or y equals two to the X all over 2 for coefficients that are powers of 2 there's a neat trick involved that you might remember from the episode on exponents 8 is 2 cubed so 8 times 2 the X is really 2 to the 3 times 2 to the X which can be rewritten as 2 to the X plus 3 since we can add exponents when we multiply terms with the same base now all the action that was originally happening x equals 0 is now happening at x equals negative 3 factory plug in negative 3 for X we get y equals 2 to the 0 but the shape is still the same now we're two to the x over two we can cleverly manipulate the exponent to see that it's really 2 to the X minus 1 and the graph shifts the other way so that all the x equals 0 action is now happening at x equals 1 but again the shape is still the same in general multiplying by constant is just multiplying the original Y values by that constant so for Exponential's that also means shifting the graph to the left or to the right and if we change bases to something else positive like y equals 3 to the x or y equals e to the X the trends we originally found stayed the same if we compare the Y values we'll see the same general shape we've just adjusted the steepness of the curve so when graphing exponential equations just find a simpler version of the equation and start with that graph just like we did with quadratics now everything we've done so far with graphing exponential equations is actually everything we need to do to graph logarithms they look really weird and something like y equals log base 2 of X is just puzzling to try and visualize but remember that log should really be called powers equation y equals log base 2 of X is just saying that Y is the power 2 that gives X as the answer so 2 to the Y should equal X 1/2 graphing our log equations the same as graphing x equals 2 to the Y and we just did that tilt our head a bit and we're done it's just the graph we had before with the X's and Y's switched so I put the X inspector where we used to and we can just flip the picture and tada y equals log base 2 of X any logarithmic equation will basically look like this for X values more than 1 but bigger than 0 the curve heads down towards the negative y axis as X moves closer to 0 and for larger and larger positive x values the curve increases just kind of slowly so far graphing other equations isn't much harder than graphing quadratics the trick is the same we're just transforming a basic shape over and over so let's up the ante and look at rational equations why not let's stop the simplest one y equals 1 over X if you don't know what the basic shape looks like a good starting point is just to make a table of data points with some friendly X values like 0 or 10 just like we did for exponential equations usually 0 is an especially friendly choice but here something immediately jumps out at us X can't be 0 so graph will not have a point on the y-axis but knowing X can't be 0 lets us do something unusual let's multiply both sides of equation by X and now we've got x times y equals 1 again we can notice that X can't be 0 0 times anything will be 0 not 1 but also we can see that Y can't be 0 there are no points on either axis so we still make a data table with other points X&Y just have to multiply to 1 so if x equals 2 then y equals 1/2 same for x equals 1/2 y equals 2 and x equals negative 2 y equals negative 1/2 and X equal negative 1/2 and y equals negative 2 we can gather lots of data points like this there's lots of symmetry at play here basically as exits bigger Y has to get smaller so that x times y it's still 1 and if X is tiny then Y has to be huge but all this without X or Y ever being 0 the axis the lines x equals 0 and y equals 0 are actually asymptotes or lines the graph gets closer and closer to so when we put it all together we can think of the points 1 comma 1 and negative 1 comma negative 1 as our corners and on either side the graph will be approaching its SM totes along X and y axis and for the first time we have a graph that comes in two pieces so what if we had a more complicated rational equation like y equals x plus 6 all over X plus 4 how could we uncomplicated one approach is to do what mathematicians call engage in wishful thinking now wouldn't it be lovely if the numerator were exactly the same as the denominator and we could change it all to y equals x plus 4 over X plus 4 well we can't go that far but we can get an X plus 4 to show up in the numerator just think of X plus 6 as X plus 4 plus 2 so now we have X plus 4 plus 2 all over X plus 4 and we separate that into X plus 4 over X plus 4 plus 2 over X plus 4 that first term is just a fancy way of writing 1 so now we really have 1 plus 2 over X plus 4 the behind-the-scenes 1 over X structure is starting to appear so let's go back to y equals 1 over X for a second if we multiply that by 2 so y equals 2 over X all the Y values are double what they were before and the curve stretches a bit the graph of y equals 2 over X plus 4 is just the same except the plus 4 in the denominator means that all the way stuff that was happening at x equals 0 is now happening at x equals negative 4 that moves the whole picture 4 units to the left and finally adding 1 to the whole equation adds 1 to all the Y values and shifts the whole picture up one unit now if all that sounds overwhelming please don't be dismayed it takes practice to develop the intuition about how to the basic templates hiding in more complicated equations it's a literal learning curve and building our skills by hand plotting functions is worth the effort if you know how to make those connections we'll be able to use out graphs to answer questions and even make important decisions let's talk through some biology goggles or biology goggles are really mad CC resume in enough let's say you're a scientist studying algae bioremediation which basically means you use algae to fight pollution ideally you grow algae on the surface of polluted water the algae then takes up the pollutant as they grow and you skim the algae off and you have a less polluted pond repeat with more algae until the water is clean sounds great and slimy with just a few algae cells and plenty of sunlight they'll reproduce super fast as soon as they feel upon don't run out of light and their population is going to level off and stop growing that's when they've reached their carrying capacity or the maximum the environment can hold populations that grow super fast and then level off a common in biological systems they're modeled by logistic equations where a B and C are all constants based on data from past experiments logistic equations like this one for your algae make it hard to see the carrying capacity right away or by plotting a few points to get a graph the carrying capacity line is more obvious and you can know when to skim off one batch and let the next batch start growing you thought it takes about two weeks to level off but to be sure you plug in X values up to date 21 turns out when you check the Y values the algae growth levels off much sooner after about 12 days and from there you can work backwards look at the X values and see if it could skim the pond any sooner at 6 days it's only about half billed for the curve is almost level after 10 days which would have been hard to find with that graphing the equation so you'll end up doing more bioremediation cycles in fewer days and that's going to get your water clean a lot faster so will you graph everything by hand for the rest of your life no way for the trainee from the graphs you're drawing right now will be with you for as long as you need it if all else fails and you get stuck trying to predict what the graph is going to look like don't get discouraged make it table of points a table of x and y values will never fail you and there's no shame in doing this after all a graphing calculators exactly there next time we'll finish out our discussion of graphing with some real-world applications of data fitting until then Cheers please to watch you study for algebra which is produced by Arizona State
