 before-and-after pictures are all over the advertising world from devices that reorganize cabinets to the latest milk pouring technology but long before social media or TV commercials we used visuals to show change clearly and more persuasively and not just to get people to buy supposedly life-changing stuff journalists and scientists use visuals to keep track of how unpredictable situations or experiments change over time besides before and after though understanding what's going on in the midle trends over time correlations between inputs and outputs and actually describing them can be just as powerful and informative so how can we visually represent transformation head to our drawers reveal the underlying relationships and data and we were asked to graph an equation what does that really mean g'day I'm James Tanton and this is study hall algebra presented by Arizona State University and crash course although human beings are very visual creatures it took us a surprisingly long time to come up with a simple way to picture those transformations and relationships in the wider world of mathematics a graph can mean many different things but in college algebra a graph is a way to visualize data with points on two perpendicular number lines that make what we call the Cartesian plane this particular visual where this horizontal and vertical axes is named after Rene Descartes the 17th century mathematician and philosopher as legend goes they cut devised the system not after hours of careful mapping but while lying in bed watching a fly crawl across his ceiling based on all the buzz and how often we use as see graphs we'd never know they are only 400 years old so much of math feels set in stone and as old as time but often the ideas were using quite new like graphs now when you're asked to hand draw pages and pages of them for homework or cowork has 30 slides to click through your first response might not be gosh what a marvelous invention but although it can be easy to take grass for granted they're an incredibly efficient and elegant way to convey information let's say we've been growing some plants on our windowsill and we want to answer the question does more water mean to all the plants so we give each plus a different amount of water each day and measure their Heights after a week but if we put this data into a table and for five or ten plants a well-organized table might be enough to suggest a trend but what if the scope of our experiment is wider than a windowsill maybe we're working for the Department of Agriculture and looking at 50,000 plants a table would still hold all this data but we wanted to show our conclusions to someone else it would take them an awfully long time to read all fifty thousand rows ideally we'd be able to show someone just one image and have them understand the summary of what we found from all our observations and that's what graphing will let us do let's go back to just a window cells worth of plants so we see the whole table at once now we didn't give the first plant any water so the seed didn't sprout zero milliliters zero centimeters we gave the second one twenty milliliters daily and it grew to be one cent a bit at all over the course of the week and we see our plants kept growing with 42 16 80 milliliters until we got a four point nine centimeter tall plant with a hundred milliliters of water so let's make the start of visual and break down the elements of a graph first we need a plane which is an imaginary two-dimensional surface like an infinite sheet of paper and an axis one number line for each variable on the Cartesian plane our axes cross at 90 degrees and that's probably the way you've seen 99.9% of graphs drawn but it's not the only way like if you ever watch Star Trek you might have noticed that the consoles on Klingon spaceships display everything with 60 degree axes and it broken into equilateral triangles but we humans find right angles much easier to work with so here on earth without two number lines and squares we can record two data values in one hit by plotting a single point this is the same thing Descartes was supposedly doing with the fly he turned his progress along ceiling into horizontal and vertical pieces now for our graph we need to decide which variable will be the horizontal or the vertical component and the convention can help us decide with our plants we are in control of the amount of water we give each plant so water is the control variable or the independent variable and we usually put it on the horizontal number line or x axis the vertical axis or Y axis usually represents the dependent variable or the variable that changes depending on the control variable for us the height of the plant depends on the amount of water it's commonly convention to say that up and right are the positive directions and left and down other negative directions as long as we label our axes clearly we could do whatever makes the most sense for our data so if the water is on the x axis and height is on the y axis our first point is at x equals zero y equals zero right in the center of the graph every other point is defined by its distance from this point so we call it the origin our next point is that x equals 20 y equals one we've moved up one unit and right 20 units from the origin we can write this as an ordered pair or X value comma Y value in parentheses and that's what we need to plot the rest of our data so far with these measurements of plants we can sort of see a trend more water means more plant growth focus squeeze even more information over the graph by identifying an equation to more precisely represent how water affects the height of these plants to do that we need to connect our points with some sort of line we could like to write down as an equation with y equals something about X since our points line up is tempting to just draw a straight line through them fitting an equation to data is actually called curve fitting even when the line is straight and we'll talk more about how that happens in a later episode for now we're going to warn against extrapolation or using the curve to talk about values outside the data range especially when you have a small data set if we continue the line out to say 20,000 milliliters of water each day which is about how much I should drink in two weeks of graph predicts we'll get a plant 10 meters tall that can't be true unless your name is Jackie here part of the magic being a less risky move is interpolation or making guesses at what the values between points could be for instance how tall will a plant grow given 70 milliliters of water but we can't be sure but based on our trend from 60 to 80 milliliters bring guests around 3.5 centimeters filling in likely values and making predictions for data we don't have is the reason we attempt curve fitting even though the data points in real life are rarely going to line up perfectly here we started with a few points graph them and fit a curve to them to get an equation but we can also start with an equation that's subscribing the relationship between datasets like water and height plug in a few X values and get points and graph the results in fact equations describing relationships between variables where every input has only one possible output accord functions and that often what we're really graphing when we're graphing equations example let's say a group of inputs called the domain is the set of all people and a function assigns them each a birthplace so all the possible outputs or the range are all the locations in the world where people are born so if you stuck me into a function the output would be late Australian sure lots of other people being born dead late but that's okay we only care that each input each person has one output most of the equations we've been working with could also be interpreted as functions from linear equations like y equals x plus 3 to more complicated equations with polynomials and logarithms they're all described relationships where every x value has just one y value but sometimes a relationship isn't consist for all inputs and we can't describe our data with just one equation a piecewise function which is one function made of a different equations for different rips of inputs can be tricky to plot for instance let's say y equals x squared when X is less than zero but y equals two X when X is greater than zero and what about at zero well our function doesn't specify so we just draw an empty circle there to indicate that it's not included piecewise functions turn up in a surprising number of places and for college algebra they're really good way to practice graphing and interpreting equations but you've constructed a piecewise function with speed and time whenever you've taken a train to work and then walk the rest of the way and 3d computer graphics rely on piecewise polynomials to describe curved shapes now shipping companies have long tables of costs which really covers them to use but ideally we could represent the underlying patterns with equations and graphs and since many businesses charge the initial flat fee for the baseline service then apply additional costs we could be working with a piecewise function so let's have a look through the math goggles let's say I'm trying to get a sense of shipping costs my small business selling math themed pottery and this is the pricing plan for a shipping cabin called my old owner let's call them ku PS so first I want to know what size parcels I can send it doesn't make sense to shift something with negative or zero weight and where do you have equations for inputs up to 50 so this shipping company weren't to handle anything above 50 pounds apparently and second what is it going to cost me usually the least expensive thing to send is a very light object and that seems to cost about $5 and the most expensive thing is probably a heavy 50 pound object which comes in at 75 dollars but so does a 25 pound object hmm let's graph equation by equation and pay special attention to the input values where we change equations if we plug in a few x-values and plot the points between 0 and 10 we get a straight line but careful 0 and 10 aren't inputs for the first equation so the endpoints are hollow in the middle piece there is a value for 10 which is $23 by plotting a few more data points we get a steeper line from 10 until right before x equals 25 y equals 53 but 25 isn't an x value for this equation so another hollow end point then between 25 and 50 there's just one value the output is 75 dollars no matter what the input is so the data points here make a flat line so QPS charges at least five dollars and the price steadily increases until about ten pounds where it seems to increase twice as fast but the items between 25 and 50 pounds there's a flat rate of 75 dollars I pick a much better quick reference so when we're graphing an equation for a function we're really just visualizing data and relationships they can be intimidating to get started so when you given an equation to graph make a table of a few data points and look for trends that will help you skip the general shape of the graph this technique will carry you pretty far in college algebra next time will hone out graphic fuels and rely on symmetry
