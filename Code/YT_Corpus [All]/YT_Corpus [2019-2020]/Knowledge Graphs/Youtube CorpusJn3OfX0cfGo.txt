 AOA .hope you are fine. today the topic of my tutorial is how to plot graphs on MATLAB so first we will open the MATLAB I have version 2016 8 it will open like this take some time so meanwhile it is opening I I shall tell you about my video content but we will do in this first we will upload a simple graph in MATLAB and then I will show you how you can bury your results and make them colorful in representation so first we will go to this new okay first we will open this new script okay and save it as plotting graph whichever directory you want to save I saved it as Grafton so now we will declare some values like alright and at the end you know that semicolon is required so we have the multiple values for supper first I will allot against one entity like one entity on x-axis and one on y-axis and then I will go on and increasing the values on y-axis against that x-axis you know we have multiple variations in physics and mathematics like we plot two entities against x-axis so I will show you this in this video now let us declare some values like say for XP request you okay for suppose I have some values okay so I have declared two variables you should keep in mind that whatever the value of vector is this like it has four columns the same four columns should be for the ends otherwise it will give you an error so Lord first the x-axis so W coma I have keep my y-axis suppose at so let me replace it the post I will give it a Y and it it is saying that Shift + Enter it will change that right so save and that one actor passed because I have saved in the different folder you see it busy here so it is processing okay so we have on the x-axis like this and on the y-axis we have the lot of values all right but this is a very basic and simple value graph now I will do some variation on this graph and make it look beautiful and for those students who want to present it in their research paper or some other jebel paper so how to present your graph using MATLAB this is my topic today okay so now put some value small Y 1 equals I have some other values like okay you should keep in mind that there should be spaces between the two numbers or you can put a comma so now I want that it is also why banish altar also plotted against the value W so now you will see that W comma y1 okay and I say so this is C but I haven't added any colors as you can see it has already added color tone and so on but I want that I add my color on my own so I will add there are two ways on by doing literally anything and bring it into the programming or you can also do it by opening the plot window so I will tell you both ways first we will do here by suppose I want to give it a blue color blue this should be like this ticket and suppose the marker for the graph should be like this okay and and this should be someone's red it is giving me another C comma is missing make sure you commas so now you can see that first plot is like blue and started static is shown at the corner end point where the graph is drawn showing transition and in the second one it is showing red and I have entered oh so it is showing this you can also change it like going into the show floor stupid dog figure both this icon okay so now you can choose the variation you click on here on the boundary go on phone you can bold it you can keep it italic as you want I will tell you each on everything you can change the font name and you can also change the size of these values next time here x-axis you can also add X label and wire labels in the programming as I said but I will tell you later firstly this that you can change colors here I have selected this second one here and you can see marker I have written what I have written in our programming is there now I understood and I can change the color to purple so it is changed now okay so now I close it and I will tell you what is X table suppose it's the distance for it should be inverted mr. and y11 for suppose dated frequency and you want to enter the title either there are both are the ways you can enter here or you can go on the dog seeker window and enter the values there I will show you that what I am entering here will display it there okay title will be like okay so it will automatically give me a red line if I will not when you will put the single column then it will become a purple one okay so now running this one now you can see that frequency and distance are all displayed here now going to the dog window and I will show you there you go to this one font again you want it bold x-axis you see here distance is given now if you want to plot a log so you don't have to implement that on the programming support on why I've said I want frequency on dog so it will change okay so I am getting back again here I want to change this title so I can come here z axis I want to add some values so graph will be displayed now that's what I will click on this window and I want this to be displayed in the picture form on my desktop so what will we do expose data exposed Dexter and Matt laughing uh no JPEG image okay okay now you will see on your desktop okay a related opening I bet you that there are some colors that you can write here like blue white yellow yellow for yellow you would write Y and then write blue prints and so but if there is any color of your choice so as I said that you can change from here I'm going to dock window and you can change as many as your colors so more colors and you can select it as much as you can okay if you have you knew the value of saturation values or hue you can enter here if there is an RGB value for Apple are you fine somewhere and you want that color on the graph so you can enter RGB values here or in even if you have a color code like CDs okay so that's very simple and that's how I show you my graph here it is so if you have any queries for me please comment and let me know thank you very much laugh is
