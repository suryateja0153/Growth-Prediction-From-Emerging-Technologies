 a good good afternoon everybody my name is Chris Wixon it's a pleasure for me to be here today and share with you my experience with the creation of a knowledge graph for the healthcare industry in full disclosure unlike many of the accomplished data scientists who are that are here today I'm merely a practicing vascular surgeon next slide I've been in practice for approximately 20 years and during that time I've had the good fortune of caring for numerous patients with both life and limb threatening problem it's truly gratifying work I say this as I want to emphasize the magnitude of the decision that I made approximately four years ago I was gonna I contemplated quitting the practice of medicine thanks like like many other physicians around the country I was tired and angry it was a classic case of burnout next slide but before quitting I asked myself the obvious questions why was I so unhappy after all I had amazing tools in my disposal tools that allow me to diagnose problems at an early stage and then treat those problems with increasingly minimally invasive techniques next slide ladies and gentlemen the electronic health record is not one of those tools at first it seemed practical who would argue with a process that are advocated legible documentation electronic information sharing and aggregate decision support but soon after the next slide but soon after implementation came the unintended consequences as it turns out electronic data entry is loathesome soul-crushing work it causes disruption to the patient physician interaction and is the proximate cause of widespread physician to satisfaction all the while the promise of improved outcomes and reduced healthcare costs have remained elusive ironically is my discontent with the current system that allowed me to pursue the solution that you'll hear to hear about today next slide early on I spent time developing customized templates that fit the new electronic format next slide but no matter how much time I spent the system remained confusing inefficient and failed to adequately capture the essence of the patient's illness I didn't realize it at the time but these I did my formative lessons in data modeling now now before I get too far down on the electronic health record vendors I'd like to say it's not necessarily their fault as Henry Ford once famously said if I'd asked people what they had wanted they would have said asked for half a stir horses similarly in an effort not to disrupt the physician workflows designers of current systems mimicked workflows around traditional paper medical records that is to say they were designed to simply be faster horses it's precisely what the medical industry asked for but not what they needed I thought there must be a better way here's the key concept you connect slide here's the key concept rather than documenting a patient history which contained a variety of data points why not create data points which accurately reflected the patient's history for me this was an epiphany thanks like now it's true that healthcare data are complex they exist in multiple locations they're structured and unstructured they have any inconsistent definitions and are constantly changing due to at regulatory bodies next slide here are for you the most commonly used terminology system by the healthcare industry such suits such systems are integral to health informatics systems as they support the representation of detailed clinical concepts in a computable manner but on their own the terminology does nothing they are only a single component needed for the solution for an effective medical record to benefit from a terminology it must be implemented and used as part of an integral part of the application next slide so what if we did just that what if he used the patient's problem as the core of our system we could if we could pre coordinate medical knowledge in a clinically relevant manner we could then enable documentation through a process of simply semantically navigating the graph next slide I spent a lot of time on the whiteboard developing convoluted models that look something like this honestly I was lost in the date data and it was pretty messy stuff I had to remind myself that the graph was being built to accomplish a particular case in my case to document a medical history as such the underlying schema needed to be Purpose Driven to facilitate usability it also needed her consistency and efficiency to the user thanks slide after spending a great deal of time on the problem what emerged was a concept model or a meta model that is that represented clinical concepts in the universal and economical manner the key concept here is the use of attribute attribute nodes which correspond to various components of the electric electronic health record as such in a such serve as a pointer function to tell the system how a particular resource should be used in a particular medical application while the model appears to be relatively simple we found it to be incredibly expressive next slide I think the best way to show the model is demonstrated is demonstrated through an example which demonstrates the relationships between clinical concepts let's say we wish to associate a medical diagnosis say carpal tunnel syndrome with a hunt with a concept called hand weakness we first created a direct relationship between the two nodes and then we use the attribute symptom which describes the relationship between the concepts I should note that since all resource nodes in the model are bound by the sno-med ontology all superclass concepts are inherited by the resource node we can talk about this later if anybody's interested in this next slide another thing that I really like about the model it as it permits nodes that do not contain explicit content but rather allow the grafts who recommend data to the user that's not explicitly entailed for example as part of a patient plan for the same diagnosis carpal tunnel syndrome the physician wishes to make a referral to an orthopedic surgeon instead of creating explicit relationships between the tens of thousands of orthopedic surgeons were able to launch a node which references an epoch spatial query to locate all the physicians with the label orthopedic surgeon and having the criteria of sharing the location with the user obviously the next step would be to include provider networks as part of the recommendation engine also since this data that is captured is fully structured we can delegate the responsibility of processing the patient referral to the computer we can do the same thing with prescription medicine and schedule tests and procedure by making by making use of the Apoc spatial query we can look for pharmacies testing centers hospitals which share a Geo location with the provide with the patient next slide let's go to the next slide before we get too far into examples of the graft in action I want to sit drink spend a very brief moment to discuss ranking functions because it's important when you're creating a knowledge graph it's something we actually hadn't thought of when we first developed the graph imagine we use the graph to perform a faceted search on the terms metacarpal fracture next slide obviously if alphabetical order does not make sense to the user index being the first term on the on the on the returned payload really doesn't make sense so sibling concept nodes need to be presented in a contextual orderly manner and in the health care sector concepts are more likely to be ranked by size severity in atomic site or perhaps frequency of use this is something that a domain expert will need to provide when curating the graft next slide so even if we can represent concepts in a clinically relevant economical and orderly manner the obvious questions arise can we truly map the entire human condition and if that's possible with the model be too complex to be useful next slide obviously to build such a tool you're going to need a domain expert and in the healthcare industry you're going to need a team of them the challenge is that these people tend to be in short supply and they tend to be very busy people next slide so where are we today today we built a graph that contains approximately 1.5 million clinical concepts and those clinical concepts are connected by about 5 million clinic relationships the graph contains the bulk of information for the fields of general medicine cardiovascular medicine orthopedics neurology renal medicine and soft tissue and we're spending the agretti and we're expanding the graph nearly every day next slide one of the things I think is really great about a knowledge graph that it provides means for an expert physician like the gray-haired physician in the upper left hand corner to transfer knowledge to a less experienced user often that's the case in medicine a doctor may see a patient that does not fall strictly within their domain the data encoded in the graph can assist the user by providing lists of potentially appropriate diagnostic diagnostic or therapeutic decisions next slide okay so we finally arrived at the fun part of the talk I brought a couple examples to show you how this might work let's say the user is an orthopedic surgeon and he's away from his office perhaps he's in the operating room and for billing purposes he needs a diagnosis code associated with a broken leg you might be surprised to learn that there are approximately 3,000 icd-10 codes associated with this injury one method is to go to a reference book that looks a lot like the yellow pages and and look the code up it's a tedious process and if you hit the click button I'll show you how this works for this use case we designed a smartphone application around the data contained in the graph the data would first choose a patient and then drive through the decision tree in order to get to the appropriate code it's hard to see in this particular potential thing but they just drill through the code using very short numbers of nodes to choose from in order to get to an actionable mode associated with a particular entity to provide context to the user previously selected nodes remain visible on the interface and since the port this portion of the graft is arranged in an a cyclic manner if the user finds himself down the wrong branch of the tree it's easy to go back up and explore a different branch without getting lost as an alternative the app also supports a faceted keyword search method next is a very preliminary iteration which demonstrates how a user would interact with the graph to document an entire patient visit we purposely tried to create an efficient user interface that is devoid of extraneous information context should come from the data itself not from the interface as I noted earlier the metamodel of attributes corresponds to typical components of the physician encounter such as history of present illness physical examination review as systems and plan each of those have children with which correspond to items in column one as you see on the Left hit play now so I'll show you how you can go this is a particular the diagnosis that you see in the blue bar on the top is a diagnosis of carotid stenosis so when we asked the user to document well so that's just showing the different categories throughout the electronic health record and if we go back to history of present illness and we ask what particular symptoms it will start delivering disease specific symptoms to the user and they can they can document whether there is a firt whether that symptom is there in the affirmative or the neg or the negative the idea is to allow the system to participate in the medical history taking at the point of service and without being mentally distracting to the user in the bottom pane it's hard to see there you can see the history is documented concurrent to the navigation and next slide upon completion the system generates both human and machine representations of the data and the encounter is immediately interoperable via fire compliant API or more clearly another benefit of the graft is that it can be used to store the clinical information that was captured storing the information in a graph format would enable the array of graft algorithms to look for unrecognized patterns which exist in the data perhaps the next years meaning I'll be able to bring that back to show that to you and next slide I'd like to conclude by stating that I was fortunate to have emerged from burnout before throwing in the towel unfortunately we continue to lose a number of good physicians due to this process and if we truly hope to modernize our health care system through improved outcomes and reduce costs we must acknowledge that healthcare is a data dependent industry things like machine learning and value-based healthcare will depend on concepts being represented in a reliable a complete and a computable format last slide perhaps the medical knowledge graph can provide the necessary panacea a knowledge graph offers significant advantages over traditional symptoms one of which is not listed there is the speed at which the transactions occur latency is a very annoying process as you're going through an electrical electronic health record the time between clicks and the the graph database is probably the fastest platform out there in addition it offers the graph the graph participates in the medical encounter and keeps the user focused at the problem at hand it enables the use of lightweight devices such as such as a tablet at the point of service it enables less experienced clinicians to function at the top of their credentials it provides a method of storing clinical agent information suitable for pattern recognition algorithms and it can facilitate the delegation of ten the delegation of tasks to the computer such as scheduling and prescribing and the last slide thank you very much for your attention and be happy to answer any questions in the the quarter afterward thank you [Applause]
