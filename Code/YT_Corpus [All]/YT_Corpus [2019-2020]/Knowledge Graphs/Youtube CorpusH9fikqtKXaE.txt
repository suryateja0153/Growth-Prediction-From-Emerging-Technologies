 in this video we're going to be looking at graphs in this particular slide that we're looking at now it is a distance versus time graph or we could say it is a position versus time graph that's another way to think of it we are ranking these on this slide based on velocity and we know that velocity is equal to displacement over time velocity is a vector displacement's a vector and so if we look at a and we look at the slope slope is equal to rise over run so in case a has a relatively small slope for a relatively small rise over run now the rise is the change in the position which can be given the symbol x so that's delta x over the run delta t so the slope here is equal to delta x over delta t and that is the velocity of a so it has a small slope and therefore it has a small velocity if we were to look at say case c and if we were to try trying to do about the same run you see the rise is much more so the delta x is definitely bigger delta t i picked it to be about the same as the one down here so this one has a bigger slope and you can just see that as you go from a to b to c all the way up to f the slope increases and so f is the one going the fastest and a is the one going the slowest so those are quite easy and so in your explain the reasoning you can say since the slope of a position versus time graph oop don't need a comma there is equal to the velocity we can rank them by slope all right let's look at the next one here we've got a velocity versus time graphs you've got to pay attention the axis changed and we're also changing what we're ranking them on we're ranking them on acceleration oh and it has a 1 there so i'll just write this out here acceleration is equal to delta v over delta t velocity and acceleration are both vectors and so we look here we look at the rise over run so the rise here is going to be delta v the change in v over delta t change in time and so here we can rank these similarly say since the slope of a velocity versus time graph is equal to the acceleration we can rank these by slope and so therefore a has the least slope then b then c and and then f how many of these are moving at a constant velocity it doesn't ask you that but i'm asking you now what do you think how many of these are moving at a constant velocity if you said none you're correct okay think about it we could put a scale on here let's say that's one two three etc well the velocity at the beginning for a object a is moving at zero meters per second later on it's moving at about a half meter per second then one meter per second one and a half meters per second so no that's not a constant velocity it does however have a constant acceleration okay so it has a changing velocity but constant acceleration all right and that's true for all of them they all have constant accelerations but each one has a different constant acceleration and we're going to be taking advantage of objects that have constant acceleration because we have a set of equations that you're going to see in the next module called the kinematic equations of motion and you're going to use those to predict and to determine calculate various unknowns in a lot of situations but they're only going to work when the acceleration is constant doesn't mean the velocity has to be constant only the acceleration all right let's take a look at one more graph here we're also ranking them for acceleration if we look back to the last one we're ranking those on acceleration and this looks like the same graph however the axes are different well then just the vertical one the velocity is on the axis the vertical axis here but on this one it's distance or position so we're asked about acceleration and we remember that acceleration is equal to delta v over delta t so it's a little bit more challenging here we're not given a velocity versus time graph but we're asked to rank their acceleration so can we figure anything out about acceleration here well let's just look at case a case a is moving along and it has a certain slope here and it has a certain slope later on well the slope stays the same okay for a the slope is constant and on a position versus time graph the slope is equal to the velocity so we can therefore determine that the velocity is constant and if the velocity is constant then we know what about the acceleration that's right the acceleration is equal to zero and then we go to case b and we see that for b the slope is constant and if the slope of b is constant then the velocity for case b is constant and if the velocity is constant then we know the acceleration is constant i'm sorry i said the wrong thing the acceleration zero the acceleration is also constant but more importantly it's zero and those things get mixed up and so i'm glad that i made that mistake there so i can point it out saying that the acceleration is zero is not the same as saying the acceleration is constant if you think about there's lots of things where we could have constant acceleration but the acceleration is not zero so we could have something speeding up with a constant acceleration or we could have something like this where it has a constant acceleration of zero and it's not speeding up at all remember this is a distance versus time graph and so this thing is getting further and further away but at a constant rate and so the acceleration is zero so they're all going to have an acceleration of zero and so a b c d so let's see if we could explain that get some words to go with that say since slope is constant on each x versus t graph velocity is constant for each one and that means acceleration is equal to zero for all of them so that's why it's a tie
