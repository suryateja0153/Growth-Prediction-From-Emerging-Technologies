 if you look closely and maybe if you've been doing a lot of graphing lately you'll start seeing the same symmetrical u-shaped curve all around you stop for a sip at one of those old-fashioned metal water fountains and you'll likely be drinking the peak of what looks like a tiny parabola a shape first studied in ancient greek geometry and made by slicing a cone in a particular way or take a gander the path of a jumping fish grasshopper kangaroo or frog another problem and the main cables of suspension bridges are pulled into parabolas by the forces of gravity and compression it's the same pattern sometimes bigger or smaller or narrower or fatter but not all of them are true parabolas but an impressive number of the phenomena you notice will be parabolas at least in ideal circumstances with so many different manifestations of parabolas out there it seems like each one could have a vastly different equation but no while there's plenty of unique and complex math underlying the hydraulics of a drinking fountain or the leaf of a kangaroo the basic parabolas are all versions of the same thing and the same is true for the parabolas you'll find in college algebra they all may look a little different but each one can be graphed as a variation on a single quadratic theme g'day i'm james tanton and this is study hall algebra presented by arizona state university and crash course parabolas were first described by ancient greek scholars with words and geometry it would take over a thousand more years before algebra was invented and we could describe them with equations all of which are variations of the simple y equals x squared now no matter what we're graphing a surefire way to get start is to plug in some numbers into the equation as x values and see what matching y values make the equation true 0 squared is 0. so x equals 0 and y equals 0 make our equation a true sentence then 1 squared is 1 and negative 1 squared is also 1. 2 and negative 2 squared are 4 3 and negative 3 squared and 9. and we can keep going until we're sure of the general shape here we're pretty sure that if we plug in bigger positive or negative x values we will always get bigger y values here we're working from an equation so drawing a line connecting the dots is really just imagining we've plugged in all the numbers and plotted all the data in this graph the vertex or the point where the curve changes direction is at zero it's the low point of the graph or the minimum and that's it that's the graph of the only parabola we'll ever need well look we've made good time wow garlic cheese beautiful outside look at that okay that might be a little hasty but jokes aside the graph of any other quadratic equation is just this plot transformed the basic symmetry always stays the same which is kind of magical almost like y equals x squared is a chameleon or maybe there's a secret mathematical chameleon helping us with all the possible transformations well we can dream before we get started let's see what we're working with remember a standard quadratic equation looks something like y equals ax squared plus bx plus c where x is our variable and a b and c are constants so with a equal to 1 and b and c equal to 0 y equals x squared is the simplest quadratic relationship out there but what happens to the graph if we have an a that's different from one well if our graphing chameleon makes a equal to one half the y values will only be half of what they were before and snap the parabola is shallower and wider and if she transforms a into two then the y values will be twice what they were before and the graph will look narrower and steeper you can think of messing with the a coefficient as adjusting the arms of the parabola smaller a values for the arms to lay flatter while larger a values bring the arms up closer together now all throughout these adjustments the vertex is still at zero and stays the lowest point now let's have a bring back our original y equals x squared graph what if the a term we're negative like y equals negative x squared we can probably figure it out before plotting it our y values are going to be the opposite of what they were before so the arms stretched down instead of up but if we flip our graph where do we put zero well negative zero squared is still zero so in this graph the vertex is still at zero but now it's the high point the maximum rather than the low point the minimum for quadratic equations the vertex anchors the rest of the curve and is often the most interesting part of the graph when the math is describing something in the real world it's important to know the minimums and maximums of graphs which are the lowest and highest points we've been talking about the maximum for example can tell us how high the rock launched from our backyard trebuchet will go now in all of these graphs so far the vertex has been stuck at the origin where x equals zero and y equals zero we've only worked with the a coefficient so far and that didn't shift the vertex from zero so we're going for a transformation where the vertex is somewhere else the b and c terms must handle the action here there's actually a way to rewrite quadratic equations to let us understand what the b and c terms do to our parabola by completing the square like we did when we first explore quadratic equations we can give y equals ax squared plus b x plus c a shiny new look called vertex form the point h comma k is actually the vertex and we can read it right off the equation if we just have an a value like in y equals x squared or y equals 2x squared or y equals negative x squared we can see that h is 0 and k is 0. our vertex for all these parabolas is at the origin just like we've seen so far in all our graphs could you come up with something a little more complicated oh that's good now let's try converting this tricky equation to vertex form by completing the square so x times x is x squared that's straightforward we need a negative two and a negative two to add up to negative four x and those multiply to four but our c term outside the parentheses is three so we'll need to subtract one and we have y equals x minus two all squared minus one so where is the vertex h is 2 because we have x minus h squared and subtraction there is built into the vertex formula it doesn't mean that whatever the number h is must be negative but because it's plus k in the vertex formula our k value is negative 1. we can think of it as plus negative one which is just negative one so we've got the same answer our vertex is still at the point two comma negative one in fact by completing the square we see that every quadratic equation really looks like y equals a x minus h or squared plus k in disguise they all have the same structure and so we've confirmed we always get the same symmetrical u-shaped parabola it just might have been transformed a bit in fact we can put symmetry to work and get a rough sketch of any quadratic equation without much work at all first let's take the same equation as we had before we can rewrite the equation by pulling out a common factor of x from the first two terms to get y equals x times x minus four plus three now we see that x equals zero makes y equals three and x equals four also makes y equals three because both 0 and 4 make the first part 0. that means there are two points for the same y value 0 comma 3 and 4 comma 3. and we already know the graph is symmetrical the line of symmetry must fall halfway between 0 and 4 namely at x equals two so the vertex is somewhere on that line of symmetry and two has to be its x value but where we'll plug in x equals two and we see that y equals four minus eight plus three equals negative one the vertex is at the point two comma negative one the same place we deduced it was before by converting the equation into vertex form now let's take a look at one of those classic applications of graphing quadratics projectile motion around the turn of the 17th century the astronomer and mathematician galileo did a lot of work on projectile motion introduced that all objects fall at the same rate of acceleration due to gravity or about negative 16 feet per second squared this led to discovery that heights of objects in motion follow this quadratic formula where v is how fast we throw the object up and d is how high we start above the ground now we're throwing something it's easy to see a parabola in the actual path of projectile like a ball flying back and forth in an arc but most of the time we throw objects at an angle so the velocity is a mix of vertical motion height changing over time and horizontal motion that spreads those changing heights over time and these two directions are a bit harder to model and need more variables so a quadratic equation won't be enough that's why in algebra class things are thrown straight up so we can represent them with quadratic equations the variable on the horizontal axis of the projectile is time and the variable on the vertical axis is height maybe you want to launch something up that won't come down at least not in the same form like a firework it's super important to calculate the maximum height of a firework because you don't want to go off too soon after it's launched and you especially don't want it to go off when it's falling back down so if you know the launch speed of your firework how do you know how long its time delay fuse should burn before it explodes so let's put on those safety goggles to have a closer look let's say you and your local fire department have been assigned to set off some of those celebratory fireworks from the bridge over a nearby lake to set your fuse properly you want to find how long it takes the fireworks to reach their maximum height and from galileo's work we know the height of a falling object is h equals negative 16 t squared plus v times t plus d you know the fireworks launch upward at 200 feet per second so their initial velocity v is 200 and the bridge is 75 feet above the water so the initial height d is 75 the variables might be different but this equation is recognizably a quadratic so we know its graph is going to be a parabola the a coefficient here is negative 16 which means our graph is going to be upside down and narrower than y equals x squared in fact the vertex will be the maximum since b and c are both non-zero that vertex will not be at the origin so to sketch a quick graph we can find two points for the same y value and if we write the equation like this we can notice that time t equals zero and t equals 12.5 the height of the firework above the water is 75 feet then since the graph is symmetric the fireworks reach their maximum height halfway between those two times at t equals 6.25 seconds plug that in and our fireworks will launch 700 feet into the air we can even learn a bit more from the graph to extend our sketch the parabola's arms will cross the horizontal axis when h equals zero or at the roots we discussed in episode nine the positive root is somewhere between t equals 12 and t equals 13. so the graph tells us that your fuse needs to be set so the fireworks go off up to 6.25 seconds when they're 700 feet up in the air and will be back on earth just before 13 seconds are up now look at all these quadratics we've graphed a phi works worth the accomplishment so when setting out on transformations of your own remember that all graphs of quadratic equations are essentially just graphs of y equals x squared just flattened or widened or shifted around and the vertex form of a quadratic equation lets you read off the vertex h comma k right away remember that h is being subtracted from x so if you're something like y equals x plus one squared plus three h must really be negative one but to easily graph a quadratic use the symmetry of the parabola we write it as y equals x times ax plus b plus c and find the two x values that give the same y value c halfway between those points is the line of symmetry and the vertex next time let's revisit linear equations and see how graphing can even help us solve simultaneous equations until then cheers thanks for watching study hall algebra which is produced by arizona state university and the crash course team at complexly if you like this video and want to keep learning
