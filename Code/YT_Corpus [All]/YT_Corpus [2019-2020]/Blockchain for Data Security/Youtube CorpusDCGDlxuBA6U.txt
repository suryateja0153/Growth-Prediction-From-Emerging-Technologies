 hey everyone welcome back to Tech Talk I'm Julia Beauchamp I'm here with Network world senior writer John Gold and we are going to be talking about IOT and blockchain - really buzzy words but do they really have any purpose together stick around alright John thank you so much for coming in thanks for having me back always appreciate it so you cover IOT pretty extensively and there's obviously tons of use cases for IOT for consumers and of course in the enterprise but something that is sort of new information to me is how blockchain and IOT can come together there's sort of these two buzzy words but do they really serve any purpose in conjunction I think they do um you know based on some of the reporting I've done lately I think part of the reason that people are here to talk about it is that as you mentioned these are a couple of buzzy words and people are eager to get them into the same sentence but there are definitely use cases out there particularly one source explained it to me really nicely as in cases where you know two parties don't quite trust each other but they would like to so you know largely anything sort of transactional or you know you know working on that kind of model I guess is uh where blockchain is pretty applicable yeah and so can you give me an example of what would be an example of sort of as transactional application of IOT yeah well um one example that was given to me was say you had like a system for you know tracking like really like fine foodstuffs like you know farm to fork basically tracking of like um you know I don't know I guess expensive you know well-bred meat or something you know so we you know broadly there'd be you know asset tracking at every level that of that process you know coming from you know you'd have the secure database thanks to you know blockchain technology where it you know says that you know this has been you know this product has been in this location for X number of days it's been refrigerated at Y temperature you know it you know this is their be sort of this immutable record you know the idea is throughout the process so you know just I guess cutting out the wholesalers middlemen along the way sure and using IOT sensors to it for example say you know this is the temperature that it was stored at right exactly that's really interesting it's something I mean you do hear really frequently at references to IOT and it's obviously huge I don't have to tell you this but it is really interesting to sort of see ways to unite these two technologies and it's not just and it's really not all talked just saying well you know what black chain would be a great solution for this yeah I mean it's you know it is a really interesting idea just again based on sort of you know adding this layer sort of trust and validation over you know any kind of transactional system you know just it it adds that kind of security without the need for you know other kinds of you know expensive specialized systems so and you make a really good point we're gonna link John's article in the description so you can read more about this but you make a really good point in your article that if because block you know sort of this immutable record if there's any sort of break or pause that could sort of raise concern to anyone yeah I mean that was sort of revealed to me in the context of you know I learned about this basically just you know in the context of these examples that was provided because it's sort of a hard technology to grasp on an intuitive level sometimes um but yeah that was in the context of there's one company I spoke to that's making sort of a product that's you know MIT Ferb it's been sort of for the used car market so what it would do is would plug into like a diagnostic port on your car and you know just kind of keep you know maintenance record you know it would be able to tell you whether you know like the airbags have been deployed whether the cars ever been flooded and yeah and if it was removed there would be you know this big blank space and the data where you know it's as well hang on this wasn't being monitored what's going on there ray can any can raise concern or at least prompt someone to ask more questions exactly and it because and you know because you know ideally it's in this blockchain system it's not you can't tamper with it so it's not like you know the bad old days of used cars where somebody could just like roll back the odometer with the grill right and it's because that also adds that extra layer of security first of all just because it's in the blockchain there's an extra layer of security but also as a potential buyer whether I'm buying for if whether I'm a used-car seller or just an actual buyer it's that extra sense of just personal security knowing that this has not been tampered with the same goes for your your farm to sort of table an example which is really great but I think it's also important while we're going on and on about how there's a potential use cases for IOT and blockchain it's also important to say you know you don't need to be going applying blockchain to every single IOT device yeah there are definitely you know exception there are all these there are cool use cases out there and you know they're not a hundred percent you know this sort of transactional model where it's you know about some kind of you know exchange of products or services but you know it is largely that's that's where it works best definitely and you know I people might get you know because as we've talked about these are you know very exciting sort of techie terms and everyone likes to use these days um but yeah it's definitely not the right you know technology for every use case you know it's you know it's a database it doesn't you know it's just not applicable to everything you're using the i/o the IOT for absolutely there's no need to go out and employ blockchain and IOT combinations and you're under don't you don't need to rush into it no definitely not and because this is sort of it seems to meet please correct me if I'm wrong that it's these are sort of newer use cases that this is really coming into its own now yeah absolutely it's I mean you know blockchain itself isn't you know brand new but the idea you know mixing it into you know some sort of IOT deployment is definitely pretty new and you know not you know my impression at any rate is that it's not super well and stood yet you know the way the two technologies sort of interact and you know based on how you know nebulous and widespread IOT is you know it's that's not really a surprise I guess and how because it's new how would you recommend enterprises employing it where there is sort of this transactional application yeah it would definitely be focused on that kind of use case you know that's at this point you know unless you're a really really big company who can you know afford to hire blockchain programmers and I'm told that they're they you know they cost a lot of money but it's definitely something that you know mostly you're gonna want to work with a vendor on you know you're gonna need you know sort of like a like you know most of the companies that are offering this sort of thing you know some of them are like ASAP you know they're gonna have a lot of in-house expertise then that you'll probably need to get that kind of thing up and running sure and it's you know relying on a vendor for this sort of thing is yeah it makes sense great well thank you so much for coming in John it's really interesting to see how I ot and blockchain can be applied in the enterprise I think it's I mean it's exciting do you think we'll hear more soon oh I don't feel here a lot you know more you know brand new information soon but yeah definitely down the line there will be more use cases more applications coming out of the woodwork and in any case we'll be sure to keep everyone in the loop if there are more use cases will bring John back on yeah thank you so much John and thank you so much for watching this episode of tech talk if you liked this video be sure to like it and subscribe to our Channel
