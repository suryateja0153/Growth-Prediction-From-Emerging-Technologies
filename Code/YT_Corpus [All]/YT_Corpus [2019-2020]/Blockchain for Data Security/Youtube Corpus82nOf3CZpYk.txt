 friends and colleagues welcome this rainy morning at Oxford it's really fantastic to see you all here today want to guarantee an amazing time we promise not to disappoint you will not need 1/4 cup of coffee nor will you need the toothpicks to prop your eyes open but if you pub crawled last night we can't guarantee anything so that was your choice so here we are the power of proximity look around this room we have powerful impact investors and foundations we have scrappy social entrepreneurs we have global influencers an array of amazing human beings from around the globe you have come here together we have convened this event in order for you to be able to be more proximate to one another the power of proximity recently I was working on a university campus and I met a Somali Bantu student who wants to become a technologist her name is Jasmina and she's a fantastic energetic young girl I said yes me know what is your backstory and what drives you to get out of bed in the morning she said as a child I was in war-torn Mogadishu I was then displaced and spent most of my childhood in a refugee camp on the border of Kenya to be resettled in the US of A my father was killed in the war and my mother preliterate herself brought seven children to the US she's now working three jobs she doesn't have time for education or technology but what she does say to us is that she wants us to become educated so that we can give back to our own people in in East Africa her mother wants her to be proximate I think each of us brings with us a very visceral identification with the people who we work with the most disenfranchised around the world and many of us have had that inflection point that opportunity to sort of reevaluate our priorities and focus on the things that matter most and we're all in this room because we see exponential technologies as a way to accelerate what we're already doing to really move the needle for these people today is gonna be really incredible we have Peter Tufano the Dean of a site Business School he will be followed by ani patent power my amazing colleague I've told my girls forget becoming Wonder Woman as a superhero if you want to be anyone just be Ani patent power and then ani will provide some definitions and she'll set the stage for our incredible speakers today really powerful jaw-dropping presentations in a TED style format that you'll have the opportunity to hear now Peter Tufano is an incredible individual on a personal level I had the opportunity to study under him in the MBA program and he brought his powerful leadership he has his bachelor's degree his MBA and his PhD in business economics from Harvard University he taught there for 22 years until he took this place at the site Business School but as students in the context of all the madness that's going on around the world he through his leadership showed us the power of proximity and what that means for us to be in the business world and to be proximate to the most disenfranchised so without further ado Peter what a welcome Oxford I know you've been here for a few days but I haven't had an opportunity to welcome you you may wonder what happens in this place and the other 51 weeks the year when the orange signs come down are we just a venue for a penance the answer is absolutely not from the topics that you're dealing with over this week Parshin trans social progress mark year-long part of that isn't that festiveness full center for social enterprise and I hope that among the other shoulder events events you come to the most Oxford of events on Thursday the Oxford Union debate on universities and social impacts so please join us for that press here what we do for example is we were to come here you can find next week of course on social investing and social finance and then computers over here from our school is leading out of those courses or you might go online and you find some courses that we're doing on clean tech or distribute ledger technology blockchain how do the training let's put these two ideas together on the one hand we care deeply about social progress and that may come through social enterprises for the big school our firms or it may come to negative projects all of which we studied on the other hand we're looking at technologies how the technologies change society for good so put those two together and how is it that we can actually harness some of these technologies in order to achieve and you may hear more about these kind of applications but trackless make sure that diamonds are tracking the provenance of products distributed layers ledger technology and AI have lots and lots of promise lots of potential so exploring those ideas over the course of the years what we do so this morning enjoy a remarkable morning and I'm proud to say that our two cleaners here so no expectations so we're really gonna have a few people trickling in as you probably know by now my name is Oney Patton power and I in an entrepreneur in residence at the school Center for social entrepreneurship and an associate fellow here at Oxford I've also founded my own advisory firm that seeks to help founders and funders use exponential technology to allocate capital for impact and in my spare time I'm also an advisor to the Bertha Center for social innovation in Cape Town where I live so I have the world's longest cute up here to Cape Town so do the rest of my job so I'm really excited to convene this event and we have a whole set of speakers that have different ideas around exponential technology I wanted to start with a couple of definitions I don't know how comfortable everyone is with some of the language we're going to be using I've asked our presenters to you know be as as introductory as possible but also still getting to the meat what they do so I'm going to attempt to define some relatively complex terms come on so exponential technologies our technologies and that have an exponential growth curve and it's generally we used the term to describe things like artificial intelligence and blockchain it means that they're eminently scalable with an exponential growth curve and this is one of the reasons that they are very interesting so artificial intelligence is essentially the creation of computer systems that are able to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence and artificial intelligence with the capability of the processing means that we are able to with these systems calculates and compound millions and millions of data points simultaneously which gives us potential processing capability beyond what our human brains have the blockchain or distributed ledger technology is essentially a decentralization of transactions of any nature and it's it's a good way to think about it is actually an economic layer to the Internet so what it does is it it provides us a protocol which is a system of rules so you might hear that word protocol said today for tokens or entities of value to be transferred on a p2p basis on a peer-to-peer basis and the interesting thing about it is that you don't need a central actor to be able to or that is required to facilitate this transaction now the transaction doesn't have to be monetary we're probably most of us more familiar with cryptocurrencies that do use distributed ledger technology to do monetary transactions so crypto currencies like Bitcoin ether and ripple I think there's a couple people from our boys are built on blockchain and one of the advantages of the distributed ledger is that there is no centralized clearinghouse for these transactions and the transactions are completely transparent to the entire community so this transparency and the irrefutable 'ti of the transactions make it really interesting for some of the applications we're going to talk about today including land tenure and supply chains which Peter mentioned financial inclusion is another one so in addition to the cryptocurrencies the transactions another element you're going to hear talked about today are smart contracts smart contracts essentially allow you to execute a contract without the sign off of a single centralized unit instead you can have often multiple third party verifications that trigger the at the utilization of the contracts are the execution of the contract a lot of turns outside be very concise there's like whole papers that are written on that so hopefully that makes a little bit of sense okay so so how why is this interesting to how we structure impact funding so I think as Peter said there are huge pitfalls that the opportunities are also really interesting so I've spent the past eight years of my career building innovative financial instruments that have social and environmental impact embedded into those instruments and teaching others how to do that and it's it's not been clear sailing let me tell you and a lot of the issues that we've come across in the work and I think can be partially addressed by some of this events technology so in over the past eight years I have experienced huge issues building things like impact bonds Green outcomes funds algorithmic social lending platforms a milestone and social milestone based contracts and the more and more that I learned from the people in the room and many of those that aren't in the room the more I see the possibility to build a layer of impact measurement and potentially smart contracts that help to overcome some of these relatively insurmountable issues so I'm going to be done speaking now and turn it over to our amazing speakers so we've got Scott and Tom up first they're going to talk about the future of impact intelligence-gathering impact intelligence in urban communities julie is then going to talk about making property rights and claims of individuals publicly recorded and globally verified raff is going to then talk about bringing transparency to social funding through blockchain she is going to tell us about leveraging biotechnology the blockchain and virtual reality to clean the Niger Delta sean is then going to tell us how he is building this decentralized impact validated marketplace Ben is going to give us the future of aid finance and Todd is going to wrap it all up with closing reflections on a decentralized impact finance revolution so we have a very long list of speakers and you can't see it guys but over there I have one of those long hooks I need to pull you off so I have told you all in those that you know me know I will so you have eight minutes each and we're going to start thank you good morning morning everyone that's great next we need a clicker we need to click on e thank you so much great hi everyone this is Scott he is the CEO of scout impact this is Tom he is the chief impact officer for a Cuban great that's got we're actually going to talk about future of impact measurement more generally so not the cities so you'll see us skip over a slide in a second which had 22 cities but eight miss who came really really fast so last year Scott came to talk to me about blockchain and impact measurement some of the strengths that might be applied on some of the challenges this was this was really exciting to me we've thought at lean data a little bit more about that our approach to impact measurement acumen the blockchain could be part of our future but we didn't really know how I was a complete newbie to this area and asked Scott a whole lot of really really stupid questions but one of the exciting things that we've been trying to do is take him back measurement make it faster more effective and critically cheaper and so could blockchain be part of the solution to doing that no let me try and explain on the surface perhaps not but it gets better blockchain gives you a really neat claim and verify model before I go any further let me talk about the very small section of blockchain that we're actually talking about we're not talking about cryptocurrencies we're not going to talk about Bitcoin or anything like that we're not talking about crypto economics some of the guys on the panel may well do we're talking about using blockchain basically as a glorified database it's something that you can write data to and once you've written data to that database you can be sure that it won't be tampered with it can't be retracted and it can't be lost down the so for when it's audit time that's what blockchain gives you and that's really how we're using it in this context so claim and verify this is a really neat model and it kind of underpins everything that everybody's doing on blockchain with impact measurement claim means you gather some evidence from the real world that something actually happened and you put that on blockchain or somebody makes an assertion that something happened in the real world and that gets recorded on blockchain then the verify part a third party comes along an independent third party and confirms that that thing in the real world actually did happen and their verification goes on blockchain as well claim and verify that's that's the basic principle behind everything the problem is gathering all of that data and cleaning that data can be expensive paying somebody to show up and verify that data can also be very costly so blockchain by itself maybe doesn't solve the whole problem doesn't make things that much cheaper but there is hope we see three different kinds of data converging I'm going to talk very quickly about transactional data this is literally payments and watching payments as they hop from from organization to organization they get tokenized and you can see that happen in real time this is exactly what Ben from dispersed is going to talk about that's that's their technology you'll hear more about in a second there's going to be lots more of that in the future to track that's data we can use also in this category supply chains have been mentioned quite a lot we would put handshakes in supply chains in this same transactional category it's where one supplier may be a Gina says here's 20 bales of BCI cotton and another supplier may be a mill says thank you very much I confirm I'm receiving 20 barrels at BC icon that's a handshake that's transactional data there's going to be a lot more of that and we can use that to explain how in just a second engagement this is basically where acumen eats this is what Tom does yeah and unfortunately I'm the person does the least sexy thing in this room which is surveys a big part of impact measurement in the future is we're not going to get away from surveys it's the thing that frustrates me more than anything in this space is that everyone talks about impact measurement and it's all big numbers and we forget to actually listen to people's lived experience so surveys ones that are cheap to deploy benchmark herbal standardized and digital are going to be a really really big part of the three of these data points we have also been trying to do some work with ambient data mainly sensors trying to build some trying to use some we've had some success and plenty of failures but we know we need to treat continue to try harder and it's gonna be a big part of our future thank you to what we both agree on is that ambien is the real growth area here let me sort of elaborate on what that might mean hedge funds have been using satellite imagery for years that is finally affordable to the masses also off-the-shelf algorithms that can look at that satellite imagery for you and tell you what's in it and now available off-the-shelf or check out things like planet labs and what Lucas Chopra is doing with geo AI at Microsoft IOT brings us a whole array of very very cheap sensors and beacons things that you can embed in the environment in buildings in equipment that can give you a constant data feed this is this is new ambient intelligence that we can gather this becomes interesting when these three things start to converge which is why we've done it as this this Venn diagram because the more independent data points that you can get to corroborate the same event the more sure you are that it happened and the less need there is to send a human verifier to that location let me give you a quick example you're fitting a solar array for a micro grid on the rooftop of a community building in an urban slum say thank you we get a whole bunch of data from the event so the engineer that's finished the installation takes out his smartphone IDs himself with a fingerprint take several photographs of the successful installation they get time-stamped they get GPS stamped those photographs get uploaded in hash to a blockchain straightaway the customer that's there does exactly the same thing but they also add a five-star rating to that to that engineer for the work that they've done other things that happen as well immediately that solar panel starts sending data about its performance back to the cloud as well so we can see what what is it's producing at what time of day other things that start to happen we see some payments flying around with tokenized tracking via blockchain so we might see a micro lender pay the solar provider we might see some local household start to make first three payments to that micro lender all of those transactions would be visible and finally if you really really want to be sure that that soda panel has been fitted within a couple of days an algorithm can confirm from the satellite imagery that those things reflecting in the Sun from space are actually solar panels that's complete overkill you don't need all six of those data points to verify that that thing happened but that's that's the picture normally two or three are quite enough so this is the trick you can verify things without sending a person there if enough of the data points corroborate the same thing essentially good clean action or data verifies itself here's where we see it going great so a few last thoughts on some big parts of the equation that we need to fill in and it's irelia it's an exciting time I think for impact measurement and the future is not going to be good news is the future is not going to be R C T by RC T by RC T it's going to be we think these sorts of data all coming together and one part of it will be platforms where you can find digital surveys that you can deploy really really easily cost-effectively and we're acumen are just building our first SAS platform for this think of it kind of as the iTunes for social surveys or the Etsy for social surveys and a tools to help with this triangulation idea fit into that same category um what's really interesting here is validation 2.0 which is just a made-up term for how the validation market is being disrupted and with what we're doing with triangulation with what platforms like EXO and Alice are doing you'll hear about those in a second opening up a marketplace for third-party verification the way validation is procured is provided and is paid for will be completely disrupted over the coming years that's the space to watch out for great so putting my impact investor back on acumen there is this really all these really exciting things coming down down the pike and I think for the first time over the next few years you're going to see property impact measurement being a really serious differentiator of impact funds and social enterprises taking this seriously thank you very much [Applause] hi my name is Julie Smith I'm the CEO of de Soto Inc I was told to give you my contact information my email is Jay Smith at De Soto comm if you'd like to get in touch DeSoto is a company that is using blockchain and other technologies to bolster property rights in the developing world and as the title of the presentation suggests we think this is a big component to poverty alleviation worldwide I want to take a minute to explain why applying blockchain to real estate makes sense specifically the first reason is representation so Bitcoin solved what was called in computer science the double spend problem one of the beautiful things about digital technology is that you can copy and transmit information very easily and that's great when what you're the asset you're representing is a photograph that you want to send out to a hundred of your friends but it's not good when what you're trying to represent is a unit of money a dollar you you want it to be very hard to counterfeit that dollar and that's why it's been so hard over the years for digital cash to really take off bitcoins blockchain solved this problem it allows for a unique digital representation of a dollar or of unit of money and what works for money also works for other kinds of assets so anything that needs to be uniquely digitally represented like a parcel of land or a house or even a person blockchain can help the second is coordination so as Ani sort of gave us an intro to this I won't dive too deep but blockchain provides a single shared ledger that every entity in the real estate value chain can see made it has a it contains the state of that asset of that real estate asset and all of the the participants and the real estate value chain don't necessarily have to trust one another that that's true they trust the system they have this single shared view so banks and mortgage companies escrow companies title insurers registries all of these entities can have a single shared view of the state of an asset and that greatly reduces coordination costs between all those entities in a real estate transaction and then finally the transactions themselves so because of these first two properties real estate transactions can be much more completed much more efficiently the time for transactions to complete can be reduced from months or weeks down to days or even minutes and this is particularly relevant in the developing world where where registries are not really built with transactions in minds often so it can take a very long time for transactions to occur as we'll see we recently partnered with Hernando DeSoto he has an institute in Lima Peru called the Institute for liberty and democracy and he and his team have been researchers of the informal economy for several decades and one of his key observations is that 2.5 billion people in the world live in it as you and I and many in this room probably know it we live in the within the formal legal systems of our countries and therefore we're connected to the global economy five billion people in the world live to varying degrees extra legally they don't have formal identities they don't have formal title to their property and therefore they can't participate in the global economy and a big reason for this is that we have little structured knowledge of the ledgers that list and govern the property rights of these five billion people so here are a few examples of some of these informal disconnected Ledger's sorry there yeah so here you see titles branded on cows in Tanzania Egypt Peru Syria so these people do own things and they do record them but they're doing it in formal and not only that they have the right to own and practically every place in the planet if it's through four treaties constitutions laws the people have the formal right to own property the Universal Declaration of Human Rights specifically calls this out so why then if they have property and they have the legal right to own are they not becoming titled it's because in most of these places turning rights into title is extremely costly and here's an example from Tanzania to register a piece of land takes 19 steps three hundred and eighty days and about fifteen hundred dollars in costs in a country you know it's a small fortune in a country where a per capita GDP is less than nine hundred dollars so obviously you know who would go through this process what is life without formal ownership like if you're this gentleman you have a small business you're an entrepreneur you want to buy a truck so that you can scale this fruit business well you can't register that business formally and connect to the legal system you can't pledge your holdings against investment and credit you can't divide or combine holdings to create surplus value you can't acquire their companies you cannot use those assets as credentials for access to public service you can't rely on law enforcement for protect your property rights and you're confined to your hyper local economy to your local market you can't engage in any kind of large-scale entrepreneurship there are a few other deadly global problems that result terrorism it turns out has a business model often they'll go into an area and say we are armed will protect your property rights in exchange for your support and here are a few examples of that environmental damage often the result of a lack of accountability due to poor property records unruly migration if you lose your property rights in your home country often you spill over into your neighboring countries to refugee camps or over into the West if instead we surface the informal Ledger's terrorists power wanes capital can be unleashed and entrepreneurs can go to work Hernando did this Peru he defeated his policies that feeted a terrorist organization called The Shining Path I mean he did this by providing an accelerated path of formalization for farmers in Peru and finally here at De Soto we think that there is a convergence of technologies not just blockchain but social media mobile applications a machine learning an AI that can help surface this information helped us reach millions of more people at a time than we used to be able to reach so thank you hi I'm Rafael I'm the CEO and one of the cofounders of Alice and we're a transparent social impact network that's built on the ethereum blockchain and the gold that network is to help identify and then scale truly effective social and environmental projects and the way that we do that is through token economics which is just a fancy way of saying that we create incentives for charities to be transparent about their impact to make sure that that impact data is reliable and then we create incentives for users of the network to systematically crunch all of that impact data and surface the very best projects on their on the network the Alice's a network that brings together like quite a few actors so you have donors you have impact investors you have validators and evaluators that all interact it's a decentralized network which means that it's managed by the participants so there are some fairly sophisticated governance protocols that that come into play and integrated into the network there are also some data management processes and I'm going to unpack some of those now if you know about Alice already and you might it's because last year we rolled out the first bit of the protocol which is which is a conditional donation platform so that was a run the first pilot was run by st. Mungo's a homelessness charity that helped rough sleepers in London do things like find accommodation deal with mental and physical health issues with substance abuse issues and the reason we decided to start with donations is because we wanted to tackle one big problem first which is that there's been a decline in public trust in the charity sector and we wanted to help reverse that and the way that it works is essentially just a payment for success model so when you make a donation to a project on Alice your money doesn't go straight to the charity it gets held in escrow so it gets frozen in one of our smart contracts and it only gets paid out when the charity's deliver on the goals that are set at the beginning of the project so in st. Mungo's case it was helping people find a home for example but crucially the money only gets paid out to the charity from the escrow donations when they're validated by an independent validator which is in in this case was the Greater London Authority so the local government of London the housing team verified all the proof like rental agreements and that validation triggered payments - from the escrow donations to the charity and the really cool thing is that when you give on Alice and your money as a donor is used to pay for an outcome you get a little notification that tells you exactly what impact your money is made we built it in a way that was super user friendly so we don't use cryptocurrencies you don't donate them Bitcoin or ether or whatever you donate them what we call Fiat so pound sterling and you just plug in your credit card details as a donor put that in the reason we did that is we wanted to reach a mainstream audience we have a fairly sophisticated back-end that allows us to do that and it allows anybody including our CTO s mum that you can see here to make a donation using the blockchain which is pretty great but as I said Alice is way more than donations actually donations are just the incentive layer to make sure that charities are transparent about their impact we're now working on the next set of building blocks of the net no pun intended and the first one of those is an impact investment module that plugs into the donations so as I said before when you make a donation on that list it gets held in escrow the charity has set its goals but the big problem with a standalone payment for success model is that obviously the charity doesn't have the money upfront to start running a project before it gets paid when it when it achieves its goals so that's where the impact investors come in they provide the seed capital that allows the charity to start a project they also underwrite the risk of a project failing so if no goals are achieved they lose their money but if goals are achieved well then part of that goes to pay for the for the charity and part of it also then goes to pay back the impact investors with interest pausing for a second if that sounds like a social impact bond is pretty much because it is in a way we haven't reinvented the wheel social impact bonds are a big inspiration to the Alice platform but the way that it's implemented actually gives participants some really great advantages over the way that they're structured right now so the first one is really obvious it means that charities aren't reliant on a single outcome payer they can literally just self commission their project and go out to the crowd for the outcome payments but there are some really key advantages for impact investors as well one of those is real-time data management it means that as an impact investor you can see when outcomes were validated which outcomes were validated all of that in real time as the validations occur another big advantage is that there's a the legal costs are streamlined because everything's encoded in smart contracts and automated it means that that can be ported from project to project which makes it a lot cheaper it also means that any number of impact investors can come into a project during its life cycle without having to go through the complex renegotiations of contracts it also means that the payments are automated and actually there's a built-in liquidity to the investment because everything is tokenized it means that investors who there early can then sell on their tokens to a secondary investor who has perfect visibility over how the project is performed to date and the payments are automatically re-routed to that secondary investor and then the final one is that what we're trying to achieve is a reduction of transaction costs because they're shared across participants in the network the way that we achieve that is through another set of crypto economics another set of incentives so charities are rewarded for providing more granular data around their projects like internal kpi's churn rates etc there's an integrated knowledge sharing market in the network which means that if you do due diligence on a project then you can post that on the network and others can access it for a fee which reduces the due diligence cost for for everybody there are incentives for participants to systematically take all of that impact data crunch it and compare and benchmark projects and then there is a mechanism whereby fees that are paid on the platform go into a grant making fund so it's a decentralized fund that's managed by the users of the network and its goal is to allocate grants to smaller charities in particular so that they can design and implement really great projects really high quality projects and so you can think of it as kind of like a decentralized fun to make grants for feasibility studies things like that the holy grail is the way what we're trying to achieve is to try to break out of the status quo which is that we're stuck in prehistoric times when it comes to impact data and people keep reinventing the wheel if you see what we've done there and the the data is really difficult to access it's siloed in everybody's databases everybody's measuring with different frameworks so we want to end that and come to a situation where you have high quality comparable data that's publicly accessible that's reliable with automated reporting and payments so that it makes it really easy to identify and then scale effective projects while lowering transaction costs we're not building this alone we have some Partners like Imperial College London scripted currency research lab like the impact management project Charities Aid Foundation really open to collaboration so if you're interested please come and grab me later thank you very much hello everybody good morning I hope everybody is sober and feeling good it's been a it's good to be back in business school it's been five years since I've been in business school and actually sat in the SEC not at this school actually in school in Philadelphia i sat in the second row I remember in business school and I remember I was not paying attention I was on my phone and I was the wallet there was a news flash from the World Bank showing the population estimates for 2050 and I looked at Nigeria Nigeria had 180 million and then was projected to hit 460 million by 2050 and then 760 million plus by 2100 and that's when I realized talking about a proximity that I had to change where I'm where I was so as an introduction my name is Chi naughty or Cheney a day but you can all call me chicas cheese a lot easier and I'm originally from the Niger Delta in Nigeria when I say originally I mean going back over 250 years it's been documented by one of my uncles and yeah it's a long time and from the same village as well and I don't know if you guys know about the B Afrin war does anybody know about the Biafra war yeah my so that was my tribe trying to leave Nigeria right after Nigeria was formed because all the oil was on our land and my grandfather was mayor for TAC courts which is the capital the oil capital of Nigeria and the war actually ended in my village when he sent his 31 kids out into the forest my mother was one of them and went out and met with the soldiers because they had chased him chased our family to inquire a my village and so that after that she'll came in in oil and gas and we all have power in the modern world and it's wonderful but what ended up happening in our neighborhood was over 10,000 oil spills the equivalents of an Exxon Valdez spill every single year and my parents grew up in that in fact my father from that war so my parents grew up in that and they actually became environmental engineers because of it and I grew up around a lot of very smart engineers always looking to invent and and and try to solve things and come up with new solutions and when the BPOs will happen in America I remember sitting at a kitchen table my mother and she was a professor at the University of Central Florida and environmental engineering and she told me about how she found this biotechnology that was organic liquid and could be used by any local person because it's just liquid in a hose and it would find oil encapsulate it destroy it and then excrete oxygen and in 30 days an area that's been dead for decades starts growing green shoots and I was young then I was a 28 and uh on the realizing that this was probably my last chance to go after something crazy and I decided I was gonna take that solution back home and clean up massive oil spills in our area and get agriculture starting and this was 2010 and I went back to Nigeria and I with local people I met with politicians and everybody laughed at me everybody laughed me out of Nigeria that called me a conservationist and I should go back to LA California which is where I was living at that time so I ended up going to business school because I wanted to think about a different way and how to solve this problem and then I had that moment when I looked at the world back statistic and realized I was in the wrong place so I went back home to the Niger Delta and in those years in the village working in the villages in the Niger Delta I began to realize that there was a suite of technologies that was impacting our lives there's only one village in the Niger Delta that has won a case against cell shell there 184 million dollars from shell because of mobile technology and then I also started to realize that if there was a way to connect the local villager on his phone to the executive at Shell we could actually solve this problem now there you know there's a there was you want about the Niger Delta the first time a study was ever had ever been done about our oil pollution and there was all these milestones that were set all these standards and I looked at that and said this is impossible this is an area where no one trusts each other all the different stakeholders do not interact with each other and luckily in that time and working in the Delta and seeking out a way to solve this problem by building a platform I ended up meeting Joe Lubin a couple years ago and started thinking about smart contracts so we're actually very lucky this smart contracts were invented and now today actually next week we're going to do a cleanup of three oil polluted lakes or the fish ponds actually fish ponds we're gonna hire X militants and they're going to clean the these ponds with the bio technology then they're actually going to be connected to our CEO who's actually going to be in Singapore who is gonna have a smart contract with them real time monitoring to make sure they're actually doing the job and once they've submitted in data they then will receive stellar I don't know if you guys know stellar which is a a crypto currency and stellar only because it's the fastest way of doing it as opposed to aetherium and then right then they're they're gonna go and be able to trade in that stellar p2p for naira with a local woman in their village and all of this is a journey of thinking how can we bring transparency to a place where there's absolutely no trust and one of the things that I feel like I have to let you guys in on a secret is that there are tens hundreds of millions of people in Africa that are reputable hard-working and they just want to be part of the economic system yes there are bad actors corruption in such-and-such but we are at an inflection point where that can change our next project is to work with the Nitra Delta Development Commission which is a classically corrupt government organization but we're doing an audit of 4,700 public works projects that they have it's being funded by the World Bank and it's the first time the there it has been a full audit of their entire public support portfolio and what that will allow us to do is identify who are the contractors who have actually completed the 8% of the projects that have actually been completed investors will be able to know the reputable contractors that they can transact with and I know we talk a lot about the blockchain but we just have to remember that it's just a tool that's it and it's a tool for a place where there's no trust and I don't know if and if you guys ever this in Nigeria that's a place where you can't find anybody that you can trust trust me and so I believe the blockchain is a transactional layer that will be a leapfrog tool for Africa and it's actually more usually technology is for the richest and most privileged and that's what's exciting about the blockchain is here we have a new technology that's actually for the least privileged and I just want to encourage you all to check out our website follow us on this journey over these next few months as we try to bring transparency and change the way people transact and bring capital to Nigeria thank you [Applause] good morning I'm Sean Conway and I'm going to speak about it so the blockchain for impact so we're actually building some of the core infrastructure for the things that you've heard about today and I'm gonna make some claims today that I hope that you will verify them maybe in the future but we're here because we're excited about the potential that these converging information technologies have to give us super superhuman powers to have much greater impact and I'm particularly excited about the technologies that enable us to form and allocate capital in new ways now you possibly all have heard of the ability that you now have to create your own digital currency it's called cryptocurrency and how many of you actually have cryptocurrency a few of you I claim that these cryptocurrencies are going to become extremely valuable or or not there might be completely worse than together so so it depends on how they distribute it and we have new market distribution innovations that are quite amazing that are going to create new purpose networks and and and new marketplaces and this is really what's going to make a difference and so with it so we have been working over the past four years to create mechanisms a protocol for taking impact data and turning it into tokenized value and I'm going to talk about that oops the wrong direction and so this isn't a new idea so around ten years ago almost to the day I gave a conference presentation it was at a conference where we were looking at the next Web was 2.0 then and it was was about this new phenomenon of social networks and and social media and so I thought this would be a really disruptive idea what we could do is use these collaboration tools to enable all of us to become share stakeholders in in being able to deliver and better on project until end and should ensure that capital gets delivered more effectively well I was quite naive okay the technology really wasn't able to do this ten years ago and really what the past ten years have been about so I thought little albey impacts impactful and have these technologies available what we've ended up with is the hashtag so this has become really symbolic of the past decade and we see now how the hashtag as a as a technological device has been effective at creating cultural and political revolutions but at the same time it's also a sign of the dependencies that we've come come to have on the social media platforms hashtag speaking at school and and more recently we've seen how these selfish genes have become vectors of memes of mistrust and bad information and so I think that what we need now is and what is happening is a an evolution of these memes into something which I'll call today a hash claim now a hash claim is what we heard about earlier claims that are cryptographically hashed and why these are so important is because you can take these hash claims and tokenize them and I'm going to talk a bit more about tokenization so I truly believe that right now we're on the threshold between web 2.0 and web 3.0 now this is not just about technology this is about a whole economic shift it's about a whole change in the ways in which society works so what does this mean for impact investing and and how we achieve impacts well we all want to believe that impact data is what we use to drive the allocation of capital into into results and we all know that good information helps us to achieve better impacts but the reality is and I think we all kind of know this is that we're actually really bad at counting what matters and we're not very good at valuing what counts and so that's why when the SDGs were launched back in 2015 the sacred general's office made the statement that we need a data revolution for sustainable develop so what's wrong with the way that we currently collect data well I'm not going to go into the technical aspects of this but just look to the person next to you and ask yourself would I accept their data from from whichever databases they have and just trust that data and and even if I would would I be able to use it there's a whole lot of governance issues around this is a whole lot of compatibility issues and so on and so this idea of there we go so this so this idea of of having a data Commons for development you know it's been a great idea but it's just really not been possible so with blockchain databases we have an entirely new paradigm and this is about having high definition data so high definition because the data resolves to unique identifiers that sit on a blockchain and and it's high fidelity because of the hashing and and they're digital signing processes and so by bringing these together and creating this new claim format we have something which is called a verifiable claim now just in the low definition version if you have an immunization delivered to a young woman at a time and a place by a health care provider who records this and signs it on a card and immunization card that is provided by a project that then makes this tweet and says hey we just reached a thousand immunizations hashtag stop Hep B so that's the current way that we do it really this is what a hash claim looks like it's not the user interface and it's not the real code but basically we can encode this into a digital format which scales either add an event or a project consisting of many events so we can make claims about anything and because this is in a machine-readable format we can then subject subject this to automated algorithmic evaluations and as we get more data the evaluations become smarter so these Oracle's and we've heard about bringing in data from other sources these Oracle's become smaller and so we end up with a hash claim that's worth the piece of paper that it's written on or not written on and what's really important about this is not only the aspects of the blockchain providing provenance and transparency and so on but really that this is a new asset class for the impact economy so tokens are a really important concept they're going to change the ways in which people participate in delivering in evaluating and in and in funding impacts and if we think about it so digital tokens are really about providing rights rights of access rights of use rights of ownership the sustainable development goals are based on a framework of rights rights to clean water rights to health rights to gender equality etc and bringing these two capabilities these two ideas together I believe is going to be profoundly important for who gets to participate and how we get to distribute rights to more people to create a fairer and a more abundant participation in sustainable development how we implement this is important and so the tools that we use and how we configure impact projects that are being built on technologies such as the Excel blockchain enabling different agents to participate whether you're funding whether you're evaluating or whether you're delivering impacts and around this we can now start to create some innovative market marketplace mechanisms such as smart impact funds and so on very quickly I'm gonna talk about some of the projects this has really been hard work and it's and then we've had a lot of failures and unless ins learnt so in South Africa over the past four years implementing a project called ampli which is digitizing pre-school attendance records we're going to be implementing a development impact bond in India for 200,000 young learners tracking that over four years cookstoves with with connected sensors that produce claims that can be translated into into carbon credits and we're very excited about the last one here which is a project in Madagascar to measure the ecological restoration from from reforestation projects using special sensing technologies and I have to stop there so little cardboard matters and very you watch cants let me start by asking you a question can you raise your hands if you've ever donated to an international charitable cause like the earthquake in Nepal or the Syrian crisis or the Ebola crisis okay keep your hands up keep your hands up if you can tell me exactly where that money went where it was spent how it was spent in the impact that it had literally not one hand I've worked at the aid sector for the last ten years most recently managing about a 30 million dollar portfolio across Africa what was what became clear to me was that the global financial system wasn't built for the aid sector wasn't built for the charity sector generally so about a year and a half ago two years ago we decided to build one that is there we go the current financial infrastructure is slow so if you're responding to a crisis response or a disaster response let's say there's been an earthquake or flooding somewhere whether the funds take two days to arrive or two weeks to arrive can be the matter between life or death the current banking system is also expensive banks charge up from banking fees offer poor exchange rates for example and it's also opaque so we're unable to trace the flow of funds from end to end from donor to beneficiary and that lack of transparency also often leads to the misuse or misappropriation of funds the in in 2013 ban ki-moon of the UN estimates that up to 30% of official development assistance Oda was lost to fraud and corruption now whether you believe that statement or not what we know is if we combine the legacy banking inefficient sorry legacy banking and efficiencies with the lack of transparency it means a significant portion of funds aren't getting to where they're meant to get to they're not able to serve those individuals or those communities and therefore the impact is reduced so it dispersed we're building an alternative financial infrastructure for the aid sector dispersed in essence is a fund management platform that drives the transparency the efficiency and the effectiveness of aid finance and we work with governments with donors with end enabling them to transfer funds from end-to-end from donor to beneficiary ensuring that ensuring that resources get to where they're meant to get to and can have the greatest impact so whilst we envisage kind of an age chain certainly potentially starts from a fundraising campaign goes through a number of organizations and potentially funds are delivered to beneficiaries or individuals at the end of that chain what we're primarily interested for now at least is that inter organizational distribution whilst it's certainly not the sexy thing we all everyone agrees that you know cash transfers is probably much more and much more sexy place to be working in inter organizational distribution for us is the key challenge is where the biggest losses occur whether that's from an fx process for an exchange process or from a potential loss losses through through fraud or or misuse etc so to that sorry just going back that is our our primary focus for now so here's how it works an institutional donor let's say differed or the Gates Foundation with deposit Fiat funds normal money pound sterling etc into our bank account a disburse has a segregated bank account against that deposit we then issue or tokenize money as we've heard a lot today digital money so let's say DeFede is funding a girls education project in Malawi and they deposit million pounds with us we then issue a million digital pounds it's those digital pounds that can then get distributed down that chain so potentially from differed to save the children in the UK to save the children in Malawi to local schools local training providers through that chain and that they can be trusted that they can be traced as they flow in real time and that can provide a real-time audit as well so let's say an organisation a school in Malawi has got 10,000 pounds worth of digital funds that they want to redeem we can they can then redeem those funds or exchange or withdraw those funds from the platform into their local bank account into local currency the same could be done for individuals into mobile money or those phones all those funds could be tokenized onto an eval for example and could be with redeemed within a merchant store so back in back in the middle of last year we implemented our first pilot and that was distributing funds for a girls education project this time in Swaziland and we work with the charity called positive women now for some of you that may note the Swaziland has the highest HIV AIDS epidemic rate in the world and if your parents subsequently often die relatively young leaving their children as orphans now if you're a female orphan in Swaziland the likelihood of you accessing an education is relatively slim or significantly reduced at least so we work with positive women who raise funds and then distribute them for a number of different kind of projects or causes within Swaziland this one specifically was distributing school fees to ensure that those young girls got on access to it got access to an education so the funds were deposited with disperse and then dissed and then we issued electronic funds or digital funds to to the positive woman's account and those funds were then distributed down that chain it could be tracked in real time so that positive women and the other stakeholders involved could see exactly where those funds were at any given time that real-time audit but we also enable enabled them to save 2 and a half percent on on their transfer costs which which meant that they saved a couple of hundred pounds now it was only transferring 20,000 pounds but a couple of hundred pounds meant that they could fund an additional 3 girls to go to school for a year now it's scale we think that is quite exciting each year 650 billion dollars is distributed in aid finance that's a huge opportunity we then formed a partnership with the start network the start network in essence are a membership network of 42 leading humanitarian or aid agencies like Oxfam and Save the Children and they respond to smaller crises across the globe and so what we're doing is that we started piloting with a series of these of the member organizations and that we're starting to test the dispersed platform to demonstrate that it can have an impact at both in efficiency level in terms of the speed in terms of the cost savings but also at a transparency level and it's that transparency or that traceability that has been proven to be the most of the most including important feature of what we're building the ability to trace funds as I said from donor to beneficiary and potentially beyond I'm really proud of what we've built to date and but in in more ways I mean I'm excited about where we're going you know we're still at the very early stages of this but the potential of what we're creating we believe is is huge and I'd invite all of you to join us and be a part of that that journey with us so thank you very much [Applause] Todd Morley and I congratulate all the other speakers because we're all rebels and we're challenging the status quo and part of the status quo is how we allocate and manage money which i think is very backward looking and as we're all talking about exponential returns the godfather of that to me is is Ray Kurzweil who created the law of accelerating returns so this goes back to what is that 1900 and you'll see a very predictable smooth upward sloping line that captures the exponential growth in computing power but basically you can take any data set and put it on that line and you'll see it pretty predictable results including solar and other information technologies which I'm going to discuss that are going to produce substantially outsized returns and substantially in excess of the sp500 which to me is a backward-looking index why is that important because we have trillions and trillions of dollars sitting in non-traditional accounts including insurance companies that to me are mismanaged we're running deficits even with the best performers very few people ever even beat the SP and so rotating that capital into this part of the world is going to be unavoidable and so we want to be leaders and pushing that so just that as an introduction you know when we think about where we are I think everyone's touched on it we're seeing this decentralized economy what we need to recognize is where we are in that in in the evolution of technology we need to not be frustrated by the pace of change and to effectively raise our level of consciousness and understand how quickly things are changing we need to grab the empowerment which is a power transfer right and so the decentralized economy best captured in the new protocols like aetherium it's really a gift that is handed to the individual instead of instead of what I call the guardians at the gate it's amazing how hypnotized we are now by social media if you want to know if your children are loyal to you or the Wi-Fi network they're on try to turn it off and see what happens and we've sort of lost the vibration with each other and with earth watch Blue Planet - and see how you feel about our stewardship of the world so we really need to educate ourselves we need to understand the power of the decentralized economy we connect peer to peer we hardwire ourselves through smart contracts we regain control of personal data and bring back trust through the open ledger I've been an entrepreneur my entire life and I have never seen the kind of action that is happening right now there's this palpable sense of accomplishment but even more interestingly of collaboration people really are helping each other it's not that's my pioneer PI people are really coming together and moving very quickly I think that capitalism as we've known it will decline not in favor of communism but in favor of free enterprise it's interesting when you look at any market you have the guardians at the gate we used to have hundreds of investment banks now we have four you have four important VCS four important publishers four four or five important PD firms so they become oligarchies and I believe that they're gonna have a very tough time keeping up with this very quickly decentralizing economy people have all the creative the creativity they need they are doing things with intention you can now hardwire your intention and I love the saying that intention will now be unhackable kind of an interesting concept a philosopher friend of mine says we need attention intention awareness curiosity and will but we control all those things right and so marshalling those together are gonna produce amazing results so what's a different about the new protocol driven economy trust and accountability and of course peer to peer action what's the value of trust so we've most recently seen a problem of trust with our favorite Facebook from peak to trough it was down over 100 billion dollars Mark Zuckerberg did pretty well I guess and Congress yesterday and the stock is that but it's still down something like 60 billion dollars so if you want to put a value on trust the last sixty billion dollar problem was Lehman Brothers conveniently that was a market cap and it's gone and so that was a an issue of trust right we didn't trust their marks and so they flushed them and the same thing happened to bear start so people are now starting to put a huge value on trust I'm getting cue cards that are scaring me back in time we had a problem with uneven access to information so we created search and then Google democratized information now we have huge problems caused by old technologies like I believe with the decentralized economy it just will not be able to keep up with the pace of change I've recently come together with a group of people including X Google executives and and people from the AI world into a new company slash ecosystem Kawai to X as in Y to the X power and our goal is nothing short of democratizing innovation and entrepreneurship we should not control people's ideas we should help them get to market and move them quickly this is intimidating speaking so quickly we ironically live in the Holy Trinity for the execution of this we have low interest rates governments are insolvent if you tell the truth and we have an extremely liquid private sector and so all of that capital three trillion dollars sitting in negative interest rates and zhuge Switzerland for the tech companies is insane you have three and a half trillion dollars sitting in hedge funds that are in four and a half percent over the last 20 years and yet you have these information technologies attacking the big problems that that we've all been highlighting here my view is that the things are impacting our basic assets of need combine those with the SDGs and if you'd like the the decentralized economies slash blockchain will become the operating system for that which is pretty phenomenal to get your head around that suddenly its power to the people not surprisingly of John Lennon on the back of those cards people still think that impact I'm getting the one minute sign impact is a tax on return I think that we can show that by combining information technologies to solve all the problems this project in Nigeria will find itself on that that graph of law of accelerating returns you're gonna find hyper hyper growth there so why would we allocate to backward looking things when you can actually do good things and substantially substantially outperform Moore's law would be the most convenient way of thinking about the law of accelerating returns right it's double you y equals two to the 55th power imagine if you had 55 doublings you'd have your own country so just skipping ahead fearful of Pawnee I think that the the key really is that we we need data over dogma and that the two greatest inefficiencies in the world are left brain and inner truth and ideology and statistics we simply have to get to through the noise get to the statistics because you'll never solve a problem and in the final moment if you feel guilty about making money with these solutions you can always start your own foundation and do the great work of the skull foundation [Applause] to invite everyone up we've got about ten minutes left and I know much has been made of my time making but I would just like to say we got through ten speakers and half the time of the plenary last night so well done everyone come on up you can actually keep that if you like great okay so we've got a little bit of time for questions I think we've got about ten minutes so yeah Gail especially technology and what your scribe is magnificent what I always asked my students for insects so I'm fresh off watching governess training on this we were too I'm gonna say so I'm gonna pose that question to you it's five years down the road ten years and you're in Congress which you idealistic that's your message I'm gonna take this one I'm gonna ask you to take this one then I have Chi and actually Shawn take this one if you don't mind go ahead if you pass the mic over did she um interestingly it's an interesting time where blockchain is very exciting to everyone and it's actually especially the problem where we're dealing with in Nigeria the people who normally would be actors against us the government have now become partners because of the excitement about blockchain but you're asking to answer your question it's actually the the the fear of the government organizations in the US and the West that's holding back innovation because in Africa the CBN I you know I met with the CBN and they're looking to the sec to lead but that sort of a conservative view is actually it's influencing them and because they don't really a lot of people don't really understand the opportunity of blockchain they just want to you know so it's almost like for someone like me who's actually it was like trying to create some societal change it's like now we can sneak in the back door but this uh this sentiment that's coming from the SEC is actually holding back innovation in places where it's needed so I spoke about the transition from web 2.0 to web 3.0 that's the technological transition the other transitions are much harder and what we're starting to see is almost one of these kind of archetypal battles that we've kind of read about in history and so on the battle between good and evil or old and new and so on and and what's really gonna bite us is the backlash from from the incumbent system and we're starting to see it already with regulators with the big institutions and so on and I don't know whether in five years we can really tip the balance in the right direction and so I think there's some huge battles that are going to be taking place and and it's going to be battle scars and there's gonna be people in jail regulators and say you you did wrong because you because you didn't get a banking license to transfer those those tokens and that kind of thing hoping that you do and just really quickly we work in the blockchain space and it's very fashionable nowadays to tabash on blockchain companies actually because there's completely over hype there are a lot of scams and like crazy icos that are going on and that's actually fueling the incumbents to to sort of like dismiss what some of us are doing in this space we're making quite a few organizations feel a bit queasy we're starting to see charities in particular of some charities feel a little bit threatened because this is quite disruptive to to the way that they work so the question is whether over the course of the next five years the the hype is going to die down real solutions are going to emerge and what we expect is that a lot of new actors who can pounce on what Todd was saying pounce on this new way of doing things this decentralized way of doing things probably going to one-up and a lot of the of the incumbents thank you two very quick things I think the comparison to Facebook in Cambridge analytical is a really good one in five years time I could easily see any one of us up in front of Congress saying defending why we created a surveillance state privacy is gonna be a huge issue in all of this technology going forwards we've got to get that right but for me the bigger challenge is communication if we're not careful we end up as this weird tech cult that just went ahead and did something and didn't bring everybody else with us and that's that's the responsibilities on us for that I'm thinking about prioritization of data you know when I think of our world team ups and I lead our sustainable finance for energy of EVs tonight part of my job I think is getting our whole team of scientists and experts so you know sort of like the key leverage points and the data that's relevant to the financial sector getting them to act on that wondering how do you think about there's some places like land tenure where you know that's obviously the priority but these issue areas that are much more dispersed that guess in terms of what the DA likes deep mitigating deforestation or addressing overfishing you know how do you sort of make sure that the data that's gonna be the real lever or driving the change get sort of serve this stuff really quickly sorry I'm talking again but that's where crypto economics come in actually so we have a whole business model I couldn't get into before which is about surfacing also using getting experts to to identify which are the best projects which are the the the issues or the outcomes that are the best structured and that's part of the partnership that we have with the impact management project which I'm sure you know just incubated by bridges fund management to try to bring all of that expertise in and that's really a big focus of what we're doing one of the other really interesting thing that none of this is yet touched on which four people are allocating capital is to think about all these impacts and how you start to value those and actually none of this data what this will data will say what things have happened and we might have better data on what people's experience has been and then there's going to be a really really interesting thing about that comes along how people actually account for that social value and that's gonna be absolutely fascinating and you can see a whole of new valuation techniques that start to say these are the things that we value more and more and that will be the data that starts to come out because we're putting social value on these things yeah just a quick point to UM you know there's kind of a first step in just capturing data in the first place I mean a lot of the technologies especially a machine learning are technologies that help us understand what the best or you know what the relevant factors are and that's like the beauty of it is that by by capturing things obviously we you know liber8 with experts like you to figure out what are the right questions asked what should we could be going after first but as more and more things more and more information comes online applying machine learning to it I mean it can point out trends and patterns to relevant factors that matter that we couldn't have thought of in a hundred years so I mean that's another exciting frontier yeah so we all have an interest in the SDGs and such and I one of the things I find interesting is how capital at the top of the string is so interested in it but the it's not reflected at the bottom of the string the string being the world and if you Falacci and hopefully we can tie the bottom and at the top together and get transactions flowing and and I said so when we're looking at let's first say for example the oil spill cleanup that we're doing and the other projects that we're doing with the Niger Delta Development Commission what we're building a reputation system that actually is weighted towards different SDGs so in the end you're going to be able to see which actor and hopefully eventually which area which country is actually contributing to each STG and that kind of data is actually highly valuable because capital at the top wants to be distributed to all these different STDs but it's not in the mindset of the government and an emerging world or the people and by attaching those milestones and then also being because you know people are very competitive in Nigeria cuz the population so young by attaching those milestones and to the reputation it actually gets people more focused on creating STG projects which helps transfer that mindset and eventually will on earth the type of data that capital is looking for to to work with yes we are out of time Nigel so it has to be very very short provocation yes I've been reporting a blockchain and so are thinking some amazing things my provocation is this is that this is the language we're starting to you whoever said that was a tool is absolutely right don't create any product does not crave and socially I think some of the language that starting even with it reminds me very much in the provocation in the danger if this sounds like ten years ago perhaps or people talking about social investments interesting like a and that is the danger and it's brilliant what you're doing I'm just saying that provocation is let's not go down the road with suddenly we've got more top-down product telling people down there excellent Nigel that's great thank you okay we've run out of time I wasn't here ten years ago I was here nine years ago what are you're talking about social investment so just gonna quickly wrap up thank you very much for all of your time and and for our amazing set of speakers I mean just another round of applause [Applause] looking forward to seeing many of you back here next year to look at where we've come please feel free to get in touch this part of exposing all of you amazing individuals to these ideas is for us to build things this is not a thing yet this is something we are all building this is a world that we're all creating so I think that you know there's a lot of different talents and resources in the room so I encourage you to interact with panelists are gonna be here all day feel free to fund myself and Nicky Tom's also going around all week and thank you very much and have a good rest of your day you
