 welcome to whiteboard programming where we  simplify programming with easy to understand   whiteboard videos and today i'll be sharing  with you different types of blockchain and   their respective examples so let's get started so  broadly speaking blockchain can be classified into   three categories 1. Public blockchain 2. Private  blockchain or 3. Consortium or Hybrid blockchain   In this video we'll be understanding each type  with an example #1 Public blockchain simply said   publicly accessible blockchains  are termed as public blockchain   further these blockchains have no restriction  on the participant and the validator also the   main advantage of this type of blockchain is the  uncontrollability of the blockchain which means   that nobody will have the complete control over  the network hence it ensures that the data is   secure and helps in immutability of the records  also all the nodes connected to this public   blockchain will have equal authority and hence  this public blockchain becomes fully distributed   bitcoin and ethereum are some of the examples  of public blockchain being used in real-world   scenarios #2 Private Blockchain as  the name suggests this particular blockchain   requires the participant to be invited  before they can be part of the blockchain   here all the transactions are visible only to the  person who are part of the blockchain's ecosystem   these type of blockchain are centralized and  much better controlled than public blockchains   as the blockchain are more centralized here  they can be governed and regulated by someone   who can make sure that the governors are guiding  participants also these blockchain can have a   token or may not have one and can be manipulated  based on the preference of the blockchain owner   private blockchains usually have a network  administrator who can take care of the user   permission in case any particular user requires  additional authority on the go these are   typically used in private organization to store  sensitive data about the organization for example   hyperledger #3 Consortium or Hybrid  blockchain now this blockchain can be divided   into two different types where some nodes are  private while others are public as a result some   of the nodes will be allowed to participate in the  transactions while the other nodes are supposed to   control the consensus process this comes out  to be as an ideal hybrid blockchain between   private and public blockchain here all the nodes  can be accessed by the blockchain while the   level of information that can be accessed will be  based on the node accessing that particular data   in this blockchain there are usually two types of  users one is the user who has all the control over   the blockchain and decides the level of security  for a particular user while rest others are the   ones who just access the blockchain as per  their function for example ripple network so   now let's answer the biggest confusion what is the  difference between blockchain and cryptocurrency   well the difference between cryptocurrency and  blockchain is the same difference between mobile   application and your mobile platform for example  the app can be whatsapp or uber while the platform   can be ios or android in the end the applications  will run on the platform and in a similar tone   blockchain is the platform while cryptocurrency  is the application this confusion is quite   common as both cryptocurrency and blockchain were  introduced at the same time with bitcoin and do   remember that bitcoin was the first application  of cryptocurrency on the blockchain platform   with that i hope this video was helpful  to you and served value if you love my   content be sure to smash that like button and  if you haven't already subscribed to my channel   please do as it keeps me motivated and helps  me create more content like this for you
