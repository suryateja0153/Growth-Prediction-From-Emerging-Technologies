laptops open to work on other courses midterms but I will ask you to try to focus on blockchain and money today today we're going to chat about permissioned versus permissionless systems I want to thank I I have a guest here I call out guests when they're here and I know Mark Snyder men who runs a fund at fidelity mark runs is six about six billion dollars called the real estate Income Fund at fidelity and you might say well why does he want to come to a blockchain in money course it's because we went to high school together so and I was in his wedding and he's getting married again next week but you can all inundate mark later about fidelity because he's been there for a lot of years I'm shamelessly for MIT and MIT students so let's let's get going I was I was letting a little bit of time for a few more people to wander in today we're going to talk of course we're going to chat a little bit about the reading and study questions gonna go back again to what are the technical and commercial challenges and this is relative this is relevant for all of our lectures but it's particularly relevant today because we're gonna be talking about two different database structures one's the permissionless blockchain a Bitcoin but now today we're gonna introduce and go deeper into the permissioned or private set of block chains like the IBM hyper ledger and corta but the technical issues relate to all of that and then of course we're going to talk about that against a third type of database traditional databases so aligning permissionless like Bitcoin permissioned IBM hyper ledger type of and then traditional databases and why in a business setting you might think of one versus another versus another and I'm sure if I run off the rails anywhere on traditional databases which I have not personally studied alene will help bail me out somewhere that ik is that a deal mamie yeah I asked for it mark a lien is a as a computer scientist from other parts of MIT so he helps me out in subjects I don't know and even in subjects I think I know so so let's just start a little bit with what did you take from the readings there were four or five readings of course but what is a permission or private distributed ledger now I can do this I can light them up as some people set because tallit is giving me my buy list but but again class participation anybody who hasn't spoken yet sort of chime in and give it a shot I'm not seeing any volunteers oh yes in addition to that they are said to be stakeholders and since they're the only ones involved in verifying the transaction instead [Music] away from decentralization and so J eat data went through a whole lot it's about the number of nodes and permissioned into it and that it addresses some of the that booter ins trilemma so in its core it sort of addresses some of the scalability issues but it does that at a trade-off that it's not truly open it's not anyone can write to the ledger I mean that's sort of the fundamental things anything else that folks took out of the core readings as to how it separates and how it's different I mean all right okay get a chance to add a little bit and then we're gonna dive into hyper ledger and kurta a bit we'll talk about digital asset Holdings what's did Joe asset Holdings anybody know this company laun knows it bro - knows it other than Eileen Oh can tell me who runs digital asset holding just it shows that you did the reading like whoo-hoo Blythe masters is and what she's famous for beyond digital I said holding JPMorgan and she's known around the world of credit default swaps Gillian Tett who some of you the Sloan fellows will get a chance to chat with Gillian Tett in New York in a few weeks Gillian Tett wrote a whole book about credit default swaps in JP Morgan and Blythe Master is a central character in that whole narrative art and this is what she's doing now she's brilliant and she's a very good businesswoman I ran the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and had an opportunity to meet with her a lot because she ran the the swap dealer association is done at the time or was the outside chair of Vista if I recall and then we're going to talk about the business trade-offs as well but what what do you think some of the central business trade-offs if I could get two or three of you to help me out on what are the central business trade-offs between permission and permissionless blockchains let me see if I get some of the other than Priya yes you remind me your first name better privacy and and the third point you're saying no mining or mining is associated with this proof-of-work any other business trade off so for permission you have some more flexibility with governance you need to make changes you don't need to rely ability of governance in essence because if you have a club deal or a group deal maybe you can do that governance changes amongst the group instead of having thousands of people participating hyper latch or at least promotes themselves in their own right ups because the the reading was really from them that they're their embedded language much more flexible and then you can use Java you can just go and so forth at least they say they can I I don't know if it's really as limited in Ethier iam but they think and they promote that they're more flexible than etherium so Kelly's right in that too so these were the readings and now so we're back to basics again what is a blockchain I know we've spent four or five lectures on it but these key components would start append-only timestamp logs are they both by show hands are they in permissionless blockchains I hope every single hand goes up are they in permissioned or closed blockchains I'm watching I'm not putting I'm just gonna watch alright every hand should go up so both sets of blockchains have this concept that goes back nearly 30 years to our friend Hebert you know who started the whole blockchain that's in the New York Times this whole concept is in both sets of block British append-only to yoke ability of the major feature where you can make some changes to that history which is not equivalent to a hard fork so that will probably be one example where if it's purely raising that there are certain features that are promoted in one of the private blockchains Corte that may allow you not to append only but in essence delete data or or replace data possibly and I'm not because there's also in private blockchains an ability to partition and in essence it's a kind of a form of shorting but to partition the data I don't know enough about court or whether there you literally allow you to the delete or is it is it something in this partitioning but maybe Hugo if I mean to my understanding if you have a permission system and there are only a like a small number of will still call them nodes then can't like if you realize to do something wrong or something needs to be changed can't they all go in and change that the point if you're down to like three nodes as I've shared with you all the Australian Stock Exchange is putting a permission block chain up using digital asset holding which i think is backed by also the hyper ledger fabric technology but if it's just the Australian Stock Exchange in its one node or three nodes couldn't they just change it in all three and I think in essence yes I mean that's may not be what the database structure is but I still think it's it's potentially yes so as you get more concentration you have more chance but British I will try to research the court a thing more specifically other so then you create an auditable database some database with cryptography hash functions which half the class said they understood and the other half was sort of you know a little rough line all is in permission systems using cryptographic schemes to ensure for the validity of the data and so to speak the immutable nature of the data what's different is consensus protocols in essence it all goes down except for bro dashes point maybe about kurta as to who gets the chance to add the additional data is it a small club deal or is it broad wide open everybody together roughly so back to the technical features remember it's a bunch of cryptography love it or hate it it's actually allows us all to use the Internet well past obviously the blockchain that we're discussing in this class network consensus and then all the Ledger's so both permission and permission lists have Ledger's have cryptography it's that middle bucket that's different between the two so what were some of the challenges that we talked about in blockchain we just talked about them ten minutes ago but just what's the list again see this is the easy part if you haven't spoken yet this is like the easy questions oh I'm hopelessly shameless yes do you want to say your first name so till Lida takes you off the list no you want to say it louder because talita can take you [Music] all right so scalability and some time so efficiency and scalability anything else privacy so it's basically the scalability of the privacy are two big things that permissioned systems address interoperability basically how does how does this blockchain talk to other block chains or how does this blockchain talk to other legacy systems permissioned and permissionless systems both have issues of interoperability however the smaller the club deal the more likely that a bank or the Australian Stock Exchange might address its interoperability right within the system whereas if it's a big open source open project so IBM would say we can even help you with interoperability IBM would say we can help you with all four lines we can help you with scalability efficiency we can help you with privacy we can help you with interoperability and governance I think it's less clear that they can help with all four but they can certainly help with the first two the LAN you've switched from using a permission list to a permission system in your startup right which of these four is the reason why your switch or something else so what was the reason that you're switched so I was building on a theory of public and I thought that it's unlikely that in the near future banks are going to adopt a theorem as their underlying technology and then I learned about our three importa and learned that banks actually funded that project so I switched where the banks put their money so I would contend that it's a bit about interoperability you felt your users would be more likely to be able to work with your system if you were using Korda which they were which which they were familiar and then of course there's the public policy reasons and IBM would even say that they're gonna score higher points on the public policy if for no other reason that there's better privacy and security now I'm not trying to shell for IBM I'm just saying these would be their selling points or Corte or elsewhere we talked about booter ends trilemma but in another way many people would say decentralization competes with scalability and security if you want scalability and security you can't have decentralization I'm not a big believer in this trilemma even though I've now raised it twice but it's often talked about in at blockchain conferences and blockchain papers and business discussions so I've always told you I want to be a fair representation of the debate that's going on I think it's more possible to solve these three over time together than some others but maybe I'm just a cockeyed optimist about technology so public policy framework what were the big three slipstream so I went fast last time the last class Leonardo what what are you going to tell me about that it's because you were adjusting your glasses more about for adoptions or security protect people so it's sort of a privacy thing I think I have a hand hand up here from Catalina all right so you know my style I try to drop things into three buckets but it's the only way I can remember anything but it is the three big buckets of course and since I went fast last time and we're gonna be coming back to a lot of it but we're there any questions that you have and this is just an opportunity for ODIs value of finance of crypto finance is about two hundred and twenty billion dollars right now compared to worldwide capital markets that in aggregate over three hundred trillion of debt bonds and and yes any question that even though it's only two hundred billion versus three hundred-plus trillion dollars of worldwide financial assets couldn't it still be relevant to financial stability and the answer is yes but it's still relatively it's less than one one thousandth of the broad size yes please better you than the public when the Bitcoin markets down within the past year into the system and once that the supposedly kissing a lot of you're saying there's correlation and there may be feedback loops Tom it's sort of a related question so Mervyn King was in this room couple hours ago and he was talking about in the OE crisis two issues of trust one where there was a counterparty trust issue banks even though the overall derivatives market was even banks didn't individually know which other bank was most at risk and so they wouldn't trade with each other or lend to one another and then on the opposite side that the solution the Salvation was two people in a room trusting each other that the central bank that the government would fund billion tens of billions of dollars inject capital and so I wonder your thoughts on role in addressing that first problem of knowing your counterparty or at least being able to trust their position and then the risk of eliminating the second chance of injection of capital I had a question is this it's tricky but you only have a financial stability problem if people are relying on the value of the people the reason you have the problem during the crisis is give all these bangs they're carrying these assets on their balance sheet and all the sudden people think they don't know what they're worth right who if anyone is actually carrying a Bitcoin assets on a balance sheet that someone else is relying on or put it differently who's extending the leverage let me wrap these together I think that what the what many central bankers and the Financial Stability Board would say a 200 billion versus 300 trillion it's probably not that financially relevant at this point where it could get relevant is as Rossa sort of suggested is this if there's leverage behind it if it's in a balance sheet it's an asset on a balance sheet and there's a liability on the other side and thus it could bring down that that entity whether it's a hedge fund whether it's a bank but something that's relying has has to tie it back to the questions that Tom raised is could blockchain lower systemic risk possibly if it's a better database solution if it if it answers what Mervyn King was speaking about we also addressed in the late 90s I remember quite well when secretary Rubin caught a number of us into his office and said I don't understand the bank's can't tell us their exposure to Korea a number of countries South Korea was about to they they didn't default on their debt but they were coming close to the defaulting on their debt and of course it was only a short while before other countries like Indonesia and Thailand we're getting into that same debt challenge but why couldn't banks tell the US Department of Treasury their exposure is usually through derivatives and derivatives both in the late 90s and and and the financial crisis were often something that propagated risk through the system now the numbers were larger I mean depending upon the time the 90s were less than this but it was three four hundred trillion dollars of notional amount of derivatives so just the the sheer notional size even though the capital at risk and derivatives was much smaller it was because the leverage of this notional big notional size and the transparency was pretty low it wasn't zero actually wasn't zero but it was really low and so I think that's what Mervyn King would have been mentioning and I do think blockchain can help in that transparency but it takes a big collective action and so Europe the US and Asia a lot of laws were passed to get more transparency in the derivatives space British I would say that there could be problems and I've had I've had conversations with elected leaders that say don't get lulled into the sense that it won't have financial stability issues because that was what happened in the 1980s and 90s when people said well derivatives will not create instability because it's only it's only the the institutional investors the sophisticated investors this there so to speak big boys or big girls you know and and I was part of that those debates that consensus that formed that it was only institutional and it wouldn't but there was a lot of leverage and a lack of transparency when big leveraged multiple hundreds of trillions of dollars associated with it of course was part of the crisis not the only part of the crisis but any other questions before Hugo run I'm just wondering like a lot of people are now using Robin Hood and Xero feed things like to invest in stock market and companies like Robin Vanguard often sell or give up data to high frequency traders so that they can kind of know what's going on and maybe front-run so I was wondering how that fits in to the to what we're talking about last time where there's no transparency on many of the block crypto currency exchanges and then in addition to that big institutional investors can I think I like upwards of 5% of any stock and then wait a few days before they have to before they have to report on that so that can also have a huge effect on like stock price and then they can afterwards dump on people so how is that different from what's going on in crypto currency exchange rates faster protection one was there another one in the is this investor prediction or different all right any other investor protection because I'm going to collect them and then just enjoy active financial stability all right can I hold it let me just answer hugo's it's investor prediction one so all markets not just crypto markets all markets are susceptible to some forms of front-running in essence if you have a client relationship and you get information from your client that might affect the the market pricing you might jump ahead of that client with their information their information might be a buy order a sell order or frankly it might be some other information but traditionally if they have a buy order or sell order you have information and then you're sort of jumping ahead and you know saying alright I'll buy or sell in front of them that's the classic sort of front running even though there's other methods it's not supposed to happen on regulated exchanges you have some policing of it even before government stood in you could have some policing of it in self-regulatory organizations in the crypto world there is you know Katie bar the door anything can really happen and it's my belief and understanding that many crypto exchanges not all of them not all of them but many crypto exchanges are basically trading in front of their customers and in fact most crypto exchanges make markets as they're both market makers meaning they are buying when you're selling and selling when you're buying that's the nature of a market maker it's a very typical very legal very important function of market but the exchanges are both market makers and then they show order books and so it sort of helps them do front-running not that a lot of people would necessarily agree with me I think these markets would be better off if there were some forms of rules about front-running and manipulation and markets and the like when you're five percent question can we take it up at office hours or something because it's served outside of crypto but I'll be glad to talk about the SEC rules about the five percent is this investor protection to all blockchain technology whether it's permission like fabric or parishioners Ken if it was if it was efficient and scalable could help out because you could actually time stamp when did the order come in when did the clients information get to the exchange and as somebody standing in front cause right so if you look at the the the algorithms at the New York Stock Exchange right now which are not blockchain they're not permissioned and they're not permissionless blockchain but if you look at the both the algorithms and the data flows they have very good time stamping I'm not gonna say it's perfect but they have very good time stamping to it sure when or orders basically message time stamping every message that comes in and some order books like the New York Stock Exchange some order books are price and time priority price priority meaning high bid gets hit before the next bid or lowest offer gets lifted first that's price priority but they might also have time priority for any bid that has the same price and any offer that's the same price so they have to have very good time stamping it's not it's it's not permanent you could not use I truly believe you could not use a blockchain solution for the New York Stock Exchange order book right now whether you can in ten years I'm not sure but the time latency is so relevant in the middle of those order books you know the nanoseconds that matter I want to take this stability question there were two stability and then we're going to move on to the rest of today's lecture you're having fun now so how blockchain could possibly help stabilizer a lot of financial instability or beyond the financial markets instability is a question of resilience and when when things are centralized you you create single points of failure in any system it really in a military or financial you you centralize something you then thus you know what to attack you can also maybe have higher walls or better moats but you still know something to attack so blockchain in its decentralized nature might be a more resilient database because even if half or two-thirds of it goes down you still have the other third I'm gonna say something that the New York Stock Exchange got whether it's a New York Stock Exchange the London Stock Exchange the Chicago Mercantile Exchange they all are required by their various local laws to have backup data centers and there's backup data centers even have to be lots of miles away if God forbid a bomb comes and takes out the center what's that it's caught it's basically disaster recovery so maybe blockchain will be more resilient I know I'm gonna take two more questions and then get back to permission versus permissionless wait back in the corner or your first name Venus Matt thank you Matt I should know that so I'm new and this market is how that affects policy because when you're shaping policy and you don't necessarily have a bunch of years of knowing how people are gonna react to that policy I feel like it could almost be a chicken and egg okay I understand anybody else with the same theme know so the question is how does it affect policymakers when a whole technology is no and I would say we have a lot of history with this we have whether it was railroads or the Telegraph or the telephone or television we have a lot of history technology and commercial applications move ahead of the public sector I mean just it's just inevitable the official sector the public sector unless it just basically does what Mark Carney says and the choice is to isolate something to sort of put up the moats of a society and says we can't use that technology here unless you have that technology usually supersedes the the markets and the markets and technology come before official sector depending upon the area can take single-digit years and sometimes decades for public sector to catch up literally but let's take the internet the internet was being worked on for 15 ish years but the the protocol layer that helped take off was the World Wide Web in 1991 or 92 and then the security protocols in 96 just taking financial regulation the SEC was asked in 1995 could bulletin boards they were there were electronic bulletin boards listing stocks and bonds be exempted from being considered stock exchanges well the people that were asking that were the people putting up the bulletin boards they didn't want to be regulated the New York Stock Exchange it was fully regulated and Nasdaq that was fully regulated was coming at the other side and asking the SEC to shut them down they didn't want the competition from the disruptors it took three years for the SEC to answer that question I don't mean answer it like with a letter that had to propose a role and they had to do a final role and it was three years to to do that in blockchain I think we are through some of the big questions we know how most jurisdictions tax t IX tax it as property and not as currency and some of the tax issues we know in most jurisdictions how it fits into broadly Bank Secrecy Act and illicit activity there's very choppy implementation very spotty implementation I would say the investor protection side we're at the early stages and it's going to take in most jurisdictions another three years maybe to sort through some of how to and this is just crypto finance I don't know Matt is that it's just I'm giving you some predictions some of it could be multiple decades we're still today trying to figure out the public sectors figuring out how to regulate Facebook and Google I'm going to take one last question thank cuz I got to do permission I was kind of like it kind of answers the side of like following the technology but I think for me what I was kind of wondering about was this the way we're like as soon as you apply regulations to something that at least a good portion of the market seems to value being deregulated it seems like a lot of the activity will change either in scope so Matt's raising there's a there's a trade-off about bringing something under regulation or into the public policy sphere I'm probably just one voice of this but I think it's probably true there's very few economic activities that grow large that stay fully outside of the public policy framework of a society it doesn't mean that public policy frameworks don't change get adopted get adapted the internet comes along and at first it's a question of the you know with Amazon is it going to be taxed or not is there sales tax and then later you know it's at first it's not later it is and in some jurisdictions questions on the internet was liability and this a very critical question of early internet was was there liability for any of the information of the flow of information I'm talking about libel laws and all the liability issues and so forth and so in the u.s. there's a section of the law in 1996 was passed and now we're coming back and saying wait a minute that gave two brought it was basically exempted the internet from liability his carriers but now that was modified in two thousand eighteen twenty two years later to say well if it has to do I think with basically child's trafficking and slavery and everything maybe maybe that's we should tighten that up a little bit so I don't believe any broad economic activity is going to remain outside fully outside public policy frameworks and and I'm glad to be challenged on that but I and and I think blockchain and particularly crypto finance is it that's grappling stage to get in so let me move forward because this is more about permission to permissionless i just wanted to cover some of these we will cover initial coin offerings and the public policy issues around initial coin offering so the Howey test we will cover crypto exchanges and we will cover central bank digital currencies a lot in the second half of this semester and so back to the trade-offs that we talked about already the trade-offs of centralization of decentralization and kosis work from the 1930s about the firm this is the cost remember this is the cost as we get centralized there's more cost of economic rents single points of failure and capture some fragility in a sense in the system but decentralization has its cost as well you'll notice that these two lines are crossing somewhere it was my failed attempt to say you know maybe there's a balance maybe overall while some organizations will find all the way to decentralization and some decentralisation I think economic systems tend more towards the centralized side of things but you can change the slope of these two lines if you want I'm just trying to give you a framework of thinking about so as as we've talked about the financial sector pretty much favors permission systems the financial sector is saying going back no too many costs of coordination governance security privacy and scalability we're we're over on the other side and and so that's where they are today I'm not sure that's where they'll be in five or ten years but it is definitely where they are today so let's go back down our our list in a sense where do you think I'm gonna I'm gonna have a bunch of check marks and X's on the right where do you think I'm gonna have check marks and XS this is the same three big buckets because I can't think of anything Emily do you have a point of view I mean I think features one of them is obviously that it's not using that group of work not using proof of work so I had to give away that you know reveal occurred all the cryptography that's used in permission systems the permissionless systems is used in the permission systems it might be used a little differently I'm not going to say the Merkel trees are exactly the same but all that broccoli we were eating a few lectures ago are relevant on both sides sorry Elaine what's that you you like broccoli a computer scientist speaking everything though about digital signatures and hash functions and so forth they're relevant to both of these but they're not necessarily relevant to every traditional database which we'll talk about in 10 minutes or so but as Emily said there's really not I said no there's not decentralized network consensus I'm stretching it a little bit because permission systems can be decentralized there could be five or ten or twenty you know nodes and so that is decentralized so I I shouldn't have really said no I should have said maybe or hi-bred and instead of proof-of-work the permission systems use a bunch of consensus mechanisms and I just listed a couple notary nodes or PB ft for Byzantine fault tolerance again but they don't have native currencies so that's the big that is a very big difference no native currency if you have a solution for your final projects or you have a solution for some entrepreneurial business that you're gonna do in the future that you want a native currency you're probably more over into the permissionless world you want to have an incentive structure something to motivate customers or users or create token economics token economics is more in the permissionless I say more because you can create a token even in the permissioned space we'll talk about it in a moment and then transaction scripts or utx zeroes they're not technically UTX zeros and a bunch of permission systems but you need some ledger this last box if I just caught it Ledger's you'd still have Ledger's in so it's really the consensus mechanism in the middle as Emily said a couple key design features first memberships limited to basically an authorized set of nodes does anybody want to say if if you were a bank who you might you know what's a what what might you do if you were a bank and who might you authorized if if you're doing a bank let's say that it was loans or if it's marks and ironmans real estate it's real estate loans could you ever see real estate loans going on a blockchain mark loans may be so if real estate loans were on a permission blockchain who might be that membership limited who would I'm it's not just a rhetorical question who would actually care about the database of the loans broker dealers that are active in loans invest institutional investors that are active in loans so the broker-dealers who are actually trading the loans and maybe the investors yeah so maybe loan servicers maybe the right Angelis so it's basically who has who has a need and needs that data I'm not sure that that this is the right community but it's the discussion I'm thinking about and again as you're thinking about I'm jumping against it a little bit final projects but when you're thinking about you know who actually needs data and who has a reason to amend the data or write to the ledger because if you don't have a desire and a need to actually amend or change the data move value in the system you might not need an open database I'm not sure I follow you a question when you say an additional layer of blocks I'm sorry layer two so so what kelly is asking is is we've talked about how to make blockchain permissionless block change more scalable by having a layer two like the Lightning Network that's what you're referencing so in permissionless systems it's open to everyone even now if you're opening up an individual payment channel and the Lightning network it's really just two counterparties opening up a channel so in a sense you've already narrowed the scope because you might just have a payment channel between two parties some side chains or multiple parties lightning Network and payment channels tend to be two parties so I don't know if it was that what you're asking in itself is like mechanism of membership the layer two can be a membership that is correct but it's a technology that's available to everybody so it has attributes where you can open up bilateral channels James Michener's blockchains couldn't imagine that the layer one would be say the Fed would all be big commercial banks so where we're headed is due permission systems have the same need to have a second layer as permissionless and even if they don't have the same needs might it actually provide something so i would say i don't think they have the same need to have a second layer because they're they're more scalable they're more efficient right now and they're already closed clubs but even if they don't have the same need they might actually want to put a second layer on top and some of them actually do this right in their technology and and and it's what i put up here is the second and third bullet point the transactions can be limited to only authorized known participants so in many permission systems it's a one broad technology might only be twenty people that can authorize transactions but now in some transactions it will only be anton and may and in other transactions it will be alpha and amanda i mean so i might not be able to you by the way alpha might be goldman sachs and amanda might be Barclays and then it might make more sense and Mark might be fidelity and I don't know I am I the US Department of Treasury in this one mark and I both started out in finance I just went off to public service later but so-so corta and hyper ledger and many of the private blockchains literally allow for partitioning right in the blockchain I don't know if you'd need to put a layer or two on top because they allow for partitioning and segregated pools of authority inside of the blockchain I'm sorry there is a question I thought so your point is is that titling of of real estate could be an important part of block chains but every little town has its own system for keeping property records and getting them all to cooperate and blockchain kind of solution seems like Oh seems remote they don't think they have a real problem that needs solving so yeah maybe someday but I doubt it will happen anytime soon but it it makes some logical sense and that would probably be a permissionless system because there's not a huge amount of times a piece of property transaxle it's not like moving money around the world it's much it's a much simpler less frequent and land records are public people often have to go to the town town offices to look at them or anything that involves real estate you in the system but you're paying money because you're asking them lawyers to clear that to make sure the titles free and clear and there's all sorts of claims on a title to property somebody that fixed the roof or the utility company and has an easement through the middle but you know lines and so forth and so there are some complications that are different than just transferring these so to bring it back to broaden it out look it's right rahem rehabs question is is well what about real estate and title might that be appropriate and as Mark has given us a sense of yes it might be but we're back to that sort of thing of the collective-action issues that we've talked about in previous classes the collective action of many municipal authorities to keep the land record to keep the real estate records yeah it might help why do I need to do this and it's also a second thing it's a low volume low transaction and yet it could be an enormous benefit because there's something called title insurance and title insurance time to clean up the title and making sure that something is free and clear could be recorded in the future so I'll be a long-term optimist I don't see this one being solved in the next handful of years single-digit years particularly because of the door and collective action issues I'm sorry we have somebody here is going to take the other side before I give my conclusionary you know estimate yes yes they will not probably a quarter note and order stuff but you can publicly pool that information and then use that information and record that information on the blockchain and then once I become stronger and bigger than they will probably so maybe I'll move up my estimate from double-digit years to single digit years but I think it's gonna be with all respect some time some time Priya then I'm gonna move on so access to proper land rights rule and title that was a big issue for us overseas not so much in the US and so I could see a real application there where in several countries where there is no land record or there are no tidal systems are there buried in layers of application and this is a great solution to get something like that started in those contexts where you know there's you establishing the property right of record is could be of immeasurable social value no I agree and I think there's a there's been a tremendous amount of literature in the last 24 months around whether blockchain can help free up a lot of illiquid capital in essence I'm just saying I'm probably closer to Marx thinking that last thing I think it's gonna take some time contacts the country the system the legal system how decentralized and how tough the collective action issues are so just going back to private blockchains technical features let's go back membership limited to authorized nodes transactions can be partitioned as well 2k it's kind of Kelly's point right in the technology you can partition and segregate information so data and Ledger's can be partitioned because transactions can be partitioned that doesn't mean you can't have a layer two I'm just saying there's a lot less need for a layer two because they do it in the data structures itself the consensus is permission private protocols they do have a consensus somebody has to agree on the next block but it's it's it's a tight limited group it does use cryptography but often there's some but something called a registration Authority the registration authority is helping mask data so they address privacy two ways they address privacy because it's a smaller group that can actually see the whole network but even within the network even on the network there further addressing privacy that alphas in my transaction Amanda maybe can't even see even though she's on the network because it's encrypted and then there's sort of what's called a registration authority or authority within the system that can unmask it yes it's um a subgroup of two different from if they choose already doing some netting off of calculations or whatever it may be transactions and then the net all right so I've got another question I have to follow up when I have to follow up when bro dishes court a question and now James's question about wait a minute how is this partitioning different than a lei or two and it's beyond my knowledge but I'm gonna see if I can get it for you there's a good they're good questions and then smart contracts yes smart contracts can happen when these systems as well as permissionless systems ibm's they say they use chain code but they say chain code really could be any language at least they advertise and no native currency so that's kind of a technical not deeply technical it's not like learning hash functions but yes to cryptography well they'd partition the ledgers the consensus is closed loop yes they have smart contracts but they can even have additional privacy but it comes at a cost there's there's an authority that has to protect something a registration authority inside of it oh I forgot the code is generally open-source it does not have to be open source hyper ledger is open source but it doesn't have to be open source so this was the this was from one of the readings I'm just putting up that short that was in the reading and I just found it helpful it's a different way it's not Gensler zwey it's somebody else's way of thinking about aetherium hyper ledger in kurta I'm only using hyper legend quarter because they're two of the biggest private platforms there are many others different programming languages you might say from a business point of view who cares and to some level you're probably right but you're not completely right I mean there's probably more that people can write on top of hyper ledger fabric they say more developers could work on that than solidity governance that's the governance of the system itself they all can do smart contracts we've talked about consensus and and the scalability is much harder aetherium remember almost crashed on crypto kitties last December and I shared that story about one initial coin offering was 30% of the etherium network when the one day it was closing so DTCC in a given day can do as much as a hundred million transactions in a day that's the Depository Trust Corporation aetherium does about a million and a half transactions a day and Bitcoin about four to five hundred thousand transactions a day so you know we've still got a ways to go on the scalability so what about traditional databases I think that to talk about permission versus permission lists a lot of people even some of my colleagues here at MIT says well if you're talking about hyper ledger Corte and and a fabric in court it's just a that's that's like Oracle that's just a traditional database that's not really blockchain the Bitcoin and blockchain purist would say if it doesn't have Nakamoto consensus forget it it's not poor it's not a member of the club that's not how I've chosen to teach that this class as you know I think both are relevant possibly to business solutions and it's worthwhile to think of them but so what what what separates and this is not in the reading so I'm just gonna you know but what separates it versus a traditional database well back to the basics permissioned private blockchains have append-only looks you're adding I know cause I know Thank You Brodus will figure but basically they have append-only logs traditional databases and I'm at the edge of my knowledge you can create you can read you can update you can delete again I'm taking the mainstream traditional databases or what's called crud if you wish see your you do whereas these you always are adding to the database to these databases use cryptography to have commitment schemes remember what is a hash function it not only compresses data but it means you're committing to the data and when you finish the New York Times crossword puzzle you can actually send it in and if it's identical to it and hash it and if you remember our discussion about the New York Times crossword puzzle if it's hashed and the hashes match voila you solve the New York Times crossword pose so you could have commitment schemes for the data and it can be distributed yes Joe clean so even if it's append only if you take away the proof-of-work you can rewrite it in a very quickly manner so Joe Quinn's raising a very important point so even if it's append only you get rid of proof-of-work can't somebody go in and rewrite it permission block chains make a different trade-off on trust permissionless systems say we're gonna address trust through this proof of work and at least 51% of all of the network has to in essence agree and validate and would like permission basically are saying I'm going to trust the 10 or 15 or 20 nodes that are in the system can validate against each other and and the so there's there's something about the club that's authorized in the network but they're still using append only your right that it's within those 20 somebody could try to rush through and do a whole entire new append-only but then within the club it's exposed we the club agrees that the last two days have to be rewritten they can do it in a very easy way correct but I would contend that even in Bitcoin if 10,000 nodes decided to rewrite the last two days they could it's a very good a little time that's correct so what Joe Quinn saying is in Bitcoin what protects against that is partly the proof of work and partly that it takes 10,000 or at least 51% of them probably to rewrite the last two days the economic incentives in Bitcoin is is why waste all your computer power and electricity and so forth doing that when you may as well just go forward I think Bitcoin could be susceptible to state actors I think you know if North Korea wanted or Russia wanted to spend probably single-digit billions but at most maybe 10 billion they could overwhelm the whole system and and bring they could do a 51% attack by buying up enough mining equipment the a6 and just bigfooting the whole system but it's multiple billion and there's act there's academic papers on this now it's single-digit billions a state actor could an individual wouldn't want to do it because you'd crush a hundred and ten billion dollars market cap down to varrock so that would be kind of unwise this is a very critical part of what a private blockchain to me economically what a private blockchain can do and facilitate better than a traditional database I'm not saying this list is the only list I'm not even saying this list is completely the right list this is listen Gary Gensler slist trying to say what's the business that separates traditional blockchains append-only time stamping some cryptography and schemes that makes the data immutable so you can put it in a ledger so it's back to Ledger's and so forth and thus finality of settlement does anybody want to remind the class what settlement means anybody take a shot there's my accountant Aviv is not here oh please forget about you TX oh just tell me what settlement means debits and credits settlement means changing the data and a ledger and and doing it with finality in essence do I have $10 or $11 a payment settlement system is when you finally say I've got $11 no longer ten and Amanda's got nine dollars instead of ten you went down I went up all right thank you you'll hear a lot about clearing and settlement the word settlement means to finally change the data and a ledger and that we're not going to come back to it it's done it's final if we're moving something of value and the value could be grapes the value could be diamonds the value can be real-estate the value can be money but if we're moving something of value in it and and storing it on a ledger it's more adaptable to block J if you're doing some database that has nothing to do with things of value and ledger you don't need final final immutable settlement I would contend you probably have less reason to use any of this blockchain stuff maybe talk a little bit about a real-world implementation of this I saw recently that Walmart is forcing their suppliers to basically add themselves into this private blockchain to true to basically track your supply chain I'm having a really hard time understanding why that needs to be on a blockchain whether permissioned or non-commissioned needs to be so the question is why is Walmart putting supply chain with a bunch of agricultural products on a blockchain agricultural products are something of value but what well it's corn wheat grapes it's something of value and when it moves from one owner to another owner if you keep that on a ledger you can record that amanda has the grapes and Gary no longer has the grapes and another thing that blockchains helped with is they lower the cost of reconciling multiple databases we could keep as in agriculture we can keep separate Ledger's separate databases the farmer is keeping their database the wholesaler with the grain elevators are keeping their database and up the supply chain from the form to the grain elevator to the the Millers and merchants all the way to General Mills all the way to Kroger and this store you right now there's are multiple databases that buy and Lord don't have to communicate so the question is will will Walmart get to the place where that's a good idea but I'm just pointing out if you have if you're moving things of value where you want to keep final settlement that you you you know who owns that thing of value in Ledger's and lastly if you want to lower any reconciliation if there are multiple Ledger's if you have multiple Ledger's and things of value blockchain I think is more valuable Zhaan's asking was that Walmart I don't know we're gonna find out Tom and I've got about seven minutes to finish this program but the example they used was in a coli outbreak and their spinach supply rather than taking a whole supplier an entire wholesaler offline and recalling all that product through the blockchain they could trace it to a particular farm and a single point of origin almost let me do this they just thought I know we've got two questions here I mean we just hope that all right all right they've got permission so we talked about this was what we talked about earlier kosis trade offs of costs let me try another one which which is good yeah my shot at blocked chains and traditional databases so one is access control who has access to the ledger who acts access if I might to the data three different types of approaches we talked about open permissionless multiple permissioned and client-server I'm using the word client-server just to say traditional database you can use another words but I just try to say three different types of data structures and to Zhaan's question why would you be in one bucket versus another and I'm saying this if you're a venture capitalist one day and somebody comes into you with the blockchain you know solution this is the same thing hopefully you'll make it better this is just my approach to it public bought chain do you need basically public write capability that lots of people can write to these Ledger's do you need that somewhere secondly do you want some peer to here transaction capability across the distributed ledger do you kind of not want any central intermediary maybe you don't want the center under meteor because they're slow and sluggish maybe you don't want the center intermediary because they have a lot of economic rents it doesn't matter to me why you want to get rid of the central intermediary but if you want to get rid of a central intermediary or less in their control or lower their control raised peer-to-peer transactions have a lot of public writing oh and by the way if you want some token economics you're probably somewhere over here I'm not saying you have to have all four but to me those are the kind of three or four things that are floating around why you might be over there private blockchains well maybe you actually don't want public right capability you need private whether it's just the Australian stock exchange or fifteen to twenty Club deal you still want kind of multiple people to write but you want it to be private but if you still need finality of data in an append-only log that you need this appending the log and you need some public verify ability that you still need that data to be verified amongst and this public means fifteen or twenty players but you need it to be able to be verified so the trust mechanisms not thousands and open the trust mechanism is fifteen or twenty or five parties but you still need it you might be there where I come out is there's some cases that you just don't need any of this there's a trusted party that hosts the data your trust mechanism is one party the trusted party can do that I use the letter crud that's the create and and and update and delete and and so forth and that's based on client service architecture this client-server architecture there's always in that circumstance somebody right in the middle that basically owns updates governs that whole architecture my business judgment on this is if you've if you're moving things of value you want those things to value to have some final settlement and an immutability an immutability append-only logs give you some of that final settlement we talked very briefly about a lawsuit that was three hundred plus years ago the Crawford case in Scotland that that you won't have to remember it but this watch this so steal this from me just do me a favor just steal it okay right now I have a right of action but if you give it to who are you gonna give it to I don't have any rights against you no well wait it depends whether he knew you stole it from me but it's gone it's part of its finet that's final settlement those two dollars are gone that's that's final settlement it's immutable I can't get them back what Christopher you want their money I just use that as a visualization money is a social consensus and a social construct but if you think of it in terms of Ledger's look the money's gone I can't get it it's that's it you know that's good you all go to Sloane I can tell ya but it's an important concept I think I think of this whole that way so there were two questions and then we'll and then and then this is the decentralized end Bitcoin any theory amor kind of it the decentralized end I would contend bitcoins more decentralized ethereal and centralized databases initial coin offerings that we'll talk about later I think are actually maybe a little bit more central heist even than permission block James but well we'll get to that comments more about the supply chain like when you think about the millions and millions of dollars element of transparency that washing kind of brings him to all the parties probably saves money to what you're talking about kind of regularly so I sort of we're we're gonna talk about finance next Thursday and some of the strengths and weaknesses in finance and some of the attributes and you know one of the readings sheila bair and there's a bunch of optional readings about what's happened after the financial crisis and so forth and then we're gonna talk about the economics but I've had a few I've had three or four groups come in already talking about the final project so I'll just say think about whatever you're working on is this new technology blockchain whether it's permissioned or permissionless either one is this new technology really address some pain point that you're trying to solve whether it's about payment systems or actually there's a group that's talking about doing supply chain on wine and I figured why not I'll probably approve it but it's what is the pain point that you're actually trying to solve or will decentralize peer-to-peer networking somehow create a business opportunity and a new model it might not be a pain point it might be a business opportunity that decentralized systems solve or it might be an opportunity that token economics can help solve but if there's no pain point you're solving no token economics no decentralization peer-to-peer I ask you to use your critical reasoning and move to the next use case because this is really about this is a business class this is about finding places for this incredible set of new technologies in the context of markets and and to have a really healthy sense of ground truth about what's possible if not traditional databases move one I'm not looking for projects at the end of the semester that are using traditional databases it's got it lacked it's got to really use blockchain so I thank you I'll see you next Thursday you
