 [Music] hello everyone and welcome back to the next lecture of our blockchains course we've been discussing use cases in the financial services industry and today we are going to specifically look at two aspects of financial services compliance and mortgage like these are both very important aspects of financial services today and we'll look at how blockchain can make a difference to both of these use cases so financial services so one important aspect of it is compliance so today there is a process called kyc know your customer process so if you have ever opened a bank account or if you have got a postpaid connection with a telecom company you would have gone through this kyc process so what is this so this process is a regulatory requirement it's a mandatory requirement for many aspects of our of our daily industrial work so working with banks or working with telcos there are many places where kyc is applied and why do we have this so it's a regulated requirement to ensure that we have a good knowledge of every every organization is a good knowledge of its customers and it can help use that information to help prevent fraud or money laundering or things of those ones what does that know your customer it says what is the process the process really is about collecting personal information so this could be information about your identity so when were you born what is your address where do you live what do you where do you work maybe whether you're if you're a student you may be that those details of course age and all of those aspects and apart from that they might collect other aspects what is your financial standing for instance if you are opening a bank account and all all the process all these processes are or there are there are guidelines that the let's say the regulatory authority will provide to the banks and the banks have to come up with the process of collecting this information whenever they are opening an account and this process is slightly different based on the type of account you're opening if you're roping a savings account versus you're opening let's say a mutual funds account or you're opening a stock trading account all of these may have slightly or a credit card all of these have slightly different processes slightly different sets of information that they seek so for the past from the perspective of the bank all of this processing is purely they're doing this purely because the regulator requires them to do it do this and they incur a good amount of a high amount of cost going through this process right and for individuals more than individuals for corporates the process is much more stringent so as a corporate entity if I am going to open a bank account then the process I need to go through is much more stringent all right so for the banks all of this is just pure cost they are not going to get any revenue or no one's going to pay them money for going to through this process and in fact it's actually a bit worse because if they have a very stringent process they take too long to implement this then another bank that might have a very loose process and they have they they have a very streamlined process customers would go to the bank that has a more streamlined process that does not have so much paperwork to do right so the banks there's actually an incentive to not do as much for if not do as much in terms of kyc right so both if they do too much it's more cost for them and it's also customers are gonna run away right if you are too stringent if it takes you let's say one month to go through this process we will go to a bank that take that does it for you in two days right so it's also a way it's they might lose customers because of that so banks want to do just enough so that they pass the regulatory norms now that's from the bank side at a point of view what is it for our end customers like you and me today let's say when I go to SBI and open a bank account they asked me for let's say 10 documents identity address proof and all of those things I give all of that to them and SBI has gone through the KYC process all good at my bank account is opened tomorrow if I want to open a bank account with let's say HDFC HDFC will ask me for the same set of documents again after give them the same copies I have to go through the same process all over again so for me as an end customer it's a waste of time with a waste of effort and it's it's a laborious repeated process for me as well so everyone in this ecosystem has a problem here as an end customer I would like to just do this process once and if the banks can share this information then I am happy when I go to another bank in this consortium I don't have to repeat this process again hopefully right or maybe they only ask for the incremental information that they need maybe I have opened a savings account with SBI they have a bunch of information when I go and open let's say a credit card with HDFC they should be able to get the information there that I have already given to SBI and maybe they need just two other things from me for opening your credit card credit card code and they should just ask me for that extra information right so that way I can reduce the redundancy in the system that exists today and same thing for the banks for both SBI and HDFC if HDFC can get documents from SBI where their customers have gone to SBI first and YC versa if SB I can get documents from Asti HDFC whenever customers go to HDFC first then the ecosystem can share the information amongst themselves and can reduce the overall returns redundancy in a fish inefficiency that exists in today's world okay so that's that's the whole kyc process and once the KYC process is done there is a lot of processes that happen for AM L AM L is anti money laundering and again there's a whole lot of due diligence that is done for every transaction that you perform there is actually an anti money laundering set of processes that happen to make sure you are not doing something suspicious or or fraudulent this is what I mentioned here right so what are some of the pain points today know your customer process there is a lot of duplication for both the banks and for the end customers we would like to remove that and today basically it's a multiplicative factor right if I have if I have to open accounts with ten banks and each of them require 10 documents then I'm repeating this a hundred times over right so this is a multiplicative factor here and today the estimate is P Bank spend between somewhere between 60 million and 500 million annually in going through this kyc process and anywhere between five 100 documents and I said like I said it's it's lot more for corporate customers than for individual customers and this is all because of regulation we want to prevent fraud and a change lot of banks believe that a change in regulation or legislation is the most influential factor for their kyc process and these regulations and the policies keep changing almost on a monthly basis so the bank the regulator will say I want this addition like for instance we're all going through this other process today the regulator says you have to link your other with your bank account right that is debated still but let's say the regulator has said you have to link your other with your bank account then all the banks have to go through this process all the individuals have to go through this process and they have to make sure they're compliant and these regulations change on a daily basis so and there is a cost of non non compliance as well if the regulator finds that this particular bank is not following norms they will penalize them and sometimes that penalization can be in multiple millions of dollars right and there have been many such cases worldwide and a lot of the times people also believe that it's a distraction because even the individual information is changing regularly maybe I changed my address I changed my phone number the regulatory process requires that banks the onus is on the banks to make sure the records are up to date so if I change my address within three months the banks the onus is on the banks to make sure they updated addresses in there so all this becomes a distraction from them from their usual the regular banking business so that is also a problem so for instance over some of the numbers we have right here today - on board a new corporate client on average it takes about 24 days right that's a huge amount of money in today - to - the amount of time money in today's word and it's 22 pies the cost is 22% higher now than 12 months before so this cost is also growing with time and the banks are not getting any benefit for for this right they just being compliant so how can we address this with blotchy and this is again a big place a big differentiator that blockchain can bring in where we have a shared kyc solution so think of a consortium of banks that have come together they are all agreeing to share this information with each other so between let's say s bi an HDFC they have an agreement to come to a network together any customer that goes to s bi first and then Snohetta TFC HDFC can get the documents from s bi and if the other way is to if I go to HDFC first and then to SBI s bi can give the documents from HDFC and think of it all as a larger network maybe a group of 20 banks can come together agree to share now I have to do the work only once all 20 banks can benefit regardless of where I go and open my account next and it also helps in keeping the information up to date up to date let's say today I open an account with SBI I gave a set of information tomorrow I go to HDFC maybe not tomorrow maybe let's say after six months I go to HDFC when I could ahead City FC I give them updated information maybe a new phone number a new address when HDFC gets that new information they can share that back with SBI SBI does not have to reach out to me again to get that updated information so all that will result in savings and benefits and that way we can significantly reduce redundancy we can improve the efficiency of the overall process and we also improve standardization so all these banks now can follow the same process and this process can be wetted by the regulator because it's on blockchain it's all automated on blockchain the regulator can also see that yes this process follows the guidelines have specified today two more of the policy changes you can also modify the process to be adherent to be a to adhere to the policy and that can that can also be done so it also improves standardization it's not like 20 different banks who asked you for 20 different documents right when you bought they're all not going to follow the same process so that's also a significant benefit so again I went through some of these so the key participants in the network is of course the set of bank's customers could have identity on this network to say that these are these are my documents and we can have a notion of consent so let's say I have given my documents to SBI when I go to open my account with HDFC I can give them my digital consent a signed transaction on blockchain to say I am permitting HDFC to get the documents from SBI so that is a consent transaction that the customer might provide and only after consent is provided will the documents be will hedge TFC be permitted to view those documents so they talked about the banks and customers Garmin can be a regulator and auditor on this network they can have immediate oversight and there could be optional service providers on top so there could be third-party service providers who provide kyc as a service that is also possible so there are significant benefits that I have talked about so we can go from periodic monitoring to almost real-time monitoring so today it is a very odd hawk on how updates are made to my cave I see record unless I go and turn my bank my address has changed bank it's very hard for the bank to know and you will also notice if you have a a bank and net banking account whenever I saw after every three months or six months they might pop up a question saying are your details still the same right so those sorts of things can be avoided avoided if this information is getting shared and they can they can continuously monitor how information is changing so this going through this quickly what are some of the information that is getting shared of course there's a set of documents that are getting collected and apart from the documents there is a customer due diligence process and that process can also be standardized and shared across all the banks all the participating banks blockchain could store either the documents themselves or more ideally because this has personal information and you you probably want storge is the hash of those documents on on blockchain you can verify that hash saying when SBI shared those documents with HDFC HDFC can actually verify that these documents have not been tampered with because the hash is still the same what documents I got from SBI are really what were were put into the system three miles back right so you have that proof of authenticity of integrity of the data so what are the sets of some of the documents that are getting stored what are what's the some of the information that's getting stored in the network we have proof of identity and address and there could be other notions of identity that we are storing there like employment and so on what is there is also aggregated transaction behavior and this is part of the customer due diligence process that every bank actually implements today so based on how the pattern of transactions that I am performing they will compare that with some of my peers and say is that transaction pattern similar to what they would expect of one of my peers if the transaction pattern is is somehow deviant or anomalous from what other people are doing they might actually flag that off for manual verification and that might actually be a trigger for the tracking maybe money laundering or or fraudulent transactions and the other kind of information that's also getting stored is credit score so it's also possible for all of these banks to share information to to mutually agree on risk assessment so today risk assessment is being done in silos each bank or even within our bank had multiple lines of businesses let's say the the credit side of things whereas the the the personal account or savings account may not talk to the credit card account line of business of the back right they might not even be sharing risk assessment information so all of that can now be cumulate in some privacy-preserving manner we can bring that onto a blockchain platform and that can help credit scoring as well credit scoring and risk assessment for individuals and corporates so this is a high level model of how this might work so there is a client service provider think of it as a as a bank so this is let's say the first bank that on boards this client and there is a requester this might be a second bank that the client has gone to and there is a regulator that's that's overseeing all of this so there is a document shared model that is the inner circle so this is where documents are being shared by the entities in the ecosystem let's say a client first comes in so they are going to give a set of documents or submit a set of documents to a particular service provider they can also revoke access at some point maybe I'm closing my account with SBI and then I say SBI should no longer have access to my my records my customer records so that is given revoke access so the client now is in charge of the their own data the document that I have provided so we can bring that in so this is the customer consent so that's a consent model that's the outer circle now the service provider can request for access saying this client this particular client has come to my house has come to my bank and has requested to open this kind of an account maybe it's a credit card account and because of that credit card are called I have a request to see these these documents that the client has submitted and it's possible for you to anonymously share these documents across banks and then this then each service provider that the client goes to can get access to these documents likewise another third service provider can also come in and request these documents and then once a client provides consent the documents can be shared with the other service provider regulator at any point of time can come in and verify whether all of this sharing is being done in a regulated manner whether the due diligence is being performed when collecting these documents when sharing these documents with other banks so all of that regulatory oversight is then possible okay so with that now we've covered the KYC process itself so let's look at the next use case which is the mortgage process so this is again another major use case for financial services again there are many aspects of mortgage itself I'm going to give you just a high-level overview of what this is and and what are some of the benefits in in mortgage for bringing in blockchain to support mortgage processes today again the mortgage hole market system is extremely manual there are a lot of physical steps if you have opened or let's say if you've got bought a house down alone you will know I've bought one it probably takes you two months to to get a loan approved right and there are a lot of documents that they asked for a lot of regulatory processes that the banks internally go through before they are proven on and in today's world you probably also know that a lot of loan related fraud that has happened and lot of that is coming out in recent times and it's a lot of it is because in there are there are loss lawsuits wreck people the regulator's say the banks or whoever provided the loans have not followed due processes right a lot of that is because we are following very manual processes it's very inefficient today and very little very little a regulator can do because this it's so complex and and oversight on each and every loan that is being provided is very hard so some of these frauds surf is very late in the day also right after several years even so what are some of the mortgage processes so first to begin with there is a mortgage origination so this is where there are originators this might be employees of a bank could be other third-party service providers who work with homeowners or people who bought a home to generate mortgage loans so they will assess value of these homes so there'll be like appraisers there might be companies that will look into the title deeds to see whether this title is a valid title whether is or is it fraudulent are you the real owner of that house and so on and there is a lot of these checks and balances that are done in the mortgage origination and today like I said it could take anywhere between 30 and 90 days for you to even figure out whether a mortgage can be applied for this property so it's very time and paper intensive too much back and forth between multiple parties here between the lender which is a bank or a financial institution and the homeowner right and it could also be multiple multiple employees of the bank that have to communicate or multiple functions in the bank that are communicating with the with the homeowner again it's not at all streamlined there is no standardization and sometimes even the banks trouble and very last moment they'll say ok I need this document also you would have given them 10 other documents they wouldn't have told you that they needed this eleventh document also and then you'll have to ramanamma run around to get that 11th document so all those process problems exist today because of lack of standardization and streamlining of processes the second part of it once oK you've determined that okay this is okay to give a loan we've appraised the value of the the the home and you've if this out determined that this is how much low and I can give then there is a loan servicing part of it so the learn saw missing part is where the institution the serving institution or the financial institution that has lent the money is going to collect payments on the loan may be today it could be - that you pay monthly payments or it could be lump sum payments that you pay back so the many models that are there different countries for different models and it's also possible to renegotiate or renegotiate a loan and the loan interest rates also change with time right so all of those are part of loan servicing these are again very little standardization different banks follow different interest rates different processes of how you can initiate let's say Reno Gate renegotiation and so on different documents are required sometimes documents are misplaced they will the banks will ask for you that all the documents again they're almost always physically held right so today if you go to a mortgage section of a bank they will have stockpiles of paper of all the loans that they have trained and very disparate IT systems that are not really connected with each other there's a lot of issues with loan servicing them and this is even more of problematic I'll talk talked about that when multiple banks are involved in giving or not so we'll talk about that then the third part of it is Margit securitisation so what happens is a mortgage can also be sold to third parties there might be an initial lender let's say a bank that bank might soul might sell one mortgage or they might aggregate multiple mortgages together securitize it and sell that as a security that security might actually have hundred mortgages underneath and these are a large large faction of these at least in the u.s. they are sold to garment sponsored entities and there are again like some regulations here but one of these problems is I think if you go back to the 2008 financial crisis a lot of that happened because of market securitization and the problem lack of transparency there so what happened is mortgages were pooled together and the risk assessment they went through almost like multiple levels of securitisation so mortgages will be pulled into a security those will all be pulled together to another level and out of the level and so on by the time you go to the fourth or fifth level you have no visibility into the original mortgages themselves or the risk associated with those mortgages so there were a lot of these really bad mortgages that were created but at the fourth or fifth level they'll be packaged as a triple-a rated security and so on right so those sorts of problems arise because there's very little transparency across the board and multiple parties were also involved along the way so the whole 2008 financial crisis was attributed to that again multiple pain points there because of that so this is just an example origination process multiple parties that are involved a lender a buyer borrower and a seller so think of it as a I'm let's say I'm a buyer I'm going to buy it from another person who owns that property currently and there's a bank that's in what that might be third-party service providers who act as appraisers to see whether the value of the house whether the it could be associated with the housing authority because it might be one flat out of one apart in a larger complex in which case I have to validate whether the housing authority or the complex itself is a legal entity that land is okay and then I have to validate whether that flat is has has an edge different documents there are multiple aspects of it and then there is a note Lisa notary office registrar and so on that that you have to work with again a long process I'm not going to go into the details of the process itself so it's it's useful to think of this in two ways one has the exact existing origination process you can bring that on to a blockchain system and you can bring all of these parties onto a blockchain system and you can bring in automation in efficiencies but our more transformative way of looking at it would be to say I'm going to completely rethink the way this thing works because this is so paper oriented so manual in nature today I'm going to envision a completely new way of doing mortgage origination and that new process a set of financial institutions can can agree to bring that on board and the set of service providers together with let's say the land authority or notary office can all together come together to come up with a new process in which they're going to do mortgage origination and some of those conversations are happening today and that can significantly improve transparency can improve efficiency automation and so on and the bottom are some of the documents that are needed for force for this kind of origination process so our next level of complication these are more broadly not just mortgage which is tied to land and house housing syndicated loans so syndicate loans are loans where one organization or one entity is asking for a really large loan maybe for building their business and multiple it's beyond the risk that a single bank is willing to take so there might be a consortium of banks that come together sometimes upwards of ten banks come together to provide portions of the loan right and but so each bank might take on a different amount of risk so maybe the whole loan may be four thousand crores each new bank might take 100 roars and and agree to give hundred crores to thee to the borrower now again there is a huge process of how this works right so there could be multiple participating banks a borrower there could be an arranger or an agent that actually brings these banks together for this borrower there is there's a book runner who keeps tribe of who who has learned how much how much has been repaid and so on it could also be investment banks that could be a secondary market on this right so beyond just the primary market of providing the loans these banks might sell those loans to other investments right they could securitize it and sell it so that becomes a secondary market and set of investors then so there is a whole set of an ecosystem here of participants there are a set of benefits for each of these participants to actually come onto a blockchain network because it improves transparency for them they know how much has been much has been borrowed by this entity it's today what has happened is there might be one syndicate of banks providing a loan to a borrower borrower that syndicate might be completely unaware of another CENTAC 8 of financial institutions that have also provided loan to the same borrower right and that and that may means that their risk calculations were completely out of out of whack and that has led to a lot of these non-performing assets today in in in India especially and that's true for a lot of the developing countries as well again there are a lot of direct and indirect benefits that blockchain can bring about for syndicated loans so hopefully have automated why blockchain can can significantly change the landscape of how we do compliance and and mortgage today so if you have not seen if you if you don't know what the Cochran in your customer process is about I would encourage you to look up the Wikipedia article it gives you good set of details and this is a nice reddit article I think back in 2010 that talks about y kyc is mandatory now it's a very short article it just tells you why it's mandatory why it's useful for banks to this and again for syndicated loans is a nice Wikipedia article that tells you what syndicated loans are with that thank you and in the next session we'll look at some more aspects of financial services where blockchain can can play out differentiating wrote thank you [Music]
