 what happens when one of the world's largest tech giant's starts leveraging the power of watching we are talking about a company with over 350,000 employees and operations running in 177 different countries in 2018 alone this company registered seventy nine point five billion dollars of revenue IBM also known as Big Blue is using blockchain as a tool to disrupt business models across multiple industries from shipping companies to service providers to banks we met with IBM blockchain representatives at SCI Bose in London who told us how big blue is using blockchain to radically change how businesses store share and verify data what is putting data on the blockchain mean for businesses two things if it's in the blockchain if it's on a chain that means it a you can have trusted shared access so think about you as a supplier perhaps if you're a producer or supplier there's a supply chain there right now you have many steps along a supply chain with a consumer being at the end of that think if you have trusted shared access you don't have to make phone calls look at emails and check and see where something is in the supply chain you could all have access trusted access by just looking at it and then when you saw that data and you had access you'd know it was right a supply chain consists of all the processes for the creation and distribution of goods typically these processes consist of hundreds of stages happening at different times in different parts of the globe and involving multiple entities thanks to its transparency and immutability blockchain can keep track of all data involved in this process making it easily accessible for all parties involved in minimizing the costs interesting thing about about blockchain as we said you know it goes across industry goes across geographies you're gonna see a lot obviously based on some of what I said is a consumer you're gonna see in a financial services financial services were growing the first it took off you see it in Industrial anyplace where there's a lot of people processing paperwork so that's probably in most industries right so what we're seeing is more interesting is not which industry but which industries come together we think about one of them the production networks we're working on now project with the US FDA it's also tied to Merck it's also tied to Walmart as a retailer with IBM KPMG as an advisory I just went across multiple industries in one blockchain network in ancient times supply chains were relatively simple since commerce was only happening on a local level today in the era of global commerce and growing connectivity supply chains have grown increasingly complex that linear step has now become very dynamic almost three dimensional because a supplier can also be a buyer a buyer can could then be a shipper at all changes it's it's it's past what you have instead of this step step-step it's actually three dimensional and you have this value that's in a sphere that says look I could be today a buyer of goods and then tomorrow the data that I have around those Goods could bring value to the consumer knowing that it is in fact the good it's supposed to be I've consumed this much of it and here's how it's flowing through the supply chain so that thought of changing the value of data has now changed how the ecosystem is evolving one of the main sectors IBM is focusing on is the food industry IBM food Trust is using the blockchain to track food products from their original source all the way to the consumers thus ensuring the freshness and safety of those products think about the world's largest retailer even the world's largest grocer which is Walmart when it used to take them seven days to trake it trace and track something that could have a foodborne illness and of course food is guilty until proven proven innocent so they were throwing that food away for seven days they were able to shrink that time to two point two seconds I have to at that point two but two seconds two seconds on the blockchain so think of what that changes where you had the luxury of seven days but now it's only two seconds so if you can do that across multiple industry and shrink that timeframe and get information when you need it think so think of what business models that could open up the IBM blockchain platform is built on hyper ledger fabric an open-source blockchain network hosted by the Linux Foundation and designed to streamline business processes across multiple industries hyper ledger fabric is a permissioned blockchain which means all its components and members have precise identities and all transactions happen via validation checks this is what makes hyper ledger very different from traditional block chains which are usually focused on anonymity and rely on computing power to validate blocks we don't mind we don't spend extra energy but this require another technology that we put in place and another ways to protect from an honest participants like Byzantine photons algorithm so if you're not mining and there's no proof of work what does that do for the scalability of the network so the difference between mining scalability in the consensus algorithm we are using is actually certain consensus algorithms you can have much better throughput of transactions so can insert much more transactions and that's why permissions networks are much closer to transactional systems then the proof of work networks on the other hand the usual amount of participant there is not like in Bitcoin where you have thousands or tens of thousands you have much smaller scale you know let's say up to hundreds of participants and they will order the transactions but the work IBM is doing with blockchain goes beyond supply chain it expands to an identity management governance trading and Finance and of course cross-border payments that's what blockchain is delivering as a capability on the forefront then we think about all of the extra guess what else does the the you know depends on data IOT so the Internet of Things if you're trying to make sure that that device is that device and it's saying how something is going to apply it's using data as well ai also is using data automation using data all of these things are now being empowered this new catalyst of capability which is blockchain coin Telegraph like subscribe
