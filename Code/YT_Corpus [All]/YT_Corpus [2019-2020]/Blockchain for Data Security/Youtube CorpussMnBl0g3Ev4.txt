I had to look a little official so let's talk about a little bit about public policy and some of the challenges that we're gonna do and the overview of today we're gonna chat a bit a little bit about the readings of course and then I'm gonna set it up a bit on crypto finance just a simple term of this 200 or 250 billion dollar space because a lot of the public policies about crypto finance though there is some public policy about underlying blockchain technology it's it's both but most of it's about the the financial markets around crypto crypto currencies and crypto tokens give an overall public policy framework talk about the three guardrails the big rails of illicit activity financial stability and the public and then I'm going to I'm going to share a little bit of some slides and some thoughts on public policy development as many of you know I've spent the last 20 years kicking around politics in public policy and as two or three of you now in the spring Simon Johnson I stood up a course called public policy in the private sector so it's maybe my little advertisement for next spring because we're gonna stand it up again as well so this study questions which was basically around public policy as you remember remember these questions and I'm sorry because talita didn't give me my friendly list as to who hasn't spoken up yet you're saved you're saved because now I can't remember anybody that's not what's that yeah you can send to a printer you know it's hard to remember with 85 registered students as to who hasn't spoken and who has spoken but you're all going here now he's going to do it's cold calling now but the the the main study questions that were going through basically around the public policy frameworks and how it relates to blockchain technology but Catalina what did you take from the readings from the readings that for further adoption investor protection and confidence in the markets important Lauren did I see they do I was gonna say kind of I mean one of the readings was a little bit the opposite of this but to build on that like the mention of kind of regulations and kind of validating blockchain a little bit will help the players that are already in the markets exploring that space just because they tend to be a little more like risk-averse so they haven't really downloaded startups and things that kind of had the advantage so in essence that that some people are risk averse the incumbents are a bit risk-averse and why would incumbent big-big oh this is this is my fun last it's not your fun list but really there's still 35 of you that have not even spoken up in this class don't be so shy watch this watch this area of britto not even here even better even better talita we have a sign-up sheet - it's going around yeah that's fun watch I'll just say David and then see which David speaks up this is gonna be really interesting so you mean there's no David Martin here so to your first question one sits in some ways and absent like it's not Regulatory Authority as the SEC does in a gap but the second thing is even if those gaps were closed the for certain kinds of watching technology the anonymity and secrecy of it just prevents regulation almost entirely so there's sort of two things there's a gap question and then there's the impact supersede there's a gap that's because of the technology but are there other or there gaps also so with James is raising is is there might be a whole change in this sort of ecosystem a little bit of the business model that there's fewer intermediaries and a lot of regulation whether that be tax or investor protection or even around illicit activity centers around intermediaries why do you think it is that so much of the law centers around intermediaries it wasn't specific in the readings but just why why do you think that that's so Isabel is raising a point that maybe intermediaries would be threatened about this technology but I'm also asking why do you think the law historically a dn.y the law has attached requirements on intermediary and saying in the red jersey in the back I can't remember your name dad then you bring down a lot more than just that so - two ideas one is this is an attachment point that has sort of some leverage to it in the system you can you can exert some public policy influence and one is that there might be a point of failure and you need to protect the system from failure other reasons back here is it Jake's raising sort of a variation of the force multiplying it's not only a node to apply but they have the resources so you're you're tapping into JP morgue back office so to speak and back here I'll take I'm sorry your first name meteor is also there are mechanism for trust to allow trading between parties so the regulation then would be in place and serve like a consumer protection role to ensure that those those intermediary intermediaries are someone to trust so it's it's for a collection of reasons that the public policy officials around the globe often attach requirements to intermediaries because it's a node to get it done it's a resource they have deep pockets sometimes sometimes it's because they might fail and one thing that wasn't mentioned is sometimes actually institutions want to be regulated over time because it creates barriers to entry it's usually not in an early stage but later on it's actually the incumbents that often it creates some barriers to entry and they collect some economic rents Hugo like the American institutions that started their exchange early on and now they're working with regulators to see how they can kind of after the market so easy place to go so what were the letters you said OD like og og stand for something original gangster thank you thank you my daughters will be glad I know this now that's very good so it's moving from the disrupter phase to the near incumbent phase and where is some affirm Hugo's raised like coinbase or others or are they now the incumbent in this only six or ten year old field you know in essence we're gonna talk a lot about tax and bank secrecy and the Howey test and I'm gonna I'm gonna save you from the cold calls on the Howey test yet but wait but be prepared when we get to that slide we'll talk a little bit more and then of course my favorite the duck test does anybody know who American poet oh really good where is he from couldn't anybody know where Riley's from no it's not in that I don't think it's in the visit in the testimony yeah you're right seems like a good Midwestern saying you know damn duck there you go there you go no no Christopher is raising the question if it's a robotic dock a robotic duck that's walking like a duck quacking like a duck and waddling like a duck is it a Dorn duck for purposes of public policy maybe it is right if it's a smart contract that's waddling like a duck and talk quacking like a dock maybe it still has the influence over society like a duck and and this duck test I didn't originate it it Reilly did a hundred plus years ago but it is something that regulators and public policy people actually talk about it's like just one of those things if you're in Washington well other people might call it different things but the duck test it's like use common sense and then sort of answer the question oh my gosh I assigned one of my own writings as a reading so we'll skip over that so crypto the world of crypto finance you've seen this slide before but it's been quite volatile about 220 billion in the last few days and a little over 50% 54% is Bitcoin and the other big big currencies right now on market value a theory I'm ripple and the like we'll talk a lot about initial coin offerings and are these securities are they not I would note in terms of market value probably 3/4 of this space has already been determined by the Securities and Exchange Commission not to be a security bitcoins 54% ethers about I don't know 15 points or something like that so you're all this sudden up to about 70 points and then there's a bunch of other things that add up so about three-quarters of the market value right now is what one might call a cash cop or a commodity but not a security in this world and and that's just relevant for some of the debates that go in we talked about this a little bit like the lioness tin the corner incumbents are starting to I crypto finance so it's raising some of the the challenges why are they interested in this why are incumbents interested in in in getting into this place eg wank oh come on I can't be this bad off am I really all these people haven't even said a word huh is Yugi here now look at this this is even easier now I'll find out if somebody's signing in for other people how about Nikita yeah that's it why do you think incumbents want to get in difficult you said it's difficult to do for you yeah but why did they want to get into this space why do they want to be in crypto finance part of it that is that it's Holly any volatile and make money or jail for volatility and then there's also a lot of people think it's like 20 million coinbase right so when I was at Goldman Sachs for years we used to have a saying volatility as our friend it's often not the front of many people in the markets but if you're in the world of finance you're in the world of intermediating risk and holding risks of volatility is a form of risk so volatility was always their friend there's also our friend cuz often if it was really volatile sometimes some of our competitors would not manage that risk as well and they would lose market share and we would gain market share or in fact maybe they went out of business too but people like the volatility startups can beg for forgiveness afterwards incumbents feel more often not always that they need to ask for permission and so there's a little bit of an asymmetric reputational risk that goes on business-wise now once you're at a big incumbent if you work for one of the big places you'll you'll feel that more a little bit more constraint a little bit more compliance officers you're more lawyer do you have more accountants but you should still have the same values I say this sincerely don't break the law no no sincerely but when you're at a start-up you tend there's always some ambiguity and you take a little bit more reputational risk you tend to so there's a bunch of incumbents that are trying to get in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange your ax IntercontinentalExchange which owns the New York Stock Exchange will do a whole class on on what they're doing there later in the semester fidelity that's spending significant amount of money looking at it and others so the the framework that we've talked about about guarding against illicit activity stability and the investing public I'm going to sort through each of these but it's tax compliance no government wants to shrink their tax base now some governments want to attract activity that shrinks the other whereas diction's tax base but it's not about shrinking your own tax base usually I mean you might bylaw lower taxes but you're not really looking to generally government's don't want to promote whatever the definition of illicit activity we don't need to define that in this class it's a normative thing that happens culture by culture jurisdiction by jurisdiction but there's tends to be something that's prohibited drug-running for instance child trafficking I mean there are certainly things that are broadly defined as illicit and then there's some you know that the the changes depending upon the culture and the society and the times we're living in a terrorism financing clearly and then sanctions it's a toll of foreign policy the countries like around but Europe and elsewhere often use sanctions to try to it's it's centuries-old it's called blockades in an earlier century you know with the ships but now we do it more electronically and commercially financial stability tends to be about the stability of the overall economy or the fiat currency or I put a little second picture there the stability of the commercial banking system so financial stability can mean a lot of different things but it's usually about the currency the economy or the central bank system and commercial bank system but to some countries not not a majority some countries financial stability is about capital controls if a country is controlling somewhere the valuation of their fiat currency remember we talked a lot about money but if some don't want to flood and they want to control the value of their fiat currency then they often have capital controls and for those countries this whole world of crypto finance sort of touches on that and then the investing public the consuming public will talk about investor protection and consumer protection or not exactly this the two words market integrity means basically we promote economic activity if you can have confidence in central market structures whether that's the pricing of apples or the pricing of Apple stock it's in essence that there's not fraud and manipulation in that market and the more transparent the prices are both before you do a transaction and after what's called pre trade transparency and post-trade transparency the more transparent and the more you can root out manipulation and fraud there's more integrity it usually very simply and this is a lot of economic study goes into it you lower the risk premium in that market in essence you could have more confidence in that market and secondly you have more competition in the price discovery function aleem silly question but you said free transaction transparency how does that relate to like the United States when you go to the doctor you have no idea how much we're going to pay it seems like there's no pre transaction I tend to agree with you that there are many markets not just healthcare but there are many markets where there's limited pre transaction transparency I feel there's only limited pre transaction transparency when I take my car into the to get work done now of course then then they give you some pricing and you're the the core is already up on the on you know platform and they're telling you you need your new brakes so yes that's true it's of different markets operate and in different ways and healthcare is probably less transparent partly because it's such a hybrid market where we have third-party payment providers insurance companies and governments providing and paying for a lot of our health care so a economic activity has a range in the financial markets market integrity is boosted by a lot of pre trans free trade trans Barun see does that help a little so Mark Carney what was the what did you all take from Mark Carney's paper anybody wants to volunteer I can keep going down my last break him did I get your nut name right what's it rehab so one thing that Mark Carney said is he didn't really consider crypto currencies currencies but they were an asset what else did Mark say I didn't think that volatility should equate to all right so math racing that Mark Carney says well volatility it can't have can't be a currency I tend to agree with Matt and if Mark were here I'd say it to him directly I mean even some fiat currencies that have been pretty volatile so I think that it does have intrinsic value but maybe not necessarily be a currency so I agree it's different reasons it has intrinsic value value I just think that it should be called digital asset and your first name you know Kyle so Kyle saying that it's because it's not a dependable unit of account and very few places have used it as a unit of account at this point in time that's gonna it's good we can have a debate here should make it so that it is a currency it has been used as a currency in the past and whether five people use it or a million people use it shouldn't the fact that it can be used fall by it to be a currency whether it's to a certain people necessarily so who wants to arbitrate between Matt and Kyle Leonardo yeah conscious where there is super high inflation where their domestic currencies you lose what is really worth so people actually automatically start to use dollar for example as their reference account so it can be functional functional in the sense that people can still exchange but you can't really measure until you thank you something else and I think it going spanked the value of something else today so it depends in if it's in a country with hyperinflation and I don't I hope not have have any of you lived in a country with hyperinflation in your lifetimes so five or six of you have so you you know what it is like when you go in for into a restaurant there's one set of pricing but if you eat for too long and linger at the table it's different level of pricing literally right but from the view from the top with mark one quote from the paper that I took was that Authority's thinking about this is from a public policy perspective authorities need to decide are you gonna isolate this world regulate it integrated now some countries I don't think anybody's fully isolated it but some countries in a sense have said let's be in a lot of this activity and and Kelly Kelly's question is so to what extent to comments from a Mark Carney who's the governor of the Bank of England but heads the Financial Stability Board how much does that influence the the rest of the official sector community and it's a great question I think that it all goes into the mix I think that there's probably in any public policy sphere sixth dozen countries that really take the the lead not legally they're not taking the lead legally they're just taking the lead because others follow that which is said in the US the European Union China Japan I mean we sort of know the the usual and the normal countries but part of it is because the the the depth and breadth of their economies part of it in this world the their depth of breadth of their financial markets but it's also because often their opinion leaders and their opinions are somewhat respected but we have a hundred and eighty or 190 countries and each one of them has a different culture and each has a different political system and a different history and different economic well-being so I went into the international arena doing regulation thinking it would it is it's sort of a dystopian view that there's gonna be one worldwide regime for almost any public policy issue it's quite I mean I don't know if it exists in almost any place but when you get to financial services it's pretty unlikely because of all those different cultures and histories and political systems and economies clashing up against each other yes and likely change a few money so the question is China so how many in the room think China would be in the isolate dominantly in the isolate category rather than the integrate category so a quarter or a third it's interesting it's really a hybrid China came pretty strongly saying no to a lot of activity and yet two of the biggest mining poles for Bitcoin are in China some of the crypto exchanges left China but those miners are the biggest sellers of Bitcoin because they're collecting the Bitcoin and need to sell them have to find some crypto exchange somewhere that is no longer in China I'm gonna mispronounce the name of the exchange but if you buy hu o be I still very much a Chinese crypto exchange I think is now registered in Malta if I'm not mistaken maybe so there's a love/hate hi-bred the central bank of China has very active projects with regard to blockchain technology and they have a whole Lab that in its public or that which is public is public that which is private probably is bigger and we just don't know about it so there's a bit of a mixed approach even in China if that answers your question so let me just go this is I've spent a lot of time in the last six months traveling around the globe and speaking at different conferences oacd and then Japan and here in the US what what I see guarding against illicit activity broad consensus 180 hundred ninety countries yeah we've got to do it really choppy performance on implementation and and sometimes a little bit of a head fake from one jurisdiction to another because some actually are fine with tax evasion as long as it's a tax evasion and the other person's jurisdiction usually low population centers were more comfortable promoting being tax havens trying to take economic activity from elsewhere but but there's general broad consensus and it's usually centered on finance ministries and central bank authorities and the equivalent of law enforcement our Justice Department think of those that's where the nexus is happening country by country financial stability general consensus to monitor there's not like a deep worry right now because the space is only a quarter of a trillion dollars and the worldwide capital markets the the worldwide debt markets are 250 trillion nearly 1,000 times bigger and the world what equity markets are about 90 trillion and even the worldwide stock a gold at 7 trillion is nearly 30 times as large it just gives you a sense of the relationship right now why let's monitor but it's probably not systemic destabilizing however there's different perspectives particularly in countries that have capital controls because it could be destabilizing to a currency in that way and then thirdly the investing public protecting invest in public I would say the views are wide ranging in the US and Canada more forward-leaning more yeah a lot of this stuff maybe these initial coin offerings or securities they need to be have protected and in a bunch of other countries it's like let a thousand flowers bloom let's promote innovation and so forth and it's a pretty wide view my personal view is and I've said this at some conferences if they if this grew from a quarter of a quarter of a trillion to five and ten and twenty times the size or if the ico marketplace which is raised about twenty to twenty five billion today kept raising that but went to like a hundred billion a year of raise then a bunch of countries would probably want more investor protection I think I think this is just my personal view we will never have uniform jurisdiction at uniform laws but part of what's going on is this is so new and it's still relatively small versus the capital markets if it grew I think more people more countries would want some protection a question regarding the illicit activities and financial stability as he traveled to other country is what metrics were they using so the question is what our country is doing to measure for success I'm going to use one example and then we'll keep going into the details Japan had some of the earliest crypto exchanges mount GOx geo x mount GOx was an early exchange that the promoters the owners moved to tokyo even though they weren't Japanese nationals so it was it was centered in in Tokyo and it went down went about a half a billion dollars of value was lost it was supposedly a hack stolen crypto is interesting case it was actually being stolen over many months it wasn't one specific hack so Japan and 2017 finally got around and changed their laws and and they put in a whole regime to regulate crypto exchanges particularly around this customer protection custody issue and around illicit activity and they actually have gone in and asked exchanges to register they go in and actually do examinations and earlier this year of the I think 30-some registered exchanges five or ten had to cease operations how do they measure success or failure another exchange in January this year lost another half a billion dollars to a hack there principal executive their Prime Minister got a question in a news conference if you're a regulator that's not a good thing so sometimes you you measure success or failure as to whether your boss gets a question in a news conference about you know why it's not working the Japanese have been terrific by the way in terms of what they're doing but I'm just using that as an example of like sometimes so let me just chat about and deep dive into each of these and you know probably five or ten minutes each which you could do a whole course on each of these but let me just kind of deep dive a little bit guarding against illicit activity so tax compliance and reporting what do you think the first big question that the US government or any government this sounds us-centric and Kelly I thank you for your paper because Kelly is all right if I call you out wrote a paper for today which I happen to read earlier today and said Gensler work was to us-centric I thought it was gutsy I thought was gutsy but you're right it was us-centric I was speaking to the US Congress so I sort of that was this thing you learn in politics too you try to gauge your audience but you were right but what do you think the first thing whether it's the US government or any governments got to figure out in terms of this world came along in 2010 2011 2012 what was that first question which you may have teased out of the readings but as a policy question anybody want to take a guess how do you treat it for tax purposes how do you treat Bitcoin at the time for tax purposes and so that central question was the first thing that really came up is it a currency is it a form of property is it something else what did the US government say back in and I think was 2013 but it would it would it be in the testimony what is it is it a currency or property problem property thanks for paying when you're trading that's right so the result of that is you want to say it again you have to basically every time you exchange to another currency or you spend it it's you have to record the cost basis and yeah if you do any sort of my tactic terms like six interface so anytime it changes at all you can't sort of consolidate I think it's like with stocks you can consolidate if it's the same security being traded over the year you can consolidate to show you're sort of beginning in a date and just pay tax on the Delta but you have to report every single training so so these types of questions were not known in 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto wrote his paper but ten years later is it currency is it property some jurisdictions around the globe very few but some have said it's currency but almost dominantly around the globe it's some form of property and then within the laws triggers like it does in the US capital gains and so forth like that the next quest of questions was what's the tax treatment of mining exchanges and forks anybody want to tell me what what what if you if your mining and you receive Bitcoin or any other crypto ether and so forth anybody want to take a guess it's not a guess I think it was even in the testimony I oh you have 600 pages you're saying you had to pay taxes on both sides of the fork yep so that's that's rougher than a stock split a stock split you just carryover basis how about Bitcoin mining is anybody's on you want to take Don's right it's income you're mine you get income so each of these sort of had to be addressed in the tax the next thing is something called the bag secrecy act anybody want to tell me what the Bank Secrecy Act is is it Nikolas just to see I can read your name there I see how that worked [Music] Bank Secrecy Act was passed a few decades ago so probably before most of us in this room know after I was born but most of you were born anybody want to say what the Bank Secrecy Act is Daniel correct correct it's really trying to protect against secret transactions or what's often called money laundering and behind the money laundering laws is knowing who the customers of a bank so you'll hear these letters kyc know you are a customer AML anti money laundering and the Bank Secrecy Act underneath it then has reporting obligations that anyone who has to report under the Bank Secrecy Act has to report when there's large transactions if you go into the bank and you ask them can you please I I want to take a withdraw of eleven thousand dollars of US currency they have to fill out a report because it's I believe it's the triggers ten thousand dollars if you walk in and you get five hundred dollars no report but there's various suspicious activity reporting and other Lords transaction reporting that gets triggered in the US Bank Secrecy Act but you will hear over and over again even if you never invest or work in a blockchain company you will hear something called kyc and AML and it's these two regimes that kind of work they're not the best but they they do their job to give the official sector in the banking sector a sense of who owns the accounts and when there's suspicious activity that there's a reporting obligation in to the authorities is asking how does everything fit in sad as money transmission laws money transmission laws are the laws that sort of were just mentioned by Daniel Lee any money laundering CTF is counterterrorism finance I mean Washington is a world full of these letters and jargon and everything so how does it fit in it first is one of the things in the in the US Department of Treasury but again to internationalize and other departments of Treasury's and so forth around the globe to find when do you come under the similar laws when are you just a user of this property because it's not a currency but to confuse matters the US Department of Treasury said it was a virtual currency a virtual currency which happens to be property for tax law this is two parts of the same Department the US Department of Treasury said it's property not currency another part of the US Treasury said it's virtual currency and the reason they had to say was kind of virtual currency as they wanted it to come under this law the Bank Secrecy Act without going to Congress to have it be amended the question well wait crypto is getting a bad rap for money laundering what about everything else and I say yes with hugo's reminding us of as criminals don't change just the technologies they use do change but they're still using bags of cash in some jurisdictions and there's still suitcases and cash drops around the globe I'm told that there's even now some trafficking between crypto and physical cash where the courier's can be paid a certain percentage to take suitcases of cash from let's say drug runners on the one hand and exchange them a thumb drive or a private key with Bitcoin on the other so it's just a you know new means and methods sorry I would say that the belt that that Bank was charged was probably a small portion of it whereas there's probably a higher proportion potentially of cryptocurrency so Christopher's saying maybe there's a higher percentage of crypto that's being used for illicit than the percent of Fiat that may well be correct because the world's stock of fiat is measured in the tens of trillions but that may be but it's still something that concerns because if if like like water wants to find the the lowest level and we'll drain you know at wherever the leak is illicit activity will kind of flow to wherever the lowest level so the challenges the key challenges you all have raised many of these so I'm not going to ask questions but the pseudonym ms addresses that is a real challenge for law enforcement around the globe privacy coins like what we talked about Z cash and Manero and so forth that have a cryptographic method to make it harder to track and then compliance and reporting there just isn't a lot of come even well-meaning people don't often comply and put in the 600 pages the US government thanks you you know your what's that your wedding for your audit to come I would say the other the other challenges are also these are the things that the regulators and law enforcement talk about crypto to crypto transactions are a little bit more challenging than crypto to Fiat does anybody want to Zahn why it seems to me that from a regulator perspective it's it's fairly easy to regulate and monitor the on ramps and off ramps right so when you're dealing with financial intermediaries you essentially bringing Fiat into crypto and you can monitor it's coming out but what happens within the ecosystem especially when you bring in Manero and some of these privacy coins regulators have no idea so it's really hard so the this term on ramps and off ramps a lot I've heard a lot not just from Zahn but that's how law enforcement thinks about it because they're regulating the intermediary caught bags back to the discussion we had about 30 minutes ago regulated intermediaries give the official sector a node to influence behavior they have the banks the JP Morgan's and the small community bags in the system of Bank Secrecy Act compliance and even though some are doing sloppy work as Hugo pointed out they're in the system and so crypto to crypto is harder for the official sector because they don't need any commercial bank or a sense crypto to crypto is easier for somebody that wants to stay off the tax base because there's not the same reporting so it depends on which side of the lens you're on as well decentralized exchanges we're going to talk about in about five or six classes but trust me they're harder for the official sector decentralized exchanges or basically think of an algorithm that is decentralized no central intermediary but through an algorithm yuan and I could trade Bitcoin versus ether or ether versus Bitcoin and that this decentralized exchange allows it to happen most of them right now are between two tokens that are on aetherium so aetherium token to atheria and token to two ico tokens but but they they're a real challenge and we'll get to them later anybody know what a dork market is I'm not going to ask anybody's used a dark market I don't worry does anybody know Silk Road it is it is Silk Road but what's Silk Road so it's a it's basically a website where you can buy and sell illegal things not just drugs but primarily drugs and the the payments were generally in Bitcoin even though some have moved one from Bitcoin now and the technology they were using to was was a torch teo our tour which is a way that you could do communications on the web and not be tracked I mean broadly speaking so that was Silk Road and dark markets exist again before Bitcoin dork marketers exist they might have been called black markets so they have a new name there are new technology and then state actors and and no one should doubt that state actors are always in some competition with each other and even if we're not a hot war sometimes you're in in other types of competition and so state actors are also using and not just like the the mauler investigation saw that that they allege that Russians were using Bitcoin to mess in our elections but in a more broad sense state actors could play in this space I just thought this chart was interesting I found it on a website die or did a report but this is US agency contracts for blockchain analysis there's there's companies out there that will go in and do the forensics analysis and here's the highest agencies these numbers aren't terribly relevant that it's two million dollars or a million and a half but it's interesting it's the IRS it's the customs FBI and fiscal services and the Drug Enforcement Agency that's the parts of the US that have publicly done requests for contracts and so this outside service could track it but it just gives a flavor for who's chasing after Bitcoin usage in the u.s. it's wonderful transparency that's illicit activity let me move on to financial stability because we're gonna run out of time financial stability the initial assessment of the Financial Stability Board it's not big enough yet I would say though again capital control companies are worried about maintaining stability that's if it could undermine your currency value in essence a capital control company country where China has some capital controls for instance you can't get a lot of the currency out but if you can go remember to Bitcoin Bitcoin to dollar that it's basically a bridge currency to avoid capital controls and one of the things I understand the Bank of China is focused on is that with the big miners in China that in essence the mining operations are a way to get around capital controls it's a way to change remmember into electricity electricity into Bitcoin Bitcoin into dollars or Euros so it's but it may also be why some local officials in China apparently are allowing the mining to continue and while they you know I don't have any documented proof it's why some people think that there's probably some arrangements with these local officials I mentioned three other areas in the testimony that I think are on the horizon that are worth thinking about crypto leverage a lot of the crypto exchanges provide a lot of leverage you can buy Bitcoin in some cases a hundred to one levered most or not at a hundred and one but almost all or at least ten to one says our trader right so Lev Brij often is where you can get more acceleration of a crisis if it's already happening a more systemic risk this still is a rather small market but the leverage is probably something could propagate any crisis if it were to happen the market infrastructure itself like Australia is using blockchain technology to do their clearing and settlement of stocks they haven't adopted it yet but they're rolling it out next year and into 2020 so just making sure the infrastructure works and then central bank digital currencies so we're gonna do two lectures on central bank digital currencies and I probably should just skip this slide but here are some of the concerns around central bank digital currencies they could be procyclical a central bank digital currency means the central bank says Joe Quinn does not have to deposit at a bank to have US Dollars he can deposit straight with the Federal Reserve we're in Sweden that's close enough to do it you can deposit straight with the Swedish central bank we'll talk about this more in a couple of weeks but that could lead to runs away from commercial banks to central banks you know especially a if you use Bitcoin supplied Sean so Sean I agree with Sean can you hold that for about two weeks when we're gonna go deep we're gonna do a deep dive on all of these but basically Sean's point is if a central bank issues currency directly to the public digitally could it also undermine monetary policy and there's a bunch of neat sort of trade-offs there I leave it for you just to say we're gonna come back to that the investing public so we've talked about that the markets are readily susceptible to fraud manipulation and we're gonna spend a couple of lectures on crypto exchanges but they're not regulated for market integrity so a simple thing like remember your first name here's Michael Michael has trades and I'm assuming some of those are on crypto exchanges alright so when Michael puts an order on a crypto exchange there's currently no rules in the rule books no law in the law that says that exchange can't front-run Michael so Michael says he wants to buy Bitcoin at 64 hundred dollars and the crypto exchange could buy some in front of him it's sixty four ninety or sixty three ninety sixty three nine yeah sorry that's called front-running so there are many many ways to make money on Michaels order that can just be kind of goofed around Kyle is that a question or I like front-running and criminal activity in a particular so Kyle is raising well what what maybe if it's not covered by investor protection laws might it be covered by other laws you mentioned FINRA FINRA which is the self-regulatory organization in the US for investments would be investment law but Kyle you're right certain things are still against consumer laws I don't think front-running is one of them but you might be right about that I would contend advocate that that Western societies early on in many developing countries in Asia elsewhere benefited by layering investor protection over consumer protection the consumer protection is about transacting in the fraud that can happen in a transaction selling an automobile selling a baby's crib and so forth selling a bottle of milk investor protection off so layers want something else which has to do with issuers having information asymmetries that the issuer knows something the person raising money and the purchaser does not know that information there's a lot of information asymmetries that you're trying to address in in the market and then secondly around exchanges the concepts of pre trade transparency post-trade transparency trying to bring transparency and saying we're gonna promote economic activity so in the u.s. there were two laws passed in 1933 and 34 the exchange act and and I have to remember the Securities Act and Exchange Act but one was prefer issuers which was the first one and the second was for exchanges in 33 and 34 and I think those are the key things let me just mention the key question the definition that we will be wrestling with for the next several weeks is when is something as security when is it a commodity when is it a derivative we don't have to answer these today but those will be like is it a security is it a commodity is it a derivative not only are there different laws for each but there's sort of different public policies and different normative behavior that's implicated securities are when there's an issuer and fundamentally just from a public policy point of view there's an information asymmetry that person raising money knows more information than the person investing they probably always will so you get to what's the fair exchange of information I'm gonna I'm gonna skip a couple things and just say why investor protection - Kyle's question it goes beyond and here are the four what what are the Gary Gensler four bullet points this you will not see in a textbook so but these are the key things I think investor protection layers on top of consumer protection what investors get full and fair disclosure you can debate what full and fair disclosure is but it's something more than I'm selling you this court in a milk fraud and deceptive practices are prohibited now fraud is supposedly prohibited even when you buy a carton of milk but there's some added bits to it and then this thing I said about the secondary markets promoting price transparency and then lastly one that I hadn't talked about that the advisors usually have a lot of conflicts in the financial markets there's almost always in most countries some additional responsibilities around the advisors whether it's what's called a fiduciary responsibility or some other responsibilities sometimes it's just a best efforts but there's usually some additional responsibilities on advisors and those four bullet points I don't mean to teach a whole securities law quest course in three minutes or less but those are kind of how I quite summarize it Tom from insurers Thank You issuer's yes sorry Emily between investor and consumer protection versus say like tax enforcement and that I could imagine that if if there was increased protection it would incentivize more investment which then could without prior like tax coverage make it so that like that word tax or hacks ta X their protection would encourage more investment but then more people potentially would be evading taxes if there wasn't already that tap framework in place so Emilee area so the question is how does any society in a sense make some trade-offs between tax and investor protection regimes and it's all ultimately if I can stake it one but step back that's what some countries are doing now but they've been doing it for a couple centuries how do you promote innovation that might promote economic activity so I'm broadening your question how do you promote economic activity well in the mid still sort of promoting whatever social goods you're trying to achieve in some regulatory framework investor protection so I made it the broadest because that's what you'll hear often around blockchain and Bitcoin but it was true when the railroads came along it was true more recently when the internet came along how to promote this new technology of the Internet while actually still promoting broadly the social goods that we're trying to achieve I'm one of the in the camp that says protecting against illicit activity financial stability of investor protection do in and of themselves promote society and economic well-being I don't think this is Gary Gensler I don't think they're necessarily in conflict there are others who say no no no no you can't promote economic activity or taxes and also promote investor protection I believe that's more short-sighted I think though regimes and reforms of the 1930s in this country and other decades in other countries or part of why we have had such a prosperous last seven years that investor protection actually lowers the risk to issuers thank you for correcting issuers it lowers the risk of issuers and lowers the cost of capital if you have good investor protection I believe ultimately it lowers the cost of capital which is what I said in those two bullet points so US securities law did anybody want to tell me what the how he test was what's what are those arches right there Oh what let's we'll take somebody no first name as far as I remember securities and right after that define something so citrus groves in Florida somehow our securities absolutely right man named William Howie he ran for governor actually in Florida a couple times and lost but he had a real estate venture and he had those arches by his real estate venture and he figured he could sell part of his land as citrus groves so the question was was when he was selling that land could that be actually technically an investment contract because in 1933 the Congress of the United States included in the definition of security these two words investment contract you know it said equity stock options it kept having a bunch of commas there was a comma investment contract comma and it kept going so the real legal question what's the Supreme Court was not whether bill Howie's citrus groves were securities it was whether Bill Howard's he's citrus groves were investment contracts because Congress had already decided by putting the two words and a couple of commas that it was a security and that separates us from the European Union and many other jurisdictions because Congress put those two words in their investment contracts which had to do with a lot of scams and frauds from the 1890s to the 1920s and to meet the investment contract test is this four-part test is it an investment of money or assets basically the SEC has said that if you're giving ether or you're giving Bitcoin to buy ether or you're getting bitcoin to buy some Amanda token so right that that's an investment of money or assets that's what the SEC said and most lawyers kind of agree with that is it an investment in a common enterprise so is there a group of developers that is like a common enterprise some people debate that some people say well we weren't really it's an open source if you're an open source software that's not going to be enough to get away from being a common enterprise is there a reasonable expectation of profits most people think of profits coming from dividends or or or interest on your bond the SEC has said and there's relevant court cases that say profits could be just the expectation of the appreciation of the asset so I buy a token today for six ether and tomorrow I think it might be worth 10 e that's a reasonable expectation of profits and is it the air the efforts of others is it is it reliant on the efforts of other this four-part test J Clayton the head of the SEC said earlier this year in essence he hadn't met an IC o---- that he didn't think was a security his words were a little bit cleaner than that but it was basically saying this initial coin offering market is probably mostly securities again it's probably less than a quarter of the whole crypto finance market it's a very relevant issue if any of you are trying to do a start-up but I would contend it's not the largest public policy issue but borders and boundaries make a difference the duck test this is basically how I think about it Christopher say it again so if you have a public policy question like do I have to file under the Bank Secrecy Act do I have to be a security do I have to be that and before you pay that law firm a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars an hour and there are many lawyers that I guess are worth that you ask yourself this question and I'm trying to impart a value judgment to all of you to not only to save you legal fees but there are many lawyers who are gonna try to help you solve your problems but when you feel like they're just trying to get between the wallpaper and the wall with the narrowness and the thinness of the slice of their legal judgment remember how Christopher just gave us the duck test and then step away and say well maybe there's another business solution to what you're trying to do because if it doesn't pass the duck test at some point in time you're probably going to have your friends from the IRS or your friends from the Justice Department or the friends from the SEC knocking on your door and those are the friends you usually don't want to have knocking on your door there's still two to three hundred icos a month I just wanted to say that the market has not gone away and the initial coin offering market which we're going to talk about in a couple weeks has all these attributes of the Howey test they're raising proceeds and they're usually trying to be functional I want to skip ahead a little bit to something on public policy and we're gonna do crypto exchanges so I apologize I'm running title in time but I want to do something that Lauren and Tom have seen well let me suppose here this is regulatory arbitrage and Kelly given your paper you'll like this but this is the list of where cryptocurrency exchanges were is from a Morgan Stanley research paper earlier this year but if you can see the little slices on the Left that's Malta Bailey's and Seychelles three really deep capital markets well not really not really but a bunch of exchanges from South Korea Hong Kong and Asia reincorporated in Malta the Seychelles and Bailey's and so it's just there is a whole bunch of regulatory arbitrage going on right now public policy development this is only five minutes but I just wanted to mention how public policy actually comes together and Tom you're gonna help me here you got it analysis Tom starts with an Alice who thinks analysis is at the top of what happens in public policy any show of hands Tom know what's number one what do you think what happens first what's it panic Public Policy huh panic Loren policy is gonna be in here but messaging if you don't get your message right you're never gonna get to your analysis but there's one other thing between messaging and analysis coalition building or politics so messaging with your messaging you can build a coalition which is called politics and if you get your politics right you can actually get to your analysis this hierarchy not written to textbooks comes from an old wonderful political lawyer from Texas who shared it with me some twenty years ago when I went to Washington he said young man you know nothing about this town you don't get your message right you're not going to get to your politics that if you don't get your politics right you'll never get to your analysis and your policy and that's how it's all made China and so what do I mean by messaging so let's have a little bit of fun does anybody remember this what's that what is that but messaging right it's messaging from 2016 does anybody want to go back to 2008 and tell me what was the message for 2008 to have some fun what's that change change we believe in you want to go back to 2000 harder harder I know it's almost it's not in the history books huh yet no compassionate conservative I was just that's ww-was he was a he was capacity was conservative but compassionate sort of it nod to that moderate side 92 this is gonna be hard huh it's the economy stupid that's Bill Clinton by the way it's the economy stupid so messaging a coalition building that just basically means unless you can really bring folks together so in the blockchain Bitcoin space right now there's not a broad coalition it's not like a deep well of people investing in blockchain and Bitcoin in America but if you were to try to address yourselves to legislative change or regulatory change you need some coalition you probably can't just be a bunch of miners or a bunch of incumbents or or startups or crypto exchanges there'd have to be some form of coalition building that goes along with it analysis does matter I'm not gonna say Tom it doesn't matter it just no no no no it's us it's just to get to the analysis if you were sitting down with someone in Congress right now you probably also need as James says the the crisis my sense is legislative bodies around the globe by and large are not engaged in blockchain Bitcoin yet you're brought to pass something Malta's passed something the Russian Duma thank you has been working on something for six or eight months and can't come to a coalition around it some state legislative bodies in the US have passed some modest things there was a bill in Arizona actually promoted to allow Bitcoin for payment of taxes it failed in committee but it's kind of interesting question and yes Lauren you're right personnel is policy ultimately who sits in the jobs matters and I would just close on it think of those several layers there's the political layer those are either elected or appointed by the people that are elected there's the political layer and their risk appetites are different than the senior career level and the the day to day career level and the day to day career level is usually that person with whom we are all interfacing but as we all know if you walk into the Department of Motor Vehicles that day to day person that bureaucrat really has a very narrow range of decision-making the career senior career person who's in their 40s or 50s has a broader range of decision-making but also we always remember they they live in a world of asymmetric risk there's not much upside to saying yes to something new and funky and hard and difficult but they could be getting a host of downside risk if if it blows up on their watch so there's asymmetric risk and Bitcoin and blockchain gives that so that's kind of everything Thursday is permission versus permissionless systems so we'll sort of dive into some of that if you've got more questions on public policy just ask we'll be talking about it there rest of the semester and the conclusions basically our public policy matters thank you [Applause] you
