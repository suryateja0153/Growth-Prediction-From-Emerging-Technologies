 Hey guys, I'm Jonas Sunandar I work as a blockchain developer, in one of blockchain company in Indonesia Today i wanna talk about hashing learning about cryptocurrency or blockchain you must have heard about hashing but what is hashing exactly??? For example, if you have a text and you want to convert the text into a word that always have the same length you can use something that is called hash function it's a math function that can convert input with any length into output with fixed length using this, your input will be put into the hash function and then it will be converted into a word that are 'irregular' and not human readable But for example purposes, in this video we use human readable function just for example so that you can see the uniqueness of hash function The nature of the hash function is that if you change the data just a bit You will change the hash output as a whole it is also called avalanche effect for example, the sentence 'Halo budi' if hashed can becomes 'Aku suka blockchain' But if you put the sentence 'Halo budi . ' adding the period in the last part The hashed output can become 'kerupuk itu enak' or other things that have no similarity with 'Aku suka blockchain' even though we just added a dot in the last part. Any little change can make a different output in the hash function The other nature of this hash function is Deterministic That means the output will always be the same, as long as the function is the same and the input is also the same If the input is 'Halo Budi', and the result is 'Aku suka blockchain'' Until whenever the result will always be 'Aku suka blockchain' The other characteristic of hash function is One way Function so you guys will know that the hashed result of 'Halo Budi' is 'Aku suka blockchain But from hashed result of 'Aku suka blockchain' we can never know that the input is 'Halo Budi' So after the hashing there are no ways to get the input value from the output The cryptocurrency that uses hash function are a lot for example bitcoin which uses sha256 ethereum which uses keccak256 And then Zcash, Nano and Siacoin which uses blake2b So what is the purpose of hashing in blockchain ? One of the uses is previous hash or 'chain' on blockchain Every block will always have the hashed result of the previous block Like in the picture This is used to maintain the data security on blockchain If there are people that change the data in previous block the avalanche effect will trigger which will ruin the previous hash on the blocks after There we can know if there are changes in data for example like this Block number 2 will save the hashed result of block number 1 and block number 3 will save the hashed result of block number 2 If there are people who try to change the data in block number 1 for example changing the transaction then the avelanche effect wil ltrigger automatically previous hash on block number 2 will change because there are different data on block number 1 The same thing happen on block 3, and block 3 will detect changes on previous hash So network will be easier to detect the changes in data on blockchain network so that it will be faster to follow up and fix if there are conflict data Because in blockchain all data that are saved in nodes must be indentical not one difference Maybe there are question about why must it be hashed? Why can't we just save all data from previous block the purpose is to store data efficiently remember, blockchain is decentralized so every node or person have to save all the data Because after the hash we will have the fixed length output it will save storage of the person that save the blocks So rather than saving all the data from previous block we just need to save the hashed result from the previous block this help save storage for every node So what do you guys think? can you picture hashing in blockchian better? If you have question or still confused comment on down below Don't forget to like the video if you guys feel helped by the video And subscribe this channel FWB (Friends with Blockchain) See you on the next video, bye!
