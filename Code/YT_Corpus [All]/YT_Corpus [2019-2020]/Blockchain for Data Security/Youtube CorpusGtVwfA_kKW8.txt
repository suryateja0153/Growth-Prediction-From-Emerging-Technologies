 [Music] this is actually one of my favorite topics is you know cyber insurance how do you how do you handle the risk and of course risk in in an IT world is different from risk in other places so thank you for inviting me if you have car insurance you don't go wow this is i've got insurance this is great i can drive like a complete idiot no no well actually I have never seen you drive maybe do but but it doesn't give you permission to to ignore all the other stuff really what cyber insurance is or any insurance policy for that matter I think they need to be looked at as ways of dealing with residual risk or what they sometimes call tail risk that after you've done everything you can reasonably do to understand the risk that you're facing mitigate the risk that you're facing and make sure your business processes all of them if you want we can talk a bit about what those should be maybe that after you've done all that stuff then you get the insurance to cover the residual risk that you simply can't control no matter how careful you are with your business processes and so on it's a little bit like let's say your house insurance that's maybe a good example you know you might put an alarm system in it cover all the windows when you leave lights on you do whatever you need to do to protect your your home but if somebody wants to get into your house you know they're going to get into your house and the insurance will cover the losses that happened there you don't just get home insurance and then walk away from your house leaving the door unlocked you don't drive your car in a crazy way because insurance gives you a you know some kind of get out of jail free card for four route bad driving it's always two to mitigate tail risk and so you owe it to your own company and probably to the to the insurance company because you know they'll pay you if you don't behave I mean they'll charge you if you don't behave you owe it to do everything that you can I think probably you have to start with what you can afford and get the best coverage you can with what you can afford not every business that has a network can afford a you know rolls-royce style insurance policy so you have to pick and choose if you're I could tell you this for example a law firm I work for a law firm law firms are worried about state-sponsored hacking because law firm servers contain information that might be very interesting to an inimical government so you know that that that would be important for a law firm if you have a server you you have to in a network you you have to have cyber insurance no a lot of small companies go with let's say some of the big providers Microsoft 365 Amazon Web Services and and and those and they do a terrific job at the data center level and you can dial up how much security and privacy you want you know you can get third-party help you can do it yourself a lot of there's a lot of flexibility with those those kinds of offerings but it still doesn't none of those things help you if somebody else you know gets your password one way or another you haven't trained your employee isn't they they they start getting away information you know most of the mistakes that are the sort of liability and cost that comes out of employee actions are not from people being unhappy they're just from people making mistakes because people are people they make a they have accidents they make mistakes it's part of the human condition right we make mistakes training helps a lot having good technology that lets say mitigates against the possibility of the mistake that helps a lot you [Music]
