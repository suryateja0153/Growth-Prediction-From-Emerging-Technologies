going to turn it over to Michael laughing thanks Beth you know we're really excited at the department of civil and environmental engineering to be to be offering both this webinar and and a broader course that we'll talk about a little bit later the cybersecurity is one of the greatest challenges of the current their work environment and and the ways in which cybersecurity affects the physical built world which is our focuses is one that we think is incredibly important and that's why we're so excited to offer this and so you know I'd like to turn it over now to my client's to kind of walk us through the schedule for today's webinar and kick off the kickoff the content Mike yeah thanks Mike dough welcome everybody and very happy to have you participating today and and so the focus of today's webinar is to give you a glimpse into what we're going to do in the in the September course which will explain a bit more detail in toward the end of the webinar today will give you a glimpse into what some of the current attack vectors look like what the impacts of code 19 are which as you'll see quite significant and then we'll we'll walk you through the three stages of how we've organized this program which is what do you do to get set up in the pre attack mitigation phase and this turns out to be really important because if you do this right it makes everything else much more straightforward and if you don't well and you have problems then we're going to talk about shifting that into what it looks like when you're doing response management and what are the issues associated with that and then what happens for rapid recovery and what are best practices there at the end of the webinar will shift over and talk about going deeper into all of these topics and how the five session program is going to work in the fall then to wrap up we'll go into a little bit of Q&A and try to answer your questions so now let's talk about the whole area of pre attack mitigation what is the best approach for setting things up so that you have fewer problems later on and what we're going to do in this program is approach cyber security from a different angle than what you used to seeing normally we're going to use what Gartner calls financial integrated risk management so what we're going to be looking at here are ways to drive your cyber security strategy from a business impact point of view which is different than the way most folks at associate solving the cyber security problem by just buying you know tools and things from vendors and so on and saying hey we got everything and we are protected so why is business impact an important way to look at that and this these numbers kind of give you the idea of what the problem is so as you can see the spending on cybersecurity solutions is becoming rather absurd it's getting much much bigger yuria year-over-year and then you would think okay with more and more techniques and tools and spending we should be able to suppress losses but that's not what's happening the cybercrime losses are just getting worse and worse and so in some ways one could say that the losses are correlated with increased spending on this I mean certainly it looks like that and this has really now become a multi trillion dollar problem and what it says is that the solutions being deployed don't work and so that's the obvious conclusion for this and the question is why is that and so I'm going to turn this over now that Cray so he can dive into more details around why this doesn't work great yeah thank you Mike and as Mike said you know the focus of the course is on the three different stages of attack and losses occur in each of these stages and can occur to different levels and so really understanding business impact in each of those stages is a primary focus of the course and its curriculum here and of course minimizing attacker free time as we call it the amount of time that attack there's actually within the system is a key element in reducing business impact so it didn't if we go forward and kind of look at threats today the course is not focused on threats in general but really on what are the what's the current threat profile as of the time of the court and so as we've all experienced right now COBIT is that a fairly significant impact on everyone from a cyber perspective shown here is some of the Trend Micro statistics for q1 of this year and you can see how the dramatic increase in how attackers have really dynamically changed to target businesses based on current circumstances and the key takeaway here is that cyber risk and business impact has not become kind of an it's no longer really an annual assessment thing it's something that actually has to be managed and almost a daily basis the COBIT case risks to corporation changed overnight and it has dynamically changed and in the attacks that we've seen dynamically change every week since the Cova you know the Kovach pandemic that started and it's it's morphed into different forms so really the key takeaway here and for the course is how we manage risk around the current profile and do this on an ongoing basis the second part of the course really looked at how you manage infrastructure if you look at the statistics on the left here you see from Gartner kind of the current pre kovin focus of infrastructure and security now this profile is changing dramatically right now and what we've seen is a number of things and I'm sure everyone on Collier is witnessing parts of this which is really the migration to mobile workforce people at home not necessarily in corporate systems for instance operating off of personal systems in some cases the other one that not so many people are familiar with is is the mass migration to the cloud and we've seen and in particular infrastructure as a service increased an uptick by over 20 percent just in the last few months as Kovac has occurred and the question is you know what are the what are the ramifications from a risk perspective of migrating to the cloud so quickly in some cases companies do this just over a period of a week or two you know and migrated to a platform that prior to kovat I you know they were under intense discussions the security and risk implication I combined with this the fact that you know there's loss of revenue and you may not have as much capital and so cost now is a much higher focus and so the course here is really focused not only just on the risk from cyber but the trade-off the cost the trade-offs of business impact and and productivity for the company has to operate kind of this changing risk effect and the course will focus beyond that on some of the emerging malware sets and really be immersive in the current attack at the time of the court to attack just as examples here that are quite relevant to this discussion the Baltimore attack where essentially nation-state reverse-engineered malware and called Robin Hood was used to attack the city the city was down for over a month this was a ransom or attack asking for about eighty thousand dollars Baltimore did not pay the resulting losses then were more around eighteen million dollars or so and their trade up right in terms of how you actually respond and manage these event the other thing to note here is that insurance played a key role and that malware set and lack of insurance added some more losses and so not only are we looking at cyber attacks but in the physical economy you're really talking about tying you know physical systems to insurance to business continuity and operation and then back to the cyber impact the second as an example second set of malware you know of interest especially in this energy utility sectors are things such as crash overwrite and why do I mention this if you if you look closely at the at the cert for this the us-cert crash override which has been out for a while we're seeing what I call almost a new category of malware that when you look at it and you read the sentence here you see that us-cert is basically saying that current security controls cannot defend against this this malware set and as a result as we've seen it's quite effective at getting into ot systems and so this raises the question about how do you really manage your business risk when you have malware that can bypass a very effectively bypass existing control system meaning that compliance and other items like that are not effective at reducing impact and so a key element of the course will be looking at how to manage against risk an event that that that compliance and certification really do not have an impact on which is a reality of today risk management environment and so with that I'll turn it back over here to Mike to go through kind of basic questions and how we manage these risks within the course yeah thanks Craig now I think we're going to get here a more on the ground sentiment on these questions from Benjamin because the managing the risk in an effective the way really requires that you be able to answer a bunch of questions Benjamin you want to take us through some of these questions and opine on them and whether folks can actually answer them now yeah I think what's interesting about these questions is that when you're a CIO or you're a CEO or you're someone on a board or even the chief information security officer I think these are questions that you are constantly being either asked or asking and when they're you know your answer today is going to change tomorrow just as Craig was going through some of those examples so the Ukraine event happened one I was at my previous role it's 90 responsible for cybersecurity not only for snow ped that eyes also representing all of American public power with Newark which is the federal age Energy Regulatory Commission for governing these the utilities in the US and what was interesting is that you know the way I would answer these questions before that event and after changed I think that's the point that we're we're trying to make here is when you're managing security it's constantly changing and you need to look at this and understand you know how do I make the right investments you know you're going to your board asking for money constantly saw the numbers from Mike earlier billions of dollars are being spent on cyber security how do you know if you're making the right investments a lot of times companies are focusing on building higher thicker walls to try to vent people from coming in but that's not always where the right investment needs to be made and I think understanding where your opportunities are what your threats are and how you can get the most value out of your investments is really well we would like to help people understand and help people comprehend where those opportunities to offer for them well yeah then a question that comes up certainly in in when you're going through this list is why don't see suite and you know managing directors of corporations just do what the cisco says and the cio says and that's it well I think you know we'll talk about this little bit later as well but I think it's about understanding the ramifications of your decisions right it's about understanding where or how you're going to impact your operations with some of those decisions but in Craig got some good ideas here on starting to look at how how we can look at those risks and those financial factors that have a more comprehensive view of how to make the right decisions for your cybersecurity program and your strategy as a whole yeah absolutely Benjamin and if you look at the slides up right now you know there's kind of a range of techniques the more one has been risk scoring and fuel gauge and we'll cover these in the course and there's been a steady migration of new technologies which is very exciting you know and so you're seeing kind of the emergence of technologies that are starting to try and get a better idea of what business impact is you know from changes in security controls and initiatives within the organization you have kind of the financial factor analysis which tries to put a larger bound on what the financial impact is to give general guidance and even more exciting is kind of the scenario pathway testing which allows you actually look at your system and how it responds that's said these technologies independently really are still not enough because if you just look at them they really they really don't look antibac pathways to the business impact which is what really needs to be done to understand the red and so in this course now that we're going to focus on these techniques but we're going to go to the next level and and and really look at this from kind of the c-suite and board level and how you really start to tie business impact and business decision-making back into pathway analysis and back into kind of forward-looking blueprints and templates for what can happen to the company and that then allows transparency at the leadership level so I'll be a major focus at this Court is looking at how you tie business continuity operations the physical security elegance and bring these all together in terms of what the impact is on the company and then be able to demonstrate impact by the investment that you do and look at return on investment from your security controllers so if we go on I think it'd be good right now to go through essentially a case study similar to what we'll do in the course and and Benjamin having been it's no cut has has witnessed this firsthand so Benjamin will turn back to you and talk about you know one one one kind of immersive case study here yes Thanks so as part of my work at snowfoot I was always trying to figure out where are our opportunities and where our weak points and one of the approaches you can take is have someone do an ethical half of a pack of your company or pen test of your company so we actually hired the Air Force and Army National Guard to do that for us so that was an interesting activity one of itself had they actually get the governor of the state of Washington to approve this but what was really interesting if these gentlemen were extremely amazing talented individuals they you know they all had day jobs working for major companies like Microsoft and t-mobile but there are some of the best trained cyber security experts you'll ever find being trained by the US government as well and so my team felt we and we've been you know evaluated and thought we had a very strong cybersecurity program until we went through this exercise and you can see here it's a very simple path right they did some fishing of users that happen within about 20 minutes they're able to get in and start to get access to our systems and I can go through the entire chain here you can read through yourself but fundamentally we had what we called a smart grid lab which was set up to mimic our control systems for a production environment of managing the grid there in the northwest and that was their target right if you like capture the flag that was the flag thereafter and they were able to get there it was very interesting about going through this exercise was one the team didn't think it was possible in fact they thought I gave those little keys they felt I gave them those keys to the hackers to help them through and I did not and so we actually had the team that did the hacking in pen test go through step by step how they are able to get from entry all the way into our critical systems understanding that was an eye-opener and I think one of the first things you always have to remember in cybersecurity is there is no way to prevent a one number seven you know hybrid cyberattack you know I always joked that my personal information has been stolen so many times I had a security background with that was done by the FBI and and NSA and those folks and CIA and all them you know that better information was a stolen at one point so I think you know that's one thing is you we're having conversations with a board with our leaders they have to understand there's no way that we can 100% protect the company it's about making the right investments and it's also about having the right response plan when we do have those events and so it was a very interesting experience there's several white papers written on this can be shared as well that's great thanks Benjamin yeah and so you know from the standpoint of you know looking at the attacks it seems pretty simple that attack paths it's quite common between most attacks that Benjamin just walked through and it seems like the purview should be pretty simple to pick up on that pathway to protect against it so the complexity here is that is you know is that isn't just one pathway what you're looking at here is is a simple corporate structure for a system that's running on the order of about a thousand computers so this is a small company small to medium company and what you can see here are the access pathways through that system and and the number that even for a small company you have to look at in order to figure out the pathways true and many of these are potentially viable pathways to take over the entire network which is the the node that's on the far right essentially the active directory system you add to this what we see with many companies which is the fact that in order to monitor this and and if course you get to a global multinational company you're talking about you know a system that's hundreds if not thousands of times larger than this and the amount of data you know for a large oil and gas company or for you know a particular financial company easily reaches terabytes of data coming through this system per hour and and so trying to monitor the system and all of the different pathways through it is a very difficult daunting and yet to that the false alarms coming off on kind of these critical infrastructure systems and and you can see from a cost-effective point of view it can be quite you know quite difficult and so and so how do you actually you know protect this system the traditional approach right now that we've seen with companies is is to actually you know use monitoring systems and and of course try to put in security controls in the general way from a compliance standpoint that try to try to impact this the issue is that from the shotgun approach your monitoring tremendous amounts of information it's large teams to do this and this is where cost becomes an issue if you try to monitor everything becomes difficult to actually protect the system and if you look at the attacker coming through they obviously have their very specific pathways that they're targeting on and each attacker you know has their own favorite so so they'll be coming from different directions based on the malware that they have and and so one way and to to actually mitigate this and to reduce costs is to really look at which of these pathways I have the largest business impact on the compass and focused in on the pathways that lead to largest dam and so in this case you're looking for one threat group with their malware set and you're seeing what's the most damaging pathway is from this front from this group in this case you can actually start to now prioritize and look at how you might introduce security controls to impact that and so in this case you can actually look at the different nodes look at the staging that they might do and and the problem becomes much more tractable from a risk management point of view and so in the end if you know the pathway and you know the various staging mechanisms you can win target security controls in the physical security area against the specific eye damage pathway this is really integrating kind of the concept of risk management with how you implement security controls and then costs become you know the critical driving factor the prioritize in this manner becomes absolutely crucial you know to how you how you manage the system so there's really at the core of business impact modeling and how that can reduce cost and also at the same time give me a good understanding of what the final business impact is on the company so that c-suite board members have transparency for that effect so if we go beyond that I'm going to turn this back over but now that you can understand you know how risk prioritization can help in managing you know highly complex systems like cyber access control and other things like that turn back over now it kind of the view that c-suite and and and board members can get if you start to position analysis or risk analysis in this manner yeah so it was very interesting because of all the dynamics that Craig was talking about and your executive team is going off the conferences and and in the oil gas industrial utility industry cybersecurity is one of the top topics that are talked about and it was they come back and they started asking you all these questions how would we know we're making the right investments etc and so it was really good working with the team to come up with a way to look at this and a simple way to make the right decisions and if you look at this chart on the left hand side here right really to our point of understanding the business impact and when I sat down with our board I said I really want to talk about two things with you I talked about cybersecurity the first is the probability of an attack and the second is the impact of that attack and my goal and everything we do from an IT perspective or security perspective should be focusing on those two numbers so build a display to them this here's what our plan is going to be so the controls are across the bottom we had not only regulatory requirements kind of coming out of the federal government but we also had assessment done by by the neo solution here and then we also had other input from our hacking pen testing that we did with the National Guard all those so I had all this information and I needed a way to figure out how do I make the right steps I don't make those right investments where I get the most bang for my buck where should I start looking to maybe apply insurance which wasn't part of our risk mitigation plan at the time so if you look at this across the top you have the risk reduction numbers a percentage of the risk reduction number then you have the controls across the bottom so if you look at asset DLP is an example you I get the most bang for my buck because I'm going to get the largest percentage of decrease and or what a larger percentage of decreases in the three-year reduction but also I see a overall reduction my overall risk profile by fifteen percent as well not only am i reducing my cost but also reducing my risk profile as a whole so that made it very easy for me to go into the board and say hey we're going to go off and spend X dollars we're going to implement these controls and then implement that and build and then show value back to them from a risk reduction perspective perfect Benjamin and then and then in addition to that going back to the questions Benjamin that you introduced at the beginning you know we know it's challenging to answer those questions such as what is what is the top control that most reduces my business impact you know from a cyber perspective and so you know using times like this you actually can you know take the next step and now you have the answer to that question at some level and and allows you to give you transparency because in this case you know you can actually say here's the top control measure that actually reduces my risk of loss and when you start doing it it kind of forces one to you know think in a structured way because when you break down the analytics you know at the higher level of the company it forces you to actually look at your recurrence period so in this case you see that acid LT is the most impactful control for your recurring losses over three years so on average over the next three years as the deal he will reduce my risk of loss the most as a company now interestingly enough if you go here and look at your 20-year we bring lots look at this like you know your 20-year hurricane recurrence your New Orleans but your 20-year recurrence lost if you click on that actually go through and start to look at it what you see is these controls tipped around many times and dramatic weight and so if you're trying to mitigate your longer-term 20-year loss it's very different controls and those are typically your nation-state controls where as you see the three-year loss down below here is primarily criminal organization they're the ones you're going to impact the treaty loss so it forces you to start looking at you know what are you trying to mitigate with the security control and then finally it does give you a way to start looking at insurance because the residual risk that's left after implementing these controls then gives you a target a quantitative goal and target in terms of risk transfer so if so so that's risk minimization and obviously that's the loss reduction shown in green here but there are many other aspects that companies are faced with one obviously being cost reduction when you're actually trying to figure out the initiatives and the controls that you implement how much you spend on cyber security for that year and so I'm going to turn this over to Benjamin to talk a little more about the the breadth of trade offs and and how you approached it yeah I'm just going to use an analogy just to kind of clarify the point we're trying to make so we talked a lot about loss reduction and cost and if you just take a company like Nordstrom who is very both employer focus as well as customer focus and if you think if they added some security features to their overall program because they have lost reduction right people are stealing from them on a constant basis if they all of a sudden started to to Pat you down as a customer every time you left the store right my customer experience would go way down my employee experience and having to do that would probably go way down and the cost for the company would go way up so there's got to be a good balance between the costs the corporate productivity your operations and the impact on your employees getting their jobs done and balancing that all out is very interesting we did this with our when our generation facilities had to be upgraded to meet Newark ships compliance we had to go out and help them understand that and then help us understand this well how do we reduce the impact on their operations but make sure we put in the right controls in place to keep the facilities secure so it's a balancing act to try to manage this across those dynamics thanks Benjamin it's yeah that's a great example and and so now one of the things that you need to take care of here is is the whole structuring of corporate security roles and responsibilities Benjamin touched on some of this material over the last few minutes well one of the things that you know many operations don't do well is have a really fully articulated playbook about you know how this is going to work and you know who's responsible for what and in each stage of the operation you know pre mitigating what's going to happen really understanding the whole playbook who's responsible for controlling the security for communicating for making these business decisions that affect the business continuity and the cost for the company going forward that this needs to be really carefully laid out and we're gonna dive into that material even more later now in with respect to that we need to focus as you can see when you go back to the financial integrated risk management approach to controlling the whole security posture of the company it's really about these top two things the corporate return on investment a systems approach to what it's going to cost to actually make the company secure and to sustain operations and the whole thing needs to be business impact driven whereas in many cases right now it it is not done that way it's it's more of a technology oriented approach to controlling security you know and what is the latest hot product or bell and whistle or something that has some compelling technology advantage that says yeah we can detect everything and and I think as you've already seen that's not really possible these days with a IML driven solutions the attackers are gaining even more advantages because they're using those technologies against us and yeah those technologies for sure are being used to advance cybersecurity products but the attackers are also using them and in some cases more effectively than the defenders and so this can't just be driven by technology that's not going to work so the emphasis is corporate ROI and business impact that's that's the approach that we're taking and is in this program so one thing we can look at is in the next phase is what happens when we're responding to an attack that's happened very much like what Benjamin laid out a little bit earlier and one of the key elements of this is crisis communication we're going to have extensive sessions on crisis communication and it's it's very much making sense of what happened because as it says if we can't make sense of actually what happened then someone else is going to make sense of it and one of the key things here that distinguishes cyber response from say dealing with natural disasters like hurricanes earthquakes and so on as Craig mentioned earlier is that those those events don't don't do anything differently depending upon what we do there they're just what they are whereas in cyber attacks the behavior of the attackers is heavily driven by what we do and and they're paying attention to how we communicate as well and you know this also brings in the notion of oh yeah we're just compliant struck that's all we do and if the attackers know how we're complying with NIST and other standards this is tremendous information for them and dramatically in some cases drives what they do to attack us and our behavior is going to drive though what they do next because these attacks as you saw earlier can go on for quite some time this is not just a one point in time kind of event okay and the crisis communication strategy has to think about all of those elements and there are certain roles and responsibilities and who communicates what and when and how is it's really critically necessary to manage this properly now if we shift to the recovery part of this I'm going to turn that over to Craig to talk about some of the elements we need to address when we're recovering perfect thanks Mike and building on some of my comments recovery similar in some ways to response but it's quite interesting here is when you move and and extend beyond compliance to business impact driven management a couple things really stand out in terms of reducing losses to the business as a whole just to highlight a few here I basically the removal of malware is something that typically leads to heavy loss with companies the lansing michigan case where the utility there in michigan was taken down they tried to rebuild their systems multiple times the malware was not entirely removed and as a result they had extreme cost and eventually had to replace most of their systems of product across the entire corporation so quite quickly you see that you know understanding when malware and verifying that malware is removed becomes a critical business loss issue the second item I'll mention just to highlight this is is the changing threat landscape you saw the attack graft that I showed earlier those are actually from an offensive attack tool and so you can see them mapping that that group already has of the system that they attack they have a very good idea in some cases better than the security personnel themselves in the company and so this threat is now staging is in a position to stage against the company in the future so really really what your threat profile is given that the attack just occurred and looking forward at that to understand it becomes critical in reducing loss the final one I'll mention coming back to Baltimore is really taking a more careful quantitative financial look at your insurance and really being able to assure shareholders and stakeholders that that your insurance does coverage cover the types of attacks that your to see and really taking a relook at that to make sure that that the the company has proper insurance and risk or other risk transfer mechanisms in place so as you can see you know looking at this from the business impact point of view really changes some of the items as a company that you might focus on in addition to compliance not instead of but in addition you can find to really secure physical as well as as well the other digital system that you're working yeah thanks great so we can we can get some key takeaways now and kind of summarize the things we've been talking about for the last 45 minutes is that the key thesis here is that it's no limits pending against cyber threats really doesn't work anymore the spending and the selection of controls that are needed is very situationally dependent its path dependent and it depends on what's going on in the threat environment and this is as greg pointed out something that actually needs to be tracked you know almost daily to be really really effective okay and it's also clear that transparency is necessary in communication not only so that the c-suite can properly control the risk in the company but you know that were compliant you know on the regulatory side and and those and those regulatory requirements are getting tighter and stiffer you know as time goes on and the penalties for failure to do this properly are becoming more severe we need blueprints and playbooks for how this needs to be handled and communicated and the you know the key issue here is that we need to keep coming back to this notion of business impact and that compliance per se isn't really the solution and in fact in many instances it's fairly straightforward to show that being fully compliant is actually not correlated with risk of loss and and you know and that's certainly a disturbing situation for sure so now what I'd like to do is is shift over and and in the remaining few minutes here just really quickly talk about what we're going to do in the 20 hour program in September and and the focus or the the attendance for this program is really driven around c-suites the board of directors senior managers and and not per se scissors or people who are you know deepen the technology for how they're actually going to implement the solutions but this is more of a higher-level set of folks that need to understand how to control the business risk because that's going to be the principal focus and what we're gonna do is give a very real-world scenario based education here where we're actually dealing with something that replicates what they might see in in real life and the key point here is going to be how do I know when I've spent enough money when am i when am I done or what is my process going to look like here because my budgets are not going to be unlimited and I've got to pay attention to the ROI and so we're going to be as we said very immersive in this probably in this program and and we're going to look at a kind of a fictitious standard energy company in this program and the network's for that company are going to be quite elaborate we're going to be using large network emulations to illustrate the various points and the risk of loss and the loss pathways in the system and we'll also use that to drive the pre attack mitigation strategies you know what are we doing to get everything set up and then we'll go through some actual attacks that have happened to utilities and you know other physical type systems to see what they actually look like and and show how all of that is communicated to the feast week and the C's we will need to be able to respond to those things and do crisis communication and all of that sort of thing and we'll be practicing this throughout the course so that we understand actually what it looks like and how to do it you know very important items and then we're going to look at trends and as Craig mentioned earlier the attacks we'll be looking at will be trending very typical around the time of when we deliver the program so they're going to be the latest things things that you may not have seen before and it's going to be very interesting to see how that really plays out we'll bring in you know especially in our crisis communication part of the program which is going to be handled by Steve Calendar from the Stanford Business School he's an expert in this area and we'll tie that out to the latest SEC regulations and you can see here what the participant focus and the concept is going to be and I think we've we've recovered many of those things I don't want to leave a little time here left for Q&A and discussion so again the key point of the program this is this is not high-level compliance this is not about checking which nist boxes are important or any of that sort of thing we're going to go through three stages throughout the program the pre attack the response and the recovery and and this is going to be done in a very real-world way where teams will form up in the course and take responsibility for these various aspects of the response so communication is going to be key on the program and how do you do it how do you talk to it so it's all going to be virtual we're going to do five sessions early September for four hours a day we will we will pace it properly so that we don't get burned out you know on screens because now that we've been teaching things virtually we're very familiar with what that process looks like and how it works and you can see the dates there and one of the things we're going to ask people to do is to if they can provide anonymized versions of things that they'd seen attacks situations things of that nature that they can contribute so that will build a database at Stanford of anonymize you know information so that this can help others educate themselves around gee what did somebody else see and what do I have to be thinking about and and this also provides a way for us to do more directed research at Stanford around these anonymized kind of attacks this will this will be extremely valuable the program will offer a Stanford certificate of completion very important and it's of course a significant amount of effort to go through the program but highly worthwhile so here's some information on how to sign up and Beth did you want to say anything about these lengths no if you don't have time - other than if you don't have time to write this down if you do though - online dot stanford.edu and put in cybersecurity this is one of the courses that will come up and you should be able to find it there and also the recording of this webinar will also be on that signup site as well for anybody that wants to view any parts of it again or show it to anyone else all right Mike Mike Benin Craig you know great job the takeaways that you had listed there I think we're really were really spot-on a few questions that are sort of grouped into some various areas for all of you a question came in you know earlier in the webinar you had listed a few of the free attack mitigation strategies and specifically this person is saying I'm already overloaded by Kobe 19 with spot stuff what are the top one or two things I should focus on right now if you were going to say from each of you top one thing that they should do to start thinking about this so this is Craig I can start off so on the technical side it does depend upon how you're set up and what the impact on the company has been but but some of the things that we've seen you know the that are high loss mechanisms or if you have migrated significant you know resources to the cloud identity access management a data leakage has become a core issue there and as an area in terms of you know how you actually access that system and what the protections are in that system and and the second one is it's how you're actually monitoring on the remote side when you have a mobile workforce and so again it's dependent on your situation but these these are a couple you know of trends that that seem to be areas of high loss and in good area spokes and Mike what would you say there are things yeah yeah so I think for me response response response is no matter what controls you have in place and no matter where you're making your investments always having a solid response plan and exercising that response plan on a regular basis I don't think you can ever lose from from that investment so I think that's an area where I encourage all companies be focusing on how will they respond and continuously updating that based on their profile like lines anything different than what Craig and Ben have said well I would only add a lot of the classic problems are still sitting out there you know we did some some key demonstrations risk of loss for some large auditors last year and you know you know 20,000 machine network that was set up that had some miss configurations in it you know advanced apt attack vectors were able to take this miss network down very very quickly and you know misconfigured systems and not checking this kind of stuff on a regular basis so for specifically question came in for for Craig you had talked about Robin Hood and crash override Edie wouldn't be coming next is it going to be a variant of one of or they're gonna be something completely different than Tennessee so that's that's a great question and and I would say you've got to watch out for both we will see variants almost certainly of what exists today as people fine-tune it reverse engineering kind of by you know various groups actually start to distribute it as as kind of what I call standard malware that they sell you know within the criminal infrastructure at the same time you know Robin Hood was a reverse engineered nation-state and so we do keep a very close eye on what's been stolen and not all of the stolen malware on the nation-state side yet has been reverse engineer and so what you're seeing is as they reverse engineer different components of that you're seeing the effect of it and so I think you need to look at both you know the commercialization and the criminal side and the you know the fine-tuning and adjustment of existing malware and at the same time it's an and you need to be looking at you know what's the likelihood that certain nation-state malware will be reverse engineered in the coming year look very closely at that to understand what the impact is that will be once it is reverse in fear so it's a lot more depth in the India in the bigger course so for Ben and my clients and this will be the final question as we wrap up the webinar what's the most difficult part of cyber security for a board member or CEO to understand and what have you found to be the best ways to try to educate them on that and these are complex things and potentially leaders that that that aren't experts in this area and so what what are those pieces that are super difficult for them understanding and any-any try to any any thoughts on how to help them understand it no that's an excellent question I think it's and it's depend on your board you know I add for board members on our board and our CEO CEO understood cyber security very well that's because him and I had regular conversations about all the time one of my board members understood it fairly well because they're a little bit more technically adept than maybe the others were the other ones though weren't necessarily as technically adept and so just trying to help them understand and using very basic examples and that related back to their personal lives right securing their personal information you know when my information was stolen you know from you know the federal government sharing that with them and understand them understand that the complexity of what this means and impact to our customers as the utility at the time as well so I think try to keep it as simple as possible and that's why when I was communicating back to our board I said there's only two numbers I want you guys focused on which is a probability of attack and what that the cost of that attack would be that way you can just judge up and down the impact and risks of the company as a whole and so I try to keep it as simple as possible I think it's my best message and I also like the idea of trying to relate it to personal security because that's something we've all sort of been exposed to a little bit and and say look we're gonna have to take this and take it to the next level Lyons any last comment on that earth or is that good well it did you know we're out of time but you know as soon as the directors why even the non-technical ones understand that 85% of the web traffic is on the dark web and you can buy all of Ben's information there right all right well I just want to say thanks to all three of you for for for helping us with this webinar today and I'll turn it back to Beth blending yes again thank you to Mike Craig Benjamin and also Mike lepak for helping with the questions here at the end and just for this very informative presentation again thank you to everybody who joined us today we appreciate you joining us as a reminder you'll receive a link to the recording of the webinar in about a week thank you very much you
