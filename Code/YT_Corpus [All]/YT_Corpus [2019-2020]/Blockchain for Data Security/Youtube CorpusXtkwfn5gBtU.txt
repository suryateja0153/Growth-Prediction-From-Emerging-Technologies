 [Music] hello everyone welcome back to the next lecture on our blockchains course we hired a couple of lectures talking about use cases and financial services so they'll be though the third one in that series talking again about use cases in financial services now we're gonna go a little bit into the commercial side of financial services specifically about financing trade so this is a area that my colleagues and I have been working on ourselves for the last couple of years this one and more more on trade and supply chain so they'll be the topic of the next few lectures that's actually way close to my heart and something that have been directly working on for the next couple of first for the last couple of years how does the trade world work today so the trade international trade is probably the backbone of world economy today so most of the things you have in your home have probably been transported on a ship at some point or the other right so all the way from the regular even food articles some of them are you get imported fruits and so on it could be electronics those are imported exported and there's a lot of the regular day-to-day activities red-legged day-to-day items that are actually shipped over see we don't really realize that because we don't see their back end supply chain of all of these things today's well this whole process is extremely complicated let's say there's a small exporter the who's exporting the same mangoes from India to let's say France right today that farmer or a small enterprise has to be working with several participants today so they may be an exporter in India so they have to work with a logistics provider maybe a trucking company to transport their mangoes to a warehouse or to the port and then they have to work with a shipping line or a courier to transport over a ship using a border ship and then they also have to be working with customs in India also customs in France they have to be working with ports along the way so there's a and and also freight forwarders customs brokers and various other entities who are going to be handling the shipment all through the lifecycle and it's not just the people who are handling the the container of the shipment itself there's also a huge range of documents that they need to be to prepare to to RDR to export regulations and import regulations so the Indian customs authority will say okay if you're shipping mangoes then these are the set of documents that need to be prepared likewise the French customs might say ok these are the documents we require for you to import mangoes into into France and the kind of documents are needed but let's say it could this be about your packing list or your invoice that says what really are your shipping or it could also be let's say you might have to go to a phytosanitary you might have to get a phytosanitary certificate to certify that these mangoes are not infected or the have to they are of good quality they're of export quality and they're okay to be exported out of India there are many such regulations which for which they have to prepare documents and they also have to be BP export duty so they have to have a separate document and a seal from an authority saying they've paid the Duty there's a lot of these documents that need to be prepared and this picture basically shows some of that complexity so it shows how the the container itself moves from one port to another port or one yard to another yard there are a lot of inefficiencies right so typically on an average it's estimated that about twelve parties are involved in a single shipment and there's out an average 27 documents so in my own experience there are certain goods for which you need even up to like maybe close to 100 documents because maybe dangerous goods or they may be restricted goods so there's a lot of documentation that's required in a that's very cumbersome it's very little automation so it's all manual processes paper-based documents that are that are in place today and all this adds to the the risks rate so because of the fact that this is international trade you're also dealing with multiple currencies so you're they're subject to currency fluctuation issues and there's also issues with what if the shipment doesn't reach the other end so the there's a non-completion issue itself and then on both sides so exporter has to ship the goods to the importer importer needs to pay the money to the exporter so there's this both ways exchange that's happening and the end result of this is that financing becomes very expensive and in a country like India that's a very severe limitation because we have a large number of small and medium enterprises and they are very much dependent on financing for their capital inflows outfalls outflows so if the financing is going to be very expensive then this exporting becomes a impossible task for them so they are restricted to the markets only in India and they can't leverage some of the demand that's there outside India so that's the SME lockout that that is mentioned here so what can we do to alleviate this situation so what if we could get some of these parties maybe even all of these participants onto a blockchain platform where they all securely share information so what we can achieve is end-to-end real-time visibility into exactly where your containers are what documents have been prepared already what documents are still pending what approvals need to be obtained from various authorities so all that everyone can get a real-time visibility into exactly what is going on and along with that we can automate some of these business processes that are transcending organizational boundaries so I talked about how many documents of do you have to be prepared by different participants this is actually a sequential process that people have to follow so you need a set of documents once they are prepared you may need couple of other documents that are dependent on the first documents and so on so that entire process can be captured in an automated fashion as smart contracts on blockchain and these smart contracts can have additional intelligence so they can actually eliminate some of the manual verification and the validation of the data elements in these documents so they people actually manually look through these documents and see whether they are okay now you can automate some of those aspects as well so making sure all the documents are matching their the information is all correct so on that valuation can also be automated and you can of course have restricted access certain documents you can only allow certain participants to to view based on their authorization so what are they allowed to see we can only show those those things to them so that's part of the access control that we've looked at and at the end of the day if there are regulators in the picture they are part of the blockchain as well and then they can also get a real-time view into this and it can really help them address fraud today if trade fraud is a huge issue it's in the trillions of dollars worldwide today and even if we can address a fraction of that through technology I think it can make really big impact so today overall over 14 trillion dollars of trade is being financed this is the trade that's being financed is not the overall amount of trade and it takes up to three weeks for just the documents to be verified the actual shipment itself from India to to France can go faster lower ship it probably takes me less than ten days to go worship and by just eliminating some of this paper it's estimated that we can save about twenty seven billion dollars it's a huge amount of money so what is trade look like trade finance look like and let's Lucy how somehow we can impact this there are various forms of trade finance as you might imagine so in this picture it shows some of the least secured modes of trade finance rate to the most secure ones so for instance if you take one example where cash is paid in advance so the importer is gonna pay the exporter in advance and then only then will the exporter ship the goods the other way around so now if you think about it the importer has paid the money in advance what if the exporter doesn't ship the goods so the risk of non completion is fully borne by the importer ship so it's very less it's not secure for the importer but it's it's secured for the exporter because they have the money they've got the money and in the end only then they are obliged to send the goods so that's cash in advance the other extreme is what is called an open account where exporter is going to bear all the risk so they are expected to send the goods in advance and only after the goods have to have reached the destination and have been verified there will the importer then paper so they're in this case the the exporter is going to bear all the risk and it's its least secure for them whereas the open account is more secured for the important there are other forms of financing in between so these two actually may not even involve a bank the cash in advance in the open account may not even in those a bank or a financial institution it might just be an agreement between the importer and exporter one party for whatever reason agrees to to absorb the risk and the the end of send the money across and of course there are problems that happen along the way right and relationships are and there may be lawsuits and so on right but when financing comes in there are multiple modes again I'm going to talk about just two of them one of them is called letters of credit it's actually a fairly popular way of financing today where a bank comes in the picture let's take it take for example it's the importers bank so the importers bank will say export of a exporter he may not trust the importer but I was guarantee that whether if you if you send the goods across I will verify the bank was verify and we'll make sure that you get the payment so the bank now assumes the risk of payment of non-completion the importer maybe pays a fee to the bank to assume that risk and exporter that there buys is now has probably a more reliable entity maybe a large bank that they can trust and and and and send the goods across so the way the letter of credit works we'll talk about it in the next line but another version of it is documents collection where the bank is in the picture but bank may not assume the risk of non completion so if the money doesn't get paid the bank is not liable so bank is not going to a pay the exporter but but the bank will assume the responsibility of just collecting the documents that are required so that the importer or somebody else can can verify those documents so there are many forms what I wanted to impress on the salaah on the slide is there's a huge range of these financial instruments today all the way from being very less secure for one of the parties to being fairly Karin and trusted and executed by two or more banks in this ecosystem and in some cases when the letter of credit is involved then maybe even five or six banks that are involved there could be a guaranteeing bank that can be correspondent banks because there's a currency exchange that could be negotiating banks that help negotiate terms of the agreement there are many banks that are involved in in even a single financing situation for a single size shipment what are some of the advantages if you can bring in blockchain right so I mentioned somewhere who are the parties first right so of course the exporter importer has to be in port so they are the two parties who are fundamental to the trade and they have this fundamental discard rate importer is worried that the exporter will not ship the goods exporter is worried that the importer will not pay so they are both reluctant to be the first to show their end of the deal right so they both of them employ banks and hopefully these banks are trusted so that's how the world works today and it might not be just the importers bank and the exporters bank there may be other banks involved there could be a regulator than one there's other investors who might be involved so this is actually a fairly complex ecosystem and this is this whole process that is out there I'm going to let you see it earlier but I want to impress upon the fact that is a fairly complex interaction that's happening even between these four parties there are actually more parties that are not shown in this in this figure so what blockchain brings and if we can bring these parties on to a blockchain platform is that it can give you at an ambiguous shared view of exactly what has happened so far what needs to happen in the future it's a common store for all documents so whether there are multiple kinds of documents here and as I mentioned it can automate business processes on the on the blockchain so you can have smart contracts that are executing these business processes and they can automatically validate whether a particular step has happened correctly whether the document is valid and so on and of course as I mentioned there are many different instruments trade financing instruments with different levels of security and different risk assumed by different players and of course you can encode them as different kinds of smart contracts so Vita trade is actually an existing consortium of banks who are running a blockchain network for their trade farads purposes so they are running this in partnership with IBM so there are actually nine banks who are involved in this in this consortium today and maybe potentially other banks could join them in the future this is all banks in Europe some of them have a global footprint like HSBC or Jeavons deutsche bank is there in multiple geographies and they are using block chain today to extract some of these benefits to have this real-time visibility into the information that is being exchanged for a trade finance use case um and they are looking at ensuring that they have continuous business automation and also compliance wait so the chain can give you an auditable dog of everything that has happened and banks can use that to show regulators that they are complying with trade practices so every country has regulations on what can and cannot be done and banks are expected to show proof basically as for to an auditor that they have been complying to regulations so this is one real-world production application of not chain that's that's running today so let's move on so a related topic to trade finance is actually supply chain finance so there's a little bit of distinction in to how or the what the use case itself is so let me just describe the use case first I want to take this this picture is it example so let's say there's a large manufacturer rate it's they are the buyer so let's say this is startup motors right Tata Motors probably works with hundreds of suppliers each supplier may be supplying let's say a small automobile park maybe let's say nuts and bolts so the supplier who is a small small scale enterprise who is just manufacturing nuts and bolts and they are selling these to Tata Motors and there is a financier in the picture so Tata Motors is a big company the supplier is probably a small entity here and L here is the logistics provider so there is a logistics provider so let's see how this process itself who actually we want just just one example of supply chain finance there there are other flavors as well but let's just take this example so the supplier now creates a purchase order sorry other the paramotors creates a purchase order saying i want to buy let's just for example i want to buy thousand nuts and bolts from you so they agree create a purchase order send it to the supplier the supplier then would package those nuts and boots and they would send it through a truck - through a logistics provider and this will get delivered at a tata motors warehouse for instance they parallely also signed an invoice to tata motors saying hey I've shipped these goods across they'll reach you tomorrow but this is the invoice for this this shipment and you need to pay me whatever ten thousand rupees for this for the shipment now Tata Motors is what tata motors typically does is it probably needs it it has its own supply chain it has its own orchestration so it probably will take it take a few days to even verify that the shipment has come in look at the quality assess the quality of those nuts and balls say there okay so there's multiple steps that tata motors would internally do and typically takes time and the arrangement is usually that tata motors would pay the supplier after maybe 30 60 or 90 days depending on the agreement back to the supplier so they you pay the money only later now there are often times the supplier is a very small company right unless they get paid for the ones that they've already produced in and sold they can't use the account produce the next batch of goods right next batch of nuts and bolts so any money to prepare then I produce the next next batch so what they do is they go to a financier so now if the small company goes to a financier then this Bank is probably not going to give them a very good interest rate because they don't have a very big credit history and they will not be a big company right so they're in that loan rate might be fairly high but if the supplier can show that hey I've actually sold goods to Tata Motors this big company then what the financier would do oh I do trust Tata Motors more right they are not gonna go they're not gonna run away any time so I will give you the money now right right away when you show that you've sent Goods - to Tata Motors the financier will pay the supplier immediately and after the 30 60 90 days whatever is the agreement between the supplier and the purchaser or between Tata Motors and the small company they will collect that money from Tata Motors now the advantage of the supplier is one they got the money early they didn't they didn't have to wait until Dharam Otis does all its processing and pays it after 30 60 or 90 days and the second thing is they got a lower interest rate so they basically got a loan of some sort at a lower interest rate if they went for a loan with a bank directly they would not get that interested they got an interest rate at the date maybe Tata Motors would get our loan so that's the advantage of the supplier now advantage for Tata Motors is that they get their thirty sixty ninety days to process this shipment and then they can take that time to make the payment and if some things are not good they can raise a discrepancy they can raise an issue and of course finance here out of this when they are getting the money when they are giving the supply or they might give hundred when they're getting from Tata Motors they'll they'll get hundred and five so they get the cut or it might be the other way around they probably give the supply or ninety five and get hundred that that the supplier was owed from Tata Motors so they get the interest rate cut from from this transaction so in this ecosystem almost everyone benefits right but there are of course challenges the challenges is that it's now this process itself I just showed one shipment right this might be like a periodic shipment with a supplier sending goods to - Tata Motors so it's difficult to get a consistent view of the status across all the shipments across all the entities in this ecosystem there's also the issue of what if the supplier sells this shows this invoice - to financiers now both of them may be sending the money and expect Tata Motors to pay both of them of course Tata Motors not gonna pay both of them is gonna pay only one of them so that becomes an issue rate how do you make sure the supplier is not trying to achieve and it's not showing that in Y is a duplicate version of that invoice two to two people so this is a duplicate invoices are a huge challenge in today's way today there are also challenges about under reporting or over reporting for instance the supplier could say hey Tata Motors has given me these ten invoice the total worth is actually one lakh rupees whereas it might just be ninety thousand tonight so there might be issues such as that that are also problematic because these are all paper documents it can easily be tampered in and so on and they are prone to error rates there's a lot of errors that happen along the way right the supplier will say hey I sent you ten shipments and Tata Motors will say I go I received only eight right so those sorts of discrepancies also happen so all this entire process is fairly manually and it's very expensive and very risky and error-prone and there's a lot of manual Dickens reconciliation that happens between these parties to make sure things happen smoking again they are here with doctrine if you can bring these parties on to a blockchain Network then blockchain can be a single source of truth it also eliminates this issues of of any kind of fraud that might happen it automates this process so you don't have to wait to wait for the other person to manually do some work and and so on so there are act actions and responsibilities for every participant in this ecosystem and that's what is captured in this light and the benefits right so every participant in this ecosystem gets some benefit out of participating in this eco systems that's why they're gonna be they'll be willing to come on to the blockchain and we are already working with Mahindra finance on this in India we're pretty much this use cases what they are targeting with some complexities of course so that comes to the end of what I wanted to talk about how blockchain is being used in a very big way in trade finance and supply chain finance for various kinds of financing so there are a couple of interesting reads as part of our farm reading section this week so one article is on trade finance in SMEs this is by the way World Trade Organization it's an interesting read to say how if we can just make certain changes to the way trade works today there can be significant improvements and benefits especially to smaller media mention of enterprises and that is I think a huge deal for India because we have a huge number of them and it can make a really big difference for the Indian ecosystem for Indian economy then there's also a small a very short two minute video on streamlining trade finance with blockchain so I'd encourage you to to watch that as well thank you [Music]
