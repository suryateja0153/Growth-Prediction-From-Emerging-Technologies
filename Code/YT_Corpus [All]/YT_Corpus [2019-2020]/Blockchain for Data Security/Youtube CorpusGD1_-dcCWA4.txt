 [Music] hello everyone and welcome to this next lecture in our blockchains course we have covered multiple phases of this course we've covered the architecture design of how blockchain platforms are are built and now we're going to get to the next phase of talking about use cases so before we look at the some of the use cases itself with this lecture is going to be a little more at an abstract level about how you should go about thinking about a blockchain application thinking about a use case what are some of the considerations to take when you are building a blockchain application so blockchain itself is from many industries people think it's going to be completely transformative I've just named some of the industries here there are a lot more that people are looking at and there are like hundreds of use cases that people have you look at some of the blogs people are looking at blockchain for all sorts of applications be it in financial services in supply chain and insurance retail in media healthcare there are almost almost every industry is looking at how blockchain would make a difference for them here this is just a very high-level overview of some of the applications over the next few lectures we are gonna take three major industries where the blockchain is going this is later to be make a substantial impact we're going to look at financial services supply chain and logistics and the public sector professes sandy Chakrabarty is going to cover the public sector use cases I'll be covering some of the financial services and supply chain logistics use cases over the course of the next few lectures I hope to impress upon you the transformative nature of this of this technology that is both shape and how you could think of new business models and new applications that were not possible before before blockchain technology was available but before we go to the use cases themselves first let's talk about what makes a good blockchain use case what are the common tenets of a blockchain use case and it may not always be easy and sometimes people fall in the trap of using blockchain when you're not supposed to use it where it might be better done in a centralized fashion so for a blockchain use case you need of course a business problem that needs to be solved so do try to solve a problem that does not exist for anyone anyone if no one cares about it don't try to solve it and of course don't try to solve it using blockchain so there has to be a business problem that people are willing to spend money on spend time on to have it solved and of course it has to be solved using blockchain more efficiently then it can be solved with other technologies assuming there are other technologies that can be used to solve that problem there has to be a business network so there has to be a set of participants and bond some information that these participants are exchanging with each other and some transactions these participants are performing with that exchange information or exchange some that modify this information in some way right so there has to be this business network that is existing may be existing right now or you are creating this mistis network to solve a business problem right it might not be a network that exists today but you're creating it so that you can solve a business problem and of course there has to be a need for trust if there is a no need for trust and everyone in this network every participant of this network is let's say our is willing to trust a single person with all the information all the transactions and if the single person can perform all the transactions and can be a single custodian of all the data you probably don't need a blockchain for that use case so it has to involve multiple parties who do not trust each other but need technology such as blockchain to instill trust so you need an ocean you need consensus immutability finality and provenance of the information that is getting shared part to one part of this trust feature is also the notion of auditability right sometimes it is just a regulator who does not trust the individual entities who wants to see that the individual entities are following due diligence they are following the right set of policies that are set by the regulator and they want the individual organizations to prove that they are actually following policy right so this is actually in the public sector some of these use cases have this notion of auditability providing proof for what you are doing and that again your chain becomes a use case we it it's helpful so what makes a good first blockchain use case so if you're actually trying to do this for the first time let's say you are a company and you are gonna try you're gonna try using blockchain for some of your use cases then what are some of the metrics that you should use to determine which use case you try first because that does have an impact on your perception of the technology itself about how easy it is it is used for instance pick a use case that is fairly limited in scope so that you can test the waters with it right blockchain is not a technology that it's very mature is yet it's too maturing as a technology so I would definitely recommend starting with something very limited in scope saying I'm gonna solve this small problem for my organization or a set of organizations and I'm going to define the scope for that so think of it as a Minimum Viable Product that you gotta build with blockchain that takes maybe that can probably be built in a few weeks think of also a small business network if a problem requires bringing 50 participants into a network versus another problem that requires just maybe five participants start with the network that means just five people to come on board and that gives you a ability to get off the ground quickly and unlike traditional software product where one person can just develop the product put it out there for others to use blockchain is a bit different it does require multiple organizations to agree to come together use a particular join a particular network work as a consortium so for that reason start with a smallish network rate you can then expand build your network over a period of time blockchain is also built in such a way that it allows for scaling more participants in more scenarios in future as we discuss various use cases in some of the first production networks that we have built I will try to emphasize the same principle right we're starting with solving a small problem but we then we have the vision of building it up for an entire industry solving a huge range of use cases using blockchain so that's the Moto rate start small and and grow fast so the next thing is about understanding the business problem so what does it mean what are some of the things you should think of when your honey we are trying to address a business problem what is the problem you're gonna address so define what the scope of that challenge is going to be and sakta said that has a clear goal saying this is the problem statement that I want to address and what is think of what is the current way in which that problem is being addressed maybe partially maybe not at all think of the current process that is being followed that creates this pain point right understand current systems that are involved in this interaction maybe there are no systems maybe it's about people are currently exchanging paper documents today people are probably picking up the phone and calling each other that that could be the business problem and blockchain helps you address and automate some of those things right so understand what current systems are involved and where systems do not exist and identify areas of improvement so I that would be the next step and assuming the business problem is is fairly large then figure out whether some subproblems can be attempted right away what specific aspects of the business problem will this first application try to solve right make your scope of the problem fairly limited so the next step once you've identified what the problem is you've scoped it out clearly then you need to understand who the participants are so who are the Business Network participants or the organizations who are involved what role do they play in this business network if there is no network that's there if you tell me there is just one participant in this in this ecosystem then that probably is not a good blockchain new skills right if it's just one participant you should probably be using some kind of a centralized system maybe a database maybe a web server that you need maybe a combination of those maybe it can be solved with just that you probably don't need a blockchain for that then who are the specific set of people and organizations and what are their job roles understand the key users in the business network and how they interact with each other again this goes back to the ass's process how is the process working currently and in that process clearly identify their users and their roles that they are performing today that might change that or you might want to change that in the future but identify the current set of users and roles now there are many more questions that you can ask yourself and I'm hoping the set of we'll help you think through maybe your first application that you want to try it try out yourself maybe it's a startup that you want to try so in in all of these things I think these can be leading questions that you should ask yourself before diving in so I mentioned who are the participants what are their roles what are the different types of participants how are they gonna access and interact with the blockchain so is this what is their going what are the access control rules who are going to be operating the pure notes who are the big entities here who need to be a part of the network are there going to be some web applications or mobile applications that you need to be that need to be developed that will interact with the blockchain and those are the ones that users and users will use are their gateways there other other exchange other data sources from which data should be gathered and fed to blockchain likewise should the blockchain data be sent to other systems of record think about those things they also think about who is going to operate the blockchain who's going to govern and regulate the blockchain maybe it needs it it requires forming a consortium maybe there is one large player or let's say a large manufacturer who brings in all their suppliers onto a blockchain platform so all of those models are possible we'll talk about that later in this lecture and for each participant each role in this network be very clear about what is the value or the incentive for that participant to join the network if they are better off with their current systems and they don't really have any value to join the network it's going to be very hard for you to convince them to join the network so every participant in this network should have a business incentive to join the network I think this is a very key aspect in the Bitcoin world all you are doing quests are you are exchanging Bitcoin assets or transactions on the network on the network and the set of PR nodes were disjoint from the set of participants right it could be they were two distinct roles and the pure nodes they were getting incentivize through mining and you get a cryptocurrency for it in permission blockchains we are leveraging the fact that in this business ecosystem there is actually a business incentive for all of these participants to join the network and it's important to identify defy that incentive the value that you will be providing for each participant and that's going to be a key part in in growing the network quickly now the next part once you've identified the participants you need to know their identities so do you know all the users who are going to be there how are you going to create the identities so in the Bitcoin world again they were pseudo and anonymous identities that were created so none of these identities were were verified in any way in most business use cases let's say I have a particular organization engaging in business I already have a set of entities I do business with and I do want to recognize I do want to validate the fact that it's only those entities that are actually part of the network I don't want anonymous entities people I don't even know to be joining the network and partaken in partaking in transactions for instance I don't even want them to know that this network exists leave alone seeing data and transactions on the network so in public block chains it's possible to have an identity Oracle could provide the information about who are the identities but in information block block chains including hyper ledger fabric there is a gateway or a controller or consortium that determines the identities of entities or verifies these identities offline so let's say there is a consortium of ten banks they might collectively determine whether 11th bank should be admitted or not and they will verify the identity of the 11th bank before admitting them in so it's not going to be a anonymous user who freely joins the network but they're going to be validating these new new participants every time they join the network so there is going to be some gateway some permissioning that happens offline in fabric actually gives you some of those governance capabilities the next step ok you've identified the network the participants the identities the next step is for you to understand what are the asset assets and transactions so what is the data there is information that is going to get exchanged amongst these participants what are the set of transactions to be performed and what transactions are going to operate on which data and by who okay so all of these need to be identified so identify the assets identify the transactions for each transaction who's who the set of parties or roles who are admitted or permission to perform the transaction and what is the transaction actually going to do it might read two assets right three assets so you need to identify that so it might just be a ownership transfer and so you can define what your transactions are and transactions themselves could be of different types they could be invoke transactions these invoke transactions are going to be recorded on the blockchain these could be add delete change transfer ownership it could be any of these or it could just be a query a query may or may not be added as a transaction on the network and by definition the query only reads data it is not going to be writing any data so it's possible for you to just read one node in the blockchain and and accept whatever information it's giving you so that would be your query right so and for all of these functions think about whether you need to control access so it is possible for you to define access control rules on who can create delete update or even query some of the information that is getting stored on blockchain so the based on the participant and their rules you can define the access control rules so what are some of the additional points of understanding that you need to think about think about how the current process is by the different network participants and think about how you would like it to be in future so it might be think of a completely different way of executing this process maybe some of the existing participants may not even be there so that's the dissenter mediation that you might read a lot in blockchain some of the intermediaries middleman can actually be eliminated in the in the new world and that can significantly improve efficiency reduce cost and so on and once you determine the process you want to go to the eventual process with blockchain identify the benefit for each of the participants with the new business case and also determine what legacy systems are involved and how that how those might change in the future maybe some of the data you're storing in is gonna get changed I talked about paper documents maybe current legacy systems are actually just storing scanned copies of paper documents that is very common in the supply chain in the logistics world today where existing systems although internally within an organization they are all automated there they are actually schools storing scanned documents and whenever they are sending that information to another organization they might actually print it and courier that's that's the reality today but maybe in the future the booth blockchain we are looking to digitize all of this information automatically transfer that over the network and in that case the legacy systems would have to move from accepting these scanned documents to be able to accept digital documents so there might be some changes to legacy systems as well and that is it could be disruptive for in some cases so you'll have to work out what that disruption might be and how systems might change in the future so assessing business value is again a key step for you to be able to succeed in setting up your blockchain network and to grow it what are the existing pinpoints what is for the scope you have defined who are the set of participants assets and transactions for each of them each of the participants what are the benefits and there has to be a minimum benefit right now with the minimum viable product you're grading and of course there has to be a much bigger long-term benefit for them to participate based on other use cases that you might solve for the same network we'll talk about some of these networks and how we can start small with one use case and grow to to solving many other use cases and of course after all of this there has to be a cost benefit analysis almost always the blockchain system is going to be much more costly for you to implement than using a centralized system so the benefit of using a blockchain system has to outweigh the cost of running that blockchain network and often it has to outweigh multifold because these are disruptive in nature you are asking people to throw away existing ways of doing work of doing business and to move to new ways and they that there will be a resistance if the benefit does not significantly outweigh the cost so that's a very important consideration for use cases and with the use cases that we will see will be apparent that some of the benefits are significantly more than the cost what the costs are and how are some ways in which you can build a blockchain network one way is a consortium based network where there might be an existing consortium of banks or there may be a new set of banks new consortium that's formed among a set of banks these are happening already banks are one of the foremost ways of for most players in the market who are forming these consortiums but consortiums can also be formed by other providers there are healthcare consortiums coming up there are consortiums in the supply chain world they're all getting built today because they all have a common business problem they want to solve and there is an incentive for them to participate in this consortium and leverage the benefits of blockchain so some of the examples I can cite iBM is involved in some of them IBM there's a food trust that we are working in partnership with Walmart and many other supply chain players we have a ongoing project with Japan Stock Exchange so this is to bring in some of the securities trading capabilities used to use blockchain and again V dot trade is a consortium of banks that have come together for trade finance right so those are some of the consortium based networks the other network kind of network could be a find founder a directed network so there could be a large company sometimes even a regulator brings together several other members in the ecosystem and convinces them to come on and join our network right so there'll be an individual founder this is usually a strong player or a big entity in the ecosystem today and they influenced a lot of other smaller members to join the network and we have a couple of examples we will talk about that in when we talk about some of the use cases again primarily in the financial services ecosystem third could be a community based network so this could be already a set of set of entities using some existing system for instance Swift is a community in some sense rates a Swift ISM message exchange mechanism amongst banks so it's a secure way of exchanging messages and there are many banks that are already part of the Swift ecosystem so those set of banks they're already using Swift to communicate to each other it might be easy for them to come on to blockchain and use blockchain for their information exchange and for sharing processes well likewise there is also supply chain ecosystems as supply chain communities they are already a community that they're that are using some form of a system today to exchange messages it might be a centralized system today but then they have an incentive to move to a decentralized mode so that could be a community based network and there are many of these examples and typology of fabric gives you some of the governance mechanisms for initiating and building some of these networks so with that that gives you the overview of how to go about setting up a network how to go about thinking about a blockchain use case and there are some very nice articles that kind of explain the same principles if there's a nice article from ETH Zurich that it has a title do you need a blockchain so they have a nice way of explaining when to use a blockchain when not to use a blockchain they actually have a nice flow chart right they take you through different questions and based on whether you answer yes or no you should you should should and shouldn't should or should not use a blockchain so it's a nice read it's a fun treat it's also a Harvard Business Review article about the truth about blockchain it talks about again when to use blockchain but it also talks about some of the some of the aspects I talked about how it's going to be disruptive some of the things you need to think about before jumping to use blockchain so it's a it's a nice read as well with that I think over the next few lectures we're gonna dive into some of the industries specifically financial services first then supply chain and finally the public sector and government use cases this is gonna use these as highlights for how a complete industry can be transformed using blockchain and there's a host of applications in each of these industries so see you soon on some of these lectures thank you
