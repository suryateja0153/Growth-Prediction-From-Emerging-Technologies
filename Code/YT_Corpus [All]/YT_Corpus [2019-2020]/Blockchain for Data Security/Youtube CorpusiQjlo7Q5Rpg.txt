 it's really a pleasure to welcome Gal Hochberg who is CEO of Clear BlockChainTechnologies thank you Hugo. hello everyone thank you I'm Gal Hockberg, co-founder of clear and we are going to talk about blockchain but first I want to say something lighter I'm gonna talk about a missing link in the digital transformation process of our businesses so a quick reveal I'm sure everybody in this room knows about digital transformation but it's happened in media in hospitality in retail in entertainment there's new companies and old companies turning into full digital experiences in the way they work with customers and the way they work internally and it's in a good time too because customers are looking for this right they want stuff now they want it fast they want it better and more and more higher quality than it was before and this is true both for things that were over there already solved like you know transportation that's happening but also things that are gonna happen in the future such as you know self-driving cars real presence in AI now this big shift that's actually only happened last you know 10 20 years is putting a lot of pressure on providers to change the way that they work right so you have to be digital you have to be a fast you have to work with partners that are better way because if you don't you're going to be left behind and basically we're at an inflection point right so both for our personally in our lives and if you think about the last 15 years the amount of changes we've each --tx perience in the way we interact with the world due to the digital transformation and also for our businesses in the way that they provide services to their customers how they work with partners and how they deliver and you can either you know get this and make this happen or like tal said you know have a start-up mentality or you can be left behind so let's talk about how that happens so there's a lot of technologies that come in to making this work and this is an analysis that was done by the World Economic Forum a digital transformation of different technologies that people are using to digital transformation so we you know you see here things you know old things like mainframes but also new things like IOT big data web 2.0 and that's you know getting trapped more and more shanell but there is a missing link there is something people are not thinking about so much when they think about digital transformation so let's look at this example in many of businesses today when you provide a service to a customer when you when you're trying to you know do something for a consumer you don't do it alone you have to work with other companies to manufacture things to transport things to provide communication to sell for you like influencers so you're actually part of this big wide supply chain that works together to provide the end service and this is I think especially interesting in situations like you know uber and Airbnb and those in Amazon here as well of course where you are they're a hundred percent dependent on their partners to actually provide the service right they're just coordinating a lot of different companies to make this happen so let's for this example take a look we have two companies on the left and on the right let's say the left one is selling to a consumer and the right one is a manufacturer and they've each invested a lot of time and effort in making their business digital and the best that it can be it by doing analytics and big data in AI internally to optimize their processes or using things like you know mobile to reach out to consumers IOT to collect data from the real world using advertising to write find the right users so they've each done this independently and now they have to work together to make something work and the way that they can work together pretty much is they can do ap ice right they can try to connect their systems to each other and and that's it and the missing thing here the thing that we all know we all feel every day to live P as business people it's a lot of our work is that there's another interaction that happens on that human layer right that interaction of closing the deal the interaction of writing the contract the under action of sharing sensitive information and sometimes a lot of a lot of sensitive information to make this relationship work right to figure out how much we have to pay to figure out what we're all during to make this happen to make this actually really ship work and transferring funds and interestingly enough in the vast majority of cases those those top four things happen entirely or manually there's just people and they might send emails right were passed the physical paper sometimes but not in all industries but you know you get the PDFs and you have to read them and so he has to compare them to the contracts and the Excel what did we send and was this the right price and there's this whole song and yet the other prism is always on vacation there's a whole song and dance to make this stuff work and the reason we do it manually is because we need to trust right Computers machines it's hard to trust them they when they make mistakes there's not there's not much accountability to it but when you work with another person you have they have accountability you know who they are if they do something wrong there's there's ways to sue them right there's a legal system to protect you and because all our tools around trusts reputation accountability enforcement are human tools based on people doing things all our interactions that require trust have to stay in this human realm and this is work pretty well in the last you know since the beginning of history but now we're in a different time so something that's very interesting is that if you look at global enterprise commerce it's something that's growing larger and larger based on analysis of Juniper research in McKinsey there's a hundred and fifty trillion dollars in b2b cross-border payments this is just business this is just business to business just cross-border it doesn't include all the internal company trade which in large companies is also huge so these are really really big numbers and it's just growing more and more and more and the reason is that as the world goes up comes online as companies develop they provide more and more services to the global economy and this does have an overhead so on the on the left there there's a hundred and forty billion dollars just in fees for payments for cross for cross-border this isn't about the human work the manual labor it's has just fees to move money around so we're talking about really really big numbers you know just for context US healthcare is a few trillions right so this is this is a very very large amount of money that has to move around it's part of the supply chain so this is not gonna work because what we get is manual economies you have to work with more peers you have to work with more companies and you have to have people everywhere doing this yeah you have to for every new relationship you have to have somebody to manage that and make that work in a back office I heard I read a nice tweet the other day that says a life skill for the 21st century knowing how to choose a vendor right because if you choose a bad one you're you have a big problem so how can we solve this if we were able to somehow move a lot of that work from that human level down to a machine Lab so sort of build an API for trusts then we would be able to automate a lot of those things right if what we would like to do the best experience would be you you find someone you talk to them you can automatically on your phone figure out you know the reputation of their company and then close the deal and then it's done no more send it to the people who have to sign it for five weeks and it doesn't get approved and then we don't know the bank accounts and you have - none of that right you're just supposed to be able to close the deal like you closed like you order an uber so to do that we're gonna have to build methods for trust on that lower level so machine-readable enforceable ways to do reputation to do attribution to do enforcement when machines are interacting with each other and to do that we're gonna need some sort of share trust layer right because who's gonna be the who's gonna own that who's gonna be able to enforce that sort of interaction so that's what we're doing we're taking the process you see on the Left which is a generic process that many companies experience and we're focused on wholesale trade so this is this is more about you know trading where you have legal and management and sales and account all working together and this is a very complicated process to make stuff happen close the deal move the money and move it into a shared source of truth between multiple companies where the deal can take place instantly and automatically now there is the word I didn't say blocking until now so there is the word blocking down at the bottom and I want to say why that's an important piece of this vision so people have talked about this for a long time and it's been really hard to do and the reason is if you go to somebody who does trading and tell them I'm gonna run a cloud service give me all your vendor lists all your contracts every single piece of money that you pay someone they're gonna say hell no I'm not gonna give some central party all my information you're gonna screw me it's gonna leak you know I can't do that for privacy reasons and when you have an ecosystem people want to keep their information to their self that's that's their trade secret right who you're buying from what the price is is something you're not gonna share with other people what your inventory is and so you're stuck in the situation of either not having enforcement because it's just Wild West and everybody does whatever they want to do or you have to give up control to a central party and we've seen the problems of that you know in in privacy recently a lot in the social networks what we can do with blockchain as a technical tool right is build a network that can enforce that well that you have to that when you do something on it you can't take it back that if you have a contract you have to do it as you said without creating a central party so you'd be able to share information with the technology that we built and with blockchain technology only with your peers and know that if they break their commitments you'll be able to enforce it using this blush and that's not the hold into any specific party so you don't get locked in you don't get you know nobody controls the ecosystem and you get all the good things of enforcement so for people from the finance world it's like a decentralized Clearing House in that sense so our vision we want to build what we call trade grids which are these networks where businesses can on-demand close deals share information just with who they need to share information and have the assurance that the contracts are going to be executed according to the to the actual information and we've been working on this for a while it's a it's a it's a it's a pretty big vision so we've decided to start with a specific industry and we've done work with telecommunications and in the last year and a half what we've done is go to telco companies and they have a lot of international trade because telcos have to do international trade because we wanna make phone calls and surf the internet around the world and help them transform their international calling the roaming their data contracts with each other to digital blocks and enforceable contracts and you've done this with some British companies like BT and Vodafone but also with European companies Asian companies and US companies and we're seeing now it's a long process right what we're seeing now is that they they use it it works for them it saves them in their back office and if they're starting to roll it out and actually this came out I think two days ago there's a group of a ten fifteen telco companies who are announced they're launching a blocking Network where we're one of the providers to do this on a global scale around the world I want to add one more thing it's not just about data so the other thing that we're doing is working on payments a lot of the challenges that we're discussed are not just about sharing data and contracts but actually moving the money a unique challenge of global payment is that payment is optimized for local payment it's easier to pay to somebody in the same country if using somebody far away and so we're also working with financial institutions to bill if you guys have heard of you guys have heard of libera so build and we've been working on this before but an enterprise sort of version of that where you could put money in and trade with your liberal partners thank you gal thank you very much indeed I'm going to say I'm very pleased I don't work in the back office of a company doing accounting and things because you're probably going to put me out of a job quicker than anyone else but that was really very insightful indeed thank you
