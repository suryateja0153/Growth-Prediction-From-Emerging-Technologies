 welcome to this is my architecture I'm died from a dress today I'm joined by shrimp a Cote and engineer ocean prix - pet thank you for joining us thank you for having me so tell us about shipwrecks and the u.s. system and in simplex cooperation we have been developing systems and introducing them to the financial institutions as our main target a recently created currency industry has been growing rapidly simplex has been offered numerous opportunity to drop clips concentrating assistance and today I'm going to introduce you to currency wallet system and its architecture so let's move on to the actual overview could you introduce a point over key system in the cryptocurrency arena we need to manage various crypto currencies such as Bitcoin it's very empty name a few as it is not certain that which currency will become mainstream so it was necessary for us to build a system that we can our currency services at any time with this we also assume that the number of companies using this water system we increase our times a company a B and C and therefore we have a clique tipless system to be a m2m mapping and being the companies and M being the currencies any company may use as many currency services as they want great because you decode these components like companies and currencies to be scared exactly to reduce the additional operations cost at cryptocurrencies service increased we have an optical service application architecture so let's dive into the architecture and the data group how can we use this system there are two important parts in wallet system our first is visual Chris currency and the second is the posting it when a visual request a made a company service it will be sent to the API a clear way for the target currency service we have separated API gateways for each currency service the regional logic is written in a lander and then the transfer requests and sent to the taco container participating into the cryptocurrency proctoring Network great highs depositing case in the post in case we accept the cryptocurrency the transactional data or blocks are going to be accepted by a docker container and they're written to DynamoDB DynamoDB was to name the block notification to SNS and notify each company service great so when building the word system we need to handle large data set how can you manage it point is how we manage a logical operator as some of the change have hundreds of gigabytes block readers so when synchronizing the block data from scratch it may take several days to catch up we manage this by persisting the block needed to EBS and taking regular snapshot this enables us to repeat we launched a new docker container new docker container and synchronize the blockchain Network great I understand Interborough be a snapshot is very important great so security is also important in your system is there any point regarding security and one with the most important point in your wallet system is how to protect the private key is for making certain actions and base query we manage supply with key off line and protect against I have outside hacking attempts but only the field online operation requirements we manage supply with key using cloud HSM a cloud system is located in a separate PPC and exposed to apply this link so you manage the access to the key directory like exactly all components have appropriate security groups assigned to them to ensure minimum access great its security best practice so finally could you share a good point on building sorry building block change system on address the point for offering additional cryptocurrency services or adding new companies if you have high reproducibility and speed and clutter Commission we neighbor us to is significantly lower the powerful adding services and we think this is a bigger demand subscribe button like AWS another advantage is managed services or subbers applications which neighbors to extend our services at a lower operational overhead awesome thank you for sharing this resist thank you for watching this is my acting you
