it's not directly an application of blockchain technology itself but it is so much a part of the ecosystem of crypto finance with well over 90% and some crypto currencies 95 to 98% of the actual transactions happening on crypto exchanges so I thought that no course in clutching technology and money could really be complete without talking about crypto exchanges but I I wanted to steer say not to be looking throughout these talk today and even on Thursday when we'll also be talking about crypto exchanges with some outside guests about where are we lowering the cost of verification or where are we lowering the networking cost this is about basically the secondary markets in this two hundred two hundred billion dollar ecosystem and the first crypto exchanges came about actually in 2000 late in 2010 I think it was but it may have been early eleven because just when there was one blockchain application Bitcoin people wanted to move Bitcoin it was like well how can I do this I can do it with another individual on a blockchain but there was even how do I find that other individual if I want to sell it or exchange it and so there was a business opportunity mount GOx was one of the first three or four I don't think it was literally the first one but it was one of the first handful that started to take off we'll talk about mount GOx that failed dozens if not hundreds failed early on but they were trying to provide a user experience to trade initially just solely Bitcoin Bitcoin versus fiat was really what it was and it was providing also a service to people that were not as technologically adept as some of the MIT students so I was gonna ask again and by show of hands how many in the room have ever owned a bit of cryptocurrency or something like that just alright so it's a third to a half but you'll see it's going to be a far fewer even in this MIT community have done that directly on the block a blockchain as well so is it a lien anybody else so of the thirty hints that went up the other twenty nine basically have done it through a crypto exchange so they provide a service right there you know there's a central irony that Satoshi nakamoto's impetus the motivation that we've talked about was how to do peer-to-peer movement of value on the internet without central authorities this failed attempt throughout the 90s that finally he or she solved that riddle in 2008 here is a decentralized way to move value around the Internet and here even at MIT the 30 or so of you or 40 of you that have owned a crypto asset but one of you now this is Sloane and it's not computer science and AI class but I suspect even over in the computer science class it would be less than half actually have gone and downloaded the nodes because there's a convenience factor it's human nature and and and so that even started in 2010 so I wanted to talk a little about crypto exchanges some of their challenges and some of the opportunities and it will set up also for Thursday's discussion where we'll be talking about how a crypto exchange might be used for a payment solution and how an entrepreneur like Jeff sprecher really has looked at and said no this is where he can see value you will hear Thursday somebody who is true to his entrepreneurial skills is trying to find value in this whole blockchain technology Bitcoin world and has chosen kind of a mixture of a payment solution and a crypto exchange for both this might not be tied in so I'll do it the old-fashioned way so we're gonna talk of course the readings crypto exchange is a little bit of the public policy challenges and then my thoughts on path forward where do I see the crypto exchange space moving forward in time so Tom you get to answer another question how has crypto exchanges become critical gateways for right so let's go the other side cuz a lien was the one hand it went off that you've downloaded notes have you ever used a crypto exchange if you're willing this year so you've done both right right so if it were 2018 now and you were to transact in Bitcoin would you prefer to use a crypto exchange or the nodes that you just Bitcoin that's neat your mom uses Bitcoin okay so even somebody whose computer literate and has both the nodes and the exchange is saying depends on how tired I am and what my goals security's goals maybe you didn't say tired but and and anybody want to hit the second question which type of disputes then right and and how do these exchanges compared to traditional exchanges so the New York Stock Exchange had us had as coinbase compared to New York Stock Exchange so you're saying they have reserves so coinbase itself so one change difference I'm gonna highlight three and see if we can get off from this discussion one is the exchange itself might be on the other side of the transaction from you Alexis caught that that they had a reserved some might call that market-making I'm sorry right so a corollary to what Alexis says that they might be a market maker remind me your first name Ian what Johnny is that they take on brokerage responsibilities in the world of finance on on trading platforms trading platforms by and large early on did not allow the public to transact the New York Stock Exchange when it started in the late 18th century by an arrangement between members in the south of Manhattan you know near Wall Street for the physical Wall Street literally it was a Membership Society or membership club and you had to be a member to transact well those membership and clubs just like a golf club or a tennis club had a set of rules well before governments got involved and they would transact that became what what is now known as intermediated access that that I don't think any of you are members of the New York Stock Exchange are you I'm not either so we can't actually transact with the New York Stock Exchange but we can use an app like Robin Hood and ask them to transact the New York Stock Exchange or Goldman Sachs or Vanguard or you know whom so that's caught intermediated access so two things we've had is one is coinbase might be the other side to theirs they don't they lack intermediated access Eric right so Eric says the third big difference I mean there are other differences but the third big difference is crypto exchanges store the value the New York Stock Exchange did not store the value that your value is technically ultimately on a ledger at the depository trust Corp DTCC and just like the payment system has the central bank and commercial banks securities lectures have a central ledger which is DTCC in the US and in other countries other similar clearing organizations and underneath it or the brokers that hold things it's called in street name but whatever it's called know that most exchanges traditional securities markets the those are the three big difference custody intermediated access and who's making markets against you please they'll report well so you're raising a question of the difference between cash markets and derivative markets which exist and have existed for a couple hundred years that in a cash market you're selling an ownership right and buying an ownership right in a stock and a bond or even in Bitcoin and then in derivative markets you're you're entering into a contract or sometimes people call them contract for differences but a contract that's going to relate to a price a pricing mechanism from some of Oracle it can be Claude in computer science that we call it an Oracle but in in the commodities market by some index provider some pricing provider that's the differences between cash and derivatives but I are you saying something even in addition to that right right so I I asked you all to go as deep as you can between now and Thursday because you'll have the founder of ice with us but ice is a one-day futures contract that literally you're buying a derivative of Bitcoin but it's a very unusual futures contract because it has to be a hundred percent collateralized so there's no margin there's no ability to have leverage or debt or credit extension and one day later you get delivered the Bitcoin so one of the interesting questions for Thursday that you compress Jeff and Kelly on is is this really a derivatives contract or is it a form of a cash contract that just starts as as derivative in 24 hours later it becomes cash because it's 100% collateralized and it settles one day later very unusual future contract I'm not aware of any other one day future 100% collateralized contract it feels to me that this is in essence a cash contract by another name for one day that facilitates being regulated by a official regulator for derivatives that's for that one but I I thought you're saying one other thing is can you sell short Bitcoin does anybody Shawn has shorted ether Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash so how'd you do it shorting is selling something you don't own and and and taking the opposite price risk in essence winning when a price goes down and losing when a price goes up and it's existed for hundreds of years it's not new but it too short something in most markets you need to be able to borrow the underlying to sell a stock that you don't own there's a whole market called stock borrow where ultimate and we debated this one day and there you're experts in this room that have worked in stock borrow will you borrow the security and then you sell it or you sell it and within the two days that you have to deliver it your broker borrows it for you so I'm assuming show on that when you shorted Bitcoin what was behind that app somebody borrowed it and so just move to the third question three big differences we're gonna dig into these custody intermediated broke you know basically do you have an intermediary or you direct and is the exchange a market maker what are all the hacks and manipulation and so forth tell you about the state of security of these and the state of market integrity yeah so so in essence that regardless of where you come out on pro regulation or anti regulation or pro-business or anti business or pro Bitcoin or anti it's a question of trust when you're losing a lot of assets to theft and a hack is just another word for stealing or you're losing money to market manipulation then that tends to have you know lower trust in these institutions we can debate what to do about it I have a point of view and I'm going to share it with you as we go through this class today but you don't need to share the second part which is where I am one how to address that to recognize that the high level of custody issues and the high level of market manipulation issues probably is associated with lower trust in these institutions even though there's you know 30 million plus people that have used crypto exchanges and 30 or 40 people in this class so there's there is a level of trust I'm just saying that I think that's the what's really at the middle of them yes so let's have so we had a bunch of readings I'll skip over that so crypto exchanges so this is what a centralized exchange does there's about 200 of them probably in the history of Bitcoin there's a hundred to two under that have already opened and shut you know so somewhere in the history there's been three or four hundred it's still pretty darn decentralized in terms of the number of them and Isles later say I think one of the things that will happen is we'll see more consolidation there's just so many of them that's an unusual market structure markets usually coalesce around some central pricing function you want to buy and sell your apples hundreds of years ago you'd come into the center market if you wanted to get the best price discovery so so the question is do we have so many crypto exchanges in part because of lots of different regulation I think that contributes to it I would say yes but I don't think that's the only reason so you're saying traditional exchanges there was the extra specially for physical courts apples there was a locational advantage of being in the central square I agree with that there was locational advantages to be in new york or london you know in the 19th century the philadelphia stock exchange was bigger than the new york stock exchange until about the 1840s or 50s post-civil war New York took off compared to Philadelphia but there is locational advantages but in a digital age there's less locational advantages I agree with that I also think it's very early days in some regards it doesn't take much there's one software provider that provides the software for over 100 crypto exchanges they're not the biggest ones because some of the biggest ones write their own software but it's at least the CEO that told me this who runs the software company said that it was over 20 percent and maybe 30 percent of the volume so half of the crypto exchanges that a quarter of the volume all have the same software meaning the software for the order book for the for the for the custody solutions and things like that you too could start a crypto exchange please be compliant with securities law if you're gonna operate here in the US well actually if you're gonna operate in any country but particularly in the u.s. so it's not hard to store it up that's one other thing it's not hard to start up a crypto exchange right now if you've got a software provider they can give you basically a package and you put a new name on it and off you're going but they're matching agents meaning they're matching buys and sells they are also counterparties which we talked about and they're custodians traditional exchanges do the first but they tend not to do the second and third decentralized exchanges decentralized exchanges are very small part of the market we'll see some numbers later that estimated it's a little less than one half of one percent of the volume right now in October of 2018 but their computer algorithm that allows you to trade peer-to-peer without a centralized and there's a lot of variation in the decentralized space and I'll take any questions on it but it's it's an interesting piece where it's saying Kelly and I don't really need coinbase to trade if there's some application that can find each of us and we can find each other Ross is I understand correctly centralized only thing imagination very good correct right it just doesn't have the other two right true right so Ross is raised or decentralized really centralized for matching and don't have the other two let me answer it in Reverse decentralized exchanges do not have any custody function no custody function though I could envision that somehow they could set up decentralized escrow function through some multi-sig you could technologically even do that decentralized but what I know now is none of them have a custody solution and none of them are counterparties that that is accurate it's not clear that all of them are centralized there's one developer there's one set of computer technologists but you can actually if you wish put that algorithm out and just say that was a fun project I'm a computer scientist at MIT and just put it out there and Kelly and I could find each other but usually there's an economic model where somebody's trying to make some money and so then there's some centralization of the software and the SEC just brought their first legal action last week against a decentralized exchange and it was in essence against the software developers now there's the first amendment don't get me wrong there is clearly a freedom of speech and freedom of expression in this country but you could be a software developer and still be complicit in some crime and both the SEC and CFTC have in the past 12 months brought in legal actions against software developers and it's interesting that in the last week the SEC they settled it was sort of a thing where a third Delta had put a decentralized trading platform for what do you think the SEC is most interested in what type of what's that icos yeah so is a decentralized platform to trade a theory of base more specifically ERC 20 tokens decentralized the LAN and I could trade our ERC 20 tokens but this did they said no no that's a securities exchange so is it and it's the first action the Securities and Exchange Commission has brought against any crypto exchange why they picked at these centralized to be their first that's a story I don't know but they did so that's decentralized it was less than half percent of the volume but an interesting and tough you know new area and it brings you back to maybe Nakamoto more vision decentralized so as I said responsible just like in this classroom for probably 95% of the Bitcoin and ether transactions who do you think the biggest sellers are on in Bitcoin around the globe what's that miners right miners do do you think the biggest sellers of ether F is anybody what's that I see what you say I see OS yes because I see o is 80% of ICS are done Oni theorem and generally in the early days they were selling a token for Bitcoin when Vitalik booter ended his and he sold F for Bitcoin but we've moved in the last 12 months it's basically selling for F so then you you want to sell it generally speaking I mean they might keep some over 30 million direct members and as we talked about they lack intermediated access and as we'll see market integrity rules so this is you know the market as it is the most important part of this slide to me in this discussion is not the volatility which we now and frankly actually recently we haven't had much till atif or six months but six months isn't enough statistical relevance to say what the next six years or 60 years will be but 54 percent is Bitcoin the theorem is what sixteen percent so between them that's seventy percent so we already know in the US and in many other jurisdictions that three-quarters of the market or not I cos or not what we be caught securities even in the US Canada and Taiwan the three jurisdictions that follow something similar to the Howey test that we've talked about three quarters of the market is non securities it's just a commodity a cash crypto so you'll hear debates about initial coin offerings and what's a security what's not a security relevant relevant and important debate but for three quarters of the market it's not particularly relevant as a legal matter as a regulatory matter Brodus so is British is your question that if if there's limited volatility what's the value of an exchange the value is still is that some people will want to sell that asset or buy that asset some people might if it's a store of value I might still want to sell that store value so that I can buy a car or go to school or pay for my medical bills you don't think that's as exciting as a volatile asset is that what you're saying British well like Goldman Sachs for years it used to be that I was taught volatility as their friend when you're an investment investment banking business and making markets a market maker likes volatility so you might be thinking as a market maker as an investment banker but I fit I still think that that if Bitcoin or any of these became very stable stores of value people still want to trade in and out of it but you're saying it's just less exciting for you or for the market you think oh okay I don't either so here the top crypto exchanges I caution this is a was printed a week ago it's it's only accurate to say that a web group crypto compare plugs puts out a monthly report and I grab the October report but I would there's no confidence that these numbers are accurate except for I can tell you crypto compare has relationships with about a hundred and forty exchanges and those 140 exchanges give their information to crypto compare but here are the big ones what what do you take from this slide when you look at the either the average trade side that trades in 24 hours the volumes anything I mean has anybody traded on an exchange that's not listed there if you're willing to say hey LAN house isn't listed in the top 14 look at that for the month of October buy crypto compare Sabrina what's that true coin oq coin pulling axe which is definitely smaller than this poll so the US based exchanges aren't up there so we don't know if these numbers are accurate they are what crypto compared collects from a hundred and forty exchanges but it doesn't mean they are accurate one way they can be inaccurate is an exchange can just outright lie and if there's no roller law against it they can do that another way they can do it is they can be honest about the numbers but inflate the numbers through something called wash trades wash trades are banned in the u.s. under securities laws and under Commodity Futures Trading Commission laws a wash trade is when I buy something and sell something at the same time basically to myself or my affiliate or my colleague and if I have even if a lot and I are not even legally affiliated but if I sell something day long and he buys it and we have an agreement that we are just pumping the volume for some reason that's a wash sale why would somebody do a wash sale between two unaffiliated parties want to think devious think like you know a manipulator yeah you wanted to make sure somebody else thought something was used what's the aw that's use another reason so artificial liquidity and one other thing that you might show an order fishel price that Gil so watch sales for long time in markets was a good way for manipulators to khana Hey look at this liquidity look at this price pricing signals so that's why in the US Securities and commodities markets we say no it's it's it's a it's it's one small core thing that's not allowed but there's no ban on washe sales though there's there's academic literature there's some studies some competitors some some exchanges study other exchanges they they have a lot of wash sales over there so we don't know how real these volume figures are um the other thing that I find interesting is the average trade side two hundred to a thousand bucks a couple of them a couple thousand I mean these are not large transactions Kelly basically 20 20 million account so I went around trying to find a list of the membership and I couldn't find it for others and maybe it's kind of it's a little harder than pumping your numbers through wash trading I mean you could also lie about your membership and even coinbase is 20 million doesn't mean they're active members claim base so here is another way to look at it is by legal jurisdiction same database you're gonna have eight or ten slides to the same database coinbase is in the US and this would say that it was a little less than a hundred and forty thousand oh I can't quite see where that line comes maybe it's a hundred million a day and this is just the month of October so that's where Shaun it's listed there and the seychelles at 300 for bait Pro I'm not sure why it's not listed on this it's the same database it's not there yeah there it is number five number five so what would you take around around this about the the great financial centers of the world yes all right so the question is this looks like a lot more volume that's actually happening and I'm going to agree with you why do you think that's possible two reasons right mommy your first name Jack sir Jack's point is well maybe not all of this is going to the blockchain it's happening on a spreadsheet in some cases in Excel spreadsheet but I'm not aware of anybody storing it even on a blockchain within the coin base or Kraken or bubai's system second reason so it might be using a second layer solution or a lightening or second layer that's quite possible even though I'm not aware if there's a lot of activity third reason there's a lot of currency crosses here this is not just Bitcoin there's probably two to three thousand different pairs that get traded on any day Bitcoin ether Bitcoin dollar Bitcoin tether you can Bitcoin Bitcoin cash but a lot of the the crosses across in foreign currency land is two currencies it's often called a currency pair US dollar versus you are US dollar versus yet these recurrency pairs but now we can if we can use the same terminology here there's thousands of crosses or pairs so it's not all Bitcoin but the first reasons the biggest one what Jack said not all of these exchanges will settle to a blockchain immediately in fact it's costly even for them so they'll take some price risk and if they have enough customers and their market making on the other side they'll take some Christ risk and they might settle to the blockchain multiple times a day but only settle when there have exposure and I don't know their risk management might be I'll settle when I'm long ten Bitcoin or short ten Bitcoin but take some price exposure that risk management in essence coinbase or cracking or gemini or who buy or basic saying I'll take some price exposure and only settle to the ultimate settlement finality the blockchain several times a day which of course takes ten to sixty minutes as well so that that's happened here good observation yes Isabel yes so Isabella's raised the koi bass promotes that they have a secure custody solution and part of it is keeping your Bitcoin off of the network the term is keeping it in cold wallets instead of a hot wallet anybody know what a hot wallet is Eric its software based wallet that's connected currently connected as opposed to a wallet that's disconnected and not signed up let me hold that question because I've got a slide on that but yes the answer is others also have cold storage mount GOx five years ago didn't have much cold storage but what other observation here about the great financial centers of the world James they're tax havens lotta finance in ok X now again whether the finance and okay X numbers are legit you're Hong Kong right yeah you're Hong Kong yeah the British Virgin Islands Seychelles you know it's kind of so there's some regulatory arbitrage going on and these are the countries where they're registered not necessarily the country of the real operations some are were Hugh buys one that started in in the People's Republic but in Beijing but they rear edge' stirred elsewhere you mean you don't know them does anybody want it's a Priya there you go I'm surprised that you haven't learned about this financial center okay uh-huh James is gonna tell us more about it and how much it costs to go I'm an Expedia during sip week I think Sloan's would benefit from a sure trip okay so this is a different way to measure if this is not on volume I'm gonna take a second this is just number of major exchanges and there's the eight big ones in the u.s. starting with the biggest coinbase bit tracks Polonia acts that we talked about crack and Gemini it bit those are the ones they're kind of us-based that some of you in the u.s. might have I think on this chart if you don't find your exchange on this chart I would be alright alright maybe because they might have already failed whatever exchange you have but Eric who are you looking for all right these slides are all beyond canvas I'm sorry joke Quinn you had a question so what all of the exchanges did very early on this is starting right in late 10 and and 11 they set up a count structure literally on Excel spreadsheets been an account structure for all of their customers and let's say that you're buying Bitcoin and Kelly a selling maybe I could I could do that transaction between you and Kelly right on on this is gonna be called the Gensler exchanged right on the Gensler exchange so I don't need to move that to the blockchain because oh one really important thing what happens when you open an account I'm sorry it's a good question now I realized I skipped over something what happens when you open an account at a crypto exchange only you do you might do KYC naml but that's not what we're looking for you what's it what you you might be but actually what I'm looking for is what happens to your I have Bitcoin and I open an account or I have US dollars and I open an account I summon a user agreement with them that they're gonna store any of my crypto in their name coinbase kraken who by they are not storing it in alphas name I don't know if you have an account but I'm just using you if alpha has an account he signs a user agreement he says when I buy Bitcoin it's in a at best it's on this excel spell it's probably better in an Excel spreadsheet but it's in their database in alphas name but on the Bitcoin blockchain it's in a bunch of Bitcoin addresses that coinbase controls or cracking controls we has a nametag on a separate ledger you have some legal rights against crack in her Gemini I mean you you you do I mean correct that's correct and so because both of you Kelly and you have signed some agreement they're moving Bitcoin to Kelly and Bitcoin to you or if you put US dollars in and you're buying Bitcoin but it's because the market the customers want it that way too so decentralized exchange is again based on crypto compares these are the top five in October by volume but it's these are not the five you read about most the article that you read talked about others so I don't have the deep confidence in these but I these are the numbers of crypto compare could pull together and you can see they're much smaller numbers in aggregate in the crypto compare database it's only 0.4% of the volume so how many of you have Robin Hood app on your phones no 10 of you do you pay any fees for securities transactions to remind me of your name here no anybody pay any fees to Robin Hood no that kind of neat well you do you pay some fees okay and your name is Isaac right so Isaac's guide they saw your data and they so your flow what was the third thing you said okay all right so three things your data your flow and what I said caught float but I could call that they have the Securities to lend stock bar or stock lend and those are the three ways how does Facebook make money they have your data so we live in a time where we're platforms sell your data and use your data to sell advertisement all right so there's a premium service where you maybe could get further they sell your flow what that means is there are parties that will pay brokerage houses payment for order flow Vanguard does it as well it's not fidelity probably does I'm not certain but many big brokerage firms when we all work with them and my account at Vanguard I have zero commissions but I know they're selling my Porter flow so who would be interested in the data or who is interested in the flow okay okay now who's interested in the data or the actual order flow of financial transactions Tom wait hedge funds what type of trading entities high-frequency traders so I believe that that Robin Hood signed contracts with initially I think three and then five high frequency trading shops and I've been told a number of those names I don't know if they're public so I'm not going to repeat them on the camera but but big a couple of them us-based high frequency trading shops why would a high frequency trading shop but pay for it Daniel why would a high frequency trading shop pay for so they think there's some value Isaac yeah you confront right right so anybody have read you know some of the books on high-frequency trading you confront rum but there's also value to answer regime's question there's value in the order flow because if you can see that the markets leaning just a little bit this way even for a few seconds you can optimize your algorithms and make money off of that and the US equity markets well over 60% of the US equity markets are trading with high-frequency trading right now any daily volume in the commodity markets when I was at the CFTC some some contracts we thought it could be as much as 90 percent the SP 500 futures contract or the interest rate contracts very significantly and they they provide a service there's a market making function those high-frequency traders do and they and mostly they do it legally but there's a value to that order flow and so payment for order flow is a very critical part of financial markets all the way around the globe and any highly liquid currency market bond markets equity markets and yes Bitcoin so Robin Hood Aaron do you trade Bitcoin on arity trade regular equity it's on your phone all right but the one or two times you used it you had zero fee because some trading house in Chicago has a contract with Robin Hood to do that and Jeff sprecher who you'll meet Thursday will tell you Robin Hood with five million accounts now that's a real threat to the brokerage model why why why would people of mostly of your generation or Millennials because you're not just some of your Gen X's I think but I'm a baby boomer I know where I am but but Millennials way you get so many services for a Robin Hood saw an opportunity and they have all the sudden got five million customers but that's how they that's how that is a very good question and so moving a little long just to give you so these are the main things from this crypto compare just in October to give you a sense two thirds of the volume they measure spot one third is derivatives and we're not talking about the Chicago Mercantile Exchange the biggest derivatives exchange actually in crypto is bit max it has a perpetual Bitcoin swap and the perpetual eath that has no settlement a highly leveraged you can put one percent margin down at 99 percent borrow and every 10 hours it reap rices but it's a perpetual rolling ten-hour future and that's why it's caught a perpetual Ross I saw you look quizzical it's made perpetual because it's rolling ten our pricing settlements but you don't settle at ten hours you have to either post more margin or receive profit every ten hours what's it because a 10 hour future might not have you or me continue in the contract so they created a perpetual rolling that's correct bit max is the largest in this volume they say they don't operate in the US cuz if they did it would definitely have to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission but whether they operate in the US or not is probably for some other people to figure out crypto to crypto versus Fiat to crypto 70% of the volume is on crypto to crypto exchanges again we don't know if the volume figures are accurate but just based on these figures so the ecosystem is still 2/3 crypto to crypto rather than switching out to some other decentralized we already talked about this really important innovation I think it's gonna we're gonna see more about decentralized but right now we're still at the early days Bitcoin versus Fiat this is just the month of October but 50% was versus u.s. dollar 21% yen Korea who's from Korea here anybody do we have anybody so tell us a little bit about that figure why 16% Korea your views I know there's no readings on it any of any other views good trip not you're here are you from pure it's just pure up or down getting round curious to us capital controls know there's a kimchi premium even the Bitcoin sells for a little bit more and it's what it's caught I didn't make that term up there's a little bit of a premium and there's some academic studies one well and how that widens a narrow sometimes depending upon what the government's doing it's better in single-digit percent but you might pay three or four percent premium sometimes it's one and a half percent premium but there's a premium on the Korean exchanges but three years ago what cross do you think was the law just over fifty percent just three years ago it's not even on that chart right now Tom Graham MB in 2015 and 2016 over half the market was REM MB Bitcoin kind of got the attention from the Chinese central bank by 2017 that all changed and the u.s. dollar thing then kind of took that space and a lot of folks that gets really US dollar to tether to Bitcoin or other ways this fluctuates these these numbers aren't stable there's some months that yen is the biggest number we talked about the country's wonderful financial centers and then kyc an interesting statistic no this is about a hundred and forty exchanges that crypto compare house in their database and they say only half of them 47% observed strict no your customer a quarter partial and 28% absolutely none zero no that's just sort of stay to play crypto I hope none of those 28% are operating in the u.s. but they might be so what are the policy challenges one is the markets are readily susceptible to fraud manipulation any market it's human nature I don't think we're gonna take the human out of human it's gonna look for angles look for ways to make opportunities even the best meaning folks if you hold the assets in custody and you might make the markets because you're not settling to the blockchain even for short walls this market model this business model is to make markets maybe there's inherent conflicts of interest there's conflicts of interest and pretty much all of finance but then we try to manage we either manage conflicts of interest by certain rules about transparency or certain prohibitions about in the custody world bank's hold custody as well but we prohibit them from using your assets unless you permission them to use your assets and things like that so what we try to you it usually is build some system of transparency and an affirmative responsibilities or prohibitive actions those three buckets transparency some affirmative responsibilities and prohibited actions around conflicts but this space has the conflicts without much of those three things transparency either obligations or prohibitive actions so inevitably I think it's human nature you're gonna have some you know kind of games going on the custodial arrangements we talked about big challenge we're gonna see a little bit more about that complying with any money laundering at kyc and implementing tax reporting in the u.s. at least in the u.s. brokers have to report to the government when you buy and sell something this was not true thirty and fifty years ago but we've come to a place where I think it was in the last 15 to 20 years laws changed maybe Ross maybe you know in your legal workup but Louis change were broker chasis after report and and and those reports go into the u.s. government in other countries so the brokers say James sold this many shares of this and they had a basis of that and there's more tax compliance here there's no broker so it's hard to attach something and some of the exchangers are rather slow when the IRS comes knocking coinbase and the IRS had a little kerfuffle I'd call it when the IRS asked for data and there then 13 million customers and they settled because the IRS was bringing an action against him when they wouldn't give him any information and they they settled and gave him information on their 10 or 20,000 most active accounts but for a while right now the coin basis can act like they're Swiss bank accounts I hope is anybody from Switzerland all right then I can say it but but you know for decades wait who you live there well what did for decades maybe centuries Swiss bank accounts being known for secrecy secrecy that was their there they had a lot of other good things going on but that was one of their marketing points secrecy it's a little harder now but it's still relative to a German bank or a French bank probably a little bit more secret right right but crypto exchanges are still thinking oh well how can we give up secrecy because competitively other exchanges aren't doing it so I think coinbase was trying to be good citizens but also not give everything to the IRS state IRS wanted there's a big question of what's a security what's a commodity what's a derivative and in in every legal jurisdiction around the globe securities exchanges are regulated pretty much in every jurisdiction so what is the security and what's not a security does relate to what's currently regulated under current law I've testified in the US Congress and I say regardless of that if it's even just a commodity like Bitcoin and under US law is considered a commodity you probably want these exchanges regulated and if it's a derivative in most jurisdictions it also is regulated so the first and the third in that list securities and derivatives exchanges are regulated in most jurisdictions commodity exchanges or not but not at all so the definitional thing also relates to what comes in so in the u.s. there are a number of exchanges that will I would predict in the next 18 months register with the Security and Exchange Commission is broker-dealers under regulation alternative trading system reg 80s but I think that they will only do it if they're there category 1 they have a bunch of initial coin tokens that are so clearly securities they register but what if you're only trading Bitcoin only trading Bitcoin and atth and so forth those might say I don't want to have all those added costs so question for Thursday is why did the Intercontinental exchange create a one-day future which appears to be like it was like walking into and saying I want a regulated exchange as a business proposition that's what it feels like to me that that was sort of part of that decision set but you can ask one Thursday tracking beneficial ownership we've tracked beneficial ownership in the securities markets for long time from the first joint stock companies because you track beneficial ownership to ensure that somebody gets their dividends and if they're voting on once a year on the board of directors and things like that but somewhere in the last 30 or 40 years law enforcement agencies said that's a good way to track against money laundering and track against other things so layered on top of securities laws law enforcement agencies around the globe said we want to know who owns what for the prior 50 to 100 years it was just securities law that cared about tracking beneficial ownership but there's some international treaty I can't remember the name of it that says all securities regulators have to do something extra and make sure that there's transfer agents and there's this whole regime of keeping Ledger's of who owns what in addition to this any money laundering stuff securities laws have have this embedded in most jurisdictions this is a tough one for this space not only because it comes from a libertarian basis but it's also a tough one just technologically just just the technical solutions the crypto exchange is half of them have what crypto compare says is strict any money laundering but a quarter don't have any which means they're not tracking beneficial ownership I think that will that will slowly get ramped up but if you see a lot of a lot of registered exchanges leaving one country for another they're probably going to a place that has lower regulation oh and how do you remediated non-compliant exchange there's a bunch of exchanges here in the US that will register Securities and Exchange Commission can do look we're not going to we're not going to find you we're not going to give you penalties for the past can you just come into compliance in the next 12 to 18 months that's probably what's going to happen but like the ether Delta situation just last week they come to some settlement they say you've been violating the law for the last X number of months but how do you come into compliance and so that would be an interesting sort of what level of regulatory forbearance will will there be I think that at some point in time there will be fines and penalties but I think in in the u.s. context they'll bring a half a dozen or eight or ten into into regulation and then they'll they'll bring down a heavier footprint bring down the hammer of us in 2019 or 2020 I don't think that's gonna be in 2018 Kelly so so a very good question what does being compliant with some broad public policy norms do and I think there's probably different business models if you're an incumbent like Nasdaq and there was a brief article when a Dean of Friedman who runs Nasdaq said she wanted to be in this space if your Nasdaq if your CMA if your Deutsche börse and Germany if you're ice you really already know how to be compliant it's probably advantageous to be registered and for all those startups to be registered in some ways it creates a barrier to entries but you you want to do it if you're a start-up you could go one or two paths so Gemini here in the US and coinbase at least publicly or saying we want to be compliant how do we get there code base maybe because now they're almost like an incumbent and so they might want to keep that you know the next round of startups out but I think around the globe there's no doubt that it would raise cost the question is whether it would either secure your market share or flush out some competitors I would contend that it would increase the overall size of the market because more people would be interested but some fear that it would shrink the market because once you if you had known beneficial ownership if you tracked that official ownership for a hundred percent of this market some worried the market would shrink that that's from a commercial concept meaning like if you're tracking beneficial ownership its questioning [Music] so so the nature of your question is isn't bit coin and crypto about some off-the-rails libertarian / libertarian peer-to-peer I think it's Genesis Eric you want to answer I think that to go from a 200 billion dollar market to two trillion or 10 trillion it's got to come inside the public policy envelope I just don't see particularly lowering the risk of manipulation and fraud then you're gonna have a broader societal acceptance and investor protection matters but you know there are others on the other side of that these are on the numbers I'm not going to stay on it but this is just to say one thing crypto compare does is average daily visitors versus their volume coin basis average daily visitors is you can see that a highest red jar compared to their volume they probably have legitimate use the to Z B and E xx almost have no visitors and they report a lot of volume so it's just an interesting statistic to sort of say hey you know and it might well be that finances volume statistics are accurate they're just a crypto to crypto exchange but they also their ratio of visitors to volume is very from the coinbase just to give you a little flavor for the craziness out there investor protection I sort of said investor protection is critical we're going to talk about this in in in a week or so about initial coin offerings but it's further than consumer protection and importantly because we address we know we are honest we're earnest about we say yes there conflicts of interest how can we address conflicts of interest you don't band conflicts of interest but you sort of say is there ways to manage it how do we promote market integrity through transparency and rules of anti manipulation so it's kind of those you know the realities of humanity and then we say well how can we sort of put some traffic lights and speed limits in the system to give people confidence to drive the roads and by the way rahib I can't tell you because I wasn't there around the debates in the 19-teens in the 1920s but you can be assured there were debates in in in in whether to put the first traffic light out literally you know whether to put the first crosswalks and do traffic lights and cross works restrict the use of automobiles absolutely absolutely but think about this do they promote the sales of automobiles and I would contend they also promoted the sales of automobiles that simple regulatory intervention meant that people could feel a little bit more safe having their neighbors Drive because most people didn't drive but having their neighbors come down past their you know walking on the street the pedestrians pedestrians felt safer so I think it's a bit of both all right I might you know be disclosing my point of view I think investor protection bolsters investor confidence in capital markets and that everybody benefits but it's you know you got to get the balance right and I'd respect if half of you say no it should be less regulation and have said more I just I'm just closing where where I am and at least the logic behind it you know what the highway test is we'll come back to this in a week when we do initial coin offerings but that's in the center of crypto exchanges it's an important issue as to which crypto exchanges have a ICO token then they've got to kind of do a little bit more hacks these are the biggest hacks I could find these are reported hacks who knows what's not been reported coin check and mal Cox each about a half a billion a couple of 50 to 100 200 and here's a bunch of tiny ones that I put I mean they'll be on canvas but there's a bunch of basically steal somebody else's coins because they're all earlier question cold storage and is again thanks to the friends at crypto compare Isabella that was your question earlier right so I can't really tell you why bid flier only has 80 percent in cold storage and some of these others like bid for Nexus 96 or 7% but I think that if you have a high volume and a high flow you can maybe keep more in cold storage or if your model is more about custody than transactions you could have more on cold storage you do need something you know probably connected to give your your customer base liquidity and somewhat depends how long it takes you to move something from cold storage too hot storage what's that so they're self-insured and Gemini announced that they decided to contract with a on one of the world's largest insurance companies to insure against loss of that which they're having custody but don't confuse it for a hundred percent insurance the insurance companies are charging significantly somewhere around one and a half percent two quarter so there's some crypto exchanges which will allow you to pay for the insurance and Gemini says they've signed a contract with Aon and I can't quite tell whether that's just because Gemini is gonna pay for the insurance or they're gonna allow you to pay for the insurance in that custody solution let's see what I'll say oh we're almost wrapping so here's what I think custody I think the custody duties either have to be fixed or spun off I think I'm a public policy perspective they're better spun off and that's because there's such an inherent conflict I think you're holding somebody's funds and also transacting it's just too sweet a honey pot not just to be stolen but for the operator to say I want to use it in my own you know lend it borrow it transact around it but I that's my thought fix it or spit it off would be the custody elicit activity I think we're gonna have to get to a place where if not a hundred percent close to 100 percent are actually complying and if a quarter of them aren't even doing AML and kyc we there's still a lot of there's some road ahead here I know it might not fit Raheem with you know that libertarian soul of being the genesis of all this I won't say where you may be personally but but I that's I think that's gonna be the path forward if we're still two and three years from now a quarter of the market not doing it I think that the market integrity piece is the toughest one and it's maybe where my own personal views shouldn't cloud my judgment my own personal views as we need market integrity anti manipulation no front-running things like that but realistically it's probably going to be done by individual exchanges or self-regulatory organizations Gemini and others and in UK there's some self-regulatory organizations I don't think that's sufficient it's a step really in the right direction but I think somewhere if this gets bigger it needs to be the official sector putting some traffic lights and and and stop signs in registration and remediation first to determine whether you have to register and then comply and that's a multiple of pure month or year period in Japan they started registering in late 2017 they started with 16 another 16 some had to shut down in Japan South Korea is registering now some of those registration regimes are really just about custody and Bank Secrecy Act they're not going as far as I would like to go which is into market integrity but I think you're gonna see a bunch more jurisdictions registration remediation some closing and the like margin and fee compression I think that's inevitable whether it comes from the Robin Hood's or the IntercontinentalExchange but the juice is so much right now I mean some of these are charging 1 to 3 percent you all transact you know your fee structures better but I think there'll be margin and fee compression and I think there'll be some consolidation there's not enough room here for 200 plus exchanges so those are my predictions and I think the decentralized exchange is once they have enhanced customer UI there will be more adoption there right now not that easy to use for most regular people the non computer scientists two questions and then we might have to wrap Krypto exchanges profitability their enormous ly profitable coinbase did a venture round at an eight billion dollar valuation one crypto exchange just sold itself for 400 million dollars and coin check that lost the half a billion dollars of nem the 27 year old who ran that in Japan did not declare bankruptcy because he had already made over half a billion dollars in the previous 12 months they are enormous ly profitable
