technology I'm apologizing in advance I'm supposed to be like across campus for a 4:00 o'clock meeting so I won't have much time right at the end to do the little rap with students coming up I will note also that if you want to come see me I'm open to it next week's a great week by the way cuz I'm here all four or five days but I don't have set office hours just email me copy Dylan who's the new course administrator there was a swap out from Ryan or copy Toledo or Sabrina or something but just shoot me an email and then I'll set something up with you if you want to follow up either on your projects or it's a question about anything around blockchain I also want to thank we don't usually have people here with jackets on but we have six or eight veterans who have served our country and I thank you for your service they're here to observe us I I don't know whether we'll scare them away or not but thank you for for joining us so today's topics are gonna be around of course we're gonna go through the readings a little bit we don't have Larry lesyk and it's a little bit more relaxed so I might be doing some cold calling if that's alright I'm gonna go back a little bit to the technical features in a quick wrap in two slides or three slides but I just want to do that is the set up again and of course because you all love hash functions so much it's just a way to bring it back to some of the technical features to set up really what are some of the issues we have I think it's lecture eleven and twelve where it's just what I call Act two is the economics but I want to set up a little bit about the economics you saw that in the reading the xxi Geneva report that Simon Johnson and Nahan Narula and my Casey and Joan and I wrote so now you all I only assigned just seven pages out of it so I hope that your raid read the seven pages but some of the costs and trade-offs the challenges of blockchain technology that are very real I'll give you my own perspective on where I think this will sort out over the next three to ten years so I'll do some predictions Vitalik Bou Durant has also talked about a trilemma and I want to chat about that and that was one of the readings if I recall he's such a leader in this community that when he writes and says something like this it was relevant I think that everybody's understand what Vitalik bitter ends kind of trilemma as even though that some people think he's mistaken some possible solutions to this we have who's attending today Amador's who was actually one of the developers on some of the solutions around zero knowledge proof sand he might get caught on he works over the digital currency initiative I'm hope you're ready and and why I think governance is the most challenging piece so with that the readings I have a list of everybody that hasn't spoken yet so the goal is to speak that's what class participation is like I'm gonna be light-hearted about it I it's not that long ago I was a student really I remember all this you know you want to get your name off this list just just what I say that kind of encouraging so should I do it alphabetical from the list as to who wants to tell me no no or you look like you're ducking your head what's your name Wendy what did you take from the seven pages of the Geneva report did you read did you do the readings lady take from the great work of Simon Johnson and I helped him out you know anything about the business challenges of blockchain from the readings so one one challenge is time latency it takes a long time to do a Wendy raise raises yes if you can say your first name help Sabrina out get you off the list so you it's self-motivation to say your name so catalina sort of related they're there they're not alone but performance scalability the time it takes to do a transaction other challenges yes how to do micro payments you want to tease that out why why is there a problem with micro payments do micro payments in the small micro payments partly because they're so small maybe relative to the fees and the cost of the network Alexis may try to change the transaction there's economic incentives that are involved here we're now moving a little bit away from all that you know that stuff the the broccoli that I said that we were all going to be eating about hash functions and so forth akira yeah privacy regulators concerns here just raise a bunch of points about privacy and security about the individuals and the regulators is anybody want to tease that out a little bit more incentive to keep that natural public policy tension that doesn't only exist around one side there's a commercial interest to keep and interestingly on top of it the official sector also wants privacy for everybody other than the official sector so like in Europe there's a new requirement that wasn't in the breeze don't worry but is anybody familiar with the directive the privacy directive called GDP or Aaron Aaron doesn't tell the class a little bit about GDP or or if you there I just know that it's like a big deal right now especially when it comes like advertising to consumers they have consumers in like the EU have to like really like type certain boxes to we need to be advertised to as apposed and Joe Quinn you have the right to out of being everything you do work on summer we had to put purging mechanisms into our database right so it's a remarkable new law Europe is in a sense if you wish to say either more privacy protection or ahead of the u.s. or you know and each jurisdiction has their own cultural and political norms but Europe as a whole is moved further in a sense you have a right to be forgotten you have a right to access the information as well and so how to be forgotten in the context of an immutable blockchain isn't interesting just technical set of issues yes I work for a company this summer the processes transactions and it was our understanding speaking with lawyers in Europe that under gdpr you're allowed to request your transactions because the transactions counters personal information you're allowed to request your transactions to be erased from the ledger which obviously opens the door to all kinds of fraudulent behavior I'm just curious to know you've heard of any sort of resolution to that I haven't I was speaking at a conference earlier today here at MIT with a bunch of member companies to the computer science and AI lab and one of the participants said they thought they had a technical set of solutions to it so we're gonna talk more about the privacy issues and GDP or in the public policy session next week so I'll try to I'll try to Kyle remind me and I will try to get more up to speed on that Kelly it's specifically for chapter there was something mentioned about what makes watching uniquely qualified to solve a lot of these solutions and I found the date had coincided with what special Essex said last class about there are significant trade-offs that often come down to the cost of trust but it's so thanks affection with so many technical challenges why other thoughts or questions from the readings it's okay about having a second layer to provide the efficiency and the high performance but it's ready offline yeah so we are expecting to trust in second base offline and then goes and put inside the box chain how feasible how can we twist the question is about possible solutions to address performance and scalability and I have a few slides on that but in essence if the if the principal protocol the Bitcoin protocol or the etherium protocol or maybe tomorrow be EOS or some other protocol has some performance issues could some activity be moved to another channel that channel could be caught a layer two and the Lightning Network which was there was a reading about that that could be with a little bit different technology called side chains or shorting which I think was an optional yeah I did that optionally I didn't force you all so there's a number of alternative channels and though the technologies are - technologists importantly different sharding and side chains and layer two for this purpose for a moment let me blur over the differences the question that Lea Lea our dros ask is well is that meaning that we have to trust I would contend we already have to trust the protocol that the Bitcoin core developers have written it's open github it's open code but very few people are actually gonna investigate it enough to be assured there's not a bug or an error but I agree with you that the the core the Bitcoin core or the etherium core has been living in if I could call it the technological and commercial swamp it's been attacked by so many viruses and bugs you have some reason to trust it but you should never be a hundred percent sure the side the side chains are less tested but I do agree with you you have some trust and unless I misunderstand the question I thought it was a trust in the in the underlying code working with me that's if you're off chain should you be more worried I was addressing just a narrow part about the code you're saying should you be worried because it doesn't have the same validation models so can I hold that question until we get to the slides because I think that I think you do actually have some pretty good validation but I think you're right that it's a it's a valid question is the validation and these off chains still work there was a question back here I was just sort of gonna respond to the issue like sort of trusting these offline mechanisms it's not in the same thing but like 90% of according to this of like daily trading volume occurs in these crypto exchanges so that's also like sort of happening off the chain so I think that like in this community of people who are like currently participating there's no reason that like we're not going to so you're raising the point and it's a sort of an irony of the whole ecosystem that the majority and in some crypto currencies over 90% of the actual daily transactions are happening in in very centralized ways on exchanges particularly the centralized crypto exchanges where I can't remember what it was about half of you have owned Bitcoin at some point in time but can I ask how many of you have actually operated a full node so there's the two technologists at the middle table and Hugo who's also if I remember engineering PhD student okay so we have our three PhD students who have operated full notes honors to you but for most of you and it was half the class of own some Bitcoin you've trusted some other authority to hold your private keys I'm not saying you're wrong or right but it's an interesting and an important point about this ecosystem so let me let me unless there's other points just go through some of how I thought about these things and laid it out and I I of course the study questions we've been talking about so I'll come come back but we will talk a little bit about hard forks and and we we I didn't hear anybody talk about interoperability so we'll come back to that as well we've talked more about performance and privacy issues just back to the technical features it's just repetition sorry but I do think it's worthwhile there's of course the cryptography and timestamp logs so the the bedrock of of this technology that we did three or four lectures ago you will find that in permission systems you'll find it in permissionless systems that is a bedrock you will find it in a theory of Bitcoin and sixteen hundred others there there will be some shifts around the hash functions might be a little different but that's kind of a bedrock of this technology the network consensus is not necessarily always the same as we talked about sometimes it's proof of work sometimes it's proof of stake or in the permission systems the consensus is really are you amongst the club and then there's kind of some form of a club deal if you're the Australian Stock Exchange the only member of the club is the Australian Stock Exchange but in other permission systems it's 20 banks or 15 banks that are sharing that some delegated randomized Authority to say what's the next amendment to thee and then the transactions code and Ledger's shifts largely dependent upon whether it's a transaction ledger or an account ledger so transaction Ledger's have to have some way to record transactions account ledgers have to have some way to record the change in accounts which eat their cause state transitions but either you have to record a transaction or you have to record a change in the state or a change in the account an account would say that would be like the income statement versus the balance sheet but you kind of need to record that and basically all of these technologies as I understand it have some way to keep those Ledger's though there's multiple ways to do it and as we talked about last week some have one Merkle tree and some have four or five Merkle trees and so forth but it's it's embedded in this and they could have different scripting questions just that's like the thumbnail just to remind you about the technology it's the T and MIT so for a transaction versus account in an account based ledger does it say like if you spend five dollars to say who you're spending that five dollars to just say your account went down five dollars and somebody else went out five dollars it doesn't matter so I'm gonna take as I understand ether and medoras you'll bail me out but you you put a state-transition instead of a transaction input it's a state-transition input and that state transition input does have one account going down another count going up you can see both sides of it as I understand and there's a receipt ledger there's actually a receipt Merkle tree that then keeps this state transition happened did I did I roughly get that right Medora Wow all right medoras actually does this for a living I mean he's he's the one of the founding people of Z cash so and a bunch of other wonderful things I'm not going to go through each of the details but there was about 15 or 20 details in these slides about the differences between Bitcoin and ether and I just use it to remind because it's saying okay why why why did the professor why did the why did Gary put it up there this professor lesyk that was nice for Larry but for me but in essence the big difference is account based versus transaction base the kind of big difference is ether does seem to go faster but it doesn't have a lot of throughput they still both use proof of work even though ether says they're going to move to proof of state they're not there yet when they get there we'll all know together the economics are a bit difference of course as well and but all of these details are part of the reason why there's problems and so you read in the Geneva report a little bit about a professor an economist from the 1930s does anybody want to take a crack at it or should I just do my slides here we go like cost-benefit analysis so that like if one wants to use tool of changes in tries Network you should take into account like all the benefits in terms of reducing cost of petrology enhancing security but also like the cost of like switching to it isn't release Koko's is a is an economist from the 1930s who wrote extensively about the costs and appearing about the corporation kelly much earlier time way pre bitcoin but a different why does economic activity cluster into a firm rather than if it was truly market base i might just be selling my services in essence he was asking the question why don't we have a fully gig economy in the 1930s where everybody's free labor and and and and even capital and labor meets individually and we collect up together that was kind of the body of his question that he was so centralization versus decentralization eighty years ago studied by a great economist so just thinking about it here a little bit i think that when you go from decentralization to centralization you tend on the centralized side you get capture you get economic rents and you do have a single point of failure in some sense the resiliency of the system whether it's in finance where you worry about systemic risk that one Clearing House one central bank one government if it's knocked out it's so relevant to the economy writ large it brings it down or if it's one database you have a single point in essence of failure economic rents is an ability to collect excess profits I assure you everybody in this class wants to collect economic rats we store it out as venture capitalists and entrepreneurs but we have a motivation and an incentive to be monopolist but we don't want to do it illegal of course I mean we just want to get there you know by dominating the market I'm sorry was there a question here you just read you're shaking your head and I didn't know but on the other side there's there's the benefits the the y scale is not written on here the Y scale is however you want to think of it but I think of it as kind of costs so the Y scale up the Y scale is like greater cost decentralization the big costs that come there is coordination you have a lot of collective action issues if the hundred or so people in this room we're trying to do something together you have to figure out how to do it collectively and coordination and that's true of every blockchain that you can think about governance relates to coordination and collective action issues and then security and scalability these two lines are not in any of the readings but they try to capture what and depending them on the slope of the two lines you might say that a market might tend towards more centralization in theory if I change the slope it would be further to the decentralized side right if the cost of decentralization is a lower slope and the cost of centralization is higher we will tend more towards decentralization so it's just a way that to visualize here are the costs of centralization which are basically capture rents and single point of failure not that there aren't other costs of centralization here are the costs of decentralization I think in each one of the applications when you're thinking of use cases it's worthy this is kind of a core thing well this application lend itself to a low slope decentralization curve and a high slope centralization curve are there a lot of economic rents so their real problems with single points of failure and capture and if it's a slow slope decentralization curve meaning there's not much cost to the governance coordination and scalability issues and you're going to be more towards decentralization that this isn't any reading or book it's just you know a shot at trying to visualize it Shawn any question John's question is why are the privacy coins forked not all of them but many of them are forked off of Bitcoin or one of the major coins medoras you want to say did you you have one privacy coin high quality code so you can build up on it so it's natural to like add privacy on top of Bitcoin in your fork rather than write it from scratch medoras is the answering is there's something that's freely available the Bitcoin core code it's actually under a copyright license here at MIT which makes it free that was Satoshi nakamoto's decision it wasn't that well maybe Nakamoto does work here the clue but it's it's it's been developed and it's knocked around as I call it in the proverbial swamp I mean with all these attack viruses and so forth and Soma doors are saying build off of that and basically get that code for free and then fork that so the challenge is we talked about it a performance scalability efficiency privacy security what there was less talk about was interoperability governance and collective action and I'm going to dig into those two more because it feels like that's worthwhile I also believe that the first bucket performance and privacy buckets are more susceptible to fixes though that might take three or five or even eight or ten years to happen I think they're more susceptible to the sort of bright men and women that are in these fields addressing themselves to the computer science and cryptography of the space whereas governance and collective action might be solvable but I think it's it's sort of inherent in the human element and the commercial arrangements that governance and collective action or the harder of these four buckets that's just one person's read of it but we'll go through some of the reasons as well why I kind of I get it to that view there's also commercial use case challenges we're not going to dig into that much here that's mostly the second half of the semester but I just wanted to mention that's a real thing that a lot of folks are saying well I have to make sure that this is the best commercial application and so forth and can I make money I mean ultimately on it and then we are next week going to talk about the public policy issues and challenges and they all kind of intersect in a way as well so Vitalik buddha ran I think there was a medium post I had you all read bow do you want me to tell you tell us a little bit about what you think is metallic not only a brilliant computer scientist but does he get the economics of this right or you think he's off you're gonna be on there's no right answer I know people that feel both ends of the spectrum about his trilemma so I'm setting you up that old saying about what how many of you have ever hired a contractor to fix something in your kitchen or renovate renovate something I mean I have them a little older right you know the old saw that it's good quick cheap but you can't you can't get all three you can only get two out of three that's sort of the contractor dilemma but but what do you think do you think he's right or do you think you could maybe overtime get all three good cheap quick scalable decentralized and secure my very unsophisticated the other side just to have some fun in some debate sure yeah go out at Leonardo that systems have had to develop so they mention for example visa has at sixty years develop a system that works some of those currencies and at three four or five years number his personal opinion the tax was like less than five percent they would not overcome I don't know if that is like a wrong but I think the fact that this is a new technology yes maybe Vitalik is right that only 5% maybe only one person that will succeed but to say that no one will deal with these three points in in a simultaneous satisfactory way and ultimately it has to be satisfactory in a commercial way you know taking the risk and trade-offs so Leonardo takes the other side anybody want to say why Leonardo Hugo were you which side are you taking Leonardo's side or Vitalik side suffering the middle okay so I think that there is a trade-off but I agree that it might take time to improve all three simultaneously I mean one thing that happened just this last week in Bitcoin was there was a vulnerability discovered and like as somebody who doesn't know how to check the codebase really like I'm not a computer science person so I'm never like checked for bugs or anything that I want to do that I kind of just take the software as it stands and unload it and install it and when they say I need to update my software because there's a bug I'll update the software there's a bug and that kind of feels like more of a centralized system but you're getting that security but then the decentralization comes something from the fact that the network is still spread out over something you know it's so like there are trade-offs that I think you can kind of build on one and then climb another cliff like kind of build on each but not at the same time I'm probably an optimist enough on the human condition and that the technologist will solve more than metallics so I'm not saying I'm all the way we're Leonardo or wherever yeah there would be but I'm probably closer to Leonardo than to vitalik but that's just my points of view I also find an interesting of it's all right if I say Hugo's an engineering doctoral student here and yet he's not checking the code not any right because right so there's a trust issue that in the marketplace the trust of the code we also trust Facebook and Dropbox and and and broadly speaking the Internet as well Priya there are several examples throughout the evolution of human interaction where these three things have been sorted so it might not be that and in some systems at any one time all these three nodes are working right like four are currently in existence there are moments of vulnerability yes but then you catch it sooner or later so I feel like it's maybe not it's about having it all perfect right now versus will you get to a point where all three are mostly in place and working like how Priya said working enough right it doesn't have to be scalable to the place where it's millions of transactions a second but maybe it needs to be faster than seven or ten transactions a second or a theory I'm 20 transactions a second we had I should also remind everybody Tuesday nights we have dinner Simon Johnson treats every Tuesday night it's not required to come but it's 5:30 to 7:00 that we have an outside speaker around the block chain space and you're welcome to come Michelle is here who Michelle Fiorenza anybody that wants to come but this past week we had somebody speaking about the scalability issues and when his company did a twenty five million dollar initial coin offering the day of the offering which only had 40 to 50 thousand purchasers so forty or fifty thousand purchasers on that day that means the smart contract had to be triggered numerous times that day took over a third of the entire aetherium network on that day and it's sluggish and just to close and settle on his initial coin offering I was saying jeez that that's not the scalability you know we want so we know that's where we are today visa runs around 20 to 30,000 transactions a second DTCC which settles all the stock and equity trades here in the US has to be available to transact at least a hundred thousand a second most seconds it's five or ten or some seconds it's thirty thousand but the Securities and Exchange Commission says no you have to be rated for four times your average roughly so this gives you a sense of the scalability issues just in the current environment if one layer is the Internet of Things on top of it there's somewhere and I've heard different estimates of eight to ten billion devices currently connected to the Internet and that's likely to grow as more refrigerators and street lights and traffic lights are tied into the Internet in the next five or ten years to fifty to a hundred billion devices tied to the Internet if they start communicating to each other will it be a blockchain for Internet of Things can't do it at these types of scaling numbers or can you do it in some alternative method proof of work is also has a bunch of energy consumption we didn't have that a lot in the writing we chose not to put a bunch of that in the Geneva report one estimate is that it's 200 million kilowatt hours per day that's equivalent about seven million US homes on average just give you a rough didge economists estimate that's one third of 1% of all the world's electricity just a scale scale it if you now you can have a nice dinner you know dinner party conversation point it's the it's the electricity of the country of Austria is anybody Austrian no I just was you know so it's that's one set of trade-offs of proof-of-work as well but it also costs a lot of to run the banking system so I think that when somebody says well it's terrible it's challenging all this electric costs yes we always want to lower costs but the US financial system is seven and a half percent of our economy and cost one and a half trillion dollars so the payment system around the globe cost a half a percent to a percent of the global economy which is more than one-third of 1% of the world electricity cost so I'm just putting it in its back to this question of which cost of trust which costs neither a maximalist or a minimalist as you recall so what are some of the alternatives and we're not going to dig into each of these side chains shorting layer 2 payment channels anybody want to take a crack they're not all the identical it's a medoras and I had a conversation earlier today said I could even get my head around because I get confused but does anybody want to give the basic we were talking about it earlier the basic tenets cuz you had a reading about the Lightning Network as to what's what's the economic thing and technical thing that's being attempted in all four of these types of things with James was that a hand up you're gonna give it a shot give it a shot most of these are on the chain so most of these are off the chain but some is on the chain the idea is you transact off the chain balances are traded in the net results onto the chain so you try and speed up by processing off the chain it's like saying there's this chain this this this this this this channel if you wish that the water is running in or the digital money is running in that only has a certain speed it can only take a certain amount of performance why not take a lot of activity and put it in a side channel which is called a payment channel actually but a side chain or a payment channel or a layer to all with slightly different technical features and maybe do millions of things off here and only but some here it is not new to blockchain and Bitcoin we already have that in the world of finance for decades in some way or another where some activity can't go to a central settlement system and recalling Ledger's the central bank whether it's the US central bank or any central bank could have been set up that all of our deposit accounts were directly with the central bank and in a sense the side chains in finance right now are 9,000 commercial banks 9,000 commercial banks are dealing with our money flows and then sort of net settling to the central bank's ledger in what's called digital reserves and in fact even the banking system the 9000 banks in the US have their side chains Visa MasterCard first data that all the money processing so there's already a layering I look at layer two and sidechains is kind of taking a similar economic approach and technical approach that's already been around but in a new way I grabbed a chart from 2015 it the details don't matter but this was I did it because it was three years old this was one you know person's truth coin one person's view is what sidechains basically what James says lots of activity over here and only a few things go over to the main chain the visual is what I wanted to get across it was just that it's kind of think of it as loads of activity over here and then we only settle at sometimes to the main chain another visualization of a different is the Lightning Network again a lot of activity then settle to the main chain questions trade off a lot of people are proponents of making the block size bigger a lot of people say the side chains I have trouble understanding trade offs between those two so what what it like why not just a bigger block what's the problem there's a there's a series of trade offs of economics and technology the more you put inside the let's call it the main chain that that blue the blue boxes at the bottom so so to speak the more you're putting in there you weighed it down there's there's there's more processing of course and more storage and so forth but also there's some there's too much latency in Bitcoin it's every 10 minutes and you're not really sure until three four or five some would say six blocks to an hour go by so economically if you want high frequency low latency short time periods you might say I can't get that on the main chain because the main chain wants to have low latency every ten minutes is lower latency now low latency to be more secure to keep the mining cost and the proof-of-work up so there's some economic and technological both crosscurrents with that unrelated to what I just said but overlapping there's also a bunch of miner and mining pool operator economics as to whether they want big blocks or small blocks and part of the split last year was but uh it was sort of more motivated around local politics rather than global politics as the former Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill said all politics is local I think some of the debates last year was about local economics and the economics of miners but I don't know medoras do you Medora was in probably in the middle of some of those debates but would you have a different view is there was a big debate last year as to whether the Bitcoin block should go bigger or stay the size it was not the only reason but it was part of the reason we have now Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin we because Bitcoin cash has a bigger block size and a shorter two and a half minute processing time mining centralization the bigger block Co problem leads of miners and handles enormous blocks will be able to stay in business and what decentralization means was security there's in something for some decentralization and security to keep the Box looks smaller so what medoras is saying is there's also a bit of economics around centralization the bigger the blocks the fewer miners can handle it the fewer miners the more centralization and thus less secure and maybe even economic rents because every centralized system can collect economic rents alene that if you have bigger blocks they take longer to propagate to the network and in sort of non-intuitive ways if that happens to give more accidental Forks in the blockchain and people can accident before especially Minot State accidentally loose coins when there's a technical feature as bigger blocks are more likely to take time to propagate through the network and thus you might end up inadvertently having more chains that are discredited in a sense because they there there was work being done until the first one gets propagated so Leonar leandro no debt no Leandra okay was he asking how do we validate the Lightning Network and how do we assure that that is though working with net to important in the chain how do we record everything that's ok so the side chains are not recorded gross on the main chain they're in essence recorded and in lightning Network I said I wasn't and get into the differences but here I go the Lightning Network is more a bilateral network it can be it can take on the the feeling of multilateral because I could have a transaction with James James could have a transaction with Kelly and it feels like it's three of us but it's bilateral James and Gary bilateral James and Kelly as I understand it and so those individual transactions while they're recorded if keep it going here recorded in the Lightning Network they're not on the main chain we ultimately then net settle to the main chain and we actually in a sense pre-fund or pre it's a it's a form loosely of escrowing at the beginning so James and I might be messing with each other but we're bilateral and so we've have another approach to the trust in addition to the computer code its James and I might have other reasons to trust Joe Quinn so and and what keeps me out of double spending once on the lady network and another one on the blockchain main network at the same time because there's a yourself I want to be careful because I'm using the terms loosely there's a form of pre-funding it's not that you actually fund on to the main chain but there's a little bit of partitioning that Medora alright I keep looking at Matt doors because he's actually coded this so that's what protects you in essence that James and I if I'm saying well I'll send you a one Bitcoin and tomorrow if the Sun does come up tomorrow you'll send me a half we were partitioning that one Bitcoin or his half Bitcoin until we then close out that it's written into the scripting code and it's written almost like a smart contract but it's not called smart contracts to sort of partition or you might loosely think of it as escrow it even though technically it might be different but stop by and we can and if not some of our colleagues at the digital currency initiative like Tosh draaga who program the Lightning Network I mean that's an MIT collaboration with others and we don't we don't promote it just because it's MIT it's like one of the leading ways to do performance it happens to be MIT so let me talk about other ways to do performance and kind of move on we already talked about alternative consensus protocols you've seen this slide I'm just bringing it back because it is a way to deal with scalability it's a really critical important ways proof-of-work course what are the issues about scalability and generally I'm summarizing I'm simplifying in a sense but generally all the alternatives have some way to randomize or delegate the node that will do the next block it kind of all comes back how do you add another block and Stewart Hebert in the 1990s when he started with all this blockchain stuff and put it in the New York Times had a central authority and he set up that company surety and he put it in the New York Times and what Nakamoto consensus is as he said well no we're not going to have Hebert and and an essential Authority it's going to be decentralized so these other consensus protocols generally have some randomized approach to delegate the selection of the next block it's not always that way but they may also have a mechanism to do a second thing a second touch silvio Macaulay's Algar and he's a professor over the computer science and AI lab and touring award-winner he's got a company that has an interesting thing it's like a jury selection it's like picking somebody for the jury that's that's picking this short group of 12 nodes that might do something and every block has that selection process but then there's an another broader group that then can check the work of the jury so often there's kind of a second automated way because Trust isn't there ensuring that there's a quick second check did they decide guilty err or innocent correctly so to speak again I apologize if I'm a little oversimplifying so vo is brilliant work but it's so it could be proof of stake proof activity proof of burn as we talked about proof of capacity and as I mentioned last week there's not large-scale uses but - and neo both have some form of this going one right now and aetherium has a big project I'm confusing their two projects there's plasma and there's Casper Casper is their project to get to proof a stake but they're not they're privacy and security so try to remember who raised the contradictory tensions the contradictory tensions is law enforcement and regulators want more transparency even though the FBI did you know sort of figure out some Russians we're using Bitcoin to mess in our elections they want some more transparency and financial institutions users and even some regulators want less transparency so it's it's not kind of goes both ways but these I think are also truly solvable well for for consumers there's - and Manero and zee cash and there's even mechanisms called mixing and tumbling which I truthfully can't tell you the difference but I can tell you regulators talk about mixers and tumblers and privacy coins when when I go to some regulatory conferences because they sometimes invite me as a former that middle slide the the privacy coins and the mixers and tumblers the the finance ministries and the law-enforcement stuff that's where they kind of get worried medoras you want to come up here and tell us anything about Z cash or you want to do it from there as to what inspired you to do a privacy coin that a bunch of law enforcement folks don't like it's legal I mean it's a coin it's real just like cash can be used for religious purposes also systems that provide strong privacy like tor can be used for so it said privacy is a human right and we shouldn't be giving up our fun intro independence too because I want to buy a coffee I don't want to reveal all my other transactions I think there are mechanisms called law enforcement can it gets our regulatory objectives but privacy I think is fundamental right so we should fight for it and so when did you start working on the project so you started with the paper these kind of like prototype code base we put it open source and or with the companies that go for Monza and I think C cash now is somewhere around a billion dollar market cap if so so that's why you're here it went down no no you don't need to answer that that's sorry privacy but but in essence what medoras is saying that he came to this what were you doing in 2014 were you I was mostly working on zero knowledge groups seem to be like a natural application like Bitcoin plus I think I think techniques maybe there's something there so here a talented graduate student at MIT with it with the collaboration of other said here's this cryptographic mechanism called zero knowledge proof switch we'll chat about in 30 seconds and here's something called Bitcoin why don't we bring together and we could promote in his own words some human rights just did you buy a cup of coffee and you don't have to say who you are you could use this new Bitcoin and enhanced zero knowledge proof Z cash shot if I useful to one arrow or three cash as a way to get the money out of that I don't I don't fortunately I don't have to define illicit activity but generally societies come together through their reasonable mechanisms whether they're democratic societies or not but they come together through their legislative branches and their executive branches and their courts and define some things that are not allowed but generally speaking when I'm using the term in this class I'm thinking about four or five buckets most societies do not want to shrink their tax base so they want economic activity be inside the tax envelope rather than outside the tax envelope and that's usually the words that finance ministers call that as a tax base how much is outside versus inside secondly most law enforcement and most societies do not want to have the the money rails the banking and other ways you can move value to facilitate otherwise illegal activity so it's using money to facilitate otherwise illegal activity so the otherwise illegal activity might be drug running the otherwise illegal activity might be terrorism it might be child slavery literally so it's whatever the otherwise illegal activity you know is to use money and that's generally called money laundering or other things so you're absolutely right another thing is for some countries less than a majority but some countries have capital controls they're trying to maintain the value of their fiat currency relative to other fiat currencies and in an effort to maintain some either fixed or relationship they have capital controls and and thus in those countries they might say illicit activity also is running around the the capital controls but it's it's each country each society and Shawn you raise a good point as to what does it mean I I I mean it not to show any value I'm saying there's a there's a series of these things that each society comes together and says usually around the tax base usually around trying to not use money to facilitate otherwise bad stuff and in some countries the capital controls I saw a hand here Daniel no wizard and we're gonna do more about illicit activity next week or about guarding against illicit activity I hope the correction got film too so there's another set of security issues around private keys and to most of us that have passwords you know if you lose your password they're usually in essence a backdoor that somehow the the platform whether it's Facebook or even at Bank of America if you lose your password there's a backdoor and they can say there's a way to validate with enough probability waiting that I'm Gary Gensler and they'll give me a new password I mean in some circumstances it's a high bar and there's some biometrics involved but in most cases it's a pretty low bar and they'll give you sort of another password if you can like me remember the answer to who my high school girlfriend was or something you know these questions like I remember it's Irene but then I've just given up I'm just giving it up that's terrible I have to change it so but custodial of private keys is a very real thing and you've read about the hacking and will read more about it when we get to crypto exchanges it's it's a very dominant issue not just for individuals but for institutional actors how does a hedge fund or more likely how does Blackrock or fidelity as an asset manager secure custody in a way that works and it's an asymmetric risk it's a tricky risk for most of finance they don't have custody any longer of the securities when I started a wall street they were still the cage CAG II there was a physical cage where the the remnants of paper stock certificates were still in the cage I didn't start so long ago that it was before DTCC was already things were getting electric you know digital but there was still a physical cage for some physical paper certificates if you lost the paper certificate you could still go to the government or the company that issued it and back door and get a new paper certificate it took time it was hard it was to authenticated but in this circumstance if you lose the private key there's not the back door issue or to get the next one so it's a very interesting issue not just a technological issue but in a cyber security issue but it's a whole set of financial custody issues an asymmetric risk if you're Goldman Sachs or fidelity and you lost a key or it got hacked and it was billions of dollars so it's just a interesting I don't think it's unique to blockchain but it's rather specific to blockchain and finance and how it overlaps it so some of the solutions that I do think there are solutions here are some of the things that that medoras and Nahan Narula who runs the digital currency initiative or work and they're working on using two cryptographic primitives we're not going to deeply go into we did hash functions and we did digital signatures those are algorithms or they're called cryptographic primitives well there's dozens cryptographic primitives math algorithms well the other two that are used a lot in this field or zero knowledge proof and less often probably as Peterson commitments and I put up there my words I got medoras to help me write this one but my words is zero knowledge proof let's someone prove a statement is true without revealing the details of exactly why that statement is true you might say wait a minute you can prove something's true it's sort of like if you walk into a bar and they need to know you're 21 to get a drink let's make this tangible what do you need to prove that you're 21 you need to prove that you were born before 1997 September 27th but you don't need a lot more details and so there's some computer scientists here at MIT that actually did the foundational work when zero knowledge proves 20 to 30 years ago Silvio McCauley and others for which I think was part of why they won the Turing award and amongst other work so zero knowledge proof sir very interesting cryptographic mathematical puzzle solving that medoras used for z cache nahama doris is using for something called ZK ledger which was an optional reading my gut tells me there are ways that we can go forward that regulators and the official sector can get there transparency they want and the financial sector at the same time can get the privacy they want that the two can actually coexist through the modern methods of technology Alexi is that a hand up or just waving no all right you want to add anything Medora since your the co-author of this ZK ledger paper that was optional coin zero coy using Peterson clearance on Z cash bidding tears Peters and commitments like small talk very interesting history behind and Peterson commitments are yet another cryptographic primitive or algorithm which interestingly they're similar to hash functions where you take a bunch of data and you squish it together in a sense you compress it and get a commitment but you can actually add and subtract them it's it's an interesting thing where you can commit today to like a hash but you can also add and and and sort of subtract commitments so it has some interesting features if you're deeply interested I will probably line up Sabrina to help you or medoras might help because I'm at the edge but what I'm saying from a business side is my hunch and this is that we're at the we're at the cutting edge here at MIT of some of the folks try to figure out how to do privacy and security at the same time questions on that because we're gonna get to the tougher things interoperability linking blockchain applications to legacy databases or linking them to each other so you might want to link a blockchain application if you're if you're thinking about a payments protocol how does that payments protocol and blockchain world link to the Fiat because ultimately if you're doing let's say remittances and you want to move money from here to Mexico somebody wants Mexican peso they might be starting in US dollars how do you how do you operate basically with three different systems in that case you know you're ingenious innovative startup but the US dollar Fiats system and the Mexican peso system so that's a form of interoperability and and the challenge around it or blockchain to blockchain if we've got sixteen hundred of them or even interoperability of the main chain and some of these layer to inside shades that's an easier interoperability because it's kind of coded right in but it's always it and this is not a new thing banking has had interoperability all the time take my example of the u.s. to Mexico to move US Dollars and convert it to Mexican peso is in two entirely different banking systems in two entirely different ledger systems so we have to have this question of interoperability even pre blockchain but it's just bringing it to this new technology it raises cost of trust in coordinating the transfer assets and information across chains in essence or as we talked about across Ledger's so it's a it's an issue that's it's been around we just got to sort of see how we solve it here one solution it doesn't mean it's the right solution is the only solution well one solution is to do through some decentralized mechanisms including side chains or one of the favorites of the director of the Media Lab Joey Ito thinks maybe if we have layer two we should also have layer zero underneath all of these these coins underneath aetherium and bitcoin maybe there's a layer that we can technologically create nobody's done this yet but Joey's a visionary Joey we've had the first Internet service provider in Japan at the age of 23 when he got fifteen hundred dollars of computer equipment and put it in his bathroom and that's how he started yes yes his bathroom it was the only real estate he had so you know which way does this go you hadn't heard that about Joey yeah so it's a way to start a company and and I think far more work needs to be done so it may be solvable I'm not I'm I'm not sure and then consensus required for software updates it's a tough one open-source software updates which are not backward-compatible like can I update the software but then you can't use it for the 500000 blocks that are already out there in Bitcoin or in some or the millions of blocks and ether so the problem often happens that the older versions won't validate all the new blocks and if they won't validate all the new blocks I'm simplifying again think of like Excel and you get that update on Excel or word for window and you can't open your old files I mean it's a you know it's a rough lay definition of what what this issue is and so it leads to something called hard Forks and this little visual on the right hand side is basically what happens is you can't validate all the old blocks because the new software is kind of going beyond it a hard fork would happen is if you took two megabyte blocks if you made the block size bigger the old the old software would not take that I've got this right that would be a hard fork and so that's a that's an issue and it's happened the theory of network has E theorem classic and a Z theorem because of a hard fork that was encouraged by Vitalik Butera and the Bitcoin network has won from last year where it was this debate about block sizes so it's most software for decades is dealt with how do we update software but they can push it to us and we get it and we hit a button and we get it and after a while we get annoyed and we don't update if you're like me but the consensus remember this was a graph that we had the consensus always supports the longest chain if the consensus is to adopt this new technology and only 80 or 90% adopt it it's a question of whether the other 10 or 15% will keep maintaining the shorter chain and in Bitcoin cache they have and so in essence now you have two currencies if for some reason it atrophied and they stopped maintaining it then the value in a sense in a commercial setting might go to zero is your question so broadly speaking I think the toughest issue is about collective action and governance how do you get a whole group of people to be moving in a similar direction blockchain applications derived part of their value from participation of multiple parties on the network as well that multiple people are involved it's remarkable in hindsight this Satoshi Nakamoto whomever he or she was got this many people there's nearly a hundred people in this room studying this ten years later but somehow he solved a collective action issue because it was just software code back in 2009 but it's still the example how does Silvio McCauley with a very clever blockchain adaptation and Algar and how does he get people to start using it and until he starts to get people to use it where's the value or if you have an application that's to be file-sharing or for medical records there's a medical records project here at MIT but how do you start to get people to use it and you know these are solved every day in the internet space but blockchain has a little bit greater Rik wrinkles so there's a chicken and egg issue Priya question is is there some perception look can I use that word there's some perception it's not a real thing so it might not propagate and there might not be as much consumer adoption that I that may well be one of the commercial challenges Elon did you have someone ended up in Bitcoin was because people were interested in the innovation so in a very solution and then hiriam and other chains or basically pouring money into the ecosystem giving money to developers to develop solutions because they they are betting on every one of you as you're thinking about your final projects this collective action issue has multiple features one to me is the governance of the blockchain software updates which we said is a little bit about hard Forks and so forth and how do you have consensus and how centralized to the governance stay which we'll come back to when we talk about the Securities and Exchange Commission and whether it's a token that's regulated as a security so there's that part of governance but then there's the collective action issue that if you have a payments or medical records or or trade finance how do you get folks to adopt and in the banking sector the banks are the big the big sort of elephants in the room the big dominant incumbents how do you get them to adopt or you somehow competing away their profits and not having them adopt which is more a commercial business issue about collective action so the financial sector as we've talked about favors permission block chains that don't have as many they have some collective action issues but they don't have as many collective action issues they have four fewer scalability and performance issues because they say I'm not using proof-of-work there might be 15 20 or even 75 or a hundred nodes but they think that way they can secure their privacy and security now medoras and Nahas paper on zk ledger might be a solution and some of those banks might start using that but I'm talking about 2018 I'm not talking about 2020 or 2025 right now they're favoring permissioned closed-loop systems rather than permissionless open loose systems so next week we're going to be moving to public policy oh my god you're gonna get to read my testimony all 28 pages of it yeah can I get it but I was asked to testify in the House Agriculture Committee in July it's a venue I'd been at a whole bunch of times it was fun to be back in front of the chairman Conaway from Texas and Colin Petersen for Minnesota but yes you'll get to read mine it was I I knew that there was no legislation that was going to happen this year I want to just give you the feedback but some the Republicans run the committee they get to invite as many witnesses they want and then they let the minority invite one sometimes two witnesses so I got the call to testify because I'm like the old you know sea dog and they're bringing me in or something but it was flood but I it sort of I was preparing for this class anyway so I kind of wrote the testimony for you all Congress thought it was for them and it was it was but that's the main thing Mark Carney who runs the Bank of England wrote this really beautifully written piece that he gave in the spring about a little bit the history currency and so forth but mark also runs the financial stability the it so the the the Financial Stability Board which has the finance ministers and central bank governors and securities regulators from 20 countries so it's the g20 s finance heavies I used to go to that not as a finance heavy but I used to go because they wanted me inside the tent rather than outside the tent because we were doing derivatives reform here in the US and some of the foreign finance ministers had a different point of view and when it got to the place when seven finance ministers and it was an interesting group the Russian finance minister in the UK and the South African and four others wrote a joint letter to secretary Geithner pointing out some shall we say observations and what we were doing they had differences I got invited so I used to go I got to know mark very well but it's it's a good paper and and you'll get a sense really from I would say mark is neither a Bitcoin maximalist or minimalist but he does say don't use the word cryptocurrency use the term crypto asset so it's kind of an interesting piece and then I don't know how many of you are Sloan fellows that are here I recognize some of the Sloan fellows I think about 20 or 25 percent of the class or so fellas you're gonna get to see Joe Stiglitz in New York in a few weeks and I think yeah this is the CNBC piece where Joe who's Nobel laureate at Columbia University has a stork and distinct point of view about Bitcoin I've had two or three lively conversations with Joe about this later in the semester you'll read Paul Krugman in Nouriel Roubini and and and there's a little video of Bill Gates talking about Bitcoin I want you ought to be aware of the Bitcoin minimalist and understand what they're saying and I would put Joe on a one to ten scale at maybe one and a half or maybe two Paul you'll read Paul Krugman's piece a little later he's kind of down there too I can't just they can't modulate between them but I think it's really important to understand what some really great minds are thinking about this from that side as well so that's what the three things are for next week and then the conclusion I think that it does provide the networking but it comes with cost as we said they're a bunch of trade offs I think the scalability the efficiency the privacy the ones are solvable I can't prove it but I think in a matter of years and it might be three or ten years it won't be three to ten months though I think a lot of that is susceptible to the bright minds of MIT and elsewhere as computer scientists I think the challenges that are tougher it really relates to governance I think governance and collective action and back to those two graphs there really are places that are better to centralize then decentralize and we're gonna be exploring that for the rest of the semester together so thank you thank you for the veterans who do sat through all that [Applause] you
