 so we've got a lot to cover but i'm going to start with a little background about the internet and the payment riddle something about money which is at the core really of all classes on finance but we usually take for granted and then satoshi nakamoto's innovation who was satoshi nakamoto what is that innovation a bit about crypto markets the blockchain technology use cases and then the core really is how to think about viability of those use cases a little touch on central bank digital currencies and ground truths so a lot to cover if we don't get through it all we will talk about this again when we talk about payments and class six um in terms of some of the readings i shared with you two write-ups that were done for a class that neha narula and i teach an online class called cryptocurrency which is available through mit and those two write-ups the economics of money and technology i'm sorry and the response is a big finance sort of give you some of the challenges and how to think through these technologies also the bank of international settlement did a review just earlier in 2020 uh about the central bank digital currency space because so much is going on there and particularly after facebook announced their libra project in june of 2019 many central banks took note and said wait maybe there's something going on here that we too need to do more now before facebook libra there were many projects the bank the one of the world's largest central banks the rick's bank in sweden was already looking at an e-chrono project there were other projects but all of a sudden that facebook lever project kicked into high gear central bankers around the globe and particularly china's look and review and announcements around a digital currency electronic payments project also got kicked into gear so regardless of where you come out whether blockchain technology cryptocurrencies are getting rolled into the stack rolled into the technology stock a big finance what we can say as of 2020 what's really the case is that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have at least been a catalyst for change an important catalyst for change pushing upon big finance pushing upon central banks to reconsider how they do payments how they do the basics of money and i laid out a few questions again romaine we'll look for some uh hands we're gonna keep this a little shorter than we usually do just because we have so much to cover but how does bitcoin fit into the history of money what are the strategic and tactical considerations assessing viability and value propositions and how are these central banks thinking about what they're doing and remain if we can just see if we could get one or two people and kind of each of these three questions um and these are the central questions i'm going to try to cover in the next hour or so okay sounds good who would like to get us started i'm watching for your blue hands quiet day today if you wish gary i'm also happy to cold call all right well i'm gonna i'm gonna start i'm gonna kind of just go and then but i i hope that everybody come in i start with this scene and and i don't know if anybody wants to raise a blue hand and can tell me what movie this is from and and the era but this is the opening scene of a movie from the mid-1990s the net 1995 sandra bullock now i start with this because pizza net was actually real now the the this this cyber security sort of spy thriller with sandra bullock sort of cracking through the computer network remember let's place this mid-1990s it was only the early 1990s that tim's burner live associated with mit actually came up with the protocols that connects the world wide web the internet had been around for some time coming out of dorpa and the department of defense in the u.s and academic institutions but by the early 90s there was actually something that those of us in the public could use beyond universities beyond the defense establishment and the like but what hadn't been solved what hadn't been solved by 1995 was how to move money on the internet and pizza hut founded something called pizza net which is thought to be the first commercial use where you could actually order something online just 25 years ago order something online through pizza nut there was only sort of one problem you ordered the pizza and guess what you couldn't pay online nobody had figured out how to pay online you had to have the pizza delivery at your door and you pay so just think it's in the middle of the corona lockdown we're sheltering at home and if it weren't for these inventions of 25 years ago we're about to discuss you would be paying for that pizza at the door when the delivery truck arrived or for your groceries or for any other household goods that you have so this riddle what i call the payments riddle what others call it payments riddle uh was at the core of this new technology the internet now the internet has been fully adopted into the technology stack of finance by now but in the mid 1990s it was in essence fintech but the question is how to move value on the internet to do it securely efficiently and really importantly similar to the packets of data that move on the internet as packets of data and thus peer-to-peer see the internet doesn't really have a central controller all the data that we're live streaming right now between and amongst us between 78 participants on this zoom meeting right now is through packets of data and it's not through one central controller even though we think well zoom might be controlling all this but the challenge really was how could you prohibit double spending how could you send a packet of data to one person and ensure that that packet of data wasn't also sent to another in essence double spending having some data like an email that we might send to two people they're both reading the same email they don't know that each are reading the same email so that was this payments riddle secure efficient packets of data but avoiding double spending lots of challenges lots of attempts and there were dozens of attempts some that even went to go on to get patents and started businesses raised money some of them through the earlier days of venture capital were back like cyber cash and digi catch and e-gold b-money all of these failed all of them dozens more beyond what i list here in the 1990s and the hurdles were well of course the same hurdles that any startup would have around merchant adoption would the with the stores actually adopt it but this issue of double spending and the only sort of solution to double spending was using centralization that there was one central computer one central controller to avoid the double spending or the other side of it how did you form consensus if you didn't have a central controller how to form consensus on the state of who had the money and who didn't have the money so this sort of central payments riddle a big issue in the 1990s attracted the interest of a crypto cryptography group called the cypherpunk community i kid you not it's called cypherpunk community it was an email list that it started in the late 1980s and had gone once for some time and so um there were early digital solutions that were another a little bit different and some of the cryptography that was brought to it was not brought from the cipher punk community it was brought to bear from great cryptographers some of them at mit some elsewhere that came together by 1996 with a solution it's just updated today the same solution we use now secure socket layer and transport layer security these two protocols on top of tin berners-lee protocols about the world wide web from four or five years earlier these are the main protocols there are many others that were added but these are the main protocols that allowed us to secure the internet it's how we do it right now a a transfer of data that's secure by the use of cryptography and what did that lead to that led to a lot of things where we could accept visas and mastercard american express by the mid-1990s amazon ebay were both formed in 1995. it's a founder's uh dream to get formed right when a technology is transitioning if amazon if jeff bezos had been formed in 1992 would it still have been around by 1996 when the secure socket layer and the cryptography was there for him to get going if jeff bezos decided to form it in 1998 or 99 might have been too late now there's a lot of things that amazon got right and visas got right but i'm saying timing was one that was remarkable paypal came along in 1998 and interestingly the first mobile payments was actually uh ericsson teaming up with telenor in 1999 now that product is not around today or maybe somebody will correct me and say there's still a little bit but one of the early ones that really took off was alley pack and then m pesa in kenya now all of this still left the payments riddle that payments riddle was still there to some in that cipher cypherpunk community now the internet could get commercialized the internet could move on we had this way through cryptography just to secure payments but there was still this question and it goes to the heart of what is money and so i'm going to turn a little bit to chat about money but just see if romaine has any questions so far nobody at the moment okay so i like to go back in time i like to go back 23 2400 years in talking about money it's not the first time money was discussed because money was really an invention of humankind thousands of years before that but i like to go back to plato and aristotle plato did not write extensively on money but what he did write is interesting is that money is a symbol devised for the purpose of exchanges to think you and i are going to exchange something at the time maybe it was a goat for wheat maybe i needed the goat today you needed the wheat tomorrow but we can we can use this symbol as plato wrote as a purpose of that exchange and interestingly separately plato wrote plato wasn't in for using gold and silver for money now this is interesting in contrast to plato's student aristotle now aristotle wrote extensively about money it seemed like aristotle wrote extensively about many things but one of them was money and aristotle wrote that it solves the problem of commensurability the same sort of issue that plato is grappling with ability you need rice you need grains i need goats how do we have some commensurability between that or or the second point here money is a guarantee that we have what we want in the future so this is sort of a time commensurability i need something today you need something tomorrow so these two forms of marrying up needs and wants and values aristotle talked also as a as a philosopher about what his values and then talked about four absolute values now i hate to disagree with aristotle but you know over time over time there are many of aristotle's great writings that have been challenged about the earth and about the solar system about the heavens the skies the bodies so why not say that baby aristotle didn't quite have it right about money talked about durability portability divisibility i still sort of agree and most monetary economists would agree on that it's this fourth point did it have intrinsic value i find myself more associated with plato that said it was just a symbol it's it's but a symbol and so today when we think about money we often think of six key characteristics is it durable portable divisible these were air styles seem to to 2300 years later people still tend to agree but rather than intrinsic value that it's uniform acceptable and stable we'll talk a little bit more about that when we get to the economics of cryptocurrencies but remember instead of intrinsic value that it's uniform that it's the same unit of account within some local or national economy that others accept it because if others don't accept it how can i know that that's what i take today i can use tomorrow and then its value is stable and we think over the last three hundred plus years about institutions that help ensure that a currency value is stable we call them central banks so instead of an intrinsic value that we humans create some form of acceptability uniformity and stability questions we've done so far but i'll give our students a few seconds to raise their hand if they want to yes we have a question from hassan please hassan hello professor yeah um i mean uh my question is uh when he said that people could exchange things for other things um as a mean of as i mean so i mean how how could how could the cryptocurrency survive if there is no intrinsic value in it and it's so volatile and when he said that central banks make sure that these currencies um are stable it's because like for instance in my country the the central bank has to have gold and other currencies to uh support the uh our currency our local good our local currency so i'm just baffled to to to see like someone speaks about well you know what it's it's it's only a symbol okay i know that it is a symbol but it has to have some value in it otherwise the other party would not accept it as as as a mean of exchange if that makes sense so hassan is is associating himself more with aristotle than plato and i find myself more associated with plato than aristotle so this is a worthy debate that's gone on for well well over a couple thousand years but when when i say that it doesn't have intrinsic value and it's more about uniformity acceptability and stability think about i'll take the us dollar i don't know what's your country uh i'm from bahrain so i'm not as familiar with your central bank but let's take the u.s dollar instead of bahrain if you walk into the federal reserve the u.s federal reserve and you have a hundred dollar bill you know paper currency 100 what will they give you i mean other than that they would probably send you on your way and the security guard would say we're we're in this corona virus period nobody's allowed in the building but what what would they do if you showed up at the you know the new york federal reserve or the you know richmond federal reserve and you said i i want i want something for this hundred dollars i suppose that a few uh years ago that they would give me like a gold if that makes sense okay so we got rid of that in 1933. so a few years ago would be like at the beginning of the great depression under president roosevelt what would they give you in 2020 they would give me i think uh the government's uh that the government basically uh would support this piece of paper i assume so so you're getting at the government which sort of ensure through its means and methods that it's acceptable by other citizens and it's acceptable by the government how they do that they say well we'll take it for u.s taxes we'll take it for bahrainian taxes and in most economies the governments are anywhere from a quarter to a half of the economy in some way so they will accept it for government yes they'll ensure that other people accept it through what's called legal tender laws through the coercive power of the state they will say others might must accept it and this is not a new thing genghis khan was doing this in china uh and it was pretty coercive it was kind of you know the coercive power of the state you must accept the official currency so acceptability can be accepted by the government it could be acceptability that others must accept it broad debts public and private and they can work on stability inform central banks to ensure that now what does it mean by stability it means addressing the official sector to the supply and pricing of money supply and pricing the supply we talk about the monetary supply the pricing is through interest rates but can you go into the u.s central bank can you go into bahrain and actually get gold no you can go in and get a hundred dollar bill and they might give you 520s if you really want they'll give you 100 ones but you still have just a physical piece of paper or a digital representation that i would contend i'm sort of with plato it's just a symbol it's a symbol that our society no matter whether it's small or big has come together and it represents a store of value it represents a means of exchange but it frankly doesn't have intrinsic value the way aristotle talked about it it has only value because we humans place a value upon it but uh hassan are you on still on the other side do you feel gold has intrinsic value yes i i think because it's uh scarce nettle and i know that prices could go up and down but still i could i know that i could sell it one day and get money or get whatever so gold gold is but what we now call an element it's it's on the periodic table it's it's it's got great attributes because it's scarce it takes a lot of human resources to get it out of the ground the other thing about gold it's divisible it's portable it's uniform it doesn't oxidize so it's a really good base sort of element in that way as well and now we have give or take 10 000 years of acceptability that it's a human shared narrative some of it not good some of about war and slavery and all sorts of challenges in human history but gold and to a lesser extent silver were very acceptable and stable but think about this for a moment all the world's gold that's ever been mined if you take all of that gold it can fit in four olympic sized pools four olympic sized poles you can put all that gold into one space now it's spread around the world in in jewelry and in secure walks but it's only four olympic size pools i would kind of contend that's that's just a symbol uh again it has some you know kind of features that make adorable and and it's got 10 000 years of human narrative um and acceptability and uh i can assure you that uh those who are really at times of trouble would probably take a piece of gold if it was really in times of war and despair take a piece of gold over bitcoin but on the other hand we're going to get into what bitcoin is and how it creates some digital scarce store value so hassan we we could keep going with a lively debate but i hope that helps at least frame the sides of this thing yeah i just have one thing uh to to say now i mean if if the u.s for some reason collapsed what would happen to the whole monetary system i mean it's it's very dangerous that makes sense because you're asking what happens if the nation's currency collapses and we have we have history of that we we don't have recent history when a world's dominant currency collapses but we've certainly in a history of many countries currencies collapsing in fact right now venezuela's currency basically collapses and what happens in countries that where the currencies enter hyperinflation and start to collapse you start to see communities reach out to another symbol some other symbol that is acceptable and has stability it might be in the common time in the current time that those people will reach out to the us dollar and your question is what if the dollar collapses but in in monetary history says that usually that when a currency goes bad people reach out to the better currency and it could be a neighboring country it could be a different metal like when when we had challenges between different base metals or even earlier times when we had uh money that looked a little different than we currently looked like let me hold that about what happens to the us dollar for a moment and just say the roll of money because we'll we'll lose time and i want to get going as to what cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is so the role of money these three things a medium of exchange as plato and aristotle talked about a store of value that aristotle basically said that i can hold it today for something tomorrow that's a store of value and it also then becomes a unit of account the us dollar is a unit account in the u.s the yen in japan the euro in in europe a unit of account these three rolls of money and it's looked very different over time cowie shells are in greece but today i put here an alipay mobile wallet that's sort of what we use dominantly around the world we talked a little bit about fiat currency when hassan and i were going back and forth a fiat currency is a representation of some central bank liability central banks an invention of the late 17th century both in england and in sweden just about the same decade in the late 17th century was a check on the sovereign you see the king the king in england using that story for a moment the king was at yet another war with france and wanted to borrow money uh and and when the king wanted to borrow money going to the noble lords the noble lord said enough already king and said we need some mechanism to control how much you can borrow and how much you can borrow is in essence of representation of money and they set up the bank of england and in sweden it was a check also on the sovereign for a little bit different political reasons than a war with france and there we had the initial sort of central banks here in the u.s we went about it alexander hamilton thought we should have something that was during the 1790s by the 1830s andrew jackson said enough with this sort of centralized banking and then we went for nearly 80 years about 75 years from the 1830s to the 19 teens with no central bank we had crisis after crisis and we formed one during president wilson's time one of the great uh sort of progressive uh movements of the day and just about 100 years ago but fiat currencies are representations of liabilities and hassan was saying well but don't they have something behind it what they have behind it is the government's ability to of course tax the government's ability to uh be trusted to keep its promises to keep that currency stable but again just like when that that english king was at war with france sometimes sometimes they over print the money sometimes it gets out of control and central banks lose control um but it has very big network effects that we talked about the acceptance for taxes for legal tender it's accepted through what mandel would say was an optimum currency area now we have 180 currencies around the globe and some work well and some don't work so well like venezuela right now and so in the midst of all of that you know the question isn't this a little humorous is what's money's future is it digital currencies or is it like in in you know kind of the fun movie star wars is it uh uh these types of things credit chips and the like now i would say if you're a star trek fan in star trek gene rottenberry didn't have a currency if you go through all the original star treks and everything they actually didn't have any money that was gene rottenberry's future so he sort of dispensed with all this plato and aristotle let's now let's sort of go a little bit more serious and then talk about satoshi nakamoto but romaine any questions um none so far let's give it a few seconds nope i think we're good to go so with that foundation let's go back to the payments riddle so we get through the 1990s the internet is taking off we figure out how to secure it and the and the credit card companies find a way to move money some startups happen paypal and the like start up in this area the fintech of the late 1990s mobile payments start by the naughts we already have alipay and m payson in africa but this payment riddle is still there and that cipher punk mailing list is still there and on halloween night in 2008 an 8-page paper is written and is put up on the internet on this cypherpunk mailing list that might only be a couple hundred people i've been working on a new electronic cash system peer-to-peer no trusted third party no central authority and what satoshi nakamoto wrote in that eight-page paper what nakamoto-san wrote was bitcoin white paper had never used the word blockchain technology we've come to call it blockchain technology so what what is the blockchain technology fundamentally it's a it's a shared accounting system a shared accounting system or shared database system so satoshi nakamoto had time stamped ledgers and a timestamp ledger with cryptography to secure it was not new a timestamp ledger my little illustration here uh neha narula and i use this so i want to give her credit as well um represents blocks of data blocks of data and between these blocks of data a cryptographic hash function a cryptographic hash function we use every day of our lives just we don't know we're using it somewhere on the internet to commit to data this this technology this this idea of taking a block of data and adding another block of data and having a hash function in between was an innovation of the late 1980s two bell labs scientists haber and stoneta wrote a paper about it even started a company to notarize legal documents by 1995 a little startup called surety that existed that existed but what nakamoto-san figured out was how to have multiple parties nakamoto-san solved the consensus riddle or what some people call byzantine generals problem the problem is what if i don't know the other people keeping the ledger again the byzantine generals problem was not new it wasn't even about money the byzantine generals problem would have been written about in the early 1980s it was a computer systems problem if you tie various computers together what if one of them fails or even in an airplane what if one of the engines fails it's the question of thought tolerance but what satoshi nakamoto did was solved it through something called proof of work and we don't have the time to go through that but what this what this provided together was a decentralized auditable database now in the case of bitcoin 10 000 computers around the globe maintain this auditable database and this audible database builds a block of data on top of a block of data on top of a block of data but it's shared accounting system maintains it there was one other thing that went on in this period of time in the late 1990s a computer scientist nick saba wrote a paper and coined the phrase smart contracts again not an original idea but what nick sabo said what if we could take a set of promises put them in digital form and then the parties can perform against them in essence what if we automate and computer code the movement of a property right now i grew up in baltimore maryland my dad had a vending machine business you know cigarette machines and canning machines and and uh and the like a vending machine is a smart contract it's a conditional movement of property right it's the pack of gum if you put some money in the machine so you can think of a smart contract as digitizing basically a vending machine they're not necessarily smart they're not necessarily legal contracts so i'd be cautioned about that but these two concepts came together smart contracts meaning can i digitize the movement of a property right and then this accounting system of a shared ledger that multiple parties can share a ledger with no central controller that that's kind of the conceptual framework um i want to pause for a second romaine and take questions on what i usually cover what i usually cover in a lot more time than the few minutes that i just did any questions from the students this must be because we just went through holiday time and um we had our zoom easters and zoom seders um there are no hands raised for now ah we do have one question from celie please okay so i was just wondering can you explain a little more um the issues of the decentralized auto audible database you mentioned very briefly um when it had first come out and how these were solved but can you like i just to understand what issues they were solving can you kind of explain so what not if i understand the question what nakamura-san was trying to solve was what uh has been come to call double spending can you can you in a digital way move a representation of value in a digital way move that without having a central authority we move digitally representation of values every day when you go online and buy something you go to expedia you go to amazon you go to ali baba we move digitally representation of values we no longer have much of our economy on physical cash but we we always have some central authority a bank a payments company that we'll talk about in class six uh some central authority controlling that to ensure that you actually have that value to authenticate and authorize the movement of that money so what satoshi nakamoto was solving for is what if there was no central authority and it was a shared database or ledger or what i call a shared accounting system that would be the core core thing uh this this kind of riddle from the 1990s we send packets of data around the internet with this out of central authority maybe you do that and i don't think it's a surprise this happened in the middle of the financial crisis halloween in the middle financial crisis when when trust in central authorities was quite low and especially trust in wall street and banking and and banks in europe was quite low um this burst of innovation came at that time i i hope that helps and and i think as we're going to chat through today and in other classes the question is are there other applications see see this goes to the heart of finance it goes to the heart of the plumbing satoshi nakamoto's innovation still survives 12 years later in in this adversarial adversarial sort of off the grid way bitcoin still survives 12 years later but are there other applications in finance where a shared database system a shared accounting system is the best way to go and we've had inventions like this uh infrastructure technologies that have radically changed finance and one of them from several hundred years ago was the joint stock company when i talk about a technology stack one from several centuries ago was can we have a shared ownership of a company and when that was sort of invented i guess some people would have said what do we need that for this instead of a shared company is a shared database and and so that's the debate is it really uh needed will it be useful in the future it has led to a crypto market about 200 billion dollars as of yesterday two-thirds of which is is bitcoin um highly volatile uh hassan would say but what's the intrinsic value it is a digital scare store of value and it's only has value because somebody else will move it when bitcoin was or rolled out in 2009 nobody saw that it had value it was just a kind of interesting uh project but by 2010 one uh person who was in the community said let's see if i could get anybody to give me something uh commercially and it was actually pizza it wasn't pizza net the sandra bullock uh uh movie we started with in 1995 but 15 years later in 2010 a crypto enthusiast in florida uh put out on an email list i will give you ten thousand bitcoin if you send me two pizzas two pizzas ten thousand bitcoin in may of 2010 it took about a week before anybody responded but two pizzas showed up at his door and sure enough uh uh uh this this crypto enthusiast in florida sent the 10 000 bitcoin now at the time there wasn't a crypto market at the time it was thought that the two pizzas were worth about forty two dollars that he had paid uh ten thousand bitcoin for that ten thousand bitcoin today would be well valued about 65 million dollars so ten years later you kind of go well that was that was kind of an interesting time to do that um it's led to different sectors there's thousands of these coins the payment or store value tokens or the dominant about three quarters of the market uh some of you may have heard of ethereum but platform tokens where vitalik budaran rolled out this thing called ethereum and ethereum is a conceptually a worldwide shared computer uh it has many attributes of of of a operating system i wouldn't compare it and contrast it with ios and android but it does have attributes similar to a worldwide platform layer operating system upon which distributed applications or dapps can be put on top so this is this ecosystem there's a few dozen payment or store value tokens there's dozens of platform tokens there's a thousand to two thousand applications placed on top the conceptual framework in these applications is they're decentralized will anybody use them different questions um along the way so what has this led to it's led to blockchain use cases around speculative investing crowd funding through initial coin offerings from 2017 to 2019 nearly 30 billion dollars was raised by basically selling a token before you had a business you might have a good idea you might have be legitimate players and you raised money off of this you weren't selling equity you were not selling debt you were selling a token that could be used on some site in the future now those tokens have largely been in 2020 this is those tokens are largely for crypto exchanges for gaming for gambling for something called decentralized finance and file sharing now there's something that's consistent about the first three crypto exchanges gaming and gambling some of the users of these gaming gambling and exchange sites want a sort of a basis of staying off the grid they want censorship resistance see the thing about cryptocurrencies the good and the bad sometimes is the official sector though they can track some of it they can't track all of it that it's some way sometimes to stay off the grid i'm not advising this i'm just saying the economics of it some of that is about censorship resistance all of the other uses has been around blockchain technology and the uses really are potential uses they haven't taken off can we use it in payment systems can we use it in trade finance can we use it in clearing settling and processing and there are hundreds of projects that have been in proof of concept or pilot stages none that have truly broken out yet and this is why i say it hasn't come into the technology staff you can by the way get your mit diploma on a blockchain technology i'm saying that if you do you can decide um uh also to get it in paper for i thought uh romaine actually we had a poll to just to see how many people there's a poll on use of cryptocurrency or something uh the first of those two polls um if if folks don't mind just giving a little uh flavor for have you ever owned crypto and so forth so um it looks like a third have owned bitcoin or ethereum or altcoins and we have does bitcoin exhibit the three rolls of money uh a little over half yes and a little less than half no i'm going to ask if somebody one person on the yes side one person on the nose side just wants to articulate why it does not uh exhibit the three roles of money the store value medium of exchange unit of account um and one and for this romaine we'll cold call so if somebody wants to take the lead on either side any volunteers camilo and and if you could declare which side you're on so somebody can volunteer on the other side as well yeah i'm i am on the no side i mean i i alright so just for a moment so somebody on the optimist positive side please volunteer but camilla yeah i know i mean i i think that still as a medium of exchange uh bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrencies are really limited if i want to go to i don't know to publix and buy something uh with bitcoin it would be so hard i'll have to find an app that translate my bitcoin to real money and then try to pay and there is also a questionable thing about the store of value you know bitcoin at least and ethereum i think it's also true has been fluctuating so much that uh you never know how much value are you getting for a bitcoin day today so i think there is still a long way before like fulfilling the the essentials of money all right so i think camilo is saying i can't go to publix not a medium of exchange where i want to go and it's kind of this volatile uh store of value and you didn't address a unit of a cap but let's see if there's somebody on the other side who just wants to kind of articulate the other side of this we have devin devin please i can give the counter at least in my opinion um i don't think that the idea of a store value in the medium exchange are shortcomings of the currency i think their shortcomings of the market in which it operates um so you can use it to exchange value if the infrastructure isn't there that's not the currency's fault that's sort of the market participants and then with the store of value it does store a value and that value does fluctuate that's true but again i think that's because of the market it's in and speculation going on around these currencies uh camilla do you want to you know you both are unmuted you can cross and devin can stay on muted too is any reply just uh for 30 seconds no no i i just want to say that although it's true that the value of the bitcoin it fluctuates with the market the point is that if you want a worldwide accepted uh medium of exchange it cannot fluctuate as much as bitcoin otherwise the financial system and even you know people who who have savings wouldn't uh have their savings in bitcoin i mean you are not going to put your funding you know your your savings account into bitcoin because you might get lost overnight so and devon i i agree um that it does fluctuate overnight i wouldn't put my savings in it i never have i never will um but i do think it kind of comes down to what is the exact definition of the question you're trying to answer like can you store value in it yes is the value gonna be the same tomorrow maybe not and that's something that might stabilize over time as like if it gets used more for day-to-day interactions like going to the shop and it's not kind of speculation and sort of hype around it then maybe we can kind of converge to a point where it does satisfy everything fully yeah and and this debate that devin and camilla are helping frame is a debate that's a worthy debate i will tell you that i'm not a bitcoin maximalist but i actually i'm probably a little closer to devon than camilo on this in terms of it is a digital scarce store of value will it be worth something 10 years from now maybe not maybe not but it is survived kind of in this swamp this this uncertain sort of world for 12 years and uh it it has some value to some folks hasan earlier would say but it doesn't have intrinsic value and i would say well it's just a symbol uh in any regard it can be a medium of exchange in in certain places but it needs an infrastructure camilo is absolutely right the state treasurer of ohio in late 2018 had announced a straight state controller i think it might have been in ohio an elected office that the state of ohio would accept bitcoin for taxes was it just uh for political reasons that this gentleman announced it uh that he thought it was associating himself with a new innovation in the in the economy but they needed an infrastructure to accept the bitcoin they had to convert it for one percent fee uh to to us dollars uh for sure it's not much of a unit of account but sometimes it becomes a unit of account inside of these other de centralized apps inside the ico space so it sort of probably exhibits one out of the three mostly it's a speculative store value it can be a medium of exchange it can be a unit of account but it hasn't adopted this a number of years ago the financial stability um uh board um a worldwide organization of 20 the g20 finance ministers and central bankers uh decided that they would no longer call bitcoin and others crypto currencies and they call them crypto assets so they were associating more with camillo's side they were saying we're not going to give this the kind of word to call it a currency and yet the u.s department of treasury some seven years ago had to address itself to the question of whether bitcoin and other similar digital assets were currency under u.s bank secrecy act laws against uh money laundering and the like and for that purpose they said that bitcoin was a virtual currency so there's the us department of treasury fitting it into a box now i dare say they needed to somehow address this public policy issue as to whether it was going to be regulated under the bank secrecy access somehow they had to call it a currency call it a virtual currency another part of the u.s department of treasury about the same time said it was going to be treated as property for tax purposes so inside the u.s treasury department uh clearly for purposes of trying to decide how it is going to be taxed how it's going to be treated for anti-money laundering laws one part of the treasury called a virtual currency another part of the treasury u.s treasury called it property rather than currency and that fit into that so i think i'll move on a little bit but um we can uh take down the poll i think or do i do do i do that you uh so if every every person should be able to close that little polling window i do not have control over it oh okay um then i need to do that here for a second so that it closes okay so there's a lot of challenges of this shared accounting system scalability performance you can move about seven or ten transactions on bitcoin per second you can move 10 to 20 transactions a second on ethereum that's kind of not the shock that we need to the system our shared centralized equity clearing system here in the us the depository trust dtcc needs to move the securities and exchange commission sort of saying you need to be able to move about 100 million transactions a day well guess what in the middle of the most volatile time in february dtcc was moving 350 million transactions and when i say transactions it could be for 100 shares it could be a thousand shares the volumes and shares was higher but i'm talking about how many transactions were moving through that system blockchain technology by and large has a bunch of issues still to sort through is the point from public policy issues commercial use cases and the like now the question is for the 2020s as the scalability performance and efficiency issues as privacy and security as some of these are worked through is a shared accounting system a shared ledger system something that's going to take off and i go back to economic work from the 1930s by coast and i just sort of captured in a little slide here the trade-offs of centralization and decentralization and this is a cost curve but centralization does lead to cost about a single point of failure about economic rents and about uh capture you know we all know that we pay more for something that's highly centralized if you want to build an app on top of ios or on top apple's ios or an app on top of google's android you're going to pay a fee because they're the two dominant pipes if you need to deal with certain centralized financial systems there's more economic rents and in fact financial sector in the us takes about seven and a half percent of our economy that's double what it took in the 1960s now it's a bigger economy it's a bigger financial sector but does it necessarily need to take seven and a half percent of our economy so some would say all right those are some of the costs of centralization and then there's also cost of decentralization coordination governance security scalability now coast was writing in the 1930s why do you bring together certain attributes inside of a firm it was about the theory of the firm and why some things are inside a firm and it was the cost the cost of information the cost of coordination that you bring some things inside some things are left out the question is is will this change this balance somehow vitalik budaran talked about a trilemma and said it's hard to get all three of these to get security decentralization and scalability so budaran is the innovator at 19 of the ethereum network he's now 25 maybe but vitalik buran said look you can get decentralization like in bitcoin and security it's reasonably secure but it's not scalable you maybe can get towards scalability but you're probably going to tend towards more centralization now one of mit's award-winning computer scientist silvio mccalley says no he disagreed he says you can actually solve for this silvio uh won the touring award he's sort of the father uh considered the father of something called zero knowledge proofs and said no you can solve for this and silvio actually took a leave a sabbatical and leave to create a cryptocurrency and a company around al grant and i'm not i'm not sort of marketing for him but i'm just i'm just commenting there's this debate can you solve basically what satoshi nakamoto wanted decentralization in a scalable way and have it be secure so how does one assess use cases because this class is ultimately about sort of sorting through this well first he asked the question is the project a project that actually uses cryptocurrency or it services it and i give examples of companies uh they're in custody and software and exchange operation binance is a big crypto exchange coinbase is both an exchange in custody fidelity one of the world's largest asset managers said we'll take custody and hold your cryptocurrencies so you could be on one side of the divide and say we're gonna we're gonna be even like a hardware company bitmain and create the hardware in this space those are kind of uh use classic uh uh strategy analysis to think about those the sort of rougher side of this is how do you consider what are the strategic questions about actually using blockchain technology what are the value creation propositions and i think it's embedded in this is is it worthwhile to have decentralized computing versus centralized computing is there is there an area that you think has such high economic rents that a decentralized competitor can come in you could create the case that if uber and lyft didn't exist today that uber and lyft you could say could be created on a decentralized ledger system but nobody truly had control of the ledger system and all the ride uh of sharing could be with drivers and users using that decentralized app but then again who would have actually who would have actually gone into city after city airport after airport and sort of done what uber and lyft and others have done to get into the system so i think the basic value question is centralization versus decentralization and secondly are you filling a gap in the fiat currency system fiat currencies work pretty well now we're going to talk in the next class about the pain points and there are a lot of pain points in the payment system uh that take considerable uh challenges and costs overcome clearly strategically what are the competitors doing traditional competitors those using blockchain why use append only logs this this invention of this ledger system why have multiple party consensus multiple-party consensus is a cost so if you're going to use it for trade finance you're going to try to solve something in trade finance for instance what is it solving what are the costs it can lower verification and networking cost that's the core of its economics but it comes with some costs there are also a series of tactical considerations literally what data is going to be put in who is the multiple share stakeholders what are the trade-offs and i think what we've found by and large is there not that many projects that have taken off i have here a little bit deeper dive if you get so close to a project that you think all right now let's think about it i come back to this question about multiple parties shared ledgers in bitcoin the multiple-party shared ledger has worked in part because there was a desire to have a censorship-resistant token a token that could be global truly move around the globe at times away from what the official sector might ban away from certain money laundering any uh terrorism laws that's part of it but also that it was at least initially hard to track and trace it's actually gotten easier to track and trace over time but but really the question is if you're going to think about using blockchain technology what verification costs are you really lowering and why have this multiple party distributed ledger a little bit like a shared stock company still has a lot of centralization you have thousands of people that control a shared stock company this invention of several centuries ago but you still have the management team that controls it how do you deal with that here so what have we found we found that the incumbents big finance by and large have stayed over to the left-hand side of this screen they stay towards traditional databases they haven't gone to the cryptocurrency sort of side of the screen permissionless open protocols they're exploring a little bit the middle what's called private blockchain private blockchain saying 20 or 50 companies get together maybe like in australia there is much fanfare in 2016 into actually 2017 there was much fanfare that the australian stock exchange would use a permissioned blockchain technology to update their central clearing now many people would tell you by 2020 that what the australians have done was inspired by blockchain technology but it no longer looks like blockchain technology it's a decentralized distributed database but with the australian regulator said is we need somebody to control this we need a central controller the complete opposite of what satoshi nakamoto was talking about nakamoto was saying no central authority but the australians said well this is the central clearing the the sort of the plumbing the central plumbing of the australian stock market no no we need somebody who has kind of the overall uh plays the overall referee role so to speak so incumbents by and large are using traditional databases they're exploring some of these permission databases they're not really off to the side um romaine any questions we've done so far we have 12 minutes left all right so uh let me just say something about central bank initiatives uh central banks and we'll chat about this a little bit more when we do payments central banks have taken note of this and they've thought both can i use the blockchain technology for our payment systems because central banks in most countries control those payment systems or can we actually create a digital currency at first i mean bitcoin was not really on the radar of central bankers by 2018 it became on the radar because the market had taken off and it was for a brief moment worth almost a trillion dollars it's back down to 200 billion now but they took note and in some countries like sweden they really said maybe we should be doing something here we should be creating a crypto equivalent a digital currency and one of the readings was a bank of international settlement reading which showed three different ways that a central bank could do a digital currency and this is just for your reference to remind you that it was in the reading but going back to these projects a little bit some of the projects are just papers ecuador tried to do a project actually a dollar denominated cryptocurrency and it failed because nobody in ecuador wanted to use it ecuador was already dollarized but the one to want most closely china which might be a hybrid and i'll go back to the chart in a second china has announced they're doing a digital currency electronic payment it will be fully backed by the central bank it will be fully a remmb or digital hawaii and in a sense it may be as much a reaction to bitcoin as it's a reaction to alipay and wechat pay being dominant in the retail payment system in china and it's also a reaction to facebook that was starting something called the libra project so this again is a central tenant where i am where i think of this is that the central banks are reacting in part because big tech has been reacting and and startups are there and they're saying maybe we can do something better um the opportunities that they see the opportunities is that they say well maybe we can stay in the means of payment we can promote greater competition and we can address some pain points but on the other side the other side they're really worried they're deeply worried that if they offer the public a digital representation of central bank money that they might disintermediate the commercial banks the central strategic question for central banks is can we offer the public a digital representation of that which is paper so i've covered central bank digital currencies uh too quickly i'm going to come back to it when we talk about payment systems as well but romaine we only have a few minutes so i'm going to take uh questions yeah we have a question from victor hi professor um i wanted to come back to the previous point about handling databases through a private blockchain network because i didn't fully understand how does it work could you give me some more guidance so um satoshi nakamoto's concept is that you could have hundreds or thousands of folks computers sharing a database and it's an open database and that that database can secure the ledger through this concept of a log structure block of data block of data block of data with cryptography the the commercial banks and the financial firms said we we're we're not comfortable of having hundreds or thousands of people share a database in fact we can't under various guidelines of privacy of data protection we can't have hundreds of people share that database but they're they're they're looking at maybe we can have a shared form of cooperation or what somebody might call coopetition will cooperate around the trade finance platform and then we'll compete on top of it for the provision of of lines of credit and and and trade financing and so forth so they've come together and said maybe we can have a shared closed system amongst 20 banks 16 banks 30 banks and the like and so there's five or six big consortiums trying to put together a trade finance private shared ledger now once you have that once you say it's only these 18 firms will share it this form of cooperating on a shared database but competing on top of it that form of coopetation you don't necessarily need a token so there's no cryptocurrency it's just a shared blockchain technology database some call it a digital uh ledger technology dlt to contrast it with crypto currencies i'm a little bit looser in the vocabulary admittedly but that's how it that's the conceptual framework for it if that helps yeah thank you let me just say a couple ground truths and clothes um i really do think and and i don't know which side to end up on devon or camilla's side in terms of is it money but i think nakamoto solved the payment riddle avoiding double spending it's lasted 12 years whether you like it whether you love it hate it two is i'm sorry hassan i'm kind of monies but a social and economic construct i'm i'm deeply with plato on that one but i respect those that believe otherwise i mean there's a good debate that's gone on a couple thousand years we already live in an age of digital money and in fact the corona crisis will accelerate that um we we will still have physical paper money but we'll use it less and less in a transaction and and physical paper money is more and more just a store of value that we're not using physical paper money much as a medium of exchange right now a pen only logs in multi-party consensus actually does provide an alternative but it doesn't mean it's everybody's alternative it can address verification costs but it doesn't make sense to adopt it unless there's really some viability and a value proposition of that shared ledger system we didn't talk much about it but i will say one brown truth is is that the crypto markets that 200 billion dollar market it's ripe with scams and frauds it just is um and so what's happened by 2020 is crypto currencies have evolved to be a speculative asset class generally not that correlated with equities and bonds and i'll give you one statistic the worldwide stock of gold that gold that could be in four olympic size pools collectively is worth nine or ten trillion dollars roughly collectively so some people would say a speculative store of value that's only worth two percent of that 200 billion might be worthwhile in in a big portfolio of a family office or a hedge fund um the ico boom and bust raised about 30 billion not much is being raised there now but it's worthwhile to take note of most of this is lightly regulated and so retail investors are not getting much protection i i think that's unfortunate but i still come back to the last point i think it's been a catalyst for change i think it might be one of these technologies we look back in decades and say it was a remarkable catalyst for change for central bankers and to think through whether it's trade finance or other areas in finance was there a way to form some cooperation and compete on top of it some coopetation but just like we didn't know that the internet and geolocation devices would lead to disruption in rides and we you know uber and lyft we couldn't predict in in the 1990s that the taxi business in new york was going to be completely disrupted we don't know what blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies will disrupt later in the 2020s or in the 2030s so so that's kind of my wrap on it you can sort of get a sense of why i'm not going to say i'm a maximalist in this area but i'm also not all the way a minimalist the minimalist would say no none of these ground truths matter i think it's a really important technology if nothing else because it's been a remarkable catalyst for change on how central banks and others think about payment systems which we'll take up in our next class you
