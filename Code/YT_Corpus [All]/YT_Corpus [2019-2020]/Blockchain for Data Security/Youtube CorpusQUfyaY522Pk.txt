 today on cyberwork matthew george walks your c-suite board through the scary task of getting serious about cyber security using his five pillars of cyber security framework and his book the cyber elephant in the boardroom matu takes complex confusing regulatory frameworks and maps them in a language that non-tech fluent board members can easily understand that's all today on cyberwork i'm also excited to announce a new hands-on training series called cyber work applied every week expert infosec instructors and industry practitioners teach you a new cyber security skill and show you how that skill applies to real world scenarios you'll learn how to carry out different cyber attacks practice using common cyber security tools follow along with walk throughs of how major breaches occurred and more and it's all free just go to infosec institute dot com slash learn or check out the link in the description and get started with hands-on training in a fun environment it's a new way to learn crucial cyber security skills and keep the skills you have relevant that's infosec institute dot com slash learn and now on with the show welcome to this week's episode of the cyber work with infosec podcast each week we talk with a different industry thought leader about cyber security trends the way those trends affect the work of infosec professionals while offering tips for those who are breaking in or moving up the ladder in the cyber security industry matthew gorge is the author of the new forbes book release the cyber elephant in the boardroom cyber accountability with the five pillars of security framework he's also the ceo and founder of vigi trust a cyber security company with clients in 120 countries matthieu describes his five pillars as an industry agnostic methodology and is aimed at c-suite executives with a goal of enabling businesses of all sizes to map cybersecurity risk and demonstrate cyber accountability to regulators government bodies and law enforcement agencies matthew has over 20 years of i.t security and risk management experience and is much sought after for his experience as an authority on cyber security solutions he has been asked to speak at conferences including rsa issa and isaka we're going to take a closer look at the five pillars today uh find the similarities and difference with other regulatory frameworks as well as talking in some detail about bringing your c-suite into the cyber security conversation bye to you welcome to cyberwork thank you so much i'm delighted to be here uh so let's start out as we do with most of our guests uh with a little bit about your background uh how long have you been in the cyber security industry sounds like quite a while but uh what got you first interested in to cyber risk strategies and cyber security in general yeah so i've been in cyber security for over 20 years now i started out working for a value-added reseller in dublin in ireland selling firewalls and content security and and web security and then i uh developed a passion for actual data security so the legal aspect and the risk management aspect of data and very quickly um i decided to start my own business which is vgtrust and i started vg trust in 2003 initially actually to provide data security training but at the time it was a little bit ahead of its time so i had to wait for a couple of years uh until i could really start um selling those services and then fast forward to today um the the the the main essence of what we do at vgtrust is provide integrated risk management solutions to comply with legal and industry security standards so pci gdpr hepa iso many of them and and to your point earlier on um what i was always looking to find was common denominators between all of those standards and regulations worldwide uh and that's where the five pillars of security came from okay um so you said you know you had to kind of wait a few years before like things caught up like can you can you talk a little more about that like you were offering services as early as 2003 but you said you started need to wait for the industry to catch up like what was it that you that you needed to have in place before you could do what you wanted to do yeah so at the time people were really into firewalls and intrusion detection and more more geared towards technology rather than process and people and so what i wanted to to bring to the market was a way of explaining data security and data protection to uh standard users um and and one of the things that that always struck me is that if you explain to a standard user that a firewall is like uh passport control at the airport and that content security is like customs suddenly they start understanding the value of data right so am i allowed to come in and am i allowed to bring in data and so on and so i was always driven by demystifying technology um okay yeah i was going to ask about that what is what is it that you find so interesting and rewarding about protecting digital asset assets on such a large scale well so i i i think that security and data protection is not rocket science if you explain it in plain business english and if you get people to relate to their job and to what they do on a regular basis they'll uh they'll understand it much better and then they'll start spotting when something is wrong when something is odd they'll start being able to report incidents and they'll start behaving better uh as well online and and and when they work with with systems um when when you deliver security awareness training which i've been doing for years and you know that by the end of the workshop people go away with some key messages and they they remember a few things uh they remember some key messages it's great so i often say that security is a journey and not a destination so it's an ongoing journey and you'll get a few pit stops along the way you can breathe you can demonstrate compliance to regulators and enforcement bodies and so on but you can't really rest on your laurels you have to keep going because the attacks keep moving and and one of the the key problems right now with especially with large enterprises is that you need to explain that in plain english to the board and and to the the senior executives if you come in with gdpr you'll get their attention but once you start explaining how to comply you lose them very quickly right so yeah let's let's sort of start right here with the uh the five pillars of cybersecurity framework this is the the the main slant of your book the cyber elephant in the room um so since many of our listeners might be new to some of these concepts we have you know we did a survey recently and and many of our listeners have zero to four years of cyber security experience under their belt so you know we want to sort of uh appeal to everyone here but so for people who are new to the concept of risk assessment and in a career can you explain the five pillars of cyber security and the framework around it yes so it's based on the idea that um whatever industry you you're working in uh whatever the size of your business uh you you'll end up having to comply with legal and uh regulatory frameworks that require you to have various controls in place and some of them will be technical some of them will be policies procedures skills transfer and so on and when you start looking at them it can be daunting because the industry loves to use three-letter acronyms that only security professionals really understand and and and even so with sometimes we we do get confused um and so the idea behind the five pillars of security is to bring back uh risk assessment and risk auditing and risk treatment which is really how you address risk and how you reduce risk and mitigate risk um into five common denominators and these are physical security people security data security infrastructure security which is your wider infrastructure so anything behind your firewalls your networks your extranets your applications your third parties um and your remote workers for instance and then crisis management what do you do when something goes wrong so if you try and explain any type of regulation anywhere in the world and you map all of the controls to those five pillars you'll get a much more captive audience because everybody understands that you need physical security not everybody can get into your home or into the the company premises everybody gets that people security well you're not going to let just anybody in and out and once in you have a duty of care to make sure that nothing happens to them data security but what kind of data do you have is it paper-based is it electronic is it structured is it unstructured so that's kind of easy to understand infrastructure oh okay i've got 150 vendors that i need to use well is that risk is it not how do i map that risk i use 25 applications two of which i built myself uh is there a security risk with that and in crisis management if something goes wrong with any of the other four pillars do i know what to do do i know who to call do i know what systems to shut down do i have a disaster recovery plan and so on and so once you start explaining it in those very simple terms you find that it's easier for people to start a strategy and and to start understanding what they need to do so the next step after that once you educate people into the value of the five pillars is to do some simple questionnaires so within the five pillars of security framework uh in the methodology there's two types of questionnaires there's a short questionnaire which is five questions per pillar so 25 questions okay um and we call that a super strategic questionnaire typically for board members um and then we've got a strategic questionnaire which is 12 questions per pillar so 60 questions and out of the the results of the questions you can derive what we call red flags and action items red flag would be say for instance if you um if you're a cloud provider and your infrastructure security isn't great but you still get maybe a score of 85 percent but for physical security within your your server farm you answered the wrong way then that's the red flag it's some it basically says that despite your overall score there are some red flags and stuff that you need to address immediately and then action items could be policies procedures training and the questions are very simple um for instance it could be in the super strategic questions um i am 100 confident that i have physical security systems that allow me to legally monitor who comes in and out of the business and the answer is yes absolutely yes i think so no i'm not sure no absolutely not um i don't care or it doesn't apply to my business and as you can as you can already understand if you say i don't care that might automatically raise the right work yeah yeah absolutely yeah but it's in plain business english you know and and it's it's stuff that the the board and c-level folks um understand very well okay so this is i feel like what i'm hearing and you can you can correct me on this but this is almost kind of like an intro to the idea of you know security compliances because you know there's a lot of compliance is out there there's nist there's privacy shield cobit you know payment ones like pci dss you know and hipaa for healthcare and sarbanes-oxley so how does how does the five pillars it seems like this is almost kind of like a um like get your you know sort of get your initial assets mapped and then from there you can use that to sort of apply to other compliance regulations that you need or can you explain that to me better yeah i mean um to some extent the five pillars can supersede all of the the frameworks and regulations that that that you've mentioned in fact we've mapped out the five pillars on pci and gdpr and hepa and a few others and the idea is to to be able to get into a boardroom say if you're the chief security officer or the chief compliance officer you come in once a month and then you tell the board hey we need to comply with hepa we need to comply with um high trust we need to comply with pci or whatever and then you dial back into the five pillars in in a language that they'll understand and to some extent they don't necessarily need to understand all the nitty-gritty of of the actual controls for hip-hop or pci all they need to understand is that in order to have good physical people data and infrastructure security and crisis management they um they need to be in compliance with hipaa and pci and and it's kind of a cascading from that from that from that angle if that makes sense yeah oh yeah that totally makes sense and and that sort of shows me where it where it lands you know and where it sort of like covers other things and and you know sort of envelops it and so forth so um i i think from there we want to sort of talk about the the one of the key aspects of the five pillars as you said it's written kind of in business language uh and specifically of the book is that there's this integration with the c-suite you know between the i.t and cyber security departments uh so you know this has been an ongoing problem for a while now that you know that we we hear about is that you know getting the c-suite on board with allocating funds for security problems or headspace or resources uh you know can resemble the five stages of grief as you said with leadership passing through denial and anger and grief and bargaining and acceptance on their way to implementation but you know some c-suites might never make it past the denial stage so there's you know a lot of problems to conquer so uh you know to start with for cyber security pros who are dealing with a c-suite that thinks of the company cyber security posture is you know quote it's problem how do you get leadership to realize their crucial role in driving and directing security and risk strategy yeah so again i think that the the the first step is to make sure that you speak their language right so if you look at board level c level folks what they're focused on is strategy growth uh potentially profits economies of scale recruitment and so on um so you need to be able to position security and compliance as a value-add to to those kpis that they're used to okay and one way to do that and it's covered actually in the book by one of the the the guest chapter contributors bob gartner is he talks about enterprise risk management and and talks about putting cyber and compliance on the company's balance sheet and on the p l um so that there are models out there that allow you to say okay don't necessarily just look at the cost of an incident so the cost of an incident you know could be a cost per record or per breach or whatever right um and that's a cost that to some extent can be off offset by some cyber insurance and other insurance but it's definitely a cost but it doesn't actually add value it's just like it's a cost of fixing things whereas if you explain it in in the right way and you use the right models you're able to say by investing in cyber security technology process and people you'll actually add value to uh to the organization and you you literally add value to the share price because you're you're able to add a line in your balance sheet that actually provides value to all of that efforts as opposed to coming in from from the angle of something went wrong we need to fix it so if we don't prepare for that it might cost us 40 million right the the way to look at it is to say well if we invest 10 million we'll never really have to worry about that problem that's one way of doing it the the next thing is to try and and explain to them that it's not rocket science um you know at the end of the day the technology is their technology is good it keeps evolving it's easier to manage back in the day actually when when i started in cyber uh you needed an engineer to install firewall nowadays you just click next next next and and anybody can install a file right so um so the technology is easier to implement um and and well standard technology standard like first line of defense second line of defense um so we need to get them to focus on the process the policies and the role of the users and we need to make sure that users understand that they add value to the overall uh security posture of the business and and that's done through ongoing security awareness not just like once a year to tick the box yes like i i like pci you know pci is a it's a it's a great framework if you don't know where to start because it's very prescriptive if you look at requirement 12.6 of pci it states that you need to train employees upon higher and once annually thereafter on credit card security that's great it's a good start but it's not enough you know so i i'm a great believer in ongoing training every month a little bit of information and then a couple of events around cyber security awareness month maybe global privacy day to to to do this on a regular basis um and then to go back to your initial question about what else can you do to get the attention of the of the board um i would stay away from uh fear uncertainty and doubt i i actually don't really like that approach um i don't think there's anything wrong in providing details of competitors that have been hacked but i also think that you need to put that into an overall global context so i would highly recommend that when you try and raise the awareness and if you if you really want to have numbers or if you want to have names you use reports like the verizon daily bridge investigations report um you know now in its 13th edition um which shows you the evolution of threats and which shows you the difference between a security incident and a breach again reasonably in in plain english as well because the last thing you want to do is tell the board that your competitors have been breached because they didn't have technology xyz that the board will be saying do we do we have it do we not you know yeah that's that leads into my next question because i thought i i thought i knew what the answer was going to be but now that i'm hearing you know we have a different thing going on so you know one of the things that we always hear about is you know my c-suite is very set in their ways and they don't have a baseline technology you know i've had former bosses that didn't own a computer and they had their secretary print out their emails for them and things like that but it doesn't sound like there's as much of a focus here on needing the c-suite to have a baseline technical knowledge as much as just understanding the scope of the problem is that the case do you think that that they still sort of need to know a small amount of like the process that you're asking them to authorize and implement uh so yeah i mean there's kind of a an underlying uh aspect that you you would you would expect them to understand what a file is what a network what an extranet is what a website might be the difference between uh company-owned devices and and personal devices that kind of stuff but you certainly wouldn't want to you wouldn't need to to have them understand uh the latest point-to-point encryption technology i i don't think um i don't think they need to to know that but but knowing the scope and the the the breadth of the of the work that needs to be done yes that's something that the framework is very good at doing because it does it in in very simple terms okay so so there are there's sort of a guide in there of of getting them just enough knowledge that they know to sort of understand what they need to know yeah and so if you look at the the book you know the cyber elephant in the boardroom um the the book actually starts out by uh going over a number of uh security incidents and security breaches and in very simple terms some of them that i've seen throughout my career then it starts talking about the regulations and the kind of stuff that you need to take away from the regulation for instance if you look at the occ in the u.s for banks it's all about third-party risk and managing your vendors if you look at pci it's all about managing any entity that will stop process or transmit credit card holder data you look at gdpr it's all about personal data in europe ccpa in in the us and and so on and so you you do need to convey all of those messages quickly so that they understand that some requirements are more technical than others some are regional some might look like they're regional but they're actually extra territorial like like gdpr or ccpa but once you on once you explain those concepts within five or ten minutes that that's really all you need mm-hmm okay and so the the the five pillars concept so it sounds like it integrates pretty well into things like like gdpr and european regulations it does yes it was we've done a complete mapping of of uh the articles and recitals of gdpr and and the five pillars and so you find them within each of the pillars some of them are actually uh in a couple of pillars because they cover different areas but it's actually easy to to to use that that way it's so um picture this so if if the cso says to the board well we have an issue we've had a data subject request uh they explain what that is to the to to the board and they say okay what we need to do now is we need to prepare so that if that happens again we can demonstrate compliance with gdpr so they explain gdpr and they say okay well there's 99 things to do with gdpr and we've mapped them back to physical security people security data security infrastructure and crisis management and sudden even say oh yeah we can do that that's not rocket science okay yeah uh so uh so i guess moving to that to move from sort of um theory to action once our hypothetical c-suite moves past denial and springs into action and and even you get some fast education what they need to know what are what are the first steps to creating and crafting a comprehensive risk assessment plan and security strategy especially if you you know haven't really had one up to this point so i think you need to firstly understand what you can do with risk right so risk is something that could happen to an asset and the asset could be physical or logical or a mix right so you would have a risk to [Music] your laptop being stolen that's an asset a risk to your staff because we can be victims of a social engineering attack right or maybe risk to a process which would be a mix of staff and and and physical assets uh phys yeah physical and or logical assets so you could have a risk to a piece of software that you've written because it's full of holes and a hacker could could get in um there's only a few things that you can do with risk and it's important that you you get your board and your c-level folks to understand that um you can ignore the risk and you should never ignore the risk that's really not a good strategy moving forward um you can reduce the risk now when you reduce the risk essentially you mitigate the risk by typically by putting in place a mix of technical safeguards uh using technology or settings uh policies and procedures governing how you're going to do that and then training making sure that people know what to do um you can transfer the risk to some extent so you might say well the risk associated with my call center doesn't really belong to me because the call center is managed by a third party so the the good thing about that is that the guys that manage the call center will know what to do uh and they'll probably be more proficient in in call center security than you are however the the risk still belongs to you so you can transfer the operational risk but not the actual uh legal risk or ownership of risk um and then eventually you end up with a residual risk so you've mapped the risk you know what assets it applies to you then safeguard put in safeguards and you end up with a residual risk surface and at that stage you have to decide am i willing to accept that risk or not and it could be that you have no choice but to accept the risk i'll give you an example of that um if you want to take payment by credit card and you need a point of sale device well the point of cell device is as secure as it is uh you know it's typically very secure but there's always a risk that at some stage the software won't be updated the right way and you just have to accept that risk to to do business um so you explain the concept of risk to to your target audience the the board and and the sea level and then you explain to them that you're going to assess the risk um for a given scope again the scope could be the call center it could be the server farm it could be factory a or factory b it could be premises one or two and you assess the risk there against typical attacks and normally to do that you you use methodologies like iso or nist or cis um and uh again that's very good for operational people what the five pillars does is it uh it makes it possible it empowers the uh c-level folks to to do their own risk assessment right so am i confident that i have good physical security yes no maybe i don't care it's not my problem did you see where i'm going with that yeah yeah yeah absolutely so i want to sort of jump past that so let's let's uh say for an instance that you know in in our hypothetical c-suite example here uh we got what we wanted uh they said we're gonna do it we understand the scope of the problem they implement it they allocate the funds they allocate and hire new people uh you know so the the next concern i guess is to make sure that creating the plan isn't something that's done once and never updated so how do you get your c-suite who at this point might be hearing from you about all these things uh to create an open-ended system that's able to be updated improved uh improved as time and circumstances require right so and the first thing is you're right they'll be sick of hearing from you all the time yeah yeah yeah they'll want you back so uh i go back to the concept that security is a journey and not a single destination so that's that's one of the key messages that we need to to impart on them the next thing is that they also need to understand that uh inherently when you look at security there are some tasks that are unique and there are some tasks that are recurring an example of a task that is unique is doing a risk assessment the first time you onboard a new client for instance that's a unique task because it's the first time you do it but that task becomes a recurring task if you keep the vendor on board or if you keep that business unit on board because you need to assess them on a regular basis if you look at pci which again is a good starting point pc pci has a mix of daily weekly monthly quarterly and yearly tasks an example of a daily task would be looking at the logs an example of a weekly task would be making sure that the antivirus is updated although it should be done daily but an example of a monthly time task is reviewing the file rule base a quarterly task is doing a quarterly scan and then yearly task is a full pen test so once you when you do your risk assessment you'll be able to see which assets belong to the unique type task and the ones that belong to the recurring tasks and whether it's weekly daily monthly or whatever and once you have all of that all of that in place you can put a continuous compliance program in in place so you either do it manually uh managing it through a crm or a help desk system or you use an integrated risk management tool which essentially will provide you with the ability to disseminate policies do training conduct the assessments schedule all of the tasks and then a click of a button give you a report as to where you are okay so um because the theme of our show is is cyber work uh we like to get our guests insight on breaking into the industry at the points at which they're you know currently experts so for someone who wants to do the sorts of things we're doing in these thought exercises i.e the creation and updating of security strategies or frameworks compliance risk strategies what are some skills and certifications and projects that they should be working on right now that would move them towards the goal of getting into that part of the industry yeah so uh some of the certifications that are uh actually quite good for that would be some some of the asaka certifications like the css and ceres um certainly getting training in iso is quite good i saw her iso 27000 series is based on that idea of continuous compliance uh and that that's quite good uh pci is good too because uh pc pci has that thing called um making security bau business as usual uh so it has that that that uh that angle and that methodology um certainly the five pillars of security is very simple to learn and it's very easy to to implement right um and i would also recommend i suppose uh that anyone who wants to do that makes sure that they uh they keep an eye to uh they keep their ear to the ground as regards new regulations and new mappings right and so an example of that um is uh ccpa being very often compared to gdpr right so ccpa being the us answer to gdpr well yes and no there's a common baseline but there's some key differences for instance in consent and so on and so i would urge people to to make sure that they they double check everything um and there are some very good frameworks out there that that do multiple framework mappings you know can you talk about some of the the soft skills or other you know uh talents that make people especially good at doing this type of job apart from learning regulations and so forth uh patience is a good skill to have especially when dealing with boards uh diplomacy too um i think that uh and it's an example that that i give in in the book that uh i was asked once to to do a 20-minute presentation to the board of a a nasdaq company and uh just to to talk about cyber accountability and uh what what i did is i looked them all up on on the internet i i got i got some information and they had way too much information that was available so i was able within five or ten minutes to do apprehensions too i knew that some of them were playing golf in that area i knew i even knew their handicap and so on and and so they you know some people were laughing other people were extremely offended and so that was a lesson for me because i think that some of the soft skills would be to try and uh and explain to them that they play an important role without offending them right and so no fear and uncertainty and doubt and just just get them you know it's okay to be a little bit cheeky but not too cheeky because otherwise it's it's a little bit counterproductive some of the other skills would be um the ability to to leave them with key messages you know like news bites or little digests that they can go away with right so if they can go away uh with a few key messages like security is not rocket science uh security is a journey not a destination yep uh there's only four or four things you can do with risk right so if they already go away with those three messages i think that's good and it's a nice skill to have you know yeah so to flip to the other side of that do you feel like there's a baseline level of technical expertise that someone who wants to do this kind of work needs like if you know the the the board starts sort of uh prodding you with questions well what exactly do we need here what type of firewall what you know is that something that you farm out to other parts of the security team or should you also be kind of a little bit of an expert in a lot of different things uh so i i think you you need a good general knowledge of of network security and and web security and cyber security um you again you don't need to be able to to install the network but you need to be able to understand how the the network is is hanging together and the different components and so on um but again it's really not rocket science so i i studied languages i never studied i.t i never studied compliance until i was until i was in in the in the industry and then i got training from various vendors and then i started reading a lot of books i i read a lot of security books i read i spent about an hour a day reading security newsletters um and i don't do it in in one hour it's like i get up in the morning i have a cup of coffee i might spend 10 15 minutes reading on on some stuff and i do this three or four times a day uh in order to keep uh with the program um because things move very very quickly um i don't know if i can provide a very topical example but we've seen with the pandemic uh a rise in ransomware and phishing attacks right so the criminals have understood that the attack surface is much bigger today than it was before the pandemic because everybody's working from home with home devices no training no policy no security and even though companies are catching up on that they um you know the attack surface is so big that uh there's been a rise in in phishing attacks and and also in in ransomware for that for that matter and so um uh the the attacks move on very very quickly and as vaccines are starting to come out uh i would uh i would bet um a few drinks that uh you know we're gonna see in the next few in the next few weeks a lot of uh fishing scams around click here to get the vaccine way quicker first half the price you know and and and that that is one of the other skills that i suppose not i don't know if it's a skill but it's suddenly a requirement that you need you need to keep with the program because it moves very very quickly the attacks move very quickly uh i just wanted to jump with without jumping the next question you said you you do you read a lot of books and you you keep up with things can you give us a short reading list of books that have come out recently that you i obviously five you know the cyber elephant in the boardroom is a top one but can you give me some other examples of books that you think are especially uh interesting right now to people in this area that they should check out or websites that you really like yeah so there's a book that is actually just out now uh or literally just about to come out from ira winkler that you might know and the book is called you can stop stupid uh and the idea is that subtitles um you know it's not a case that you you can't stop stupid people it's the case that perhaps there are no stupid people it's just the case that they need to be educated so that i would highly recommend that book but in terms of in terms of um of publications that i read on a regular basis and the usual suspects you know the the cso online the sc magazines and so on but um i i tend to read a lot of the reports from the parliament institute i find them very good i i read a lot of reports from the uh ecits and sisit uh who specialize in critical infrastructure protection and protection of airports and that kind of stuff um i i also spend a good bit of time well a good bit of time a reasonable amount of time every year uh doing guest lectures in in in universities and that allows me to talk to research students and find out what we're doing right now it's all about ai and ml two years ago it was all about blockchain that was going to solve the world yeah still hasn't happened but it might who knows but but you have to keep with the program that way yeah uh so as we wrap up today um what what tips or advice would you have for c-suites or the security teams working with them who might feel uh overwhelmed by all these difficult decisions they need to make you know so where where do you start if you if you really are just afraid to even sort of dip your toe in the water i i think using a very simple framework like the the five pillars of security just one slide saying hey guys you know we need to comply with 35 different regulations we've mapped them out to those five pillars it's a well-known methodology it's very easy to understand very easy to use and it's going to help us drive the strategy and translate our requirements from an operational perspective into your strategic requirements that's that's uh easy to do of course we can buy the book and read the book but not everybody has time to read the full book um i i would certainly uh get them to uh watch uh podcasts and like this podcast and and and try and understand the key messages yeah because at the at the end of the day um it really is not rocket science i know i'm repeating myself but the the the good news is that everybody can understand it everybody can very quickly see where they are are they going the right direction security and compliance wise are they lagging behind and nobody wants to like behind um and so um i i would that i would start that way and then i would make sure that i get a seat at the table on a regular basis ideally every month but if not every month every quarter once a year is
