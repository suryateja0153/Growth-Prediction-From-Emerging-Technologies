 [Music] but what is blockchain it is highly probable that in late 2017 you heard about Bitcoin reaching the peak of around $20,000 you probably started reading about cryptocurrencies everywhere without really understanding where everything came from and how it worked well Bitcoin just like any other cryptocurrency is based on a new technology called the blockchain but concretely how does it work the blockchain is 12 a chain of blocks and in each of these blocks is four data let's take an example imagine two people Scott and Jennifer who are willing to trade together Scott wants to give Jennifer 50 dollars in our current way of doing things Scott would enter his credit card information online to send a signal to his bank that he is willing to complete the transaction the bank would then accept the transaction and send money to Jennifer in this scenario Scott isn't the one sending money he only asks his dang if he can complete the transaction and if his bank says yes then he knows that the deal will happen but what if the bank said no what if one day you realize that you are not the master of your phones anymore this concerns what has been driving the cyberpunk movement in the 90s to start developing a monetary system without intermediaries and that is how blockchain appeared back to our example let's conduct the same $50 transaction but on a blockchain instead of being validated by a single intermediary the contract will now be verified by a network of computers and servers Scott sends $50 to Jennifer each computer on the network will verify that the transfer happened the way it is set to in a blockchain everyone has a copy of the ledger which contains every previous transaction everyone can therefore verify that Scott has $50 which can be sent to Jennifer in order to validate this transaction the devices on the blockchain network must solve very complex cryptographic puzzles this creates barriers regarding who can inscribe new information on the blockchain when the puzzle is solved it will allow the creation of a block that has an identification number called a hash which is a name like Patrick Gates or Jake in our example the block will only contain one transaction puddle in reality it can hold much more once everyone accepts this action a new block is created with the updated information of the current situation like time date the amount and digital signatures in order to add this new block the chain and make it an alterable we also inscribed its name in it and the name of the previous block of the chain this ensures security and Trust and the data to sum it up the blockchain is a system that removes intermediaries and allows people to exchange phones and goods directly in a very secure and trustful environment the data written inside the blocks acts as a digital ledger allowing everyone to see what happened when and to have full confidence in the fact that these information are correct if you want to learn more about the blockchain and how it works we've written a more detailed article in our blog that will take you even deeper into the subject what we've seen today was just a glimpse of it so don't forget to subscribe and follow us on Twitter if you want to be notified when we release the video take care crypto lovers [Music] you [Applause]
