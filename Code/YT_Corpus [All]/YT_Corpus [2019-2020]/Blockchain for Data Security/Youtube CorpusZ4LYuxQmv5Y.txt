 welcome to today's presentation where we'll discuss records rewards and risks of using this technology I'm very happy to have Dhara Perry dr. Horace Pat Frank's and Amitabh here today to talk to us about blockchain and records management I hope the takeaway today for all of you is to get not only an introduction to this but also go into that 201a level even 301 level of the blockchain technology but also be left with a lot of resources that are out so we've got dar Hoffman she's an incoming assistant professor and just recently completed her PhD congratulations she is a professor for the School of Information San Jose State University also with us is I'm sorry Dara you you reside in British Columbia correct yes okay south of Vancouver excellent also we have Perry J Swift she's in the university records manager at The Ohio State University even though I come from the state of Michigan I'm happy to have her here and I'm an order Dame fan so it really doesn't bother me guard see the Michigan State Ohio State rivalry although it seems like Ohio State is definitely at least in the sport of football American football they've had us had our number dr. Pat Frank's professor and Mara program coordinator school of information at San Jose State University she's also an author of records information management her second edition book was recently released there is a review on IG guru for those who are interested in picking up a copy of her book and who is very she's very much responsible putting a lot of this content together and will later reference the the white paper and I'm your table she boss she bounced off yep you have operations and governor and I know I skipped our pairing referenced Ohio you live in Ohio I mean cob you live in Toronto if I'm not mistaken correct I know I live in in Ottawa Canada so I'm a little bit more east of Toronto kind of midway between Toronto and Montreal I don't know that's right sorry my my American is show there I apologize that's okay no problem I apologize so blockchain technology industry use cases rim challenges and the unknowns risk auditing considerations are going to be covered today I'm listed as the moderator but I'm not really going to moderate anything each of the presenters has a has a presentation they're going to give that's a short presentation on these sections and if I'm not mistaken we are going to be taking questions at the end so if you could please hold your questions till then or type your questions in the chat box and then we'll answer them at the end and we'll have that specific speaker or presenter and or others chime in so without further ado we can go ahead and advance the slide and have dr. Dhara start good take it away and so this is a 25,000 feet view there are people who write lengthy papers full of math equations and pseudocode about every tiny technical aspect of different types of block james that's not me I am your you know plastic liberal arts fluffy type and so we'll be talking I'll talk about it from a very high level what this is and how it works so this is the inter chorus which is an archival research group definition the ISO is working on their standards for flock chain and that will probably become the accepted definition but it's not out yet but blockchain is basically a trusted and mutable ledger of transactions that is centralized and distribute so I'm gonna kind of talk about each of those aspects in turn so let's start with Ledger's I think most of us who are archivists records managers we're all familiar with Ledger's even people who aren't necessarily in the archival field still have a vague sense ledger is just basically a collection of related transactions and that related transactions part is important because once you start throwing the whole kitchen sink into a ledger you lose that sense of connection you lose a sense of relatedness and it becomes a lot harder to make the ledger serve its purpose which is one of the problems or blockchains that try to do too much is that you lose the ability to form the connections between the record and to maintain what archivists would call the archival bond so we've got a ledger so how is this different from any other ledger this picture you'll see almost anyone who talks about blockchain presents but it's not a blockchain picture it actually comes from a rant study back in the nineteen sixties or 50s about nuclear war and what the picture represents is how we can make communication systems more robust in the event of a nuclear attack and so you see the first picture here on the left that is a centralized system all you need is one nuke to take everybody to have it that way then you have a decentralized system where there are more more than one controlling nodes but you still only need to take seven now whereas when you have a deep distributed network like you have on the right the idea is that all that redundancy having all these different nodes in communication with one another leads to a lot of robustness and it makes it a lot harder to destroy the system just by destroying one two or even seven nodes and so you see the same idea at play behind the distributed network in the blockchain because by having lots of nodes in contact with one another you have you can't just take down the whole system by taking down one dough and so for example you see people who advocate the use of block chains to prevent censorship this is part of the reason even if repressive regime a takes down all the nodes in there country the resistance can still be communicated using notes outside the country for example and so this distributed network is a really important part of how block chains are built now that an big buzzword in the blockchain world is immutability mutability is the idea that once something goes onto the blockchain it can't be changed and the reason the block chains are supposed to be immutable is because the way that they work is basically I have a transaction I'm going to buy something from dr. Patz and so before that transaction gets written on the ledger someone let's say andrew is going to check to make sure that pat has the twenty bucks and I have I have the twenty bucks that I'm offering Pat and Pat has the shirt in her inventory the transaction then gets verified it gets written onto the onto a block and then you get a block of ten transactions and so each of those transactions has a fingerprint taken and every single fingerprint and the fingerprint is actually an alphanumeric code that's done through an algorithm but you have a block with ten fingerprints the very first fingerprint of the next block is going to be all ten of those hashed together into a handprint the hash is the name for the fingerprints and so if I change something in block one if I change the fingerprint for mine and Pat's transaction then the fingerprint in block two is going to be wrong as well and so that's the idea behind blockchain immutability is that each block is changed together with that previous hash with those previous fingerprints now then block chains are theoretically immutable to certain attacks like a 51% attack for the Bitcoin blockchain if I control 51% of those nodes that I showed you in the distributed chain then I can change all of the transactions that I want and no one can check me in the wiki CACI so I prefer to say that the blockchain is highly tamper resistant as opposed to immutable that said it's a highly evolving space there are lots of different types of blockchains and their technology the technology is advancing rapidly but as it stands right now I would say most block chains are tamper resistant and tamper resistance is both a strength and a weakness because of course if you make an error it can be very challenging to correct the record if the record is on chain you basically have to create a new record so it's an interesting space for us as as researchers especially as archivists now the disintermediation this is what the really interesting thing about the block chains and this is specifically in what you would call a public permissionless block chain is where this is the strongest and that means it's a block chain that anyone can use and that no one has special permissions different rights on there are other types of block chains where you do have for example have people with certain rights like voting rights or where the blockchain is only accessible to certain people we see those for example in medical research or in certain financial areas where we want higher degrees of protection but the idea of disintermediation is that instead of asking a lawyer or a banker or some trusted party some trusted entity to take kick to intervene in transactions the blockchain itself does it so in the Bitcoin blockchain you have a consent mechanism whereby people can mine and whoever solves the cryptographic puzzle first gets to check mine in Pat's transaction see if it's good and it all happens without direct human intervention that's the idea behind this intermediation but of course it's intermediation again you see this Janus like coin throughout clock tech technology because if there's no intermediary then who's responsible if things go wrong the blockchain is this interesting thing especially the public permission of the slot chains that seems to be owned by everyone and no one which comes to makes it a very fascinating space for from a legal perspective which is by bypass life before I came in target and so where does liability fall when something gets messed up who's responsible for example if a court finds that there is personally identifiable information and/or incorrect information on a blockchain that needs to be redacted in some way who's responsible for making that happen if you don't have any particular intermediary to point to someone who is legally responsible it's a really challenging question to deal with and we see this I'm sure I think parties gonna talk about this later but with the new general data protection regulation out of Europe that the huge privacy regulation that came out two years ago there's a lot of big questions about how to manage block chains in the existing legal frameworks so this is basically a nice picture from NIST about how it actually works so the hash there is the fingerprint I was talking about the algorithm runs over the transaction if you change a bit you change the hash it's 256 alphanumeric characters a timestamp is exactly when it happened a nonce is a little bit of nonsense and then of course the hash the block data and you see that each of these blocks is chained together with the hashes from the previous blocks and hence the clever name of blockchain so really one of the big things the blockchain is meant to deal with is this question of trust the idea behind the blockchain and Satoshi Satoshi's white paper which were it's only in 2009 which might seem very long ago to some of you but it's quite recent for in terms of technology the idea was to create a cryptocurrency that could be used between parties who don't know each other don't trust each other without third party intervention and so it's really a big question of trust we can't trust people so we're going to trust the technology because you know there's this idea that technology doesn't lie technology is a bias technology doesn't have interests and so you see this idea too even in in the archival field you know we have the site neutral third parties trustworthiness blah blah blah and so the idea becomes that people can't be neutral but maybe a machine or mathematics kid so does that mean all of our trust problems are solved nope not so much what it comes down to and you're seeing this a lot for example in the research about accountable ai's for example if you bring another technology in is that we have a lot of problems and Trust and with bias and with neutrality that still haven't been dealt with even with the blockchain that's it it's a fascinating technology with lots of possibilities and I will now turn it over to my colleagues to explain them to discuss thank you this slide real quick is uh it's a ontology of Records trustworthiness to dr. Victoria Lemieux who heads a blockchain at the University of British Columbia based on an ontology of trustworthiness and in torus came up with because when we talk about trusting records we talk about three things accuracy reliability and authenticity and while blockchain is fantastic and ensuring the integrity of the records for example if you're hashing records that happen off the chain there's nothing that a blockchain can do to make those records reliable they were either reliable or not before they got hash to the chain and so it's just an example of all the work that still needs to be done in the space with this technology to meet our needs for reliability and trustworthiness and that's all I got to say about that all right industry use cases and we're on slide number one for you go ahead ok so the first challenge I think in deciding if a blockchain is the right solution for you is to take a look at some of the use cases and we see a number of use cases that are here including credit history elections health care and so on so this matrix you may have seen quite a bit and it explains the questions that you have to ask yourself and then answer if you're an organization to decide if you think the blockchain is the right solution on the left-hand side and I won't spend a lot of time on this but there are three questions that are important do you need a shared database for multiple users do you need it to be immutable time-stamped and keep a log of all entries and do you have trust issues among the users if all of those answers or any of them are no you might want to think about perhaps finding a way to use a traditional database but if those answers are yes and you want to move on to the right-hand side of that matrix where you ask yourself well any of the data stored need to be modified or deleted in the future you heard darah talk about the gdpr and the fact that some information may have to be deleted will personal and/or sensitive data be stored that you want to be sure is not revealed will big data be stored if any of those answers are yes you might want to consider other solutions but it doesn't mean the blockchain is not right it may mean that you would store a hash of the data on the chain and then you would store the data itself off the chain if the answers are no then it's pretty evident that the blockchain may be right for you so I want you to keep this in mind it's a quadrant and I'm taking a look at two different issues here one is the public and private modality who can write or creates on the blockchain all right is it just certain people who've permission if so then it would be private but if it's anybody out in the public then of course it's going to be public but what about reading and consuming is that different it may very well be it may be that only certain people can read the information that's on the blockchain or everybody can I want you to think about this acronym that databases can be used to describe a database it's crud have you heard that see are you d it means create and read and modify update by updating or deleting so you have your CR UD create read update and delete that's a database but a blockchain can't do all of that a blockchain can only do the create and the reach that's all you're thinking about here so that's the difference between the two different types of technologies keep this in mind maybe draw yourself a little rectangle with four blocks and I'm going to go quickly over for different use cases and then I'm going to see if you could put them in the right quadrants there so the first use case is e-voting and I thought this would be interesting because we're all concerned about voting right now with the presidential elections coming up and West Virginia back in 2018 tried blocking voting in their midterm elections they used vote as which is a mobile voting system platform and they thought it was successful asked in an independent group that took a look at the results however recently there was another study that said maybe this can be violated in some way not necessarily the blockchain layer but other aspects of it so they're not sure that they're going to be using that for the presidential election but what the idea was there is that it would be really good for our military personnel stationed overseas they would be able to use their mobile devices in order to register and in order to vote Denver used it for their municipal election as well and they thought it was quite successful as did an independent study showed that it was very useful for them that was the second pilot using the same system vote s now what about blockchain for the presidential election then well I like this a little bit of a headline here this Trump know that blockchain is nominating him what they really mean is that two states Utah nara's use blockchain to select the delegates who are going to go to the convention in August and nominate president Donald Trump for his reelection bid so the third is gambling and I don't know if you enjoy going to concede knows my husband does so I I frequent casinos and the idea there is that everybody if they're a mate should be able to gamble to visit a casino but there's always a question about the house payoff you know is that really legit what's happening behind the scenes and the same thing goes with our quick draw or whatever the states may be doing for a lotteries we want to know what's the percentage payout well blockchain can be used for gambling and you see here that it even can be integrated with virtual reality so you have the whole feel of going into a casino to do your gambling and we see a couple of examples of blockchain technology use for gambling or gaming right here on this slide so that's a third example and then our fourth well actually I guess our third supply chain in the wake of the romain do you remember the co co e coli scare where leafy green romaine lettuce was the cause of e.coli and they were trying to trace this back to the source you know what happened along the way that would cause this problem and where did this let us come from it's very difficult to figure that out when you have to trace back the supply chain so Walmart decided that they were going to experiment with blockchain technology in order to follow the chain of supply for their leafy green vegetables and they did a two-year pilot and as part of it they try to trace back the source of sliced mangoes of all the kinks and it took seven days for Walmart employees to locate the farm in Mexico that grew the fruit so seven days after first thought that they should trace this back however using IBM's blockchain they were able to trace this back in a matter of seconds big difference so now you would be able to know exactly which greens were contaminated where they came from and if customers knew this they would be able to check to to see if they were in danger or if they had to discard what they had purchased so the last one is law enforcement so blockchain used this blockchain can be used for law enforcement but for a lot of different reasons I'm just showing one here but it could be used to spot crypto crime to standardize distributed crime reports to secure interoperable interagency data sharing of the illustration that is used here is that blockchain can be used for keeping track of evidence so a tamper proof chain of evidence for law enforcement and in this case we're using one of us say a different type of blockchain solution in order to provide this service so ok we get back to this little quadrants again and we can think about the four different examples that I gave you so let's think about that very first one and see if you were correct in voting we want everyone to vote right but really does everybody see that vote I don't think so even as far as the documents that were used if you were using paper in order to vote or the OCR stands or whatever maybe we have election officials that are privy to that information and just give us the results so where would our voting come into play on this quadrant all right so it would be public for writing but it would be closed for reading ok the next example that we had was the gambling so I mentioned everybody should be able to gamble if they're of age and if they would like to do that but at the same time everybody would like to make sure that they could see the payoff staff said they know that the system is transparent so what does this mean as far as creating and reading the information gambling all right so in this case writing is public we can all take part in this if we'd like and then reading is also open so that we can see the type of statistics the payout that is happening with the gambling that's going on all right the next example was the supply chain with those leafy green vegetables going from seed all the way to your table in this case only those that are involved in the supply chain should really be writing to it so the distributor's the growers whoever that may be but all of us would like to know where the heck that came from if there is a scare we want to be able to find a way to trace back what we have purchased and the grocer's would like to do the same so that they can see if this is part of that contaminated batch or not so there you go your supply chain is private as far as writing but it's open as far as reading and that leaves us with the last quadrant which is going to be our law enforcement when I think law enforcement I think secret right we wanted write and make sure our records are secured not everybody can see them and at the same time we want to only have certain permission to people read the information that's there so I'm wondering how you all did if you were able to figure that out and I want to thank you for your attention and now I'd like to turn this over to Perry Swift of the university records manager at Ohio State and Perry go ahead thanks Pat well one of the questions that I saw come in was how each of us got involved in blockchain and I got involved in blockchain because as a Records Manager I feel like I needed to know enough about it in order to be able to have the conversations and be involved in the conversation with the IT teams and other teams involved in it and I think that I soon realized that I didn't understand it at all and what I thought I understood was wrong so that's how I got involved so that I made sure that I knew enough about it to have those conversations that I was able to clear up what I was misunderstanding about blockchain and that is why I have the records and information management challenges and unknowns because currently while we're starting to understand blockchain we don't know much about how records management is going to work with blockchain nor do we have a lot of case law on how blockchain is going to stand up to legal standards and challenges so represent information management teams are often not consulted when it comes to IT projects not just blockchain projects all IT projects so it may be that we're not even going to be aware when our organization is considering blockchain however system design can really impact the records management functions within blockchain whether its private whether it's public understanding where documents related to the transactions on blockchain are stored is very important especially if they're not on the blockchain if they're somewhere else so records management should not just be a part of the project team working on just the system design but it should also be represented in change management change management is also one of those functions that's often led by IT when in fact it's the records professionals that have a deep understanding of how people's records creation and record-keeping practices are going to be impacted by whatever the new system is if you can go ahead and click so not only loops we go back I'm sorry I have animations in mine so blockchain projects are often pretty excited without consulting records manager on whether the records or the data or the transactions are an appropriate use or whether blockchain is an appropriate use for those things oftentimes the project and the solution go hand in hand somebody is going to come and say we want to do this project using this solution and minds are made up before that analysis even takes place and then unfortunately sometimes records management is seen as throwing up roadblocks to these projects we're slowing it down but really what we want to do is make sure that that it's going to work not just for the business units present functions but that we're going to be able to comply with records and information management laws so one thing in particular we want to make sure as we've already mentioned that personally identify lit a file information is not held within the blockchain so while the basic definition of a record is the same across the board whether it's in Arma or essays dictionary or other standards or even state and federal law the components that make up what a record is can vary across jurisdictions and so that's something that we have to deal with we have to figure out you know in our jurisdiction is metadata considered a part of the record or a separate record in and of itself do multiple documents or pieces and parts make up a single record or is each one of those a different record and again this is all going to depend on the definition of record in your jurisdiction and can those different portions have different records management requirements I have spent my entire 20-year career in government at all levels so accessibility is something that's incredibly important to me whether it's FOIA or public records requests or even ediscovery and just discovery so in the case of blockchain are those pieces and parts are they stored in other places and how does that implement disposition how does it affect how we get access to those records you know we have to take into consideration is there an encryption key that certain people need to have whether it's the attorneys in your litigation division or anybody who's responding to public records requests are we going to have that encryption key are we always going to have it and then there's the lack of classification which in with with in blockchain are we going to easily be able to locate and provide access to the information that's being requested and again this goes back to how our specific state or federal laws when it comes to access worded each of those could be different and then do we have the ability to redact if we need to redact in a situation like that is blockchain going to give us that ability so one of the challenges in records management and blockchain is retention and defensible disposition we want you know we always learn in records management we want to make sure that we get rid of records per retention schedules and sometimes we there's a liability if we don't it can be a liability to our organization or it could be going against certain laws or regulations you know one of the things that I've already come up is gdpr and the right to be forgotten people have a right to say I don't want that information out there about me are we going to be able to go in to blockchain and delete that information privacy laws now often require a minimal retention we used to say or a maximum retention I'm sorry that's that's incorrect on my slide we used to say retentions a minimum you have to keep it at least this long but now privacy laws are saying you really shouldn't have it any longer than you need it for the original purpose for which you collected that information or created that record and we haven't been able to determine yet with law chain are we going to be able to get rid of that when we need to and then there's the whole issue of archival survivability one of those issues is just doing appraisal blockchain presents a completely different scenario for doing appraised anarchists are used to archivists are used to having having a group of Records and having a context behind it and a classification scheme and creating that in order to make it available to researchers in now with blockchain were unable to separate records out without invalidating the rest of the chain and then we lose that integrity that is such a big important thing when it comes to blockchain the other issue with archival survivability is simply the long-term survivability of Records on a blockchain if they do need to be kept permanently if they really are historical in nature or provide that long-term legal value are we going to be able to access these into the future and for how long we're going to need to have access to that encryption key and not lose it I mean we've heard stories on cryptocurrency where people have lost their key and they've lost their money basically we haven't looked into a transfer protocol that I'm aware of really how are we going to get records from the blockchain to the archives are we going to send a node to the archives and we're going to send all the notes to the archives we're going to try to get it out of blockchain which often at this point there are a lot of proprietary block chains as with any other type of electronic record and then you know we've talked about watching is is decentralized is that a positive or negative when it comes to getting these records to the archives and making them available and finally of course there's the cost when we are talking about a chain that keeps growing that's never deleted that is using multiple nodes from all over the place that comes at a huge cost as far as preservation as far as the power to keep it up and running and I think that there are more and more studies being done on that aspect of blockchain now I will say because sometimes it does sound like I might be squarely in the con side of blockchain that is the more I do study it the more there is some good that can come out of it I was on a presentation recently and they were talking about Identity Management particularly we we were talking about Identity Management with say student records you know I have a daughter that's going off to college she needs her high school transcripts in order to prove that she's taken certain classes to get into college and one of the things that I realized is that when it comes to archival preservation if we can use blockchain for identity management she doesn't necessarily need to have that copy of the transcript to send a copy of the actual transcript to a whole bunch of different places that preserves the original and it means that there's less copies of that information about my daughter out there because all they really need to do is use that blockchain and those transactions to prove that she did in fact earn this particular degree in these areas there are some legal challenges that come with us as well record-keeping laws are not keeping up with evolving technology that's not just a blockchain issue that's just an issue in general and so we are trying to take modern technologies such as blockchain and squeeze it into laws that were written a couple decades ago and maybe only tweaked here and there and it doesn't fit how we do business anymore as I mentioned defining the record in defining the pieces in the parts of a record is is a challenge that hasn't hasn't been dealt with yet and then what's considered destruction does it have to be a complete destruction or can we simply destroy the encryption keys so that the record is unreadable this is another thing that hasn't been tested in courts yet another consideration is are the nodes in different jurisdictions and could that present challenges to legal retention requirements especially if the requirements are different in those different jurisdictions and who takes ownership when it comes to litigation records could be retained that hold an organization liable and litigation is not regularly deleting on blockchain because it's not that easy to do we have to understand that some of that information could be harmful to us so that's a consideration to take into account when you're thinking about what to put on blockchain is if we can't get rid of this is going to come back and hurt us in any way and then as I mentioned there are increased costs but there are also increased costs and resources for discovery and then finally privacy law limits the distribution of information so here we're talking about a system where the same information is repeated on nodes across the country possibly across the world and yet that seems to be in conflict with these privacy laws that want to limit the distribution of information so there are some questions that as a Records Manager you can pose in this process I first question simple question what's their attention period and then following up with are there potential liabilities if we don't destroy it for retention usually we're coming up with a retention period because we should be getting rid of information when that expires and then another question is are there multiple reference record series represented in a single blockchain next is there a benefit to recording a transaction or is that transaction part of another record or is it a standalone record so is it just the transaction that's a record or are there records stored elsewhere that that transaction reflects I also ask who needs access to the data and are these persons going to change throughout the lifecycle of the record what tools are they going to need and how are we going to pass those tools on from person to person so what are the pros and cons of using blockchain for a particular project are there existing solutions that are already sufficient maybe we go back to one of Pat's first slides in thinking about that and she had that nice little flow chart there finally what are the costs and - the benefits of using blockchain justify the costs of it a couple more questions are there privacy and security concerns people talk about the Chane being wonderful for security but at the same time that is great for securing the information is it in conflict with some privacy laws and finally what our organization has control over where the nodes are located and that comes down to what are the laws in your jurisdiction or in the jurisdiction where these nodes could potentially be located so those are just a few of the questions and I think that the more we start to use blockchain and learn and understand it you know we're going to come up with some more questions and we're going to be able to refine this list of questions so I thank you very much for that and I'm gonna turn it over to Bob Circosta great hi thank you Carrie yes I so my name is I'm speaking a little bit about the risks that a new technology presents and of course new technology and its benefits and versus versus the the the risks so obviously you've seen some of the benefits and certainly it's a lot of new ways of doing things using blockchain technology so some of the risks that I'll be speaking about are actually discussing a bit more in detail the white paper that PAP was referring to which is understand block change roles and risks in Custis systems so we're all familiar with the technology s-curve and obviously the new technology try to solve problem out there but obviously as with any new new technology you know there's some hype around it and of course there's going to be improvements as the technology moves from the left hand side to the right hand side and so therefore any new technology requires a cost-benefit analysis so as the technology moves through its improvement phases you know it'll have its early adopters you go through your first generation of technology second and so and so forth so during the improvement there's obviously a lot of hype you know they're trying to sell solutions to problems that might not exist out there and or they try and look for problems that may not exist so it's important to really cut through the hype and understand the risks versus the benefits and determine if in fact there is a problem that needs to be solved so reports that we that we took is we to look at the risks from four different levels for so for risk assessment levels really moving from a high level which is the you know the kind of strategist should I use the blockchain then you get into your level two it's a little bit more detail which is around design then of course the implementation and then more detail is really the the operational risks and so here you see the D for risks are laid out in a kind of quarter circle to see the little circle going from strategic called it to operational but one thing to look at really is the design because the designers will really help define the scope of the potential solution assuming you've decided to use the bulk chain solution so that's really important and going back to some other speakers spoke about it's important to understand indications of information risk management and the strategy for that risk management as you consider the design solution so the next one which is the design risk we identified seven key risks from governance all the way down to the two to project planning and I'll certainly get into these a little bit more but what's important to understand is that there are a lot of questions that both effects you know the technology that also affect the the use of the technology more from processes and of course in how you're going to actually move forward in terms of implementing a project so let's look at the some of these design risks in a little bit more detail with respect to implementation risks so what you have here are the seven risks so we're at level two so obviously at level one was the block chain solution so that's the strategist whether or not to actually move forward then you catch a design risk and we see the designers have a number of implementation risks underneath so what we have here is really a risk breakdown structure or RBS or short so if people are project management you will be kind of familiar with this and so what this lays out is a hardware structure of the risks in terms of how they can either proclaim up words or you can look at this from high-level and move downwards to a little bit more detail so of course you know this refers back to the force for risk levels that we talked about a couple slides back so you know for example governance which is rerun is selecting the the blockchain solution provides oversight and compliance of course records management you can do some of the operational structures and how to manage monitor the blockchain solution you have looked at the organization's reputation if the solution fails or other things happen they of course is a technical architecture and the different options there and we've talked a bit about that as well you do get into areas around legislation and regulation personal formation we've talked about that data residency which just kind of mentioned a little bit earlier you also are looking to the IT operations running from advance we've talked about - I know you defend the chain cryptography so number of areas from an IT perspective then of course you get into the project planning so many of your regular project management activities you know you piss objectives your business case and we all know many times that these are not done properly sometimes in the brush together so she moved out so it pushed out so certainly that requires a partial match oversight so let me walk through two examples and then we can look at some of the level four operational risks so let's name you look at the governance so that of course had for implementation risks so here are some of the questions that what should be considered you know such as do you have the electronic records for your mission critical dish assets you know do you have a large volume of initial content so these are the questions one should ask tip could could potentially be more questions but this is a way to kind of get started for example the last bullet point and the records management say we said do you need to validate information from off of change sources before hashing the information to the blockchain so we've talked about some of these if the compliance questions give access if safer that's the last bullet you need to establish provenance of the off chain information before hashing the information to the blockchain so you have some of those examples if you look at for example business impact analysis which is the fourth column do you understand the specific recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives farm from from the back perspective so anybody that does backups you understand that big thing which gets missed many times is do you have buy-in from the board and senior management level committees for the after business impact analysis report many times it's done it's you spend a lot of money and this sits on a shelf someplace so so those were some of the risks but so what we have here is kind of a risk assessment matrix so obviously you've got your for implementation risks for governance so you know you an assign a priority to those risks you know probably sign somebody on the team to manage those risks but certain audit activities such as objectives audit or controls education and the frequency so these are fairly common audit activities this is not meant to be an audit framework by by no stretch of the imagination but certainly you know these are things that should be considered when you're looking at it for audit perspective let's maybe take one more example so what you see here are the operational risk for the blockchain architecture and some of these have been covered so again do you want to use permission permission lists you know so for example as last bullet does the permission is blocked institution have passed to scale up as transaction volumes increase you know then again you look at on-premise vs. cloud based you're looking at blocks you know the service versus a proprietary blockchain consensus protocol is very critical so if you look at the second bullet do you want to do a proof-of-work or delegate proof of state consensus algorithm and of course that's important because one may not be able to handle high volumes as well as as the other mining architecture again they're questions to consider in terms of the ability to perhaps handle increasing volumes so these are just some examples of questions that should be asked from in input five sly from operational perspective meaning the level four risks so again the same type of questions should be asked so in this case we had five implementation risk areas and so again the rest parity who's gonna measure risk and again the types of audit activity that that one should carry out so the purpose of this matrix is again to be able to map each of the implementation risks back up to the soil operation rest's back up to the implementation back to the design and be able to be able to then obviously determine where the or ization needs to focus its attention and its energy so in conclusion I think blockchain DLT does represent a lot of trees but as with any technology I think there are risks and really I think it's I mean the technology to do sometimes fail but not because the technology itself but I think because of not understanding that the technology's risks and its benefits so therefore the initial hype has to be tempered with a proper risk benefits assessment before committing the organization to this direction and that's it for me thank you so much for listening I hey my contact details and I'll turn it over to Andrew all right thank you very much at this time we do have moments for questions here and there is a question here posed by Andrew looks like andrew creme Tomsky P I could be held on chain without contradicting privacy laws he's wondering how is that possible question is located in the chat window I'll jump in I agree with Natasha and and Natasha if I recall correctly you're a lawyer in Russia right and so you're right if there is specific law supporting the use of a blockchain that meets XYZ considerations for holding PII then of course it can be legally done to the best of my knowledge we don't have all that necessarily supports that or at least that deals with the conflict between privacy law and for example we do have evidence law in Arizona about blockchain but as far as I know we don't have any laws that specifically provide that for that in north or in Canada and the United States at this point but if someone knows otherwise I'd be more than happy to hear that excellent thank you Dhara anyone else want to jump in or do we have any other further questions you're welcome all right dr. Franks you want to put in some closing remarks here I'd like to thank everyone for attending today I really appreciate it we had quite a a large group also make sure that you visit the 3d PDF consortium link I AMA table had mentioned the white paper that was published in January and you will see much more information about the risks and the audits that amitabh just pulled some sections out of that white paper to illustrate today but there's much more information there as well there is no question that chat window from John well that's quite interesting I had not thought about that seasonality issues federal holidays are infrastructures at risk I imagine that would be the same as with any other technology that we're trying to protect from adverse influence or partners there but does anybody have a comment on that are you work in government what do you think I mean I think that it depends on the type of blockchain that is being used if if it is a public blockchain I think that there could be more of a risk involved in it if it's a private blockchains within the government there might not be any more risk than any of the other systems that we have yeah I'd agree with that I mean mostly these systems are designed to be run you know 24 by 7 I'm obviously their regular main test windows so depending on the type of box chain architecture one chooses those things should be part of the architectural design so so you know holidays don't really affect the availability of that of that type or chain technology any other questions are just comments things that you've been think about that we haven't touched on okay then I lots of miners could be using the same cloud cloud goes down blockchain is in peril yes okay I want to thank everyone it's past our time here I appreciate your attending and if you have any questions for any of us you see our email addresses and on the screen there just grab them and get in touch with us thank you everyone you
