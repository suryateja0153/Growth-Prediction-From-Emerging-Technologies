 Early blockchains such as Bitcoin often have fairly low throughput while modern blockchains have been able to achieve orders of magnitude higher throughput However, the core of Bitcoin -- Nakamoto consensus -- still stands out in one key aspect: it’s simple Simplicity always enables more reliable implementations. Perhaps more importantly, the simplicity of Nakamoto consensus has facilitated security proofs and cross validations by multiple independent research groups. Is it possible to retain the simplicity of Nakamoto consensus and at the same time, achieve much better throughput? The answer is Yes! By composing thousands of instances of Nakamoto Consensus, we propose a novel blockchain OHIE. OHIE's throughout is similar to state-of-the-art blockchains, while its simplicity has enabled a modular security proof based on a reduction from Nakamoto Consensus.
