 The traditional way of valuing bitcoin  and blockchain is inaccurate it's not   valuable because it's a hedge against  inflation it's valuable because of its   cost of verification and the cost of networking  let's talk about why blockchains are valuable   blockchains are an interaction system based  on cryptographic proof instead of trust   allowing any two willing parties to transact  directly with each other without the need for   a trusted third party satoshi nakamoto 2008 in  that famous white paper this briefly will discuss   blockchain background we'll talk about the cost of  verification number one and the cost of networking   number two we'll briefly discuss some of the  traditional values of of good money and how   you assign that to bitcoin and other blockchains  and then some quick closing thoughts so   very briefly what is a blockchain? a blockchain  is a chain of validated transactions that are   placed in blocks one after another sequentially  in time and they're cryptographically linked to   each other with hashes with a digital fingerprint  more scarce actually than a digital fingerprint   it's more scarce than any grain  of sand on earth for instance   these digital fingerprints are important  because if you adjust anything in any one   of those blocks it will therefore not be tied  to the other blocks and will be very evident   so blockchains are a distributed ledger of those  recorded transactions placed in those blocks   that are easily verifiable that anybody can see is  very transparent it's tamper resistant so anybody   that wants to adjust the transaction saying that  they didn't really pay Alice have that amount of   money it would be very difficult for them to  do that without more than 51 percent generally   of the network's power without being able to  pull that off and it's decentralized because that   distributed ledger is not only on my computer  it's on your computer it's on thousands of   third-party computers where anybody can verify or  validate those transactions that are out there   so the reason that it is valuable number one is  because of the cost of verification intermediaries   traditionally are necessary because  they reduce the asymmetry with transactions   i have this good that i'm trying to sell to  you but i know more information about that good   than you do so the potential for me to  have moral hazard here involved with the   the lack of incentives to guard against my  willingness to use that because of the lack   of consequences on me and the potential benefit  of gaining money in this transaction or something   require sometimes an intermediary to be  there to create that trust between those   parties and those intermediaries charge a  fee right so they add expense to that   transaction and friction to that  transaction that would have been free and smooth   they also and this is important and a lot of times  underestimated is require a lot of information   that's not really necessary to divulge with what  that transaction is happening so why do i need to   give my address and social security number for  a payment that's going to be $20 at a store for   instance but a lot of times that's actually what's  divulged and we've seen large hacks and other   compromises of those honey pots of information and  then finally because that world that we're living   in is becoming exponentially more digital and  more and more transactions are occurring online   the requirement to smooth those to reduce the  the barrier to these micro payments or just   payments in general to bank a lot of people  that were previously unbanked is becoming   more and more important blockchains reduce the  cost of verification because they prevent that   intermediary from requiring to be there right  and they also prevent that information leakage   that could occur because of that there is no  equifax leak if equifax didn't need to exist   if you look at the the diagram there that  transaction is is processed uh those actions   are performed and then if required somebody one of  the two parties or somebody some third party can   go in and actually verify that that transaction  existed according to those rules and process with   that and that is able to preserve some privacy  as well because then you don't need to give up   your social to any entity for instance so that  cost of verification theoretically is not free   but it is drastically reduced because that that  third party that entity that intermediary is not   required in this case and it is near instantaneous  if you just want to you know type in your hash   into an uh blockchain explorer you can see exactly  what happened in that transaction smart contracts   can be a little bit more complicated if this  happens then these conditions are met transfer   this much money to this person or organization so  these rules of the settlement can be agreed upon   before the actual transaction or event and it can  follow a very deliberate and predescribed process   and where this is difficult this verification  doesn't become free is when an offline event    is required it's very difficult to inject  that at least currently in these networks and   can potentially be costly and a surface for attack  cost of networking number two the reduction in the   verification cost is a prerequisite to get to this  step number two so how we increase our network   from the ground up bootstrapping to the actual  development of that network and keeping it going   where traditionally it would be possible  to raise subsequent funding for instance   scaling users uh security the security is  a huge one bitcoin network has more economic   investment power devoted to it than almost  every network on the face of the earth   and then what can't be underestimated either  here is aligning user behavior so the tragedy   of commons can be subverted or worked through by  some of the mechanism design and incentive schemes   in blockchain that are possible right so i  can incentivize good behavior with a token   or other things power governance that otherwise  that individual's behavior would act rationally   and selfishly against that user incentive scheme  the network power here the power is the   replacing of that traditional platform operator  right that intermediary that bank whomever is   replaced by a system of of code of incentives and  a consensus mechanism in that decentralized system   that's able to come up with conclusions and  consensus where otherwise it would have taken that   intermediary party it reduces that intermediary  parties risk and power obviously because they're   no longer there and then that social security  number that could have been compromised isn't   even there so definitely can't be compromised  not saying there aren't hacks in blockchain   but the blockchain itself isn't hacked it's  usually a central repository another   intermediary that's actually hacked in these cases  and then consensus risk is one thing but it's   very difficult to get enough in a well-established  chain to compromise the consensus mechanisms   here are some value areas so blockchains can  be valuable and maybe should be implemented in   these specific four areas digital  verification is easy easily implemented it's easier for me to see what transactions  occur an efficient allocation of rents can   be transferred from that enemy in immediately to  users and devs or investors in this case so that   intermediaries money that was taking part of that  transaction can then be given to the customers   if i'm running a internet browser and i'm charging  you because i'm making that internet browser   if i remove that and have brave browser  for instance then i'm going to be returning   those rents to the actual users and potentially  paying them for their time for their browsing   and watching ads for instance if you can  define a new type of digital asset or property   blockchains are there man this is a new  ledger that could decentralize theoretically   any digital assets some would be obviously  more difficult than others and the challenge   here is that they're tying offline activities  online and onto the blockchain which can be   difficult sometimes and and then obviously they  have a great ability to increase privacy in some   areas the difficulty or challenge here with some  people is is understanding that the blockchains   themselves are extremely transparent most of the  time so a lot of the data that's actually on the   chain is transparent but your data that you would  have traditionally given to an intermediary is not   there that doesn't exist you haven't given up that  data if if these areas aren't part of this   problem set then probably a blockchain is not  the best use case here blockchains are a lot of   times inefficient databases and again for all of  this we're talking about permissionless networks   this is probably where you've heard these  additional driver values the good money principles   of where blockchains can be valuable specifically  discussed a lot of times in bitcoin   scarcity there's only ever going to be 21  million bitcoin so if you own one of those   bitcoin just like if you own one ounce of gold  you know roughly how much gold is coming out of   the ground well you know exactly how much bitcoin  is being produced every 10 minutes fungibility my   one ounce of gold is exactly the same as your one  ounce of gold fiat currency a dollar is basically   worth the exact same amount as your dollar  my bitcoin is worth the exact same as your   bitcoin that's fungible it's interchangeable the  portability i can memorize theoretically 12 words   in my head and take millions of dollars across  foreign boundaries and jurisdictions   it's very portable divisibility blockchains  can be divided 8 10 16 different decimal places   whereas fiat you know call it two decimal places  uh gold not going to be able to shave that   very thin before you're not able to weigh it on  an actual scale durability very hard to destroy   gold you're gonna melt and it's still gonna be  there paper you can burn it uh you can lose or   destroy your bitcoin keys or other blockchain  keys theoretically security uh arguably the   money investment the economy of power  that's invested in the uh bitcoin blockchain   is arguably the the most in any kind of  network uh especially decentralized in the world   so immutability... we talked about tamper  resistance earlier it's very difficult for you to   go into that blockchain and adjust one transaction  you need a majority of that chain's power to   convince everybody else that your version of  that network is the true version of that network   so blockchains are decentralized immutable ledgers  that transfer trust away from those intermediaries   and the way that blockchains have value is in  the cost of verification and the cost of networking   and those are the two areas that really bring  blockchain into economic value and the ability to   have us invest in them and then what's also  commonly discussed is those economic principles of   sound money of "good money" if you if you like this  definitely hit the thumbs up and subscribe down   below this was very heavily borrowed from some  simple economics of the blockchain from the national   bureau of economic research go check it out at  that link i recommend it it's written in 2016   originally and revised in 2019 but definitely a  good quick read for a non-traditional approach to   how we value blockchain but this was basically a  synopsis of it if you like this content definitely   check out my other videos I do a lot of AI  and blockchain research and presentations I   like doing this for you guys let me know what you  want to see appreciate it this is Jerry... SEEYA!
