 thank you I wanted to welcome you all here and especially those who may be live-streaming viewing us on the livestream to the session two of the digital plus performance convening at the festival of live digital art folda or full-day if you will fold ah if you like better which is what I like and for those of us who are just joining us we are inside the lobby of the Isabel Bader Performing Arts Center which is located on the traditional territories of the Anishinabe and holding the Shoni peoples in what is now known as Kingston Ontario Canada so this session is about is about the use of mixed reality work in live performance and we are talking about that today with some colleagues who are joining us via zoom from the Prague quadrennial and you can see those folks here on our screen today I'm going to and we can hear you do you want to say something you this is the traditional greeting when using zoom which is like can you hear me say that it's not just three of us sitting here we are in the room Mali gathering your people here as well when you properly pass to us I will explain this the the state of art well I'm happy to properly pass it over to you Ian Garrett who is our lead contact here taupe and our collaborator with toaster lab Ian tell us about where you are right now what's going on so we're at the Prague quadrennial which happens every four years in Prague we are within a project called the lights pop house which is a series of conversations around technology used for stage design it started as a lighting primary project that we've been integrating more meaty yet to it lightspawn is contained within 360 or 360 you or 360 q depending on who you ask which is a large project was taken over a hockey arena which maybe we can go wild a little bit later we can show you a little bit of that space it has a number of projects then you design for a sound we are lighting etc me describing it while you're looking at the walls in this room are not necessarily are not gonna do justice as it's a former hockey arena the room that we're in right now is a changing room that has been repurposed for this series of conversations that we have here Leopold conference dedicated to both these conversations of the ones from a North American cluster competes with the Prague quadrennial celebrates this performance design in space every four years there's about 70 participating countries that showcase book professional emerging work in an exhibition and the number of out programs that look at various ways of approaching sonography performance design and there's a huge media component about it that's added this time so yes we also have no AC the AC went out in our building so there's a little bit of families back that's it but that's how Prague works it's 35 degrees I am sorry about the AC um we just wanted to connect it was very we're kind of having I don't know about anyone else in the room but I feel like we're having the opposite problem where I'm feeling actually a little over a seed but we won't dwell on that I want to talk about our objective for this session which is to share experiences discuss challenges and imagine what might be possible when it comes to integrating mixed reality into live performance and so our time today has three sections first we're going to kick off the spirit of conversation that we want to cultivate which is one that embraces experimentation and the inherent risks of experimentation and we're gonna share with you the problem that we are working on and we worked on all of yesterday which was to livestream some 360 videos so that's the first thing we'll talk about then we're going to hear case studies or conversation starters from artists in both cities to hear what they're working on what's exciting about that and last we're going to attempt to have a conversation between our two cities between our room here in Kingston and IANS room in Prague and see if we can get transnational conversation running I don't I just need one more set of hands and I also just want to mention that this like so many of our conversations here at folda is an experiment we haven't done this before and so this is my first time facilitating a conversation over distance between two cities and things might go wrong and speaking of things that might go wrong that takes us right into our sharing our experiences from yesterday and Ian I wonder if you want to describe what we were working on yesterday yes we've been working a lot around the big reality and integrating VR with live performance to try and showcase how that the capabilities of that and some of the opportunities for that one of our goals with this session was to do a bi-directional VR Thika in which we would stream a immersive view of each place into the other place we put effort into making sure we have had a calf and with the appropriate equipment and enough knowledge to know how to do it and then we're extremely important for a number of different reasons which come up every so often so that we're continue to work on that so that hopefully by the end of both events which culminate this weekend that we'll be able to make that sort of link-up or continue to work on that our goal was to be able to show you a 3d view and show you everybody in the room at the same time streaming through VR headset and likewise coming in the directions not to get to text into it because everybody some through as much energy into it as I think that's humanly possible we were here up until the point in which we were getting pushed out of the space last night trying to solve this there are a variety of issues of trying to integrate technology like that trying to get that amount of data well going from place to place connecting to the appropriate stream at some point I think we've determined last night that time between a YouTube policy change and their persnikitty streaming settings that they decided that today they didn't like us in other spaces we've gotten it to work without an issue so we wanted to proceed any way to have this conversation about 360 streaming VR content and how that gets integrated into various ways even though that we didn't have that because that's of the experimental nature of integrating technology into our practice is that oftentimes with the support and we figure it out maybe on our end I could pass the mic over to Sophie Trobe who was troubleshooting attempting to set up the 360 camera to just go into detail about some of the roadblocks that we encountered and before I do and I just want to say that the papers on your laptop are in we can hear them when they move against the microphone or something Sophie thanks Adrian so yeah to go very briefly into the persnickety details of what we were up against yesterday we were working with a Yi 360 camera which has recently released a camera that is set up to livestream and there's a an interface through the camera that you connect to through your phone to make that happen in order to connect to the Wi-Fi here there wasn't an opportunity to use a username password so we couldn't use the university's Wi-Fi connection so we set up our own router and then we're working through an our own Wi-Fi connection and then we're still coming up against roadblocks when we were trying to launch the livestream itself and and Ian proposed that perhaps it's a new policy that YouTube introduced that you need to have a thousand plus subscribers to to livestream from a phone and because the camera is linked through a phone we were up against so we thought that might be the possibility and then I worked with Martin at the end of the day because from the National Arts Center because they have 4,000 subscribers to their YouTube channel to try to launch the live stream through their YouTube channel and we were still up against roadblocks so I have the camera I have two oculus throughout the festival I'm gonna aim at lunch breaks to sort of give it a try again and if anyone has ideas about how to troubleshoot or has experience working with the e camera or doing livestream in 360 I'm happy to I'd love to learn from you and I'm happy to give it a try again and if if Ian's able to get it set up on his end we have the oculus headsets and can look at what's going on in Prague from here so if we're able to make the connection in either direction hopefully we will before the end of the festival and I'll be continuing to work on that maybe it's not the best backup camera it's a good backup camera it's not a good first choice because hopefully you never have to use the backup okay well I think that we're gonna move into our next section of our conversation which is the conversation starters and I'm gonna hand that over to you Ian so we have two people here they're the people that you can see with me we got dr. Andrew Sam I talked about this yesterday I've known accredits am pretty the funny part about it is that Andrew and I have worked together for years now and I and this has come up because whenever I think about how it's spelled wrong and Beth Cates who many I think in the room know we've asked each on both sides to talk a little bit about the work that they're doing so I'm gonna talk fast open it improve to start that over and we'll do we'll pass it back and forth between us okay hi everybody hi Canada so let's see so my name is again is Andrew Humphrey let's see I'm I'm a researcher in digital stenography and technologies for stage performance I work mostly at a school in western Switzerland both non-money vector and then I also am a co-founder of a research lab a private research based lab when we build technologies for geo-located data visualization and that's that sort of thing and then lastly I'm the head of engineering for toaster lab which is an organization I work on quick Ian and in that context we develop technologies further for augmented reality performance so that's me I don't know feel me to go further now yeah would you talk a little bit about what it means to create delicated MacPhail be performance yeah sure um so there's a couple things here there's there's kind of certain to talk about this a little bit earlier but there's a technological component and then there's kind of the social performance opponent I'm super interested in both of these so in the context of my research I'm mostly interested in what does it mean to do this at all like what does it actually mean to have performance that's mediated across different time but also space what does it mean to to type ship storytelling to change the sequences of things and how is the audience different now than it used to be what are the expectations there's a whole bag of questions which I hope we can talk about I'm actually super interested in and then in the context especially if the toaster lab stuff there's a bunch of technical problems that I think we're all familiar with which is how do you actually build systems I do actually create a deal of data PR experience and one of the problems that we've identified is that the expectation of what the audience and people do sit it's generally higher than the tools that are available so it's like I really want to do this thing because I've seen it on my phone I don't really have the expertise and so I kind of settled for half way and so concretely when we're trying to do a toaster lab we have specific projects but kind of the broader picture that I'm interested in on the engineering standpoint is to try to create a set of tools which are more broadly available that will let us raise that foundation so that we can all collectively go from how do I do this thing - was that an interesting one or not so we so we're working on that and we helped against some specific projects that we can talk about but we're trying to really build out an infrastructure so you can accelerate the process so that we can see a whole lot more peace in the world we talked a little bit about one of those around one of the the project that we're working on right now we affect a little bit about where we are in the middle of the project now John Traill on I'm not going to do that we know we actually have the director of this project sitting in the room I'm not going to put her on the spot but I am non-stop variably it's actually a lovely project so the trailer project is for the Philadelphia part right sorry Pennsylvania Pennsylvania very environment fire events of council and it's a project where it was a jury selection of authors who have written stories for specific trails which are in Philadelphia so on one level the idea is that it's essentially an audio tour that you'll go and listen to a tour as you want to but I think that we're all super adjust to be injecting that with a lot more subtle and not-so-subtle interesting changes so it's a lot more than sort of just the podcast the stories themselves free temple are not they're not get too difficult betrayal and narrative I don't want to speak for anything office but they're all very different in in wonderful ways and then the structure is also something that we're working on now but we're trying to work on getting the authors to write and adapt their stories to the structure of the trail s1 my pocket but we have all sorts of interesting questions about different types of mobility and how people are able to reverse the trails what does it mean to be finished for example if you don't feel capable of a Montreal what does it mean to revisit the trail so there's a whole and kind of bag of super fascinating storytelling questions and again that I'm splitting this two ways so then there's also technical problems which is are technical issues that we have to figure out which is okay we've got the story they've gotten some money of the components which are boys but we also have a sound we also have perhaps music we've got some I'll give music we've got cues we've got bhop to build so how do we mix all these pieces together so that gets a little bit sort of what I was talking about earlier about the infrastructure so we're also trying to build out a kind of offering infrastructure because this project itself is distributed I'm based in Switzerland against Canada the project is in Philadelphia the officer promotes build up your region so the trails sorry I'm repeating you even like this so the trails are yeah are in Philadelphia so we have a distributed team as well so it's a lot a lot I'm super excited about it it's definitely a project where we're kind of inventing it literally as we're like oh yeah we need that yeah which is actually get a lot of what I do I generally say it's like a weird it's something like that but I also code so it's like I code development but it's like a little cyclic people were developing the project to try to build the tools thank you yeah who joins us from Kingston our fruit our first speaker here in Kingston is data Jane and I'm gonna ask at it and to introduce herself and tell us about your work you have about ten minutes hi I'm Garrett Jane I work with the University of Waterloo at the games Institute and I'm a research associate and what I do is the reason is just so essentially I started making projects with them making Interactive's and we started talking about virtual reality and that moved in to me basically talking to everybody that I could who works in virtual reality around the world going to festivals and building and networked internationally of creators and industry people and researchers and what we're that's been the first phase that we've done and now what we're moving into now is building collaborations and I have two roles essentially one of them is generally designing collaborations and working with researchers and creatives and industry to figure out what are the intersection points how can we find a way of working that actually genuinely gives you something that you're really interested in that is a problem for you so a lot of that is finding out who's in the network and then assembling in very kind of specific and tailored ways projects might oh okay now we can walk that's nice so basically I do this work of talking to people and finding out what they're interested in and I think personally that sort of underlines all all the work I do I also have a production company where I'm the creative director it's called vault velvet icons and we're a new media production company we work across forms we're developing a web series we're looking at Co producing a VR piece and what brings together all my different work is really being interested in individuals and what they're genuinely interested in I have this kind of deep personal aversion to people doing something that doesn't matter to them and they think that drives everything so what I try to do when I'm developing the research projects is say okay what is actually going to be useful and interesting and that you can explore maybe in a way if you're working with the university that you can't explore when you have a very strict production timeline or a very strict product timeline so what we can do is we can kind of talk about these problems that go a little bit deeper that are a little bit maybe more open-ended or or less directly for one specific project is what we can't do is develop research projects that go really quickly we have us much slower timelines at the university so that means we can open up these problems set up conversations and then develop projects where you're exploring them and kind of more careful and measured ways so the way that I think about designing a project then is I find out who's involved or who should be involved and then I figure out really carefully what did they actually want from this what kind of research output is important and then I try to design the project so it's almost built to the different research outputs different ways of engaging are built into a production timeline and I find that's a important way to work because I have that again it's it's almost a personal aversion to people coming in and saying let's do something but and they agree to it but they're not talking about the same thing so it ends up being not quite what anybody wants that's like my the thing I hate most in the world and so that's one of the ways that I'm working at the games Institute and the other way is my specific interest is coming from a writing and filmmaking background I'm very interested in storytelling so I come to VR and my initial interest in VR is how do you tell stories like how does it become a medium where creators are communicating through it to the audience and so I I really like to work with I am here actually working on the Thousand Island Playhouse residency and working with a playwright to with Nick who's over there to kind of think through okay how do you as a creator want to think in this form I think that one of the opportunities and interesting things in VR is or any I specifically am working in 360 but any new medium is if you're coming from a form where you're familiar with it you've grown up with theatre you've grown up with film then you understand really how say a close-up works at an intuitive level you have that connection you have that understanding you can almost figure out how without even thinking of that step of translating from I want people to feel this way about this character to a close-up you just naturally visualize it and I think there's a few steps when you're working in a new medium to take what it is you're imagining people feeling about this character or in this scene into how do you stage that and thinking about so I like to work very systematically but from that very personal perspective with people and so that goes to working with I've done a few workshops working with playwrights specifically thinking about okay how do we translate the way that you think into 360 space if it's not familiar to you and also doing some some more kind of concentrated we're developing some more concentrated specific Studies on thinking about the grammar of the medium so the way that you have continuity editing in in film and that allows you to create an illusion of continuous space how do you direct attention what are the tools what are the things in sort of thinking about systematizing that and approaches to explaining that that can make it clear and can make it easily more easily accessible to actually work in that form I would say that's thank you thank you so in um that's our first speaker over here over back to you so this this is gonna be one of our technical challenges is that because of the the test with sound before Beth joining us from another instance of the of our chat of our zoom link so I'm going to turn it over to Beth Pete's and we're going to make sure that we don't create some intense feedback in the room take it away back okay this also means that I can busy inside go go rogue and I can at a point later in the conversation take you into the blue hour and show you what's happening in the other part of the hockey arena where it used to be fault apparently my voice doesn't work through other microphones which is weird so I'm betting and I was there with a lot of you last year and now I'm here sweating in Prague I am the lighting set mixed reality and media designer based in Calgary in Toronto and flyed and I I've been doing this for a long time digital technologies and I'm right now in the middle of a master's degree at the University of Calgary where I'm working in drama and computer science and I'm looking at emerging technology so augmented reality or they are virtual reality or VR machine learning natural language processing artificial intelligence of different kinds and what I like to call urban reality or the stuff that we're made of and and looking at the ways that those things intersect with with performance and performance design and performance and I'm also looking at it and some of the perspective as a digital drama Terry which is something that I've been working to define over the last few years and that is it's looking at the digital drama trivy the dramaturgy of the digital the content the method of delivery I think even the dramaturgy of code would be something very interesting to think about and and there and how it fits in then to a maturity of performance and the needs a creator of a major digital strategy fund that it's going to be announced more formally and more publicly with four new play development centers which is then about in a similar way to the previous speaker looking with playwrights particularly with drama church and and looking at the digital and armature G and expanding the vocabulary opening up the vocabulary for people who work in more traditional ways and and how can we share all of them up knowledge that as we earlier called ourselves in our offline conversation communicate we've been connecting from different places people looking at performance and these emerging technologies which is different than the gaming world but bringing all that knowledge from the gaming world and and seeing what it what does it mean what does it mean as the technology changes on a weekly basis I'm talking at least a week here you own your headsets I don't have to switch between project for my creative side could you talk just a little bit about Barry the rent so Barry the rent which is a really interesting lineage and it's a project that I started at the University of Calgary it was a collaboration with the drama department and the evolutionary swarm lab which is the computer science lab that I'm a part of at the University working in their Christian Jacobs our professor and Neil Christensen who's a student in the computer science site and I created this project that's turned into my thesis project but it's continuing to have a life beyond it and it was actually for those of you who are our Ontarians particularly you'll know the Donnelly story and a couple years ago Paul Thompson and Bill Garrett and I created a play about Robert Donnelly and in that story I discovered a woman whose voice had basically been erased from history and I brought this this woman in the one particular fact of her having exude her husband's chased them in a steel casket and yet was completely absent from the history I brought that into the computer science lab and I said look at this and Neil who's who is concerned about ideas of reality and breaking reality and what is reality mean anymore and I work with an actor and using photogrammetry which is the creation of 3d digital objects by photographing carbon real objects using photogrammetry virtual reality augmented reality passed through cameras and live performance created a piece where a one on one performance piece where you've got two and Annie got to finally tell her story directly to you and where we really played with the idea of the overused presents idea so the presence of a human in a virtual world with you in a space that she wasn't present with you in in in the virtual space she was president with you in the carbon space we can't see her and and and the ways that that gave us access to empathy and emotion and and an intimacy that we were playing with and different ways of experiencing object to through both the virtual object and real objects and playing with perception and and playing with how like how far into storytelling could we get what what story did these objects hold and and how could we use all of these really intimate methods of Technology how can we make the technology intimate and and real I'm gonna mute myself okay all right good all right thank you back Adrienne I'm gonna turn it back to you for that side of the linka thank you in our last speaker here in Kingston is Janani Bali super on Ian and I'm gonna hand you that I'm gonna hand you the mic and I'm gonna get you to follow me out here cool hi my name is Jenna nee Balasubrahmanyam I was asked to tell you a little bit about my work and some of the questions that I'm thinking about in relation to it and in relation to augmented virtual mix whatever word were using on reality so what I do I'm a writer I make games and I'm performance creator based out in New York City and I'm in residence at the Public Theater as well as the Department of astrophysics at the Museum of Natural History so a lot of my work is based in really deep collaboration with who I consider the coolest scientist in the world the my astrophysicist friends at the Museum and in a couple other parts of the United States so what I try to do is use old-fashioned storytelling as well as games and play in concert with different kinds of new media whatever makes sense with whatever story we're trying to tell from the universe so I use augmented virtual reality whenever it's appropriate whenever it makes sense to help bring the poetry and drama and the store that are happening in the universe around us into the hands and minds of more audiences so to invite people into the story of science and into the story of theater and to performance in a way also especially for audiences who have not seen themselves as part of the story of science or theater astrophysics in particular is this really rigorous discipline right to be an astrophysicist to be a modern astrophysicist you have to be a mathematician and a physicist and a computer scientist and a data scientist and crucially also a storyteller and because it's ultimately the entire discipline of astrophysics is built on creating new and interesting ways of seeing right so they're taking what I consider an impossibly small amount of data I think the equivalent to you would be like if I gave you a lock of hair but told you nothing about it and then asked you to write a biography of the person that that hair came from that is what astrophysicists are doing with the amount of data that they're able to gather from the universe through different kinds of telescopes so there's a very human exciting storytelling component to the work that they do and I am passionate about bringing that side of it to more audiences especially people who have not had access to maybe the mathematics and physics that is required to go through the rigor of everyday astrophysics so one medium that I work in for a number of different projects is audio augmented reality so I build projects where audience members gather in large and small spaces some projects large some projects more intimate they're offered headphones and through the headphones they're given narrative instruction and music and through that they are animating the story of something one of my astrophysicist buddies is researching write some really contemporary data research in astronomy we tend to focus on celestial objects that are unfamiliar to most people or celestial phenomena that were just you know figuring out that most people don't know about that we as humanity collectively barely know about and what I try to create are these experiences where people are able to embody these celestial phenomena so even without again going through all the mathematical rigor of it you have attained some embodiment of the physics itself and in doing so also opened up new kinds of social questions and new questions related to your own lives and the lives of the people around you new metaphorical spaces that we can access by telling different kinds of stories about the sky in the universe I think I'm constantly inspired by how science itself as a discipline like theater also but really science itself requires many different kinds of scientists to be in the room to excavate different kinds of science I take a lot of heart in the fact that the scientists that I'm working with are looking at objects that are literally invisible to our eyes that exist in wavelengths outside of the optical and are also thinking about movements of collective systems and so for me those are exciting metaphorical spaces to explore as a storyteller so I have three questions that are emerging for me in my work overall and then specifically in these kinds of audio a art pieces so one is how to I think relevant to some things other folks have been talking about how to both in a technological sense and in a dramaturgical sense make those experiences responsive to audience movement gesture and collective movement so again we can actually faithfully embody what's happening in the sky but it happens as an organic process and you don't have to tell people every step of the way now you're this and now you're a star in a comoving group but rather you kind of experiences something that happens all around you a second question that I have is again both attack and a dramaturgical question is how to make immersive experiences more broadly but specifically the kinds of audio AR work that I focus on adaptive and accessible to disabled audience members and to help that happen from the get-go so that accessibility doesn't become a matter of maybe slapping supertitles on a piece or having interpretation after the facts but becomes part and parcel of our compositional practice and kind of an interesting place to work from rather than something that we consider a roadblock to look at you know after we've made the whole dang thing a third question that I'm thinking about which I also want to use to talk about a specific project is how to by combining these kinds of works that have storytelling references from multiple fields for me that's theater astrophysics and also literature and how we can make works that live kind of like chameleons like artistic chameleons can live in theater contexts can also live in educational context can also live outside in somebody's backyard and can also live inside a science museum a science center so to that and one project that I have been working on with an astrophysicist collaborator is a piece called the gift so I'm working with dr. Natalie Gosnell who's a stellar astrophysicist at Colorado College and she researches they're really special and intriguing lives of blue stragglers stars so I'm gonna tell you a little bit about blue stragglers stars so I know you can't see the stars right now except the Sun which is also a star the stars have not gone away just because the blue sky is up it's just when the Sun is up it dominates everything else around us so the curtain has been pulled in a way right the Sun is pulling our theater curtain for us so if you were in a night sky just imagine a night sky for a second about half the dots that you see there about half those stars you see are actually pairs of stars are actually binary systems right but because they're so far away from us our eyes can't resolve them optically as two different stars which to me is a very exciting story in and of itself right that half of the things out there are actually both a star and its companion they might be different in scale one might be bigger larger one might be one kind of star one might be another but there's these binary systems that are working very closely together that are often born together and Co move through the universe so when Natalie does is a kind of storytelling of forensics an excavation of a particular kind of story of a particular kind of star that I find really witchy and fascinating so what she looks at are these blue stragglers which are stars that are bluer hotter and appear younger than they actually are and one pathway through yeah interesting same here so the one pathway through which these blue stragglers are created is through the process of mass transfer so some binary star systems are so close to one another that they actually move mass from one to the other and so she looks at a blue straggler that is sitting alongside a white dwarf which as she says is something like the stellar equivalent of a lump of coal and she says what happened there and that's the story that together were animating through this piece so the story of what happened there is that these stars were very close together what has become the white dwarf used to be actually a red giant star which is a phase that many stars enter towards the end of their lives and they're kind of puffed up and red and giant and that star through kind of this gravitational tipping that happens start sending its mass over to its friend right that process of the mass transfer happens over tens of millions of years but if a star lived in your lifetime it would happen in about five minutes so imagine if your whole body was somehow transferred from you to your friend in about five minutes that's what happens that's what happens to these these two companions so then that donor star becomes a white dwarf and is just sitting there essentially having lost everything and the other star becomes a blue straggler which has this infusion of mass and becomes bluer hotter and is kind of living its life fast and hard because it's burning its fuel up really quickly so we wanted to create a piece to animate these really a fascinating beautiful lively stories and I think undo some of the ways that stars have been dominated the story of stars and what happens in the universe has been dominated by kind of very masculine and warlike understanding of what's outer spaces and there are a lot of other ways to understand out our space too and so we through a process of kind of iteration like we came together we made one piece that was just kind of a movement game it was really fun it's really fun developing astronomical work in a city that has an open sky which we do not have access to you in New York City so I try to get out of there because we have too much light pollution when we make these make these projects then the two best came and played around at in some studios in New York City for a while and we made something that was kind of like half art half science game that was fun and then we thought to ourselves okay but we want to make something that actually is integrating these these forms these fields these disciplines and so we came up with this piece called a gift where the form we're using is melds basically a lot of my favorite things because I grew up as a nerdy lonely child and to me the first type of augmented reality that I experienced was reading was literature right my own imagination that to me is an augmentation of reality and so we have this forum where people are offered a book as well as audio and so the reading becomes at once kind of private as well as social experience and so they're asked to do things to move through space to interact with the book the space and one another and in doing so bring to life the story of this star and its companion and hopefully you know build some other little companionships along the way so that piece is in process right now I think our next stage is figuring out water again some of the kind of interesting dramaturgical things that can happen with the interactions between audience members and the technology we are using to employ it in concert with these very old-fashioned simple techniques of theater so I think in the spirit of our community agreements I'm just gonna say that's the end of what I have to say thank you [Music] so now we're going to move into some responses and questions now and we're going to start with a question it's gonna be a little bit like a game of tennis that's how we envision it so we have a bunch of balls in the air and then frog is gonna hit something over here and then we're gonna respond with an answer and then so maybe what I'll do is I would like to ask gotta and Jenna need to bring your chairs up here and then that'll reduce our travel time and Ian I'm gonna ask you two to start our our volley our question-and-answer volley yeah and I'm absolutely grateful that you you've brought both of the artists together because it's sort of this question I want to open up to both of you we have a we had a conversation before the session earlier today we're six hours ahead so we had a bit of time to chat earlier with a number of other collaborators as well working and interested in this intersection of technology and live performance both within what we do and outside of it so expansive practices and a big topic that came up is what are the frameworks in which that work is able to happen a lot of us but not all of us are tied to universities into planes we find funding in different ways we've attached to institutions in different ways and I'm curious how and and you both talk about multiple multitude of ways in which your your work gets created and so the question there is you can sort of talk a little bit about the challenges of working within effectively a discipline that doesn't necessarily have a clear delineation we're talking about performance we're talking about storming we're talking about AI we're talking about computer science talking about being very fluid between these areas and I wanted to ask you about how you experience that fluidity in executing your projects so you mean in the structuring of the projects or in actually working through the projects or both yeah well the initial question is the structuring of the projects and and and how that works together you talked a little bit about it but then also how that impacts ultimately the work that is generated out of that I I guess the biggest way that I think that impacts what I do is it I try to think about that a lot at the beginning of a project and be very clear about how the different people are going to be thinking like I I think there's a sort of initial framing stage where I would not just think about what are the things that are going to be done but who are the people that are going to do them and how are they talking to how it what languages are they using how are they going to and so it's almost like I get to know you period where I'm trying to find out what what do I need to know about their domain to actually be able to speak and I do sometimes I kind of translation role I think it's a lot in designing for me my approach is very much in working with individuals and then spending a lot of time at the beginning figuring out what is the specific structure of this project and what do we want from it I think that one of the things that I'm very interested in is visualizing an end that has like multiple outcomes that are personalized I think this the relationship between what is interesting to people and how do you actually have a process where people are actually getting to engage with the thing that is interesting to them as opposed to a sort of morphed version of it is probably the most interesting piece of that for me so I think there's the language there's how do you how are people going to communicate at what like points in the structure of the project are they going to be able to communicating and these are all design questions essentially is that I think I feel like I missed something key in your question though I don't think so I mean yeah no I think that's X thank you I think for me the most valuable way to think about structuring these collaborations is thinking about actually is a metaphor that also again comes to me from astronomy so a way that a lot of celestial objects stars and otherwise form is in these molecular gas clouds where something triggers some action and the gas eventually accretes into various types of celestial objects in these gas clouds that are also called stellar nurseries you know these birthing grounds for these new objects so for me what that means is I have really appreciated being able to spend a great deal of time with the people that I collaborate with not always working on a project so when I hang out with my astronomy research group in New York I go to the meetings I hang out with them I spend time with them one-on-one not always with a project goal sometimes we're working on something specific but to me that time of building fluency and ease with each other's practices vocabularies what my scientists friends are thinking about on a day to day basis that is just about their own lives also the cycles that their work goes through the roadblocks that they're hitting that stuff to me has been just as valuable as the time that I have spent maybe just hearing one of them talk or reading one of their new papers one of my frustrations in how a lot of art science collaborations are imagined maybe institutionally is people think that if we hang out for a couple hours that something cool will come of it and I actually think we need so much more time together because without it that's what leads to like bad science and art and bad science metaphors especially in art but when we have the time together there's some really wonderful things that open up like for me it has been a great opportunity to learn from scientific research practices for my own work I've also really enjoyed seeing members of my research group in New York get excited about their own creative impulses and access those in you know events that we've put together co-created in different spaces so I guess part of structuring the collaboration across structuring collaborations across fields for me is thinking about that balance of informal and formal work and also times that you hang out without working thank you and question for us I do have a question for you it's like you were reading the same script or something I can't help but think when I'm listening because I think I may be the only person in the six of us who's not affiliated with a university unless you want to call it the University of mom so I I can't help but thinking I have two young kids four and six years old and I spend a lot of time thinking about their development and how do I share large ideas with them in a way that they can understand right so so I always thinking about my audience when I'm talking about I don't know why is the sky blue with that classic question or what are those things in the women's washroom that you pay 25 cents for which is always a fun exclamation to do um but when I was listening to you speak today I was thinking who who are the audience's for your works Beth and Andrew and and how are they are you seeing patterns in terms of the socio-economic maybe the socio economics of demographics of where those audiences are coming from and do those audience patterns match where you imagine your or where you want or desire your work to be landing because I get I can't help thinking about who gets it access to the technology and the equipment and the work and who doesn't and so I guess that's the question behind my question and what are the strategies that you're using or the thinking that you're using to to broaden that reach question let's go an end you want to jump in first okay yeah okay here we go Neal and I am co-creator carried around and we did a sort of table presentation of the project at the computer science showcase at the University a couple months ago where we just redid we had the pictures and then it was s time to get very like it's the elevator pitch but it's the elevator if it was in the Empire State Building because the projects so complicated but we were talking to a group of I would sort of loosely say like 18 to 22 and we're talking about as straight as an old story in history and sort of went through everything one of the one of the guides turned to me and said oh my god I would totally pay to see that and that was a really interesting experience like okay so we're making something that like young people wanna engage with we got the same feedback from from the city like is pretty modulus demographic when we actually performed the piece but I would say - there's a democratization of the technology coming and so it will be more accessible it got more accessible a couple weeks ago it's gonna get more and more accessible and I think you know as part of part of using University resources to to sort of bring the projects out into the wider world where they're being subsidized by multiple different space suits and that's where these relationships and those living with scientists and working with different places starts to become really valuable I think for the for the wider population and it's gonna start really small like I was talking to so in the other day but like how do we do this for a larger audience and it's gonna start piecemeal until start thinking about doing it in different ways - part of our audience actually in oculus and part of the part of the audience was it's only ten people shall get to see it but we find a way to to subsidize it there are like you know unreal that are offering giant mega grants to think about this technology in a different way so I don't have an answer it's a huge question it's definitely a problem as I sit here with and I know that not everybody has access to that but a but where else is he so hopefully that keeps going oh right okay we're gonna hand over I mean this is a big topic that we that we've talked about on our project so I mean I adore this question that it's also all I can really offer is some more trouble against um getting to tell a story is an incredibly privileged position no matter where you are at being the person who's on the stage of esta mike forgets the speakers it's incredible wait and I think when we're working with technology especially we have to be super careful about what it is that right now flying especially because a lot of what we talk about we talk about technology comes out of the particular development cycle which doesn't serve any real ethics nicely right I mean it's sort of like it's it's the sphere and in front of an upload system that just produces what sells really well and then we pretend often that it's neutral you can use it as ground storytelling but it's not neutral in the slightest so there's so much here I mean there's so much here to unpack about where where we stand and what we get to use and what we amplify and I think just being really about that it's it's incredibly important um I mean for me personally one of the things that's that's both part of the problem that also I think a little glimmer of the solution I'm not so I'm 42 I guess we're getting no of them I'm 42 I'm Generation X I grew up with the internet this is the point of this story I literally grew up right so as a nerdy child myself this is before anybody knew where was it didn't exist it was before the internet was a thing it was like your computer nerd and that meant that you didn't go outside and have many friends but the thing was that I had a lot of friends I had a lot of international friends I had a lot of people who were discussing some really interesting stuff but I wasn't seeing in other places I know that this is true for a generation of folks and continues to be true for marginalized communities I mean mainstream as well but if you look at what is working in social networking right you're seeing amazing things happening here community not perfect but my question now is where do we take this so this is really like very deeply personal struggle for me again I grew up on the internet I worked for a long time in social media research for a big tech company and the myth that we all have is that this is going to be this great month that's important that's not find ourselves at all but as storytellers can we honor that can we amplify additional stories other stories and we bring different voices to the table and I have to believe that we can otherwise I wouldn't be involved in arts theater here there has to be way so I yeah I mean there's a few projects that a blend thank you I I don't know I'm just gonna kind of so this is the part where we're gonna start the questions rolling so I have a follow-up question because to take advantage of my privilege of holding the mic which is you talked about who you invite to the table and and being mindful about that so if you have projects where you're where you're doing that I'd love to hear examples of who you're inviting to the table and how that's addressing these questions and I was deferring to me cuz we've been working on a project for a while called Brown works which is in collaboration primarily with a dance company called dancing earth which was run by Rulon who is it's essentially an indigenous dance company so there's a lot of different populations that come in there the genesis of that project from the other side is that there have been a number of collaborators are working primarily in California a number of collaborators from local indigenous communities who have been contributing to the work and it was let's spend a year turning that around so it was a give back period so part of that meant spending lots of time embedded with a number of community is surrounding the San Francisco Bay Area they had already into that project when because we were developing things and real love is also known in ecological performance circles and that's where a lot of my youth practice and work has been I reached out saying we have this work in which we are looking at doing a lots of site environmental work is it something that's interesting to you and as it turned out that a number of our collaborators are saying like what we really want to do is instead of bringing things onto stages where we're bringing things in we want to see how we can bring people out to the places where we are but you know as sort of a highlight of this question of access there is one of the communities that we're working with is a quaint arena Manchester band of pomo Libyans and their reservation is though calling it largest is generous it's a few thousand people the reservation itself is a few hundred people but it is a the largest like Big Town infrastructure near the Manchester Keeble station which is where the internet comes from Japan so come to North America and it's where Hawaii connects so you have this cable station that is the connection of the backbone and then you've got a community that up until half a decade ago didn't have consistent broadband access themselves the area is still really underserved and part of that is like there's a lot of market demand and a lot of it switched to mobile and you sort of have the drive half an hour to get to a proper signal and so in working with this community there's a lot of those those questions in building the application that we're now building we've been developing content that's an immersive content video audio other things that are experienced that end up being co-located but then the question then becomes like the priority for who can access this is that community so they if we don't have strong Wi-Fi signals if we don't even have 4G service up there how do we deliver what our very data hungry experiences and how do we work with technology that is otherwise expensive becoming more affordable but then the mid the big technical question that we've been battling across a number of different projects is how do we make things accessible with the devices that people have how do we meet people where they are with the experiences so that we get it have this dialogue as opposed to making it something that is locked off to somebody who can afford a new headset someone who can afford to refresh their phone every two or three years and all those different factors that sort of in in a version of mainstream is an expectation that you will have something relatively current so that's sort of one example about how that's and manifolds and that's manifesting in okay this code needs to run across different platforms that's more difficult to develop than developing off of one hoping something produced Apple would be easier trying to make it as web oriented as possible trying to keep the data minimized all of those different infrastructural questions I've become implicit and then start to shape the work as well and start to change the shape of the work because of the person who you want to access and it can't for simple technical reasons you're doing something wrong thank you do we M do we want to open it up to questions from our rooms now I think maybe I've asked our artists here on this end to listen carefully as your as our colleagues were speaking do you have any questions for our friends in Prague hmm or vice-versa Prague to Kingston about the work that was I'm scanning them yeah you're scanning the room where the brains are melting they are melting it is towards the end of heart but we have ones maybe I went over here um we have yeah we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna take advantage of the limits of our technology just watch my questions for sort of all the presenters and it's kind of a technical one if someone was interested in getting into starting to work with or experiment with these new with this new media is there equipment or technical resources that you would recommend accessing I guess do we want to start over here for someone starting to work in in like VR and AR do you mean and mixed reality is there are there equipment or resources that you would recommend that they start with specific [Music] is what are your tools I guess my answer would be it really depends on what your interest is if you are interested in 360 storytelling I would say getting a very simple 360 camera and playing with it with people in the space is a really good place to start if you're interested in ritual spaces like it really depends on what you're interested in doing and what like just starting working in unreal or unity is a great place for people for some people but it I would say actually starting with figuring out why you're interested in the technology and what you would like to do with it and then finding your most basic way to take you to the thing that you're genuinely interested in would be the thing I would start with because if you start with a technology that is actually not going to apply to where your interest is then it's going to not help you at all you'll end up playing with a small camera but your real interest is in sound or how directional sound works and that's going to just take you further and further away so yeah I'm gonna offer that something and mrs. aha this is this is a plug that's only going to work for people on this side but in about 20 minutes we just pull it there's a workshop that just culminated here that was about do it a couple of days of using introductory tools such as some basic 360 like easy to use cameras even those in working with them are things that you can orient with your phone a lot of the a lot of the thinking around it actually becomes much more is more about wrapping your head about what that content is actually doing many of the tools outside of like specialized cameras or perhaps specialized mics are actually then end up being the same so in this workshop they were just doing like the the video editing tools that we were using to edit 360 content at this point are the same ones that anybody would be using to do other content and because of the way that these things have been stored especially on the summary level of those types of files that you can actually pretty much use anything and now YouTube and Vimeo have gotten smart about how to distribute those so oh for one of the projects that's we've been doing that we launched on one because it was something that we didn't want someone have to download something it's all web-based it's geo-located but then it just you know exploits bouncing over to YouTube it builds a lot of like ability to explore into the phone there's a little bit of navigational tricks in there but you'd be surprised what's there from a sound perspective I might turn it this way yeah and I will say as it's moving as the mic is moving over there that because we do have that workshop in about 20 min that we have we have about five minutes left in our room okay hi Bobbi sound designer from New York so there's a few coming cut jumping on this question like affordable entry points especially 360 audio or 3d audio zoom makes a really cheap recorder now I think it's H to end that can do I think it is for capsules capture kind of a simple ambisonics sound which is what kind of mean sound in multiple directions also there's a if anyone programs in max which you have to have a max license there's a really fantastic software suite called spat made it ear cam that for a long time cost money and then about a month ago they finally decided to just make it free so it's a free tool that allows you you really advanced spatial audio mixing its spat SP eighty and that's kind of what a lot of the really fancy stuff is based on so it's kind of a great way to get started on that and hopefully I think at some point maybe there'll be a pure data version there's also other free tools supercollider is an open source audio script based software that can also do spatial audio so I think you know there's a lot of communities doing spatial audio and that's kind of blowing up right now because the VR and they are so it's kind of a great time but I would say get a max license and start missing if not that venture data thank you before we lose our connection can I respond really quickly or is there time for me no I was just gonna pass it over to you we have got one comment here before we lose you in Prague hi this is whit mcLaughlin hello Adrian it's nice seeing you across time and space I have a very quick response to where to start I'm really beguiled by the the emphasis on metaphor that you brought to your conversation media just delivers metaphor one time we were doing a project that we thought was going to be very sophisticated and our sponsors made us think down and down and down to flip phones if it couldn't go through a Euler phone we weren't going to do it and it made us essentialize our content and we actually delivered a more interesting metaphoric media based content through cellular phones than we would have if we had gone through smart phones whether we had gone into sophisticated software development and so I just want to emphasize that metaphor is what media is all about Thanks thank you I love that we're all just nodding yeah we there's a there's a including the the proliferation of using the phrase Carbon reality suppose that any other quarter metaphor for real space the other thing that's come up a lot is the idea of FX over FX and that's that's that's where we're sort of like landing on our t-shirt phrase on this side so II am irate and understanding that that you want out of that room or that you have to go to another workshop we are we are we are scheduled to be out of this ruthless well I if I remember the script correctly I was gonna give you the last word here you just took it away by a stocking after I said affects every oh sorry that was amazing last words epic [Applause] very effective it was so effective I didn't notice it happened I want to thank you both I want to thank all three of the three of you who are on our screen right now but also the wider circle that's in the room with you down there in that hot hot hot in Prague for joining us and for doing this experiment with us as well as thinking our guests here we can continue our conversation a little bit more if there are still questions in our and I'm gonna talk into the computer and I would also offer it like all from my contact information up on the slack which I know is being used just a primary platform and I'm sure our colleagues too because why not check another platform but I'm happy to engage with anybody as we delve into this orky murky world yes see thank you so this is the part of the script where Ian's supposed to say I'm going to end the zoom now we just kept this keep stepping over each other's line I know so this is the part where we're gonna end the zoom now thanks from this side as well for working through our our sweaty hockey dreams here at the peak you well that was fun we have some time left we have about a 10 minutes left we can certainly wrap up early if we want you but I wonder if there are questions inside the space for Janani or gata will you say your name again yes gana okay um I'm curious about this idea of industry artist collaboration and the idea of people enjoying their work together and I'm curious if you could just talk more about what those frictions might be that you're specifically trying to get at or address in terms of those relationships I'm sure you mean the frictions in people working together or just like maybe how does the industry an industry artists collaboration so usually there's a research element involved in what I do because it's with the university but I so one of the things that happens when people in industry and researchers and sometimes with artists come together is that you have specific things that you researchers tend to have very specific things they're interested in and that they're working on and industry often will have very like clear problems and this is true also with artists they have a specific I think I feel like artists are most likely to get lost in this process because they're often the ones that aren't anchored to some institutional structure but you get these this sort of we need to research this piece and you have something that's vaguely relevant and there's some kind of monetized structure that gives you an incentive to work together so you sort of make up a compromise where it's like well we'll work on this thing and then we can actually sort of make something and it really depends on the the structure we try to do different research so sometimes when it's industry it'll be actually like bringing a student on to work on a project that is basically paid for for four months and then that has a very clear structure it's more the kind of longer collaborations where you're building a project that's Co funded by different groups and then you end up having these conversations where you sort of use the same words and assume you're talking about the same things but you actually the researchers really want to work on these specific problems and the industry maybe has a specific set of things they need to happen right now and so I think when you rush those conversations you don't get to you get to maybe a compromised interest or a thing that can be like this is within our research group so we can make something happen or with on the side with artists you build something that is basically coming out of your initial conversation so you have an initial conversation where people are saying okay well we're interested in recently we're starting a project in collaboration with a group at Concordia and there's a lot of interest in accessibility of VR and then there are some interest in specific sound questions and I think the there can be an inclination to immediately sort of put those things together into a project and then shape it around what people initially said instead of kind of taking the time to say okay well what is it specifically about accessibility and how can that be built or what stages in the project is that a relevant question and how can we kind of open up explore that question a little bit deeper and what we can do with that question and then see how that links to this other piece so some of it is keeping questions separate and keeping people's interests separate for a while and letting them actually kind of develop and get clear and I think this goes to what you're saying about actually spending time to figure out what we want to do and where the value is going to be rather than saying things and then because and I don't know if this is true in other places but I feel like in Canada we do a lot of agreeing where we go to meetings and then we all agree and we really had a good meeting because we've agreed to everything but we've agreed to a bunch of stuff that we don't necessarily like we did it for the sake of agreeing and I think that's a really bad place to start a project it's better to get our agreeing out of the way then figure out what we actually want to do and then design the project from there so really like build out that sort of process that I'm Wojtek happy to be here with you all as a vir producer I have this issue of project management and most of my team have different visions of the project and we start from something completely different and the project in the end do you have any specific tools for like in the creative process so that everybody is on the same page yes I would say so structuring the project so that you know people's responsibilities really well and but starting from a point where you find out what people actually want to be doing and then give them and what is what are they going to be really good at doing what are they bringing to the project and structuring the project so that it lets them do the things that are important and valuable to them and structuring the project around complementary skill sets is really helpful but then also I think that it's useful to know what vision in what places has Authority in the project so for example it and it's different depending on the project if you're working if I'm working on a piece and I'm consulting with a director then I'm going to respect that that directors vision in a certain way and I think that knowing sort of getting there's a sort of investment in in it's not necessarily an authority structure but in a we understand that this person is doing this sort of bringing the pieces together and trusting in that is really valuable and that's partly creating a story that actually has a space for the things that the different people on the team are doing and I think it's really important to do that initial piece of finding out what are the other what are the individual people going to bring to the project and what is it what matters to them so that the person or people that are responsible for bringing those pieces together can constantly reflect back the individual contribution so it's kind of like a start is that makes sense does that have its there yeah hi my question is fortune Ani is that how I said how Jenin it was sorry Jenna knee Jenna knee my name is Alex I was so fascinated with your presentation and I'm just wonder if you could speak a little bit more about the way that the public engages with your work and if how they engage is part of your artistic process you mean when people come to experience a work what it actually looks and feels like sorry I couldn't hear the what so when people actually experience the work how what it looks and feels like is that what you're getting at yeah and you know what the technologies you use and yes and is it a collective experience is it a solo experience and and whether or not that is something that you make part of your artistic decision making yeah totally I have a number of different kinds of projects right now that live in different ways in terms of whether they're collective or large-scale small scale or individual experiences so it's a yes to all of those things and that becomes part of how the project is mapped and and developed and created I think when we were talking before about you know what technologies one might need access to to start working on a new media project for me actually I tried to test things out as much as possible in the cheap way both in terms of money and time invest before going to the expensive way both because it's harder to you know turn the boat around once you put in the heavy capital and time investment on our project and then you also get to just make a lot of versions of the thing so I'm getting at kind of the what technologies we use right so for prototypes for tests of things might be as simple as asking people to bring their own phones or sticking a Bluetooth speaker in the middle of the room and no that's not going to get us the crispest audio that we're ever going to use but it'll get at the some of the questions that were maybe trying to test if we're going to make like a beautiful handmade object eventually we'll make something out of kind of post-it notes and string first so that to me is also a technology that we use to to test stuff in terms of implementing some of these audio pieces we I've worked with radio headphones that do broadcast historically for some pieces right now I'm in the process of developing new software that can work with the what is up and coming in augmented reality audio to deploy the pieces but I think a question that's on my mind that was also echoed across this is how to make a piece that may be or how to develop that in a way that there may be a B and C versions in terms of cost so that if there are institutions that are able to underwrite the cost of kind of the rolls-royce version of the piece fantastic and that can happen what are also other modes of implementing the piece for communities and places that are not going to have that kind of budget so that there are ways of the scaling the cost up and down while still retaining the artistic part of the piece in terms of what it actually looks like so some of my works people gather in a public space whether that's indoors or outdoors depending on the piece they're off in a couple pieces they're offered headphones and and everybody is wearing a set and they're listening to things that offer them things to do kind of mini games to play a narrative that they experience and an original music and the ways they move through the space the way they interact with the audio with one another and kind of the macro patterns that are created by their interactions each conveys something like they this relationship between the person and the audio is one relationship the interactions between small groups of people is one relationship and then the macro pattern is in it is another relationship which it is actually kind of faithful to how the physics works to write that the way that the objects and particles are moving follows that pattern that there are simple rules that govern the small and large scales so that's what I'm thinking about when I develop the pieces thank you so much thank you Jennie thank you gotta thank you all of you here in the room before I leave I there's a couple announcements first of all I wanted to say that it is quite cold in here and we've got no coracles shivering so we are on working on that to see if we can make a change in the temperature settings in this side this room and that is happening there's also the Electric Company Theater VR works that's that there are still slots available if you want to catch that check it out the you can find the spaces in the slack channel and sign up at Moriah is your contact there and then I wondered if Jamie is around there you are here I was blinded by my own presence yeah so we have a few folks who we didn't get introduced this morning and I want to just make space for that to happen hi everyone I'm Jax I'm the communications manager at how around it's really great to be here I'm also really excited about embodiment and so I'm curious about how technology can aid embodiment I'm very tired right now and I think it's important to have this conversation because it's happening whether we're in it or not and so it's better that we're in it next we're gonna have Stokely so Dylan if you can be on mat camera great pressure hi my name is Stokely I used the pronouns they and them I'm the Associate Producer at Hell around to answer some of the earlier questions I'm really excited right now about the brilliance and resilience of queer and trans people of color sovereign thing about us in the in these conversations and one word was world making last but not least I've got it great I'm not gonna run Dylan hello my name is Dylan Ito a gas my pronouns are he and him I am the new ish fellow of how round so I was invited it didn't said yes because I had to but I'm actually like really excited because digital and performance is something that I am always interested in creating within my own work as an actor director and writer and it is still kind of new to me because I do a lot of like DIY stuff so it's like what can he do I think of integration and accessibility so yeah great thank you and is there anyone else at this point who hasn't had the opportunity to introduce themselves to the room I'd love to make that space now please make yourself known ah yes behind you hi I'm Jill Kylie whoa sorry hi I'm Jill Kylie I'm with the National Art Center thanks thank you so our our team is sneakily setting up lunch over to my left at the bar at the bar space there and we're taking an hour for lunch this space is available for us to hang out in as well as this lovely outdoor space and the grass thank you everybody so far for the morning [Applause]
