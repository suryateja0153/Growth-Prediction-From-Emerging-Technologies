 Greetings Mixed Reality Pioneers. Excited to be here to tell you about our Fall features for Mixed Reality. On HoloLens, brand new UI features and a lot of identity management and enterprise features. In virtual reality, I'm really excited about our new Flashlight feature, which allows you to see the real world through virtual reality. New headsets are available for Windows Mixed Reality and if you have a chance, download Microsoft Maquette which is a beta experience in our Microsoft Store. Give us your feedback and I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you. Our latest update now adds HoloLens support for the Japanese and Chinese languages. Speaking Chinese New HoloLens enterprise features have been added, including better Intune management of holographic devices, and the ability to apply provisioning packages at any time. On HoloLens and immersive devices, users can call up the quick action menu, to adjust volume, start recording, or share holograms on a screen with support of Miracast. Developers can now integrate Mixed Reality Capture directly into their Mixed Reality apps. New APIs let the user capture a video or photo and then integrate it directly into the apps experience. Also, the Flashlight feature lets you take advantage of our sensors to see the real world from within your virtual world. After installing the update, be sure to download and try the Maquette beta. Whether developing for AR or VR, Maquette will let you quickly prototype and try out your Mixed Reality UI and spatial concepts in an immersive headset. We hope you enjoy all the new features as our Mixed Reality platform continues to grow and evolve.
