 HoloGrid is revolutionizing the way pipeline inspections are carried out eliminating the need to manually create UT grids. Regardless of diameter a 3D grid of a piping elbow can be created instantaneously. Field technicians set the pipe size, radius, angle and grid size using gestures and voice commands. The 3D grid is placed on the asset and can move in all directions, giving workers a 360-degree view of a piping elbow. With the arrival of HoloGrid the future of work is here. The digital worker is more productive and efficient, as data collection workflows are quickly expedited. Digitalizing the gridding process improves the reliability and repeatability of routine precise measurement data. Optimize your inspection processes with HoloGrid.
