 hey guys today i'm going to show you how i imported this 3d model to use it as a windows mixed reality environment this is a little scale house i made the 3d model using levitt architecture and blender so let's go into blender this is my 3d model in this tutorial i'm only going to show you how to export your model from blender and import it to windows mixed reality but if you want a complete tutorial about how to model a room or an entire house let me know in the comments and like this video and subscribe so you don't miss the others tutorials according to the microsoft documentation all environments must be less than 256 megabytes environments larger than that will fail to load and fall back to an empty wall with just the default skybox surrounding the user also the maximum textual size is 1k or 2k and if your windows version is older than 1803 you will need to update it i'm going to leave you the link to the microsoft documentation in the description of this video some materials don't work in windows mixed reality and when you import the model you get an empty wall so if you ever get an empty wall when importing just replace all your materials with a default material and import if the import is successful then start adding your materials one by one and testing until you have all your materials working the maximum size of your environment depends on your pc i'm using a gtx 1060 16 gigabytes of ram and an i7 3820 i can use environments with less than two million triangles if i import an environment with more than 2 million triangles the vr experience is very slow to make transparent materials like glass you need to change the alpha in the base color property and also change the blend mode to alpha blend for the other materials like this wood wall i'm only using a color map roughness and a normal map to export your 3d model click file export select gltf and click export gltf this process can take a few minutes depending on the speed of your pc now to use your model as an environment copy the glb file type percent local app data percent in the search bar look for packages then environments up then local state and paste your model there now you are ready to enter your environment in vr press the windows button in your controller then places then select your model you can place your model wherever you want and when you are ready click the model now you are inside your own build reality environment i'm also going to make a video about how i work and make my 3d models inside vr so if you want to learn how you can work in vr click the subscribe button if you like the video please leave me a like and thank you for watching
