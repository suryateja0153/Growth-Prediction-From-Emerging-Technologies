 Sometimes, a picture is worth a thousand words. But what if we have real 3 dimensional objects instead of pictures? This question often comes up where people are working together in the industry on the same piece of work but at different times. Let’s assume that a quality inspector of a car manufacturer finds some tiny scratches on the body of the car that is to be touched-up by a technician of post-production. How can the inspector mark that position on the object to seek it out easily? This is where artificial reality comes into the picture. We prepared a module for a mobile device mixed reality headset. Using the sensors of the device, we recognize a real-world object, like a car. We can detect the exact position and orientation of this real-world object. One of the users, say, the inspector, can survey that car through the device and spot the locations on the object that he wants to mark. So practically, a virtual marker is placed on a specific spot, together with some metadata, like audio recording, a photo, or text. The device can send this information for example to a logging system as well. Another person, say, the technician, can reveal all those information using a similar mobile device or headset. The same process can be used for similar scenarios, or to train new employees, and many more. We are constantly researching and implementing modules like this one, to support the employees in the industry and make their work more efficient while providing them with a natural experience.
