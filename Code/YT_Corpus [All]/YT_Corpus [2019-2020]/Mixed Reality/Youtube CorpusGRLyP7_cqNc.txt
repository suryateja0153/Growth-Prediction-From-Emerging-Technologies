 [MUSIC]  Imagine you're crawling inside a spacecraft, and you're trying to do the work. The last thing you need is to have to be carrying paper, or tablets, or a laptop into the environment. Being able to have data readily available without having to hold on to anything is significant. I'm Shelley Peterson, my role is Principal Investigator for Augmented and Mixed Reality at Lockheed Martin. We work with Orion, which is NASA's spacecraft that will take astronauts out to the Moon and even into deeper space, such as Mars. On the Orion spacecraft, there's 57,000 fasteners. Normally, the technicians would have to measure to know where to place those fasteners. With Mixed Reality, they put on the device, they see the digital version of the fastener hovering over the surface. They know exactly where to place it. When we do this, we save about 90 percent of the touch labor. We take an eight-hour activity of marking locations, and they finish it in 45 minutes. Or an eight-shift activity they can complete in six hours. It also reduces the potential for errors, because the instruction is just so clear when they see it overlaid on the structure in front of them. Over the last two plus years that we've use the HoloLens on the shop floor, we haven't had one error, and that's significant. It's just pretty powerful. It takes what we think of as a laptop or computing to the next level. It feels like magic.
