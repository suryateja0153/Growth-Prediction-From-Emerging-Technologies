 can I get a very quick show of hands to see what's up there who is public schools public schools yay private schools where are you wonderful corporate or business okay cool just good to know the mix of who's in front of me so my name is Lorenz Dirk's I work for the New South Wales Department of Education I'm one of the learning designers and I'm based in the head office of Technology so all the activities that kind of come out of our office are really focused around the effective use of technology in schools the particular project that I'm working on is called stem share community has anybody heard of stem share community yeah a couple of you okay wonderful so stem share community our focus is to deliver a very defined set of technologies to schools so we're really quite particular about what we bundle into kits and those kits then get sent around the state free of charge so public schools can access our technologies completely free and one of those technologies is virtual reality and so we use the Microsoft virtual reality solution as part of that kit so at any one time there is up to about 600 schools that use our equipment and so virtual reality is part of that today's presentations or the slides that you'll see they are on my Twitter profile already so if halfway through you're thinking I wouldn't mind a copy of that you can always go to my Twitter profile and download it from there I'll also refer to a research report that is also linked in my Twitter profile who uses Twitter here for their own professional learning can I encourage you if you haven't done that Twitter is such a great space to meet other professionals whether they're educators or business professionals that can then encourage you and stimulate you in your own professional learning so if you haven't started using Twitter for your look for youright for yourself I really encourage you to do so okay so let's have a look at virtual reality and where that's come from you know it's not new VR has been around for quite a long time and I guess the reason is that we are always so curious to have experiences that are just out of reach maybe those experiences are normally too expensive maybe they are normally too dangerous or maybe they are just imaginary experiences but it seems that right back since 1930 we've been looking for ways to become immersed in experiences that aren't immediately accessible so VR has had a bit of a history it's had ups and downs where it's become popular but too expensive it's become popular but too cumbersome and right now I think we're at a point where price comfort access where all these things are now making it more widely available and so windows mix reality which is kind of built into Windows 10 that's now something that we're rolling out to high schools right around New South Wales now when people use the phrase virtual reality it means a really broad spectrum of things and I've sometimes have to stop people in a conversation when I'm discussing virtual reality and have to say hang on what do you mean what experience you talking about so when I'm thinking about this stuff I kind of think about virtual reality like a rainbow there is so much diversity you know and that rainbow at the very top might be just a simple 360 photo bubble who's seen those 360 photo bubbles before first come across them yeah and that photo bubble you put a headset on and just by looking around so you're suddenly in a really interestingly unique location so I've just done some work with Taronga Zoo and we built a virtual reality experience with Taronga Zoo using that very top level of VR just photo bubbles so children right in the outback can put on the headset and they can be inside the enclosure with the giraffes and the giraffes are this close away from those kids you know virtual reality just makes these these kinds of experiences so much more engaging and suddenly kids have a deeper and more meaningful connection with the content that they're looking at so that's a very simple photo bubble at the very top layer then if we move down students can then create their own photo bubbles and annotate them make notes and comments and add flat pictures so now students are also creating those photo bubbles and sharing them in the headsets you can do the same thing with video but of course video is a little bit more technical a little bit more complicated but of course much more immersive so recently one of our Department of Education teachers went to Antarctica and I gave him one of our cameras and he went snow you know like in a big sail what's that called the big sail attach it to yourself and he went kind of skiing across the snow plateaus of Antarctica and he held up the camera and captured the 360 video of him doing that and he sent me back the link and it's just so it's so cool all right I'm literally watching one of our teachers ski across Antarctica you know so so that's the 360 video bubble as we go a bit deeper we then get pre-rendered realistic photographed places that are real so think of the Pyramids of Giza I probably will never go but there are companies and professionals who photograph every angle every nook and cranny every texture and hieroglyph and they then build that into a digital environment that I can walk through with a Windows mix reality headset and I've done that and I come out of that headset and I feel like I've been in the Great Pyramids I didn't just read information flat on the screen I didn't copy notes out of a book I looked around and saw all the stone and saw the hieroglyphs it was just a really powerful memory virtual reality creates memories in our students and when you put a headset on you're just surrounded by this stuff though but of course that photorealistic digital space is slightly more sophisticated but if we go down a bit further and we look at the imaginary environments that now have interactions in them so there's a company called realities i/o that has given us their content and they have photo scans I think it's the last operating coal mine in Germany you know the old traditional coal mines and as you kind of teleport your way through these coal mines you can begin to interact with objects that are inside that coal mine for me to explore that environment and learn more about that environments so adding those interactions becomes another layer of sophistication you can see it's now quite different to a simple photo bubble and of course the most sophisticated and the most immersive version of virtual reality is of course where it's an imaginary digital environment created by an artist with a lot of interaction and a lot of movement kids are now moving around the classroom in a digital space they're interacting with objects and the things that they're doing in this part of the digital environment change things that happen in another part of digital environment so the interactions become really sophisticated the more sophisticated those interactions the more immersive and the more powerful the thinking that goes on at the end of the day as an educator I'm interested in the level of thinking that goes on inside a student when they are involved in one of these environments so let's have a look at why I think it's really important for our students to have virtual reality access because industry is already doing it so I was talking to a teacher just last week and about how he is using our VR kits and he's he invited an engineer to come and speak to his students about how that engineer is using VR in their industry so for us educators maybe we haven't seen VR a great deal maybe we think oh it's just on the horizon but industry is well and truly adapting virtual reality tools as part of their workflow some examples of course are in medicine you can imagine the benefit for doctors and surgeons to be able to see a digital replica of a human body and examine those arteries and organs examine those medical conditions from above from below and of course in the automotive industry they're using it for the design process they are using it for the quality assurance process they're using it for marketing in mining when you work on the mines it's not unusual to get training in virtual reality for how to respond to an emergency situation imagine you can put all those miners inside a scenario where there is a gas leak where there is a cave-in and then those miners have already got the reaction the responses before they go into the actual dangerous situations this is stuff that's happening right now in industry and our students are going to graduate into those industries and graduate into those environments so one of my motivations to get virtual reality into classrooms is so that kids walk in and they know what it's all about they have got their VR legs so to speak of course tourism uses virtual reality to attract people to their locations they will offer people a virtual reality experience of perhaps skiing somewhere on the snow fields in France in order to attract you to then travel to those locations that kind of makes sense right so you can see that industry is really embracing VR real estate is using it I've been working with a VR company here in Sydney and their primary business is to take the drawings from the architects turn them into a VR model that clients can then walk through those designs inspect those designs and then make changes and comments on those designs so it's really excited that the industry is moving there and I'm so pleased to be part of a program that's helping kids get access to that however just because we can doesn't mean we should when I'm looking at this stuff and exploring apps and exploring experiences I'm thinking of classroom teachers with 30 kids in front of them with a really difficult time table with assessment tasks to complete and I have to weigh up is there enough value in this experience to earth teachers to go on their own learning journey is there enough value in this to put kids into a headset tight Ted to a cable and I want to ask you that same question if you are going to explore virtual reality just because you can doesn't mean you should we need to think about the ethics of Technology so as part of stem share that's one of the things that I often ask our team to consider when I'm speaking the teachers that take stem share equipment think through the ethics one of the examples of how we're helping teachers tackle the ethics of technology is immersive versus non immersive VR there are two very distinct types I could go back to the rainbow and kind of draw a line halfway through you know those top colors are non immersive those bottom colors are immersive so this research report that came out of the University of Newcastle really honed in very clearly on the safety implications of virtual reality when it comes to young students and the safety implications for older students so before stem share launched any of our virtual reality products into the classroom we wanted to make sure that we were following the latest advice and the latest research on how to keep our students safe put very simply if a student can hold the headset up and take it down with no cables that's non immersive that's like a for little kids anyone here who teaches primary school here primary educators so if you have little kids in front of you they get very excited and they see this big beautiful turtle right in front of them and they want to reach out and grab it they'll obviously want to step forwards but the Nate's here there's a table and chair in front of them because they've got a headset on so by not letting primary aid students put a strap on their heads it's one of the ways that we keep them safe they have to hold it and they then take it down to talk to their friends to talk to their teachers so our stem share VR kits and non immersive and that's one of the ways that we like to keep our kids safe if you want access to that report again feel free to have a look at my Twitter profile I don't think you have to sign in to Twitter if you just go do a google search Twitter ICT lorentz you can see this the feed that I've got there and you can download that report okay so mix reality headsets what's the difference between that and some of the other products and why do we choose a as an education department so the other virtual reality headsets that are probably I don't know if they're on display today you'll have seen that they might need a sensor or a lighthouse and you've got to place things around the room and as cables plugged into those things I'm just not going to ask your teacher to do that high school teachers move from one classroom to another it's just not practical the logistics are just too difficult to set the lighthouses up and put those sensors in place so the Microsoft solution uses something which is called inside out tracking so on the right-hand side so on that side you'll notice that the headsets they don't have senses they don't have lighthouses whereas those ones do those ones are complex to set up teachers don't have time for that these ones you literally plug the headset into the computer and offer goes because the cameras at the front of the headset they scan the room and they help map the position of the student to the physical environment around them so that's why we've chosen to use the Microsoft mixed reality brand because it's so much easier and so much more practical to set up for teachers who've got a lot of kids in front of them difficult timetables and I was swapping from room to room so and we found that that works really well by the time a teacher has used it and then the kids goes I'll say I can look after this for you and we said right great let the kids set it up let the kids run the hardware so Microsoft mix reality works well for us in the classroom makes things so much easier this is another one of the questions that I asked teachers to think about you know there are so many apps available and I'll show you some of the apps in a minute that put that placed the student as a consumer and they are passive as passive as you can be in VR so one of those apps for example is the body via where a student could put the headset on and they are then the size of a red blood cell and they can travel through the circulatory system and then after a while they shrink even smaller and they travel inside the cell of a human and look at the nucleus and all that science is stuff I'm not a science teacher but they are a consumer engaging with this spectacular content exposed to incredible incredible ideas and concepts but I don't want that to be the only VR experience that a student has I also want a student to be a builder a creator a designer a maker in virtual reality because as soon as students begin to make and create they're then accessing all of that information they've learned and using those higher order thinking skills to put something in place so that's why I want teachers to always ask that question consumer or creator or maybe it's both maybe it's a spectrum a student moves from consumer and then moves over into creator that's the workflow that I'm looking for in a classroom when teachers are using virtual reality okay so let's have a look at some of the apps that we use on our kit and I'll just show you so virtual reality is app based if you don't have the app you're not going to have the experience just like a mobile device that you've got in your hands is app based and you select those apps depending upon the purpose so the same thing as the VR so for example we've got Lyra Lyra is one of my favorite apps it's a music composition app student puts a headset on and they are surrounded by these digital mechanisms that make sounds they can arrange them and connect them and put them on repeat they can record their own sounds they can use instruments and they literally weave a web of music around them it's just a spectacular experience at the end yes they can hit publish and create an mp3 file that they can then share with somebody else there's also symmetry this is a physics engine it's quite a sophisticated physics tool so instead of talking about really abstract ideas in physics students can actually use those concepts in physics to create machines to create cause and effect inside their digital world with almost no limitation calc flow up there is a really sophisticated mathematics visualization tool it's actually designed for university but when I saw it I was thinking of year 12 those really advanced maths kids that are working with complex ideas well this is a way that they can visualize and manipulate those complex ideas epic rollercoaster you're thinking Lawrence that can't be very educational because it is a roller coaster it's nothing more than a roller coaster but it's an important part of virtual reality the reason I've included in this list and the reason why I tell teachers use the rollercoaster at least for your very first experience you know my kids are learning something new if it's high-stakes but the kids are entering with no skill there's a lot at risk and then kids aren't as free or as comfortable to explore when virtual reality is brand new to a student they need to find their VR legs they've got to get used to the controllers they need to get used to the headset the students around them need to get used to the fact that a kid is blindfolded with a headset on so having a virtual reality experience that's very low stakes there's not much cognitive load you're just sitting on a roller coaster it gives an easy entry point where people begin to feel like yeah okay I get VR now and now I can do something more sophisticated so I guess we're moving sort of from very simple low order to much higher order sort of stuff so that's why I put the roller coaster in there I've also put a day in the life of a pirate you know maybe they don't want to do a roller coaster as a via maybe they want to do a pirate experience again very low stakes there's nothing really at risk here teenagers will give that a go and they won't necessarily feel embarrassed they won't necessarily feel intimidated because they're just trying to walk around a ship like a pirate but then on the other hand you've got something like tilt brush this dynamic and spectacular art creation tool a new medium that I know for a fact right now year 12 students are using that particular tool as their major work does anybody here work Vanessa I need to help Nessa understand how to mark some of this stuff vinyl reality this is for those wannabe DJ's those students in music who they want to be on the stage and mix music together like a DJ as you can see there's a real range of experiences for Windows mix reality and we've been working hard at stem share to make these range of experiences possible there's one more that I want to tell you about and that's the one here called symmetry alpha symmetry alpha for me is probably the most powerful app because it lets students bring their 3d modelling work that they might do in a computer lab they can bring that from a flat screen into VR and they can then walk around and inspect that work from a first-person point of view if you've ever worked with students that are trying to understand three dimensions you know it's really quite abstract and it takes kids quite a while to understand x y&z values and then design effectively on a flat screen that's quite difficult so with this workflow a lot of our schools are doing their design and their building and their modeling in a computer lab the whole class is doing it and then one at a time they cycle through the headset they evaluate their work and then their group might comment because they're watching on a big screen the group might comment about changes that have to get made so I found that some apps have got really significant use other apps have got very specialized use and as part of virtual real in the classroom that's one of one of the things the teacher does is evaluate where will this experience fit to enhance our learning for the students one of the schools that really demonstrated to me the process of designing in the classroom and then evaluating in the headset was gray stains high school they were one of our first high schools to use Windows mix reality and they went through this design process that I just talked about they had the opportunity to remodel a part of the library and the part of the library that they were remodeling was the part that was going to become the senior Study Center so the year ten kids got the opportunity to design their own study space for when they would be in year 11 so they worked very hard on their modeling tool in the computer lab in groups and submitted a bunch of designs and their first presentation was of course to the school executive they had flat versions of the designs but also invited the school executive to put their headsets on and then walk through those new virtual designs the next audience for that was the PNC of course PNC's play an important role in schools when it comes to funding and those sorts of things so again the students presented their designs both flat on paper and in virtual reality and the PNC could walk through those designs they can inspect where the doors were where the windows were where the furniture was and when the students were going through this design process they realized I'll hang on this table is too high or the windows in the wrong spot or we need to move the sink over and the beauty is that kids could make those observations as naturally as we would make them in a normal physical space if you want to learn more about that gray stain story I did kind of a 30 minute mini documentary about that so feel free to hop on to the YouTube channel of stem share and you can listen to the teachers and the students talk about the whole project and I specifically wanted teachers to tell us what they went through because at the end of the day if there's no boost to the learning in a classroom then there's no real value for us that project is now about nine months old and it is still one of the robot most robust one of the most sophisticated use of Windows mixed reality that I've seen yes I love the body VR you know yes I love Lyra the music making tool but when kids can design their own invite moments well they can walk through those out there environments for me that was probably one of the best best thing I'd seen how do I are going for time who I talk to about that I was kick going alright so what do you sketch up yeah yeah so they I just figured you know schools are good access to Sketchup and teachers are you know Sketchup so why not take your Sketchup files and drop them in via yeah okay tips and tricks for classroom management some very quick ideas for you teachers please have a go first even though the experience may not be smooth sailing five minutes thank you even though the experience may not be smooth sailing having a go first and you being the leader of the learning in the classroom even though students might be comfortable I always think that teachers we need to be one step ahead that's all we need to be I have to think about whether it's a whole class activity a small group or an individual project because one headset does not go far so think about how that works in the classroom just like I've got a large screen that you can all look at in a classroom as VR I always ask teachers to have a large screen so everyone else can watch the teacher can watch even though the kids have got a headset on so that helps the workflow it helps the teacher give instructions to the student whilst they're wearing the headset it's a really important part of classroom management we've used a buddy system for a long time in our schools and VR is another place where the buddy system is critical remember the kid wearing the headset is essentially blindfolded to what's happening in the classroom they don't know that a visitor has just walked in the door they don't know that some kid wants to walk past them to go to the toilet and you know so having a buddy to make sure that the traffic in the classroom is managed is really critical I would consider that one the important strategies to keep kids safe when they're using VR also virtual reality doesn't have to occupy the whole room it can be seated it can be just standing it can be walking around just one or two paces left and right but it can also be the size of the gymnasium a student literally could use a gym to create a virtual landscape I call that world scale I've seen so many users put the headset on because they're really excited and then then kind of like fumbling around where are the controllers oh oh and they're going oh where do I put my hands no no first get familiar with the controllers where should my thumb's be where should my trigger fingers be I know it kind of seems obvious but everybody puts a headset on first it's like just get familiar with the controllers first VR is quite powerful so limit users when they're new - nope - no more than 15 minutes also don't drive if you've been using VR for a while it can be quite disorientating so students who are driving if it's the last lesson of the day just say you know what don't operate any heavy machinery don't drive until you're firmly grounded back in reality because you're a judgment of perception are slightly messed with because it's so immersive you're dealing with teenagers schools ask me how do I take care of this just have some antibacterial wipes ready and I've seen schools before the kids put the headset on here have some wipes clean your face then put the headset on I know it kind of seems obvious but you know all right tomorrow what's what's next virtual reality for Microsoft so if you're familiar with sharepoint they've got a VR version of that being cooked in the background which i can't wait to get my hands on that's going to be really awesome and my next trick is to do multi-user imagine some of our rural kids putting the headset on being in a class with some of our city kids and an expert teacher delivering lessons that our rural kids could never otherwise get access to so that's what's next Thanks one
