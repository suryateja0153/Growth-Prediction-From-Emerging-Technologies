 yay awesome welcome everybody to this stream all around  azure and today with me with this mixed reality   with azure shortener title because we had too  much save april prepare us an incredible stream   welcome april on the stream thank you thank you hi  everyone so april is a cloud advocate just like me   but uh i will let you introduce yourself and maybe  talk a little bit about what you do inside the   cloud advocacy team yeah so um as you mentioned  i am part of the cloud advocacy team i joined in   was it january or february of this year i want  to say and i'm part of a newer team that we have   which is our spatial computing team and so we're  a smaller group there's a total of five of us   we all have very backgrounds in uh  how we got started in this space   but as a cloud advocate i would say a lot of what  my day consists of is creating content around   developing for windows mixed reality working on  different content that will help for me primarily   beginners get started with this sort of technology  because uh it's not one of those areas where as   there's a ton of information out on the internet  for you to go find to learn how to get started   so much is still changing to this day so hoping  to keep folks that really want to get started   keep them more involved and aware  of just how they can do that   i primarily do projects and such with our mixed  reality toolkit and i'll share that a bit more   in the stream but my my goal here is to help  raise awareness around the different tools that   we have here at microsoft and then occasionally  i might just share other tools as well that fall   under that mixed reality umbrella but yeah i  like creating content and helping people see   that you too can get started if you're brand  new with this because i only just started last   summer and i think i think um next week i  think makes a year since i started working   with spatial computing like as a whole so that  that's that's uh so it hasn't been that long   anniversary with you yes thank you thank  you thank you it's it's been a journey   oh yeah what a here right yeah yeah it's it's  been a journey um i i mean i had to i had to   learn two new languages which i uh hadn't had  any real use for in the past before i started   working with spatial i primarily only actually  i only used python and i always focused on ai   assistants and chat bots but now that i'm doing  more with spatial primarily working in unity i do   all of my scripting with c sharp and occasionally  if i do anything web-based and it'll be javascript   so with that said c-sharp and javascript were  the two new languages i had to learn but lately   i've found myself when i work with mixed reality  using c sharp and it's still a learning journey   that's awesome and like you packed so much stuff  also in the like in the this planned stream when   we were talking i was like that will be exciting  like can can we pass all through that all those   things it will be awesome see i hope so maybe we  should start then how about so so should we switch   that's my uh you know when you need to rewind yeah  should we uh switch scene and uh see your desktop   yeah so let me do that so that's on my side  so now we see your beautiful daisy web desktop   assuming do you see it now is it the daisy no  it's not a daisy it i you know what i don't know   what that is if i'm being honest with you  um it's a flower i know that much okay so can you see my screens yes okay wait i'm not  seeing what i'm seeing i see mixed reality there   we go here we go i was a little late where i was  viewing okay cool so what if you're watching from   twitch there's a delay oh that's a good point i  was like wait a second all right so let me move   little frank here that's in the corner and  put you over there and so my little twin yes   so what i'm going to do is show you all the app  that i've been creating um for hololens 2. for   those of you who may be wondering what this is it  is um our latest version of our mixed reality uh   uh headset device if you will most recently there  was an announcement during mixed reality dev days   that we have picked back up with uh manufacturing  and shipping so definitely make sure that you   check that out if you've been looking for  one i know these are like a hot commodity   but what i'm going to be showing the app that i  created in is mixed reality capture and that's   what you're looking at right now the app that i  created itself for hololens is to help me with   uh with strength strengthening my pronunciation  of french words so when the quarantine started   maybe a few days later i started learning french  and i think i met like day 92 or 93 of duolingo   so i've been pretty consistent but one thing i've  noticed with all my years of language learning is   the pronunciation part because it can be a little  hard to ensure that you're saying it correctly   so i you know which yeah you can relate right so  um the app itself um i like using gameplay and   also whenever i create anything in mixed reality  i like it to be an educational experience and so   the um the app that i created it gives you a  set of i can put this down for a second it gives   you a set of flash cards that shows different  words um there's a french mode in english mode   in the french mode i think that one has all the  flash cards are in english and you have to say   the proper french word for it if you get it right  then the card turns green and the score increases   and then for the english mode it's the inverse all  the cards are in french and you have to say their   english equivalent and if you say it correct then  you get points so i am going to share this right   now through our mixed reality capture if you have  a hololens device this is a great way for you to   um to show what you're actually seeing in your  device and this is also where you can come and   actually grab anything that gets stored  on your device such as pictures any uh   video captures and you can also come here and  install apps so let me put it on one second okay so you would be happy to know that i took the  screenshot to share on twitter before you put   all your assets so we can recognize you thank  you thank you all right so here we are you should   be able to see what i see in my hololens yeah  that's cool perfect all right so i have it here   in my all apps i call it practice french and  um as i've been like sharing on twitter about   this and also for you all who are just seeing  this for the first time this is the very first   game if you will that i created on a hololens so  this was a brand new experience for me so there's   some things i'm still learning and figuring out  um distance is one of them because for some reason   i put these buttons like right where my head was  so when you first start the when you first start   the app you have two modes one is english that  i mentioned the other one is french in a real   app if you will there would be instructions or  probably like a title card here and such but for   now from a functionality standpoint um i'll just  show you just the areas around it so from here   because with hololens you can use your hands to  um to select the holograms and buttons and such   i can click start french mode and then as you can  see here i have the um actual interface itself so   in this one i have the title here that says to say  the word in french i have my scored that's there   i have two buttons one that'll take me back to the  main menu one's a restart button to restart this   scene um i have my flashcards that i mentioned  here as you can see you'll notice that there's a   button underneath each one and that button is what  you can use to um to use the microphone to record   you're saying over here on the right i have my  time that's counting down and so i haven't figured   out how to make the time start by pressing a start  button it just starts when the scene starts i'll   figure that out eventually but for now what  i will do is click restart game so we can get   oh it moved okay didn't expect that let's let's  restart there let me back up a bit time's going   down so i'll start here with yes and i'll say  the word in french we turns green dog oops from and notice my score is at a 50 now you get  10 points every time you get one correct   beyond venue that one's was pretty good sweat oh old you put it that sweat  okay schwed is the female of a   oh you know yeah and the mail will be uh oh that's  good to know um so here now that my score has went   down i see that the game's over are gonna pop  up it gives me what that total score is as well   and then from here i can go back to the main  menu again since i haven't got my um distance   working well it keeps getting closer to me  so let me restart it so we can just see the   english mode really quick and we put it um at a  more proper distance it's really cool thank you i also learned something new today  about male owls i had no clue   and i know in russian like i like i will tell you  i don't want to say it right now but uh because   i was uh managing a a team of people talking  russian and with the world ibu in it word ebu   the sentence it could be very unappropriate  yeah oh i learned that that is good to know   yeah so i will let you know that cinema is  not on the not where we're live though yeah   oh that's good to know yeah my team had a lot  of fun they made me say that something in french   and i was like what's the problem with that and  they were laughing and say if you could imagine   what you're saying right now i was like okay let's  not we'll look at the english mode that one's um   we get the words in french now and we just say  the english equivalent so we'll start with we yes dog funny get back to this one dog i picked  up what i said afterwards uh welcome oh can you tell us april oh do you have a time   is there a 20 23 seconds okay we'll  let you go then okay almost done horse owl girl just like you promised house yeah i told  you it was gonna happen oh okay so game over   i got a 90 that time so let me get on out of  here and then let me get back to my face on   the screen let me get out of the mixed reality  capture cool and the response time it's quick   i was expecting like you know a long delay between  you saying something and like the validation one second frank sorry one second okay you were saying you were oh  i see now everything's upside down   sorry about that everyone you're  saying hopefully nobody throw up   i was saying i was very impressed by the speed i  was expecting a delay between while you're saying   something and like you know like that thing need  to be analyzed and everything and the response   that was quick i know so while you were uh just  want to open a little parentheses here because   a lot of things are happening on the chat  so we got raided so by a visual studio team   raid with 55 uh viewers so that's that's  cool so i was like i was about to ask you   hey could you say welcome but in french for  for them oh i could say bonjour bienvenue hi welcome raiders so super nice to see you  so people are very appreciated we already have   questions so you want me to push the uh mention  the question as we go or you prefer keeping it at   a certain point or how do you um you can honestly  i work best if you just say the questions as they   pop up okay um yep so we had the frank cass was  asking how about a wrong pronunciation any signal   yeah so you um when i tried uh trying to add logic  in there to check for the incorrect pronunciation   i realized that i was going to have to dedicate  way more time to building this out than um   than i had at the moment when i was creating it  there is logic that you can add to it as well um   to check for that because i am using our speech to  text service essentially what it's doing and i can   get into that a little a little later essentially  what it's doing is checking um it's it's taking an   utterance so whatever speech that is and then it's  translating that into text and so therefore if i'm   supposed to say bonjour but instead i say like  bong jor it'll tell me that it doesn't recognize   that particular phrase unless that happens  to be a real phrase in french of course   but otherwise um it does give you a um the way  the logic is set up at least in my in my script   it does give you a string to let you know that  there's no match if you want something that's a   bit more uh intricate in terms of detail um around  like what was pronounced incorrectly i'm sure this   there's things you can add to the script to  do that as well for what i was creating i just   wanted something that was much more high level  on the surface of checking whether or not the   words match but um there there are there is some  additional logic you can add to it as well but   it totally works because yes like that you know  the pronunciation was not perfect on certain like   being being very picky but uh i i can understand  everything you said like every word was like yeah   she's like it's it's it's so it's a valid green  right good good that means our products work exactly which is definitely good so let's um so okay so another one uh from belle da  haas was does it end all shuddering stuttering   oh stuttering um so the way that our uh our  speech service is designed if i'm not mistaken   it does for the one that i'm using i think  it takes just a shorter utterance if you are   stuttering what it will attempt to do is  make out the the the word itself that you   are attempting to say um i know for a fact that  it doesn't account for filler words like um's   and uh and like uh i've tested that out with  something else that i've built so if you just   say a sentence that said um my name is april uh  i like coding the response would take out that   almond that uh but for something that's stuttering  my assumption would be that it would look for that   word that the full saying of whatever that word  is that the speaker is attempting to say but that   might also be something that's worth looking um  more into with our cognitive services team just   to double check but i do know for a fact that um's  and us do not um are not picked up oh that's nice   and i translate google google translate because  i didn't know that word but now i know coloring i   was like what is it before asking i will google it  if it's like if it's me or if it's a tech term but   it was not the tech term yeah i think growing up  i had like a slight stutter but that was because   i talked fast and so as i got older i learned  to slow down to avoid having stutters it still   happens but exactly thank you that's what i i  didn't know that word so see i learn every day and yeah people were mentioning that  we got a delay but remember that   she was sharing that and then through a skype  call and then i'm streaming that so that's why   we had a little delay so between when you press  the virtual button and when you record your voice   for us it was a little bit like you were saying  the word and then pressing the recording button   so we had a little bit delay but that  just that just because we're streaming   kind of twice i'm assuming for you it's like  it's it's in the real real uh sequence yeah   yeah and um i'm sure towards the end of the of  the of the show um or even here for voting code   my my twitter handle is right below my picture  if you go to my um to my feed on my twitter   i actually posted a video of me doing this as well  in real time so if you want to see it done in real   time where everything syncs up you can definitely  find the uh the the tweet that i had showing it so   you can see how it does match up but yeah i think  it's because we're streaming a stream of a stream   it's a it's um it's in inceptions yeah that's  pretty much what it is well it was a very cool   demo so um thank you can you get started yeah  make it yeah it definitely takes some work   all right so let me start you off i explained  how you can um how it actually works in itself   and the first thing that you'll need to do when  you're creating this is actually starting with   unity so i have unity open in my background but  for those of you who may have never used unity i'm   just going to open up the unity hub really quick  so you can just see how the settings that i had   here and then we'll head to the actual project  that i have ready for us to use so what you'll   want to do is in the unity hub you can go to new  click the drop down i'm using version 2019.3.14f1   and so i know it works on this version therefore  if you want to replicate this on your own i would   say you can't go wrong using that version of unity  once you've selected that version of unity you   will want to find a folder where you want to just  store it i personally on my computer have a folder   of all my unity projects just to keep everything  organized i'm a super organized person and so   that's my location and then the project call it  whatever you want just know that um that'll be   what it's called if you deploy it to like in my  case a hololens so once you've done that unity   will take a moment to create the new project as  i mentioned i already have it open so we're just   going to head to unity here once you have unity  open in here there are some settings that you   need to do to configure your project for windows  mixed reality now when you're getting started with   windows mixed reality there's a lot of tools and  steps that you need to take the first thing is   going to be installing the tools itself and so  frank if you don't mind if you could share the where is it getting started with mr oh no it's  actually a couple ones now uh aka ms slash   mixed reality tools okay that  ms slash mixed reality tools i don't have that one these i have uh i have hill  2 tutorial and hl to import and right below it   what do you have that's it i have a guest april  3. oh you don't see the other ones no no did you   share me oh like you know what do you have it  on andy on your side just send it to me to uh   to the chat yeah i can do that i will show you  my skills and copy paste it in the twitch chat   no problem and of course i will add them so if  you're watching on youtube it will be down below   make sure i spelled reality right all right  that's that that's the first one oh yeah i   didn't have that one oh yeah there should be one  two three four five six seven eight nine whoa okay okay maybe i need to dig in my emails uh where is  the chat there boom all right perfect thank you   yay all right so um this webpage will actually get  you to all the tools that you'll need to install   and i don't need to install any because i work on  this on a day to day however here is a checklist   that i think is super helpful make sure that you  refer to this if you're wondering what even needs   to be installed beyond just installing unity there  um you will be using visual studio for this and   um make sure you that you have the windows 10 sdk  that's super helpful but also that you have the   most recent version of windows 10. so those are  the tools that you'll want to install so once you   have ensured you've had those then here in unity  you can configure your project for windows mixed   reality the first thing that you'll want to do  is come into file build settings and then in here   you're going to want to switch to the universal  windows platform and once you are in there   um typically this button down here will  say switch because i've already switched   i don't need to do that again but once it  switches then this will be the active one you   don't need to change any of the settings in here  if you are building for my case a hololens too   once this has been switched you'll come to player  settings and then once you're here in player   settings there's a couple things in here you  need to do you're going to go to player and then   xr settings you're going to check that virtual  reality is supported and then from here you will   add the windows mixed reality for the virtual  reality sdks by clicking this plus button here   once you've done that then you'll  have these options for depth format   and you'll want to set that to 16 bit depth and  then enable def buffer render buffer sharing   to um make sure that's checked and then studio  rendering mode is going to be single passed   instance that was a lot it was mouthful um so  and by the way i found all your links okay cool   um so yeah so for this project that's really all  you need to do here in the project settings if you   were building for something else there's many more  things you can change in here but for this project   we're doing the bare minimum of what needs to be  changed so once you've done that you just click x   um for those of you who may use unity frequently  you know that there are no save buttons really in   here except for when you save the scene so once  you change stuff you just click the x because   it's saved once you've done that what you now  need to do is import text mesh pro and that's   going to be used when we create any text ui  so here at window you'll come to text mesh pro   and then import tnp essential resources once that  gets imported the next thing that you'll want to   import is the mixed reality toolkit i'll go over  what that is in more details in a bit but the way   that you import that it will also be by coming  to um to assets import package custom package   and you'll navigate to wherever you may have it  on your computer so we will get into the mixed   reality toolkit in a second but with regards to  the regular um for the regular just configuration   to get ready for windows mixed reality that's  what you need to do just up to the mrtk part   now for those of you who may be thinking  this is a heck of a lot of things   to set up i completely understand but the good  news is that we have um documentation for this   and frank if you could share the uh do they  have some numbers on that like note to myself share a link number five right i i should have  numbered them if you can share the aka dot ms   slash hl2 tutorials link oh wait i have that one  that was the second one yep so on that particular   page as soon as i can find it i believe it looks  like this one um what this page will do is take   you to the hololens 2 tutorials that we have over  on docs and this will actually walk you through   what i just showed you probably super quickly on  unity but this is more of a step-by-step approach   it outlines what those prerequisites are so  this does reference that tools link that we   just talked about and then here on page two for  initializing your project and first application   this is literally everything i just went through  so if you are more of a you need to see pictures   and you need to walk step by step and you  need screenshots and so on and so forth then   check out this document because it'll do the  same exact things that um that i just walked   you through over on unity just super quickly  the next thing we're going to do now is um   add mrtk to the project and configure and  so this documentation also has this as well   now if you've never used mrtk mrtk is a mixed  reality toolkit and we have documentation for   what that is as well but the mixed reality toolkit  is um really really helpful if you're building   mixed reality experiences you can also use for  um for a virtual reality and augmented reality   so you you can get pretty good use out of it  there are a lot of scripts that come with it a   lot of prefabs that come with it scripts if  you're not familiar with those are they're   going to be essentially a c sharp code that  you can use to add functionality to your app   and then prefabs are going to be what unity you  can refer to as game objects that you can use   over and over again without having to create new  objects with a bunch of configurations essentially   the prefabs have all the configurations on them  that you might need so mrtk is super helpful   and there are instructions here and documentation  for how to get started with that frank if you   could share the getting started with mrtk  link for everyone at home the import right   the very first one getting started with  mrtk oh yeah yep so that'll take you   here to this page that i'm currently on  right now and this is where um you can   learn more about mrtk more important this is where  you can come and actually download the package   and so on documentation it says where you  can get the latest mrtk unity packages   for what you do on a day-to-day basis for example  um of just building you only need that foundation   package and that's the only one that i'm  importing into what we're building today and   there's a link here that says to go to the mrtk  release page and then on there is where you can   get the packages from so keep that in a safe  space i mentioned earlier i have a unity folder   where i keep all my unity stuff in that folder  i have a packages folder and that's where i keep   all my packages so that way i don't have to go  back to websites and redownload them ever again   unless they get upgrades of course so  make sure that you go there to get that   and then now frank you can share the the other  one the import um okay yeah i'm busy yeah   i gotta keep you on your toes so for that one  is um importing is that's what i just said right   so oh now i'm forgetting what that link looks  like but that one should take you here yeah and   i think so let me see now i forgot where that  link goes to one second okay that mess slash   it's a two initializing your project and first  application oh i was in the right place okay   cool thank you so yeah this is that page and  then as you come down as i mentioned earlier   there's that mixed reality uh toolkit area which  is right here and these are the instructions for   how you can get the mixed reality toolkit into  your project so you can follow those instructions   i'm just going to quickly walk you through  that on the screen though here in unity and   i already have it so i don't need to re-add  it but you would go to assets import package   custom package and then from there you'll  get a file explorer window that'll pop up   search for wherever you have or navigate where you  have it installed and or where you have it saved   and then once you find that import everything  in there and then now we're at the point where   we're here in the in the actual unity scene and  we're going to do everything else here on camera   so the first thing that you'll do um is  you're going to need to add it to your project   you'll notice here that it's been added to  the menu before it wasn't there now it's here   because we added it you'll click mixed reality  toolkit and then you're going to click add to   scene and configure over here in the hierarchy  you'll see that it's been added uh typically   or just really always whenever unity starts in  the project the directional light object and   the camera object are added by default when you  add in the mixed reality toolkit we're actually   taking that camera and we're placing it inside one  of these two objects so it's not that the camera's   gone we just move it inside one of these um  one of these uh parent objects if you will   let me switch to the scene view there we  go all right so once you have that in here   let me make sure i'm at the right next place  we're going to set some configuration profiles   and so in unity we i guess with mixed valley  toolkit we have configuration profiles   that have been created to help with configuring  settings based on what you're building for   so i'm building for hololens too and if you come  to the mixed reality toolkit object and then here   this will this is where you can find the  configuration profiles if you click that drop down   as you can see we have six different options to  choose from by default we um we set it as the   default mixed rally toolkit configuration profile  but we also have ones for hololens 1 hololens 2   leap motion and then xr sdk c or xr sdk so you  have some options um as well what we suggest to do   is to find a profile that's as close to whatever  you're building for um i think the obvious here   is that um if you're if you're creating for  a different platform these aren't going to be   a 100 match for exactly whatever configurations  you need but if they pretty much meet most of   what you need but there's some changes that need  to be made no fear selected because you can change   the profiles by cloning them so i'm actually going  to have to do that for what we're creating today   so since i use the hololens 2 i'll switch  to the hololens 2 configuration profile   notice here in my game view it's now black  before i had the the similar look that we   see here in scene but for the hololens 2 um it's  going to have you this this black game background   um now once you have the device on um you don't  see black because you can't see black with the   device at all actually um typically it's like a  super duper dark like gray color but um so this   will change that background to black and then  for this particular project that i'm creating   what we need to do is disable the microphone from  starting automatically so if you have or haven't   used the hololens 2 before it comes with cortana  and cortana is our voice assistant that we have   with our um our microsoft products if you will so  she does come with the hololens and you can use   voice to interact with her which is super helpful  but if you're building an app that also uses voice   it's not the most helpful because you want to  ensure that the mic is only starting when you need   it to and not necessarily on at all times whereas  cortana could pick up and whatever you're saying   and then it takes away from the functionality so  with that said we're there's some settings we need   to change in the configuration profile for that  so since i have this hololens two one here one   thing that i mentioned earlier is that you have to  clone it you can't um come in here and change our   default settings uh but you have you can clone  them and then you can manipulate the clone to   your liking so by cloning you'll click this clone  button you'll get a pop-up that says clone profile   you can give it a new name you can change you  can decide where you want to save it i usually   just leave it at whatever profile name it gives  me and then i click clone and then once i do that   um i don't know what just happened up there  that that just moved oh there we go so now it's   been cloned and down here i can actually change  um settings now before i couldn't do anything   and so what we need to do is find where  the mic is and that's going to be an input   so here i click on the input now i have the input  settings notice that they're grayed out because   again you can't change our default profiles but  in here there's a profile within a profile so you   would click clone same as i said before clone it  and now i have access to the input system settings   and then towards the bottom we have one that  says speech and then in here as you can probably   guessed it you'll clone that one again and now  once you've cloned that you have access to come in   here and change these settings and what we need to  do is change the start behavior and so we're going   to make that manual so now the the microphone  itself will start when we manually start it   the other thing i'm going to change in here um  just because i find it to be um it gets in the   way when i'm demoing how to do something but  i would suggest keeping it enabled if you are   um building something actively it's going to  be the diagnostics toolbar so before i get rid   of it i'll show you what that even looks like  and i promise we will start building the app in   a second there's just setup that you have to do i  know you're probably wondering like this is a lot   well like you know now it's recorded so we can  watch it yeah exactly 30 30 uh 33 times if we want   exactly so uh what you see here is the diagnostics  wait a second i will remove my picture because i'm   hiding on what you're showing let me move it up  zoom um i don't know if i can oh i can't i just   disappear you're fine okay no problem all right  so that's a diagnostics toolbar um the reason why   i say i like to get rid of it when i'm showing a  demo of something is because it can start blocking   holograms and then you can't see it but if you  are building something and you're iterating over   it definitely keep this um keep this active so  you can just see how the performances of your app   but i just wanted to just show that um before  i remove it so you're not just wondering like   what did she remove so um you can show your face  again frank you can come back oh people were happy   all right so um to disable that we have  a diagnostics area here and then i can   uncheck enable diagnostic system and now that'll  be gone when we press play again so the moment you   all have been waiting for is to now get started  with building this because our project is now all   set and ready to get started so the first thing  i'm going to do is create my scenes and if at any   point i need to make something in terms of like  give something a little bit more real estate on   the screen just let me know um i don't think i  can zoom in on unity but i can try to move some   things around and make screens a little bigger  as best as i can yeah i could i should have uh   i use a zoom-it tool you can get that control one  and uh zoom whatever you want you could pause and   then draw on it i will share with you that with  you after you could do it internatively also on   windows i think with uh the windows key and  then plus but then i'm always i use a 60   keyboard so i'm always getting stuck to getting  out of that mode after so that's why i kind of   i'm using my little tool with control one  yeah i think i yeah i think i tried that   with the windows key plus once while in unity and  then all of a sudden my internet explorer or my   um internet explorer my um edge interface got all  weird i don't know how youtube were connected so   uh share share with me the tools you use um later  so that way i can uh i can i can give those a try   i'll also have one of those special keyboards  so who knows what might be configured as what have you seen my keyboard while i'm here ah  oh it's nice oh that's beautiful i can't just   just wait a second i will i will move you in a  bigger uh so we can all enjoy your show it again there we go oh it look like um   i'm always told it's like lipsticks okay  like a sampler of lipstick and then like   if someone just like chopped them yeah that's  super cool oh no now mine is not sexy at all   mine is like this oh i like it though  it's like that is your glasses people   saying like oh like no nothing no no  i'm a cheater because i have all the the letters are and on the  side gotcha i like yourself   i like the colors blue is my favorite color so all righty so um the first thing that i am  going to do is add the scenes for this so this   particular app if you will has three different  scenes you have a main menu you have a french mode   and an english mode and so here in assets we're  going to come to um our scenes folder and honestly   let's save the scene that we have open already as  one of the scenes we can go to save as and then   let me navigate over to scenes and we're going to  call this main menu we'll keep it all as one word   all right so we have one scenes down we need to  now um create two more sorry i i was all reading   the chat people love your keyboards i will put  back your your uh your your screen oh thank you like oh my god that keyboard people love the  the keyboards oh thank you sorry about that   um so what i just did on the screen for you  all because i need to create another one so   i'll walk through when i do the next one but  is uh creating scenes and saving them so so far   i've saved this scene and called it main menu and  then what we need to do is create another scene   and we can go to new scene notice that everything  looks like it's brand new again that's because   it's a whole new scene we're going to add mixed  reality toolkit and since we already created   profiles that has all those settings what we need  to do is come to the drop down and then we need to   huh i thought they'd be here let me see i might be wrong we'll just set  them again take you off go to input   should be one here it is yep so every time  you create a new scene you will need to   go back and reconfigure each scene for the  correct configuration profile just a heads   up so the second scene we're created we're going  to call this one french mode save that in scenes   oops i'm not typing all right and then we need one  more using and we're going to do the same thing   we just did so oh no they were up here i just  missed it when i looked at it earlier um input let me see where i am okay so this seems to be  right and okay cool all right so we're gonna   save this one as english mode all right and then  we're going to go back over to the main menu   and we can do that by coming to assets to our  scenes folder and just click on that and that'll   open the main menu back up now for each scene you  need to be able to switch back and forth to all of   them the only way you can do that in unity when  you are in play mode is to have all the scenes   added to your build so over on file you'll come  to build settings and at the top here where we   say where we have scenes and build you're going to  add the open scene which in this case is main menu   and then you're going to go to french  and you're going to do the same thing   add open scenes and now it adds it as number  two and then you're going to go to english and   add that to this scene all right now we head  back over to the main menu and as you saw in the   demo that i did earlier if you may have missed it  there's two buttons and each of those buttons will   take you to one of the two different modes so in  the main menu what we need to do is add a button   for each of those options now as i mentioned  earlier with the mixed reality toolkit there are   prefabs available that you can use so that way you  don't have to create these objects from scratch   we're going to add some buttons and so if i head  back over to the mixed reality site you don't have   to share this this link frank because i gave  the link to the main site already but i will   just direct people where they can go to find it in  future overviews there are some ux building blocks   and then if you click on button that's where you  can get the the buttons um or view the buttons   that we have with the mixed reality toolkit and  there's instructions on how you can um use them   create your own custom buttons but the reason that  i'm here is just to show you what they look like   in unity you can also see what they look like as  well we do have some check boxes some toggles as   well we even have some hololens one style for  example we have pressable buttons so we have   a lot of buttons basically that you can use now  where are those buttons they're going to be in the   folder path that we see here in documentation and  i'm going to navigate to that um and use my memory   to make sure that i go to the right so place  could always search for them but if you go to mrtk   and if you were to go to sdk features ux prefabs  i wanna say and i always get this wrong let me see   look i missed a place ux interactable prefabs i  was almost there interactable and then prefabs   and here are all the buttons um in my view i like  to just see the names of them but if you do scroll   this over you can actually see what they look like  and i am going to use there's a hololens 2 style   that's like a longer rectangle and so that's the  one that i'm going to use if we turn that around   you can see it there so for this one i am going to  drag it where'd it go i'm going to drag yeah you   have a question yeah sorry no you're fine i should  have like a thing um so we have a question from android the setup seemed pretty straightforward  in detail but can we have custom ui within the   mixed reality toolkits um if possible could  you give me a little more explanation exactly   of of what of what that would entail i  want to make sure i answer that correctly so i'll um just continue we'll let you know  yeah let me know and then i'll get to that as   fast as i can um so now that we have this button  i'm just going to drag it here into the scene   and if it's highlighted if you  put your cursor over here on the   scene view click f on your keyboard it'll take  you right to it and i'm going to just turn it   around so we can actually look at it so here's  our first button and you might be noticing that   you don't see it in the game view that's because  um your headset is placed or the camera is placed   at origin which is going to be zero zero zero  and at the moment um this button is on the z   axis which means your this button is basically  sitting in your head if you have on the device   so what we need to do is push that back a  little bit what i would first suggest doing   is resetting the transform first to make sure  everything's at zero zero zero and then let me   bring that over so that's even and then here  on the z axis i like to set things at a point   five and as you can see now we can see it down  here in the game view and i'm not even hiding it so perfect um oh like built up  from a figma or a design tool um that is a good question i'm not 100 sure  um that would be something though that   i would probably have to ask a mixed reality  team to be 100 honest with you with regards to   if the mixed value toolkit um could you have  a custom ui within the mixed reality toolkit   um i'm assuming feel free uh zadduck100 to  ask you see your april twitter just under   our video feed just ask her on twitter and  she will make sure to ask and let you know   or something like that yeah um so we have  this first button and then let me just   zoom in on so you can see it and so this  particular first button we needed to say   um we need to add a label to it right now it just  says button title label label and as i mentioned   before with our prefabs we have scripts attached  to it we have all the configurations you could   ever need we have sounds attached to it so that  way if the user presses it it'll make a noise so   you don't have to actually worry about accounting  for that on your own but you're more than welcome   to switch that out one thing we're going to switch  out is what the label actually says so for this   first one um we have this button config helper  and that's brand new if i'm not mistaken with   the mixed reality toolkit this is where we'll come  and we'll rename it and this one's going to say um   english mode and then that's say button we're  actually not going to use this in this game but   what um what you can use that for our speech  commands because you don't have to use your hands   to press buttons um or just interact with buttons  if you will you can also use uh voice as well   but we're not going to configure that for this  particular um project the other thing that i will   change is going to be the icon instead of having  that that um that bounding box cube which is what   you see there now i'm gonna put the little hand  symbol just to indicate that you press this so   now that we've done that we can duplicate  it by doing uh ctrl d we have a second one   and the second one we want to name that  one uh french mode but before we do that   one thing i will do is just spread them out  and rename so the first one is english mode   second one is french mode and this  will just help me know what's what   french mode we are going to spread on the x-axis  to the right a little bit that come on back   and we got to change the name of  it still to say french and then   english we'll make this one on the right there we  go and so french mode again you can come in here   rename it to french mode and we'll change  the oh the icons already correct so   we have two buttons one say french mode one  says english mode now we need to add some   functionality to them so that way we can  get back and forth to all the different um   all of the different scenes but i think what i  will do is i'm looking at where we are in time   i'll add in the button functionality to  switch between all the different screens   after we get through the french scene first so  you can see how you can switch back and forth   because we're here for azure so let's look at  the azure component but from the main menu this   is how you come in and add those buttons so  we're going to work on the french mode and   let's save this scene and we'll hop over to the  french mode let me go to my scenes and do that all right so in here notice we don't have  anything in this french scene because we   haven't added anything yet um but we are about to  add everything in here so as you're creating this   what i would suggest doing is doing one first and  then apply to all the other ones um i had a lot of   trial and error with creating this and so i found  that to be the best way to go about doing this   um what we'll be using is the  azure speech to text and so that is   um if you ever want to see more about it we do  have documentation over on our um within our uh   docs on azure speech attacks i don't have a link  for you to share for this one frank but one thing   i wanted to show is that if anyone wants to just  test it out um we do have the ability for you to   do that in the browser without having to pull it  over into whatever it is that you're building so   we do have languages that you can try out as well  and you speak and we'll give you the transcription   from speech to text so that's just that fyi if you  want to try it out and here the first thing that i   need to do is i guess explain how azure  speech detects even works in this game   what i am doing is um i'm having the microphone  pick up whatever that utterance is and then   that utterance goes to azure in the cloud and then  azure then takes that utterance and transcribes it   to text and then what we get back will be a  string for example and then in my particular game   what i am doing is validating that that string  that's returned is equal to whatever string i set   in the unity editor for whatever the french word  is so that's how it's working um there's other   ways you can incorporate this into whatever you're  building as well but in this particular experience   that's what i'm doing so the first thing that  i would do is create that flash card um that i   mentioned and i like to keep since i know i need  like a bunch of them i think it's 12. i like to   keep them all organized in one folder so the first  thing i would do is create an empty game object   and name this one flash cards and you'll reset  this one at origin and you can put it 0.5 back   you can't see anything because it's empty  so there's nothing right there right now   but what we will do is add some children to  it now my flash cards are made out of unity   primitives and the unity primitives are going to  be the different 3d objects that comes with unity   in my case i use a cube so what i'll do is come  into flashcards and i'll right click 3d object   and cube and right now you can't see it and the  reason being is that one is at origin and then   two it's massive right now so if i were to just  push that back for example now you can see it   but it's too big um keep in mind that with unity  these dimensions are in meters so that's going   to be a pretty big cube i like to break them down  to about a point 25 um for uh for for the sake of   what i'm usually building if i'm testing something  i think for this one though i um i think yeah   i have them about this size and then meter you  said yeah so one is like a one meter and okay wow   so like if you're going in details and stuff  like it must be super tiny little numbers   yeah you'll have to get smaller and so for what  i the ones that i did i think usually my my the   one i picked i usually go with for scale is um was  the 0.25 so that gets it significantly smaller to   that size that you saw but one time i had created  um like saturn a saturn like the the planet model   brought it into unity didn't change the scale and  as soon as i put on the device it was like massive so keep keep that in mind if you're working with  something well i'm sure it was smaller than the   real saturn though smaller than the real saturn  yeah definitely smaller than a real one um so now   that we have that the other thing that we need  to do is make it a little thinner because um we   wanted to like a card so even though 0.25 is like  my default scale size i like to make it a little   longer so we have a little more space like a  rectangle um we'll keep it in terms of the height   where it is but the z-axis if i turn this and move  the camera over where's my mouse you'll see here   this is what it looks like from the side we need  that to be thinner so you can bring in that z-axis   oops other direction maybe yep till the point that  it's thin i'm not good at this doing it that way there we go that's done enough so now that  we have that um let's add some color and then   let's add some azure so the first thing for  color um just like as we have prefabs mrtk we   also have some standard materials materials are  going to be the colors that you can add and so   in this case um i can type in standard i  think it's mrtk standard if i search for it yeah oops if i can spell standard there they  are so as you can see here i have some colors   and i chose blue when i did mine so i can just  drag that to the cube and now i have a blue cube   so the cube's all set and good to go the next  thing that we need to do is add a canvas so   we can add some um some text to it and that's  going to be where that card um where the the   text for the flash card is so what i would  suggest doing from here is creating a ui   text text with text mesh pro and that gets creates  the canvas by default and then you also get this   text object as well and so right now um by default  it says new text you'll want to change this   now when i was finding french words um i actually  have a notebook where i was keeping all my french   words i want to know where i put it i thought  i had it right here ready for me to show and   tell and i know i can't find it okay so i had his  notebook and it's full of like french words but   when i started learning on duolingo and so this is  what i consulted for figuring out like what to use   so if you um if you're doing french in my case uh  if you know some french words great for this one   we'll do maison which will be house the intention  here would be that you would have to say it   no let's do it the other way let's put  house and then the user has to say maison   so now that's des house notice that we can't  see it up there um i forgot i need to convert   this to mrtk canvas i'm probably going to hate  that i just did that but i know that there's   some settings i need to change so bear with me  on this because this part i'm not really good at   my sense of direction is not the best with uh at least because like there's a lot of money an  option and drop-downs and a text box yeah oh and   i think i just messed up one of them i know that's  right and then this i need to reduce the font and   one anybody in the chat to already play with  the unity uh toolings just by case oh yeah   yeah if so definitely let me know your tips or  tricks because this is my least favorite part   um let's see where is this okay it's far okay you  might have to do a little cheating because this is   the part that i don't like too much um canvas let  me convert to unity let me take off the settings   that i just did i can do it control z because i  want to get that back over on here there we go   there we go we'll leave it here for now um because  i just want to get the functionality out so you   can see how to actually build it um so you have  your canvas you have your text that's here now and   then the next thing that we need to do is uh add  the actual script itself and this is going to be   probably the one of the more more important parts  now if you um have never used the speech attacks   and anything in unity never fear because we have  documentation on how to do it so if you um frank   if you could share the what was coming i know  it's called aka dot ms slash unity speech to text yes all right so this particular tutorial is a  really great start and it's actually what i used   when i was learning how to use speech in unity um  you can choose your programming language of course   if you're using unity you will use c sharp but as  you scroll down make sure you select unity as your   target environment and there's instructions  for how to get started with everything with   speech most important though is this script and  this is what you'll need um and that's what i'm   using as well and i'll walk you through that  so with that we just get ready another raid   so welcome raiders from crazy four pie 3 14 hello  everyone welcome we're having fun building uh   french english learning in unity mixed reality  yes all right so let's create a script for this   oh we need a button i forgot that quick um  because we need a button so we can actually   press a microphone so let me create that by  creating just an empty game object for that   and this essentially would hold all  of our buttons i would highly suggest   uh doing that and then in here we're going  to add a circular button which is what i used there we go see if i can find it really  quick there we are and then add that to that one second i want to change  something all right mommy drag that okay so we can see that here in the  game mode um let me bring it down a little bit   on the y-axis and it looks small i actually kept  it small in the game that i did because i didn't   want these massive buttons because i was trying to  do a grid of all the flash cards um if i want to   make it bigger there we are and when you do this  make sure that box collider also gets adjusted um   that box slider is going to be important because  that's how you determine where you're actually   pressing the button if you don't modify that  you'll keep pressing buttons and wondering why   it doesn't do anything um and then by default if  you do change it it'll probably ask you to fix   the bounds as well so you'll click those buttons  fix that that'll just adjust it properly to the   appropriate size so we have this button now  and we can now that we have that we'll leave it   but we needed that in order to actually press  for the microphone ah one more thing i want to   change and that's at a microphone icon there we  go all right so back to creating the script for   the actual um azure component so we're almost  using azure right almost so here in assets um   i'm going to create a new folder called scripts  and i'm going to have that hold all of my scripts and then in here i'll right click i'll click  create and then c-sharp script this one's i'm   going to call speech and i'm going to call it  speech fr for french and then unity then creates   that script there's some code that's added to it  by default which we'll use um once it's done once   it has created it we will open up visual studio  and we'll do some coding to set that up this   part can sometimes take a moment just give it a  second but once it's ready you'll see here in the   inspector since i have it highlighted what that  script looks like that's what it by default gives   you um but once this loads and opens in visual  studio we'll be ready to start with some coding questions yeah does it work also with visual  studio code or you need the big visuals to zoom   you know visual visual studio as far as i know  um in the tools documentation that we have that   is what we um what we ask of you to  use that's one of the requirements   i have not personally tried reconfiguring to make  it use visual studio code instead so i i can't   speak to that too much but visual studio is is is  what you'll need if you are linking the two now   i do know that for other folks who might work in  unity and create and do scripting and such visual   studio isn't the only one that you can use um  you have more options but if you're doing windows   mixed reality you'll need visual studio well i  know it's really easy from visual studio there's   a like a module you check when you install it and  like you got the unity module i was just curious   you know if if you could because it's you know  code and maybe you can edit that maybe you cannot   create the project but they did the file whatever  yeah um i have no better idea the experience will   definitely be better on visual studio id the big  one ah yeah i will say for me personally before   getting started with any unity i'd never use  visual studio i've always used visual studio code   so this was definitely um a learning experience  last year when i got started with this   um but now i feel like i feel better using it now  100 but you know you can only hope for so much   all right so um we'll show you a great teams  and then you will fall in love with it okay cool   then so um unity gives you three different  um three different usings or libraries here   but there are some more that we need  to add uh the first is going to be   ah i forgot to import something frank  oh no i'm sorry everyone i just realized let me make sure i don't need to do  it nobody said anything so you're fine   you should actually pretend it was on purpose  shut up we need the sdk we can't we can't use   it without it so um make sure you import  that into your project that's important um   let me click open there and import that that is  something you can also get from that documentation   the link that you just shared prior um for how to  create this in unity i hope this doesn't take long   because usually it likes to lag but in any case  um okay it's going this is something you will   need if you want to use this library so you just  import all of it and extra worst case scenario if   it doesn't go fast that's okay because i have one  that's already created and we can go with that one almost done it's going crosstalk   always blah blah i always wonder what do they do with the the  all the steps in between where it's like halfway   made meals and it's like do you finish cooking  them do you do you just throw it away i always   wondered that yeah you like that the one that  you could like for 10 minutes because they put   it in the hoven and then like i don't know yeah  like that you know the tech team around the the   those people doing the food like they must be  starving because they smell everything and like   you see that food i'm like can i have it can i  yep i feel like that's that's how i would feel   all right let's give this another minute and  extra worst case scenario if this takes longer   i'll open up the other unity project where we  have it already because now we have about just   a little bit less than 20 minutes alrighty  yeah times fly i know but you're having fun yeah i know all right so this is taking its time let me i  would say you're really impressing like you go   in there like it's a it's nothing like and i'm  lost in all those menus and things you're just   like yeah you go there you're good like i can tell  you i was also lost when i first started all right   i think what i'll do is uh let me open the other  unity project where it's already created and then   what we can do instead is actually walk through  that setup and that'll actually be much quicker   oh unity froze on me it's okay let's close that and  then i'll open the other one i'm like almost afraid to click control alt  delete and then i mess up something in that   process but we might have just in case i will call  you back all right let's try to shut down unity there we go oh look like it just finished  as soon as i closed it too that's okay   were you about to say oh i was just saying  that's one nice thing with the skype compared   to teams when you're using it to stream is  if for some reason you lost the connection   yes skype will rejoin automatically  ah that's good to know   because yesterday some people were asking why  we're not using teams and we're using skype   uh and like i don't know like i know that's one  of the difference i i didn't even try like the   the the instruction i had the like the walk  through and set up was done with skype so i   just follow and use skype yeah but uh people were  surprised we're not using teams saying yeah no no   no we use team just not to to stream yeah that's  not the stream yeah i'm sure it will come so   yeah so once this opens um what i'll do since i'll  walk through the setup in the actual version that   i demoed because everything already there is as  it should be and we'll take a look at some code   and i will also um i will also walk you through  different gotchas that i figured out along the way   and to the point that's in the chat they need a  high-powered gpu to get any project done i will   definitely say if you're working with anything  with unity um you you definitely need some power   with with uh with in terms of just your your uh  with your computer and your specs you definitely   need something that can uh withstand all  that unity does i when i was streaming   um i was talking to you about this recently  frank when i was streaming and doing unity   my laptop did not like it if my laptop want to  die with and i haven't i have a nice machine   uh yeah if you want to die with just like  visual studio and the streaming tools like   running on top of that unity that is a kind  of a big monster yeah of course you need   to pc setup all right it just opened let me  drag it to the other screen for you all and so stream uh you cannot paste any url  but if you uh if you paste just   like the the name your you want will will  be able to to see it ah no problem like it's   a rule in the but like you you don't get the  bad point because of that it's just for safety urls are not allowed all right so you can see my lovely unity screen  this is the actual game in all its glory once   it's done and let me start by opening up the  this one because i named them all crazy names   when i was building it as one does when  they're trying to make sure something works   um we'll walk through that script where  you can actually do the functionality   and once visual studio opens i'll  walk you through what that's like   all the other scripts that i have in here beyond  the visual beyond the uh the one used for azure   is what i use to control the score increasing  the time decrementing um switching between the   scenes but the one that matters most is this  speech one that we're going to open up and we're just waiting for visual studio to open it  there we go as soon as i said it it popped up   let's say what what is it like you said  three times like uh the candy man mhm a lot of time when you say docker three times  on a twitch then rubber tables could show up   oh yeah i can believe that i can 100 believe that do you know robert  tables i sure do he actually went my very   first stream i ever did um before actually  joining twitch but i was streaming with um   with twilio at signal and he helped moderate  that session yeah visual studio what's going on yeah it's there but yeah you see it just thinking   yeah there we go i was trying to it's not  responding i was trying to get it over to my   other screen really quick because i have something  in it that i need to well apparently rubber table   upgrade it's not even just docker now you can  if you use containers oh that that i didn't know   he showed up on my stream the other day it was fun and i think he was com not  complaining but it was uh you know how like all your name has a  different color and whoa did we last you hmm   the pc is working very hard okay you're just slagging a lot probably  your pc is working really okay you're back i was alone for a little while so clearly april pc is working really hard  thinking about visual studio and unity and   everything so like she's looks like she's  here as public oh oh am i really lagging   okay i think now you're good am i  yes okay i will shut up just go okay   all right so there's a couple of variables that  you want to create because you want to be able to   modify these values over in the unity  editor so you create these as public   um the first one is going to be that button  that needs to be pressed for the microphone   the second is going to be whatever that output  text is so that output text is going to be what   azure sends back to us as the transcription of  whatever was said um the next one is going to be   the flash card itself and then the next one down  we have you know i can actually zoom in on here   can i control plus or ctrl shift plus  yeah uh it's not letting me do that one or do you have a in the because i don't  see it because of the picture but in the   bottom do you see like a little zoom in  visual studio yes where you see a line   7 or something like that character 14 is  there a little plus over there i don't window maybe i can zoom this and i spend a lot  of time in the light no code come on open open but you know what because i know how to save the  day i already recreated this in visual studio code   and i can zoom in on that screen so what i'll  do is show the version and visual studio code   because i always have a good backup and i can  actually zoom on there i just hate when people   show code and then it's like i can't see  a thing so let me switch to visual studio   that's where i was keeping all my code notes here  we are all right this looks better now i believe oh yeah it's nice okay cool so this is hopefully  better for everyone at home i was lower   left there's a person attention drop down i knew  there's uh some mouse clicking possibility also in   visual studio gotcha all right so we can see this  better now i'm gonna go through this in the seven   minute set i have um but it's a short script so  it's not really long starting off we um actually   forgot to mention this there are some libraries  that you need to ensure that you do include here   we have some usings one is a cognitive services  speech the other one is going to be tm pro   and then also you need to ensure that you  include the um mixed reality toolkit ui as well   so you'll make sure you have those added and then  the thing i was saying before i switched over here   is that there are some some variables that you  want to be able to modify through the unity editor   and so those are created as public we have a  pressable button that's going to be the button   that you press to start the microphone you assign  the button game object to that we have the output   text so that's going to be the text that comes  back from azure and we have a object created   for that which is going to be a text object we  have the flash card and that's going to be that   cube that we started creating um you'll assign  that and then we have the string which is um   the word and so here that's what you want them  the um that's what that's what the word should   be and that's how we validate whether or  not the person said whatever it was correct   so for example if the card said house  and then in this word field i put maison   then when azure gives us back that string of me  saying maison in french it checks that that maison   matches whatever this string is and then that's  how we validate so that was my like cheap way of   doing the validation and i can show you the unity  editor in a second uh the next one we have then   is um because i have scoring added in here i  reference some other scripts that i created and   so this private one here is referencing that score  script so that's not needed for creating the azure   component here um the next thing that we have i'm  not the best at explaining what's happening here   with threadlocker because that was something that  was new to me again i just started c sharp late   last year so that's something that i would need  to look up more of what that is but essentially i   can tell you what's happening down in the methods  at least where that is um we also have a boolean   that's waiting to see if you're waiting for the  recording we have the message that comes back from   azure and then i have this bull once here as well  that's going to be used in the unity update method   to make sure that it's not um telling the user  every single frame that they got it right because   that would be like really annoying the way that i  had set up the uh to debug what was happening so   down here you need to ask the user for permission  and so you touch something with your sound no can you hear me yeah i can hear you just like  you're you sound far away is it only me chat   oh i don't know let's continue though  because we we have not like we can hear   you we we just need to clear okay now  it's better alrighty so the mattress   so um i also have something here um a bull to  confirm whether the mic permission has been   granted so when you're creating experiences you  don't want to start off with automatically picking   up the user's mic um that's not a really great  ethical way to build products or apps or such   you do need that permission and so when you start  the app up it will ask for your permission if you   can use your mic and so assuming that permissions  have been given then you can actually use the mic   in this experience the first thing that we have  here is the awake method now this is going to   be called when the script is first loaded and this  is what i use to when i reference the uh the score   script to increment the scoring down below we  have the button click this actually comes from the   documentation that i had frank share a moment ago  for how to create this and so the first thing that   we need to do is um do the configuration and so  from here you will need to insert your um well you   need to create an azure resource for uh the the  speech service and you're going to insert the key   as well as the region for here and then below that  we have um the speech recognizer that we're using   and when you set up that when you set this up this  is where you can actually specify the language   that um that it should use for the speech  transcription by default it does english   so keep that in mind if you go to use the um  if you go to use this particular service and   you're wondering why you're speaking another  language and it does all the transcriptions   and it doesn't understand what you're saying  you need to specify the language itself so   in my case it's french and in our  documentation that's going to be fr   fr and then down below um it's waiting for  the recording and then as we keep going   um once this is no longer waiting for the  recording that's when it actually does it's his   whole azure magic and it'll send whatever you said  up to azure and then it'll come back if it doesn't   recognize what you said then it'll give you this  message that the speech cannot be recognized   if you cancel then it's cancelled and then down  here whatever that new message was that came back   from or whatever that message was that came back  from azure it becomes whatever new message is   and um from there we have our start method and  this start method is called before the first   frame update immunity unity gives you this  when they create this template if you will   and so um this is checking whether uh you actually  added objects to those um to those variables that   we created that you can modify through the unity  editor so that's super helpful our documentation   this is also used if you're doing for a platform  for android or ios so that's why this is here i   didn't remove it because i was afraid but in event  you're using either platform that's there and then   as you go down um we have the update method this  is going to be called every single frame which is   a lot essentially so what's happening down here is  that it's looking for the output text and assuming   that it's not null then it's going to equal  whatever it's going to equal um message and then   in here this is where i confirm whether or not you  said it correct so if that output text is equal to   whatever that word was that i set and if once  it's true once this true is confirming that um   that uh this hasn't this particular action hasn't  occurred yet then assuming you got it right the   cube itself will turn a color which will be  green as you can see um i just highlighted   here that the cube goes from blue to green and  then we have a method here where we're adding a   score and that's going to be in like our score  script and then that once equals fall so that   we don't keep getting that same setup over and  over and over again so that's the azure script um   it's honestly not a lot i mean it's it's 159 lines  but keep in mind that we do have elements in here   for different platforms and so unless you're  using android ios you can ignore those parts   um but it's relatively uh relatively short you can  also do translation as well whereas um i could say   something in english and then it can translate  that into french the scripts are very similar   i would say um there's not much to change there  but that's the beauty of the cognitive services   right you just create an instant and then like  it's just an api it's a black box with something   smart in it and you just call it yes and in your  case sending some you know voice and then our text   and like receiving if it's match it's pretty cool  yeah so that's how i created what you see here um   everything else beyond that is just as i mentioned  before there's scripts that's controlling what's   happening in the game i'm not sure how if you  if you have a quick moment i was just gonna   play this just one quick round one more  time for everyone at home if you missed   the earlier demo of it but um i'm just  going to enter into play mode if it   does it quick enough for me and what i need to  do essentially is say the correct word um in   in french so we'll do this now  in unity here's my little hand we oh i said it wrong oh i'm in the wrong mode frank you must say  yeah i got to say it in english i'm like   why is it translating the english so this  one would be in english yeah so all these   words are in french yeah my wii was good right  was good and your maison was pretty good too   thank you i react when you said maison weir and  people catch that in the chat so that's fine oh dog oops dog push the button there we  go dog oh i heard everything i said dog there we go so i won't play the whole  thing but essentially as you can see this is   a functionality that we just put together if you  push the mic it waits for you to say something   it comes back with the string it validates whether  or not it's correct and then um those different   elements that i mentioned that you can modify  through the unity editor here is i put them on   the canvas component and this is what they look  like let me collapse this so we can get just a   better view here they are so you would just drag  and drop those elements to those boxes and that'll   associate it with it the good news is is that for  those of you who want to recreate this i've had   some people reach out just from seeing me talk  about them on twitter to try it out um i plan   to set time aside next week to actually do a full  write-up of how to go about doing this and putting   it in my github repo so that you can try this out  on your own at home and do whatever it is you want   to do with um with this so by all means take it  and run with it i try to create these projects   as something that's hopefully approachable  for beginners um with as limited scripting as   possible this has probably been the most custom  scripts i've ever done in any project so i try   to try to help out for for those who are getting  started with mixed reality and mrtk and now azure   so yeah that's the project frank how did i do it  it was it's awesome it's awesome and yes i will   let her answer but uh you have your own twitch  channel right yes i do um it's also at vogue   code and good news is that what is it july 7th um  as we head towards the end of this month i'll be   coming back to doing that um my streams on  there i primarily just focus on mixed reality   and doing stuff in unity as we saw today um and  just walking through everything step by step   so definitely subscribe on there if you follow me  on twitter that's usually where i announce when i   am going live so towards the end of towards the  end of july early august i'll be back on twitch   and i'll be sharing all um mixed reality and  mrtk and and you're coming back also two other   time at least that we are that are planned  so folks go in the the schedule down below   there's a section schedule where you will  see the calendar and april is scheduled   there twice so we know she will come back  with more great stuff yes i will be back   it was awesome super very packed of information  i kind of knew it but uh that was awesome   yes yes thank you very much it's uh like yeah  really really good your french is excellent   for the few words i picked at least oh yes thank  you i will say probably maison is actually like   good because in in fashion all of the houses uh  like because it's all like the designer brands   their houses it's amazing yeah and that's probably  why i'm good at that one since i had my fashion   background but uh but yeah thank you duolingo like  makes me practice every single day so uh i'll read   the offer in the on on twitter so i will do it on  twitch anytime you want to chit chat in french yes   yes i'm ready i'm still scared why don't  don't you think i'm scared to speak in english   i was scared for a long time oh no your english  is really good though i i think it's good i   think it's good well thank you a lot for being  with us today it was very interesting i think   people were very happy very uh very different  than you know like just seeing code and stuff   so it's definitely interesting to have that  dimension and see that yes the ui is really   impressive but there's good documentation where  we could follow and get our setup and like if   eventually you have your github repo and we  have we can start with that thing it will be   awesome tomorrow same time same channel will be  cecile and brian clark's learning python oh the   people i like that's interesting i know somewhere  earlier in the chat was mentioning python and on   friday it's uh jason will will be hosting in the  the the guest is uh brian benz and the topic is   where to start when you don't know what was  it again like the it's like how to start   coding when you don't know where to start  something like that yeah i love that topic   it's pretty cool like when you know what you have  in ideas but you don't know where to get started   you want to code like should you whiteboard or  like which language like which where to start so   that's the topic so that will be also very  interesting i'm looking forward that one   and after that anything you want to ask or  not ask but uh say april maybe do you even   so i will put all the links you share with  me in the show notes so on twitch they will   be in the twitch description on youtube  they will be down below anything else   yeah i would just say uh two things one if you are  interested in learning more about mixed reality   with microsoft there is um there's a whole team  beyond our cloud app because our cloud advocacy   team that is a mixed reality team they host  meetups and they um often share when such meetups   are happening i just did one recently with them uh  follow their account on twitter which i believe is   um mixed reality dev hopefully or mr i forget  it's one of the two but um i should look that   up because now i feel bad but i would say if  you're just interested to learn more about   what you can do with um with just windows mixed  reality i would say check them out follow their   account so you know what's happening and then the  second thing is oh it's mxd reality dev that's   how they're uh m m yep d d as in dog yep yeah re  reality dev yep follow that account um if you just   want to be able to attend events and such um and  then the second last thing that i would say is if   you're getting started with mixed reality you're  brand new you don't know what to do that is a-okay   that's where i was last summer and i feel like  i've gotten better i might not be the smartest   and it's always a learning process but have a lot  of patience i would say it takes a lot of patience   and you'll you'll get there um definitely so  that was a the last two things that i had to say   excellence with that i will say to everyone thank  you for being with us this afternoon or today   it was a pleasure we had a lot of fun  and i will say see you next time bye bye
