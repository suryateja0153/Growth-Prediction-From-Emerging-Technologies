 hey everybody its norm from Testim and welcome back to projections where this week where we talking augmented reality cuz happening right now is this year's augmented world expo although it's happening virtually as when i a will actually go to a convention and meet in person but it was at last year's augmented world expo that we got our first hands-on with the end real light these are a pair of AR glasses of an in development and very excitedly earlier this month they haven't launched the pre-orders for their developer kit and n real very generously also was able to send us a pair of developer kits so yes we're going hands-on with the n real light developer kit which is basically their five hundred dollar consumer in our glasses or planning on shipping in the future along with this compute unit which is basically an Android phone equivalent running a Qualcomm 845 processor and it's there for a tethered connection for a our glasses but first of all let's talk about the technology in a our headsets as it stands today since they're a bunch that go into headsets ranging from hololens to things like the magic leap and also headsets like the end green light now magic leap and hololens use a display technology called wave guides we talked about them before where they essentially our manufacturing special optics that pipe light into the actual lenses themselves to then display while the in real light uses a reliable type of display technology called birdbath optics and it's called that because you essentially have two displays on the top here in this very developed form factor and as you can see if you look through what looked like a pair of sunglasses the top part of the lenses here are masked off that's where all the display and lensing optics are so we essentially have our two of these I think Sony displays high pixel density 1080p point seven inch diagonal displays OLED micro displays mounted here that aim the image downward and then if you look at the inside there's a beam splitter right right there see that's how it's angled diagonally right there and so the image goes down it then hits it forward into what's essentially a one-way mirror it's a combiner and that's this lens here and then so light can pass through from the outside world to your eyes as well as that projected image from these two displays into your eyes as well to combine and then you see these essential projections of these virtual objects in your field of view now while they're a bunch of air headsets that use similar birdbath optics style design not all of them are created equal it all boils down to not only the displays that are chosen but also the actual physical design of the optics what types of lenses are being used the placements relatively to other all of the calibration needed to make sure the image you see is then a stereo image project in real space with minimal artifacting which image quality something we'll definitely talk about in just a moment now you also notice that these are basically fixed lenses so there's no IPD adjustment and andriola says that this should be comfortable for anyone within like the 53 273 millimeter IPD distance or someone like me with IPD in the high 60s it was still very comfortable at no headaches no discomfort looking at these images for a long period of time and they do fit over my glasses so I did use them both over my glasses by preferred to use them without my glasses and for me I could still see the images clearly but if you do need a prescription there are inserts that you can then get lenses for that magnetically attached so you can see it clearly if you need glasses let's talk a little bit more about the speed and speeds real quickly because they did manage to pack a lot of technology in this form factor if you look the outside there are a bunch of sensors so of course there is an IMU and accelerometer inside they can very clearly see there are also three cameras on the outside there are two black-and-white spatial cameras with a 120 degree field of view and these look out into the world and do the slam map in do plane detection see flat surfaces walls tables your floor as well as an RGB camera and video camera photo camera it's five megapixel right here I can't tap into that right now with the applications but the idea is then you can also do video capture a photo capture or also hand tracking there is an ambient light sensor right here as well on the inside there's a proximity sensor that turns on and off the display when you put it on and then control wise there are two sets of controls on the underside of these arms you have volume control as well as brightness control and the brightness control doubles as a mode toggle to see the Android menu the home screen versus what's essentially the image piped out and then they're also stereo microphones and stereo speakers all that built into this headset there's no dedicated power here because power is run through this USBC cable which plugs into the compute unit and that's what makes this similar to magic leap in the sense of it's a compute being something that you wear as up on your hip or your pocket as opposed something that's built into the headset that you wear like with a hololens where it's all on your head I actually like this form factor a lot I didn't find this cable get in the way it only the touches over on the compute unit side so it doesn't have a disconnect on the headset side but there makes the headset much lighter than it would be if they had all of the battery all of the compute on the headset this is 88 grams which well most of the hardware is kind of front loaded because of the displays and the optics are still very comfortable to wear while using these demos also on the compute unit you have micro USB for power although data if you want to plug it into a computer to do your development is over that USBC cable or you can do it over tcp/ip over your local Wi-Fi network and on the top here is the controller so it's a three Dolf controller three axis it's not positionally track it's basically accelerometer with you know your standard up-down left-right white control and I think they chose that because then you would also have parity if you plug this into an Android phone running a Qualcomm processor 8:45 or newer select phones because then you use that phone itself as the controller and use accelerometer and the touchscreen on your phone to substitute for this controller so out-of-the-box want to reiterate that this is not the shipping consumer version this is very clearly the developer kits and so there's a lot of the full experience that we're not being able to test or talk about at this time but we can talk about are things like the image quality the optics the ergonomics the general usability what it feels like to wear this for long periods of time as well as the basic demos that come pre-loaded with this developer kit so let's first talk about image quality and a caveat the images that you're seeing right now are captured off of my phone and a handheld camera and it's really tough to capture what you see through the lenses here because you're why they're focusing on the projected image and exposure exposing for the projected image or you're capturing and trying to see the the world around it and there is a big difference because of the tinting required in the birdbath optic design so you shouldn't judge what you see on screen right now as a full and accurate visual representation of the experience of actually wearing this headset because the images that I saw an experience were pretty great that small OLED screen high pixel density at 1080 meant that the images were vivid they were crisp they were sharp the contrast was great I could see fine details I could imagine reading text without any problem when it's within that field of view and these images felt and looked solid the pixel fill was very good with this display now contrast was also good and most of my use was indoors and there are optimal use conditions for displays like this you know a normally lit room with overhead lights whether the daytime or nighttime image gonna look good but stepping outdoors I would try using this in my backyard and right across the street from my house images start to get washed out it's harder to see these projections yeah under the luminance of the sky even though it is tinted a little darker then using it indoors I do think they are in the short term especially with this type of optics is gonna be meant to be use indoors looking at objects in your room on your desk as opposed to on the sidewalk or on the street now feel the view is something which you definitely talk about it's because one of those attributes that we're always cognizant of and we're putting on whether a VR headset or an AR headset we want to see these projected images in their entirety and not have them cropped off or cut off abruptly when we're looking at them and every VR had said every AR headset is gonna have its limitations based on its optical design the same applies here and real saying that their headset has about 52 degree diagonal field of view and much like our experience last year that's good for certain types of imagery certain types of content that you're looking at and it's certain distances so if you're looking at an object that's like yea big and it's you know maybe simulated five feet away from you you're gonna be able to see that entire object but if you want to see something like a projected 100 inch flat screen if you place it within three feet of you you're not gonna be able to see it and there is a certain sweet spot in terms of the distance because the way these optics are the sign it doesn't solve for the convergence accomodation conflict they get stereo 3d through convergence through your left eye right eye seeing different images and then your brain interpreting that as being 3d in a position in space you know a couple feet in front of you but you can't with one eye shift focus as you would with a light field display which is ways away we think in terms of being ready for consumers so there really is a nice sweet spot for the type of images and for the menu options displayed here for a lot of the demo objects whether it's a hologram the person singing or a model of a skull or an exploded diagram of a robot place you know again that three feet four feet away from you on a tabletop surface you're gonna be able to see the entirety of that image but once you get close then your brain tries to focus in places they may not be and also it does the same thing that magically did if you get too close there is a clipping plane where if you get maybe under a foot close ten inches close the model then clips away and it won't show that image which is a reasonable solution right now for these type of displays another thing I notice is that the 60 Hertz refresh rate of these panels well it made the images look solid and locked in place as I was stare at them and kind of move my head around them if I shook my head really quickly I did notice a little bit of smearing of the pixels as a visual artifact and so image persistence while good is not really made for fast movement of the head it's not the same type of artifacting you'd notice with like a DLP display that rainbow effect when you move your head quickly but it's definitely something noticeable here and I think attributed to that 60 Hertz refresh rate but I got a commend and real I think they did a really great job on this optical design and while there are you know minor artifacts that you get with all birdbath type optics in terms of you know very light ghosting in the periphery and depending on how much bright lights coming in from the outside world you see some mirroring of images below you which you can kind of see in this video capture as long as the content you have is clear in the center and the content was very very clear in these my brain just didn't notice any of those artifacts I was focused on the content and the tracking was good enough that the content was really locked solid in place above my floor above tables and the slam was was pretty good I could walk into other rooms come back and images were retained no the one thing was like occlusion I couldn't put my hand over the images and lock that out or go around and so that's something that maybe in software they can improve on in the future ergonomically like I said the 88 grams here did make this very comfortable and it's worth pointing out that you know the sunglasses style design is something that obviously they wanted to go for to make this socially acceptable right we want these AR glasses that you can wear in public that look like sunglasses or wouldn't look necessarily out of the ordinary and that's an interesting design choice because you know microsoft hololens is going completely the opposite way they're targeting enterprise customers they want to below when you're wearing an AR headset when you're wearing a hololens you know you're wearing an AR headset and that could be for comfort so you know that you know whether you're interacting with someone wearing the headset oh they're wearing something there may not need to look at me or they meet have cameras on their headset but also acknowledging that right now AR is being used not in the real world being used in you know defined spaces or people are either in their work environments at home or doing things for industry and you don't have to worry as much about that social acceptance now this design though I think really lends itself to being something that you can take on and off easily and that's I think the biggest benefit of this it wasn't about this blending in and looking like sunglasses I would wear out at the park of the beach we can't even go there right now during about lockdown it's more about the ease of removal and ease of putting long because these weren't glasses that I found myself wearing all day long I wasn't I tried you know leaving them on eating lunch trying to interact with my family while also running through these demos that wasn't really working it was something that I was keeping in the office maybe wearing the living rooms try a couple times and it's something that very easy again super easy to put on pop off and I could see being tethered to a phone or a computer to then pipe that content to hear discrete use like you would kind of use with you know tether list VR headset right now not kind of the same persistence use that you would have with a wearable SmartWatch or even your smartphone it actually going for my smartphone flipping through messages on my iPhone was something that was very very usable with this design I think that was something smart they did as well where they didn't try to have these lenses these optics obscure your entire field of view they weren't trying to go for that there's this expectation that when you put this on you can still see what's below you like I can still pull my phone and look at it and read messages and then switch attention between the imagery on the display here or the imagery on my phone kind of like you would looking at a TV and then going into your phone as well this isn't gonna be replacing smart phones it's gonna be used alongside smart phones I think part of that also is because you know there is the dimming of the outside world through these lenses and because they don't solve for convergence and accommodation when you're focused on the content you're focused on the content not looking through and then reading your computer screen reading through these lenses it's more about the comfort of seeing the projected image while also being aware of your surroundings that's what makes more sense to me for a are in the near term now let's talk about the content because like I said at the top this is not the consumer experience and we don't know what an reals you know operating systems gonna look like what you do get right now out of the box is a small selection of demos when you've loaded up you have the option to change your settings for brightness and volume and then launch into either a loop of demos which you can see right now it's like goes through some examples of what you know tabletop gaming could look like what miniature building could look like what 3d model viewing could look like or holographic projections of you know captured imagery could look like or a projected flat screen tied to your wall those are examples they also had a few demos of things like a cat running around and you can use the three Dolf controller to point around and the virtual cat would follow around and and you know exist in that space and have a little bit of persistence that was pretty neat there was also a demo that but it essentially would look like a Stargate it was very much a Stargate ripoff a portal in the middle of your space and it allowed you to really show the power of the spatial tracking the slam of that portal being locked in you could see the parallax if you move the long left and right side of it because behind the portal was this big space battle and then you could also then yourself walk through the portal and see the space battle as well as again being comfortable still acknowledging the real world around you now and real also this month announced that they are developing their own content and one of that is a kind of multiplayer tower defense game called unreal tower and I was able to load that up though not play with anyone else right now how many people have these and that required a big tracking marker you print out and put on the table and then you got to see this really cool landscape displayed in front of you with AI enemies that then you would you know point your three dog controller and fire at and while the game itself wasn't complete because I wasn't really playing the full multiplayer experience I used as an opportunity once again to examine that landscape examine the 3d geometry detail and I think the Qualcomm b45 processor can do a really good job of rendering really detail environment so reminded me a lot of you know Lucky's tale for the oculus when that first launched that type of visual style and I do think a lot of developers when they're making their Android games for AR glasses will maybe lend themselves toward that style it's pretty cool to see that demo now again there's so many things that we we don't know we're not able to test yet things like hand tracking you know will the field of view of these external cameras be good enough to do skeletal modeling because I do want positional interaction not just the three Dolf controller I think that's suitable for media playing but if you want real interaction with these objects I'm gonna want something else and speed controllers you know there's Bluetooth so will I be able to pair like a gamepad play gamepad games with this what their OS will look like a lot of magic leaps resources was put into developing their lumens OS which was a full skin and AR skin on top of Android and I don't know what n real lanzar for that yep I do think that's kind of essential for the consumer space to make it easy for consumers to browse through applications the side load to configure their settings and also feel like there is a persistent you know interface around you and we don't know what the killer apps will be for for a are just such a wide spectrum of AR technologies and AR experiences and I do think for experience that this headset provides I would love to see an easy way to display 3d model some of the most compelling parts of the demo experience here was be able to walk around 3d models I'd love be able to download things obj files from the internet something skin something textured people just load it in quickly throw it up have it locked into space and then be able to actually examine it and be able to scale up and down I think that's that would be a really neat kind of killer app for productivity and speaking of which I really would love the ability to mirror you know a desktop mirror my PC or a Mac OS desktop and have that not just locked into the headset but locked into space floating in front of you I think that would be an immediate easy way to take advantage of these glasses because the real question is will developers support this and I do think there's potential in this technology for this to be compelling and the price port they're going for at $500 for users will make adoption more easier but you know will developers spend months and months working on games and will gain this be enough to be a killer application for people to pick this up and play for more than just that first time and not sit in their drawer all these are questions to be answered as unreal moves toward their consumer launch hopefully sooner than later but this is super intriguing and I can't wait to have more applications it's a side load on the here the test out we'll be sharing those experiences with you guys in the future for sure so thanks for watching if you have questions about the Unreal Lite things you'd like me to try out please post them in the comments below I want to thank unreal for sending this because super interesting and I can't wait for more people to get their hands on them it's what developers as well to make that content thanks for watching again see you next time
