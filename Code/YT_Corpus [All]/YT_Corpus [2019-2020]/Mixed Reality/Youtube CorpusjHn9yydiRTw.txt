 hey everyone welcome to making designing holograms for those of you who don't know what designing holograms is uh let me tell you a little bit about it so designing holograms is a horizons to application that we just released on the microsoft store that you can get for free right now and this app actually teaches you design mixed reality design concepts that are not necessarily easy to understand if you don't see them but it teaches you these concepts it shows you these concepts and it also allows you to experience them yourself so designing holograms came together as a bunch of a collection of knowledge uh that we have gathered during the last um i would say like six years maybe even more starting from holland's one knowledge that designers started putting together although this application is for holland's too all this knowledge has been like bundled up in order to to allow developers and designers to accelerate their development process because we know how hard it is to design for mixed reality so we put this together um so that you could uh learn with tips tricks recommendations of what to do what not to do so that you can make your apps faster without making as many mistakes as we have all made in the past so let me tell you a little bit about myself my name is daniel escodero i'm the mixed reality academy design lead based here in san francisco and i joined microsoft in the uk in london around four and a half years ago as part of the mixed reality studios where we would do proof of concepts and prototypes for some customers um around europe to name a couple um airbus and volkswagen were one of one of the few and two years ago as a family we decided to move to to san francisco and i joined the mixed reality academy and my role um is a bit of a mixed bag of things but it makes it super entertaining um i i actually uh help and teach developers how to design for mixed reality i also help i contribute to the mrtk and also i give feedback from developers back into the product so we can actually improve our products and address all of those pain points that you guys might be going through like many of you i used to design mobile apps coming from a 2d design world and jumping into full-on spatial computing where everything is now in the world apps are not confined to a 2d screen anymore but they are kind of free and placed in the real world interacting with real objects completely different to what i was used to and this is the most challenging thing about mixed reality development designing them can be very hard as an example through the last few years we've done hackathons and workshops with customers but there's always this ongoing problem that problem is design customers would say i know what the future i know what features to include and how to get those up and running it's code i can follow the docs and the tutorials but the user experience no idea so many features different input options different scenarios and physical environments it's overwhelming so we decided to correct this not only by making improvements to the design documentation but by creating a horrorlands 2 app that would let you experience best practices for mixed reality design so let me show you exactly what designing horograms is it's a visual experience that explains mixed reality design concepts and recommendations it's just you and a virtual teacher taking you through demonstrations of mixed reality design concepts but from a third person perspective and then we let you experience them in your own space so if you've tried designing holograms you might notice that that there's one this one place which is very characteristic of it which is what we call the dollhouse and this is a virtual environment that we use throughout the app extremely protagonistic a very important asset so we need we needed to make sure that it would work great and in every single scenario and this is a dollhouse it's an 80 by 60 by 40 centimeter miniature room that contains the basic elements that most rooms contain like walls lamps furniture a table a tv a chair a rug like kind of like the standard things that you would find in a living room think of it as a small demo room to show all sorts of mixed reality things before the dollhouse actually came to be this this uh super characteristic part of of this application um we thought of this virtual room being one-to-one scale and we thought it would be amazing because like you're looking almost at a real life teacher seeing everything that they are seeing but this brought in a couple problems first of all like most developers will run this app in offices or rooms smaller than this demo room that we are showing you right now so it wouldn't fit and it's very weird to see a virtual room overlaid over a completely different room that might be in different different not only in terms of what furniture you have in there but the actual scale of it and it's extremely odd um also remember that these displays are additive meaning that the entire virtual environment will be overlaid over whatever room the user is in so it can get really confusing with like two tables maybe double couches and other messy stuff and the worst part is that this virtual environment would be heavily constrained by the field of view despite the field of view of the horizon being fantastic it's still very different to not be able to see everything at the same time right so we tried something different we tried this mini version and the result was a fantastic god view of a realistic room where you could see everything that was going on from any angle and all at the same time what you're seeing here is exactly the same content that i was showing you before but all together in this miniature version that's a 1 to 10 scale and the part that surprises me most is that testers as soon as we we tried this out they found it so much more immersive to see the small version that they never toggled back into the one-to-one scale so we decided to actually delete the whole one-to-one version and avoid any extra work required to adapt ui and other aspects of the app that need to change according to the mode you're in so we stuck with the dollhouse at one to ten scale but creating the best solution isn't necessarily the easiest option of course so there were a few challenges we had to face and i'd like to show you some of those challenges so one of the challenges was around text like where do we place titles different segment titles and descriptions so we tried different approaches where we would put the title on top of the dollhouse but this was this was a problem because most people were like almost sticking their heads inside the dollhouse to see the details so they would miss the title below was okay that uh that actually uh works well but the control panel we we wanted the control panel to be um below head height so it would kind of be in the way and also it would restrict the length of the title so we thought okay let's let's see what it looks like if we put it inside the dollhouse and it looked great the only problem here is that it might overlap with holograms and second we wanted these titles to rotate around the dollhouse whenever depending on where the user was standing so the length of the title would become an issue if it was too long and then we thought okay what if we we may actually make this like a store display where it's on the glass like on the window and it worked beautifully so we put it there it has um it has a certain offset from the side but it gives us a ton of length for any title and also it changes uh when you rotate another thing is like what about behavior here so this is the shell behavior so when you spawn when you when you open up an application this is the launcher for playground um and as you rotate it it if the ui rotates around it in order to always face you so we apply the same rule so in the dollhouse if you rotate the dollhouse the control panel and the title will actually shift towards you so it's always facing you always at hand so even if you walk around the dollhouse it will always be facing you and you don't have to like walk back around to where it was before one of the most characteristic features of the designing holograms app is that we used a mixed reality capture of myself to teach and demonstrate these design concepts microsoft has two mixed reality capture studios one in redmond in seattle and the other one is luckily enough in san francisco right next to my office and apart from these two studios we license the technology to other studios around the world like avatar dimension in washington dc and metastage in la also dimension studios in london sk telecom in seoul and volu cap in berlin so instead of me just chatting about mixed reality capture studios let me show you a quick video so you can see what these studios actually do [Music] oh [Music] tomorrow here are a few technical specs about the mixed reality capture studios um the stage of course is is a limited space uh which um has a diameter of more or less eight feet or 2.5 meters in diameter and height it's more like three meters or like 10 feet um it has between 64 106 rgb and ir cameras to actually do the shots um the source resolution is between 4 megapixels and 12 megapixels at a standard frame rate of 30 frames per second it has eight high quality directional mics in strategic places so you can actually record great audio and sound of whatever performance is going on and the lighting is configurable so you can have like standard lighting or try and have it fixed from a certain place in our case we had a standard lighting because we wanted um to have control over the directional light inside the application so once it's captured um the process generates keyframed meshes with normals and textures which can be delivered as an obj file as obj files and png files for further post production or ready for playback as an h264 compressed mp4 file and you can import these files into unity unreal native or web xr and of course depending on those it will run on windows ios mac android magic leap and playstation vr and that's me in the studio um not as a visitor anymore but actually as a performer so let me show you um a couple takes that we did it's the designing holograms app you'll notice that um different parts of the app contain small um uh holographic clips of me interacting with holograms or scanning the environment um and what you see here are six different takes corresponding to those uh to those scenes um where i uh poke a hologram grab something um explore a hologram or look at my hands and these six videos that you see here are actually taken from one of the rgb cameras that feed into the system to create the holographic me and then a couple of days later this is what the mixed reality capture studio hands over to you as a developer it's a special mp mp4 file that contains video with audio and the embedded meshes also they give you a player to analyze the takes and take and test the results like uh the one you that you see here where you can see the normals you can see the um the png files the texture files applied to to each frame and they also give you an engine plug-in in this case it was unity we were building the designing holograms app in unity so you need a special plugin to actually play back these takes at runtime i'd like to show you a couple very cool tricks that you can do with the mixed reality capture technology and this this one is um head gaze adjustment and head gaze adjustment allows you to move a captured person's head but at runtime meaning that you could have a capture face towards a user or like in this case we used it to show a panel with surface magnetism um and how the head con so how the panel can follow the head gaze so what you see here in unity is us moving an empty game object as a target for the head gaze to look at as we move the target from side to side the head of the capture follows that's pretty cool right and we used this trick in a bunch of places inside inside the app avoiding us from actually having to to make new takes um record new captures of of me looking at different positions without necessarily knowing uh where i had to look at this short video shows three tricks we use in many parts of the app the first one is that we use the mesh from a specific frame to replicate the hand visualization effect here we paused the capture playback used just the hands of that frame inflated them and overlaid them to create this hand ripple effect the second one was animating objects to sync with the capture's movement it's a really tedious process of animating and keyframing but the results are great you can now see a capture interacting with non-captured objects like this window and the third trick was blending takes in this video there's two moments where we blend different captures and you can actually see them fade in and out over each other and before implementing this there was this horrible cut between all takes which would actually break the illusion of a holographic video but using the blending between the two now the transitions are really nice and smooth now to talk about the ui creative process i'd like to hand it over to martin wettig an ex-colleague a talented and fundamental contributor to the designing holograms project hello my name is martin i'm a 3d artist and designer and lance team for designing holograms when we started ideating the ui design besides from transporting information we also wanted to show some of the magic and the possibilities that holograms have to offer and simply showing 2d um windows and text boxes doesn't feel right in the 3d world and doesn't show much of the possibilities at hand so right from the beginning we decided to move away from that and make full use of a holographic 3d space at first we started with adding some thickness to the panels and icons in addition to text information still as a user what i see is a text box fancy boxes with images but we are not quite there yet we went further by then making use of the mrtk shaders the mrtk shaders became a really powerful tool and we made use of its stencil features some know it as the portal effect to add negative depth to the panels that means instead of adding elements in front of the text box the icons now appear behind the transparent panel what i see now as a user is something that i just can't replicate anymore in the real world this is where holographic magic started to happen also as a user i don't really like to read i do that a lot already in the physical world obviously icons work a lot better than simple text does so in order to provide an even more powerful guidance i then started creating a set of animated objects and advertise each of them telling a tiny story about what is being done in the respective scenario and how it's being used we worked a little more on the icons and used them at first as panels in our main menu inside the chapters with a beautiful dollhouse the free floating windows didn't really make much sense but as info panels for design tips attached to the sites that worked extremely well finally we tried out the mini portals in the app's logo so we were able to tease some of the topics as well as the visuals at the start so now as a user i get clear guidance and compelling visual storytelling so thank you all for listening and have fun creating thank you so much martin i'm sure you've all been in the situation where you're doing a harlens demo for someone and you ask them what they're looking at what they're seeing and you using your spatial memory you try to guide them through what they're experiencing you know like pointing at the air and or telling them where to look well we took this principle and flipped it so that you could see what's happening on the headset of the teacher but not from their point of view but from a third person's perspective and this provided an excellent opportunity for us to show things that we had never shown before like here the scene origin based on the head position or head gaze and dwell for hands-free interaction a simple press of a button using far hand rays for far interaction a solver with surface magnetism attached to the user's head case the sr mesh of course and my favorites the difference between the the field of view and the field of interest as i mentioned before designing holograms teaches mixed reality concepts but it also allows you to try them in your own room so after some of those explanations we pause and take you out from the dollhouse and into an interactive moment where you can be hands-on and these are some examples like this one showing the details of hand tracking and near interaction this is head gazing and dwelling for hands-free interaction clarifying the hand tracking frame through a mirror moment where you can explore your hands moving into the frame and into the fov we're interacting with hand rays and colliding crystals and showing a simplified heat map based on eye tracking so what's next we have lots of content lining up for the next few months the first thing is that we will be working on hologram behavior the new chapter that will be launched inside designing holograms and for this chapter we'll be working really closely with yoon park to make sure that we give you the best recommendations tips and tricks and help you avoid all the pitfalls that you might encounter while designing your apps we'll cover topics like world locked holograms head locked ones body locked ones hand locked or hand menus billboarding and so on and so on we'll also be posting videos of designing holograms parts on youtube specifically on the harlan's channel actually this app uh was intended to do that initially um both being an app and being deployed as videos so uh it has built-in camera movement to actually be able to record all of this easily uh with with the voiceover and panning of cameras and fading and all that stuff for those of you who haven't uh experienced designing holograms i would definitely recommend getting it from the store on your harlens too download it run through it and and help us make this even better so if you have um feature requests or bugs please let us know um i will share my my information on the next slide and you can easily find it uh just by searching or inside the harlan's 2 collection or the new hollands 2 developer collection which gathers a bunch of apps like surfaces mrtk examples hub playgrounds designing holograms and other ones especially built for developers and of course reach out to me do not be shy let's connect on linkedin send me an email um if you have any like uh bugs or or features that you'd like to request or um or actually chapters that you're interested in learning about please let me know okay i want to thank everyone for listening and i hope you enjoyed it bye
