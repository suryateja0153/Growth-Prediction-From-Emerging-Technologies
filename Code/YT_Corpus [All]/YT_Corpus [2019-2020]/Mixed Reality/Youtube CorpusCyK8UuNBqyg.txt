 [Music] when we consider extended realities for instance this is about creating solutions that can either immerse someone into an artificial environment or augmenting the environments and the experiences that we live in today we like to use the phrase extended realities to cover augmented reality which is a digital overlay on the real world virtual reality which is emerging a completely digital environment and mixed reality where interactions can happen for both physical and digital objects [Music] this is the simultaneous confluence of three domains the sensing of human movement contextual awareness of the physical environment of the xr user and that may or may not include people the digital representation of information and 3d content and these combine to enhance the experience or enable like a superhuman capability i led a team that designed a custom hardware and software vr solution for burn patients called vr care recently we also used ar in an immersive space at room scale for the interpretive gallery at the 2018 mcgreets exhibition at sf moma where visitors only needed to use presence in motion to experience this space we're going to see an emergence of new entertainment experiences new immersive entertainment experiences and that's going to actually that's going to serve as as a way as a way of experimentation right and it's going to allow creative people who may or may not be necessarily familiar with the technology uh to to work with other people who are and to push the boundaries of what it's capable of and and to in a sense socialize it um so that you know it can reach uh more people but fraud we really feel that um you know in this emerging space where you see haptics combined with vr not just for gaming but certain types of training there are a lot of ways in which this is emerging and looking forward we see opportunities for enablement for both consumer and employee behaviors and industries covering retail healthcare finance automotive and manufacturing basically using extended realities to bring immersive environments intelligent overlays in order to speed up work process and connecting people to each other in more natural ways as that technology gets into the hand of consumers we're going to i think see a greater need for emerging us design using that technology and that's going to uh you know as i said before involve you know new ways of approaching the design problem and using new tools to to enable those [Music] experiences
