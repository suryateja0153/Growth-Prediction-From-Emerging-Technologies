 [MUSIC]  What is Azure Mixed Reality Services? Azure Mixed Reality Services is a new set of services that enable developers to more easily build cross-platform, collaborative, and spatially aware mixed reality applications. We've announced two services as part of the set. The first is, Azure Spatial Anchors. Azure Spatial Anchors enables anchor, sharing across devices, and persistence across large spaces, and long periods of time. The second is Azure Remote Rendering. Azure Remote Rendering enables customers to render high fidelity models such as 3D CAD models in mixed reality by streaming rendered frames that are rendered in the Cloud down to the device. Both of these services enable developers to build a whole new set of mixed reality capabilities and experiences by combining the power of the Mixed Reality Edge devices with the power of the Azure Cloud.
