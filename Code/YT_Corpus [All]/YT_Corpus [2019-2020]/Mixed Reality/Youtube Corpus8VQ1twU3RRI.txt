 hi i'm dan marshall and i'm here to show you what my colleague dave brown has built which is an immersive 3d data visualization application so here we've got some tornado data that we're showing sort of in a scatter plot of tornadoes happening in the united states and they're just mapped out onto this map here and the color of the dots that you see here represent the strength of that tornado if we go to another visualization you'll see that these each tornado that's represented by a circle on the screen will get animated to a different location so you see a lot of tornadoes happening all in the same place and as we can rotate this map well we don't really know exactly how many tornadoes are happening in that one place so what one thing we can do is stack them up vertically and now you can see that more tornados happened in this area over here in the Colorado area also in this Florida area as we zoom into this map here you can see each tornadoes as represented as a cube it went from a sphere transformed into a cube onto the screen here going to the next visualization you see the Tornado Alley sort of effect as we take that original scatterplot and cast it into the z-axis in the third dimension by time so that you can see sort of all the tornados happening all at once here and that animation you can see from going from that scatterplot map view into a bar chart view each tornado this animated across the screen so that you see that same data being laid out in a different way according to the way that you the chart that you want to use so in this visualization we see that may is the month with the most tornadoes and you can zoom in to see once again each each tornado there in this visualization we've just moved those tornadoes and now we can see the hour of the day when they happen the most which is around five o'clock in the afternoon and now here we're showing the tornados which year so around 2003 to 2005 we probably saw the most number of tornadoes in that year we have another way of telling stories with data and here what we're going to show you is a scrollable way to navigate through a story with the data on the left and a story on the right now here each square represents a person who was on the Titanic and we've got sort of a page here illustrating that the data visualization that you're seeing on the left and we've cast the data into a class of passenger and here's the crew as we see over here again you see the data animating each each cube representing a person who is on the Titanic animating to across the screen to where it's being laid out in the chart and we here see the most people joined in Southampton there and now we've colored the data by whether or not they've survived so more people died on the Titanic than have lived probably about twice as much so this paradigm of scrolling on the left is just a really easy way to go through and tell each each story of the data so we think this is a really easy way to consume a data story just by a simple scrolling gesture you can go through multiple views of that data with an easy-to-understand way of interpreting what you're seeing thanks a lot
