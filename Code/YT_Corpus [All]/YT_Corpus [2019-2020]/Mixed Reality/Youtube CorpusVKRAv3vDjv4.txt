 Geollery, a mixed reality social media platform. We present Geollery, a mixed reality social media platform for creating, sharing, and exploring geotagged information with virtual avatars. Our system allows users to see, chat, and collaborate with remote participants with the same spatial context in an immersive virtual environment. Geolery introduces a real-time pipeline to progressively render an interactive neural world with 3D buildings, live chats, and geotagged social media. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to qualitatively compare geology with another social media system, Social Street View. Based on the participants' responses, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each system and derive key insights for designing an interactive mirrored world with geotagged social media. Next, we'll showcase an application for virtual tourism with the audio guide. Hi, I'm Gloria and I'm Nick. We'd like to welcome you to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. Since the museum opened in 1910, more people have visited here than any of the museum in the world. It contains more than 126 million specimens, artifacts, field notes, and photographs. Who do you think has count[ed] them all? Well, I'm glad it's not me. You definitely won't be able to see everything [in] one day. We'll explore just a small part of the museum and see what your day here might be like. We'll also give you a few tips to make the most of your visit. Let's go take a look! Here are some more demos. We imagine Geollery existing as the standalone social media platform for those looking to explore new areas or looking to share their experiences. Please refer to Geollery.com for the paper and the live demo. Thank you for watching!
