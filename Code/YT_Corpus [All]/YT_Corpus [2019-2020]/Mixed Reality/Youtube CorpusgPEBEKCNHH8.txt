 This is a short demo of our HoloLens 2 project which we started this year in april. We want to support our garages with such a device to work more productively. This is not the final product. But we from "Research & Innovation" want to show you what's currently ongoing and what's already possible. First we identify the car by VIN-Number. Say: "VIN-Number" Next we can detect parts in the wheelhouse. Say: "sparepart" After selecting the part via checkbox we can search for it in the TecDoc Catalogue Say: "Webshop". For limiting the result for fitting parts we can enable a ruler via voice. Say: "Hand measurement". And filter the result by saying "Limiting". If the mechanic needs more information for one sparepart, he can click on the button right to the text. Therefore an application starts, where all TecDoc attributes are shown. Futher there is also the RMI-Manuals included which are preselected for the checked sparepart. As you can see the handmeasurement works easy and with a little bit of training it can be very precise. "One hand measurement" Thanks for watching! For further information, please contact us via mail at: HoloLens@tecalliance.net
