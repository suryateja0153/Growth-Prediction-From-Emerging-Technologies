 [Music] hey good afternoon my name is Dan Thacker I'm the director of site reliability and core engineering and magically my team's mission and magically is to provide technology solutions and services to the rest of the organization to enable people to do and perform their best work we're a globally distributed team we provide 24/7 365 support to our customers and one of the challenges that we face is being a global team is well apart from daylight savings and realizing that New Zealand actually goes the opposite direction than the u.s. from the time changes is to kind of maintain a sense of team and maintain a sense of community the team building so last year we were casting around for ideas for how can we do a team-building exercise and we landed on the idea of hey why don't we build an app for magic League one now I got to preface this by saying that none of us are 3d application developers we're not modelers or graphics artist or game designers whatsoever but we are a series and we know how to build and run infrastructure and run it reliably at scale who said hey wouldn't it be really cool if we can take the infrastructure that we do and work with day to day and be able to visualize it using spatial computing to be able to actually see all the nodes and show the dependencies and everything that we're working on so that's what we decided to do that was our challenge we wanted to in 24 hours be able to build and visualized using terraform our infrastructure and spatial computing and that's what we did so 24 hours later well about 30 hours actually but in a day we're able to with no help no outside help no documentation just using what our customers see we were able to build on device having no previous unity experience and no previous unreal or anything like that and it was really empowering an enjoyable experience like I can't describe how happy I was the first time I'd saw this like see of leapers appear on stage in in 3d in front of me it was like like my first hello world all over again one of the challenges that we faced with this was not having any outside help we had to kind of dig within the team and and leverage each other and really work work together as a team so I'm gonna turn it over to Anthony right now he's going to talk through some of the technical challenges that we face as a team as we were trying to build out infrastructure using mixed reality thanks Dan my name is Anthony Lucilla I'm a site reliability engineer at magically and the technical lead of nebula we built this experience using unity and c-sharp for the multiplayer element we are using photon which handles the user and room management as well as synchronization of object data like position rotation scale even custom metadata that were able were able to send using terraform and AC ICD pipeline we deployed the necessary back-end components Google Google cloud functions and Google Cloud Storage this allowed us to pull terraform state data which we then parse and visualize in mixed reality there is so much more that you can do than simply reading a terraform state file imagine you could make changes in real time with terraform in mixed reality query near live metadata to facilitate tasks like architecture reviews cost analysis and system health monitoring you can even customize your war rooms with dashboards comms channels and whatever other useful information you could fill the room with and because this is collaborative you would all see the exact same thing in that war room in my opinion the most important part of this experience is making sure that everyone sees the same thing in the same place which brings us to the most complex and interesting problem that we faced how do you make sure that every user and the same experience sees the same thing each device is independent therefore how can multiple users in the same experience know everyone else's position and orientation where is the origin there are a few solutions to this problem our experience solves this using image tracking the magic leap image tracking system uses the camera to detect two dimensional planar images from a custom defined target set and continuously tracks and updates its location and orientation as users move around in the real world this image therefore becomes a point of reference a way for everyone to agree on an orientation and an origin for the room in other words through the technical details let's watch a quick video of nebula [Music] okay we're choosing a room we've got a couple terraform architectures to choose from you can drag it out and into the room and manipulate their position the red indicators you see are what other users and the same experience are looking at and as you can see other users are also able to move objects at the same time and you're able to even try to steal it from them and you can also move up to it and interact with it because it's out there in the real world thank you right thanks big round of applause fees for the team at magically [Applause] [Music]
