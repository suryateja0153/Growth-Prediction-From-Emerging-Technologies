 all right so my name is Jimmy zou currently I'm in UX lab analyst at Epic Games and I'm here to present a stick and a collaborative mixed reality dance game for co-located punters so just some background first in recent years the popularity of and interest in VR has grown once again fueled by VR technologies with increased sensing and actuating capabilities and more affordable prices in 2017 nine point six million people use the VR sets headsets at least once a month and it's anticipated by the end of 2019 nineteen point six million people have used VR headsets at least once a month along this growth VR experiences have diversified structuring across multiple applications domains including but not limited to realistic simulations training and learning data visualization and obviously entertainment this has meant an increase in social vr to VR chat made this growth especially in notable with its surge and popularity a year ago however even with the increased usage of VR for networked social purposes VR as a concept is still too isolating we chose to take advantage of a tendency to hijack it senses of the players for a mixed reality project that instead utilize the physical face around the player in a mixed reality game so a few notable mixed reality experiences include dollhouse VR using different perspectives to tackle architecture scale issues haptic Turk VR for its using physicality to simulate flight in VR and share VR for its asymmetrical and interdependent elements asymmetric gameplay in this context means play operating in the same game space but working with different specifications which might be abilities rules or roles and our own work we focused on technologies supported play and the inclusion of those within the play space including spectators we wanted the game to only be partially supported by tech along with limited rules in order to encourage a richer social and physical experience we drew inspiration from to commercial VR games Audio shield was used as inspiration because it's easy to grasp concept and it's focused on dance and music which provided the back-and-forth relationship between the players we wanted to capture we focused on the asymmetrical and interdependent nature of keep talking and nobody explodes we are using these aspects as the foundation to write game we began to prototype a stair the rapid iterative design and body ideation methods and body storing we began to envision and test several core mechanics the design resources of the mix space and potential social affordances we came up with a stair dancing mixed reality game with two players VR in and VR out we designed it so that both players had different points of struggle to kind of contend with or relying on each other to work towards the end goal of a higher collective score it was designed so that VR in could focus on the micro level movements how the limbs should stretch and move and VR out could focal focus on the macro translational movements specifically where to be in the room we purposely kept the atmosphere silly and light there are two themes line dancing in the can-can to reduce the awkwardness of physical social public physical social contact and dancing VR in wears the headset and has the either has a controller tied to the wrist or left holding it whichever is more comfortable to the player they saw the virtual world and everything within the 3d space to their limited field of view around 90 degrees including the taggable objects and obstacles flying towards them their personal objective was this haggis and many musical notes using controllers VR out has the controller strapped to their ankle instead and sees the world through a top-down view from a screen that would allow that would show the taggable objects it also showed these objects appearing a second before they actually did within vr end view as well so they could prepare to tag it by making their way there however the view point is limited in that they don't know where specifically the note is just the general area they are responsible for tagging the glowing spheres so we focused on two aspects to dig deep indicating were social affordances for our players alternative controllers and the designed resources of technology supported play we did both through simply attaching the controllers to players legs and arms the direct focus onto the partners and their own movements the ACC buys controllers were used to support the play rather than become a focus of it and should have been considered as extensions of the limbs these are the main social affordances that we wanted to target to encourage social touch and the focus on the intricate asphere we introduced the game role that straying too far for each other with result in point deductions the different and limited perspectives as well as the ridiculous atmosphere encouraged players to hold on to each other having their play spaces intertwine and convey information through verbal and physical means VR ends and VR outs unusual dynamic stem from our focus on interdependent play and collaborative asymmetrical gameplay we wanted two roles with different abilities and viewpoints working together towards individual goals to achieve a larger cohesive goal while they needed to touch the individual targets the overall objective was to grab as many of both to work towards a higher goal while remaining in close contact spectatorship was combination of all of the above we were aligned in the fact that including all the previous aspects into a co-located dancing game result in a chaotic and silly back and forth that would drag viewers into its tempo and atmosphere once we were satisfied with sarah's design we play tested it alongside two games that inspired it keep talking nobody explodes an audio shield we aim to observe and compare the spectator and player experience through which we use the utilize the self assessment mannequin Sam for as well as their effects on interpersonal relationships which we use the inclusion of other in self i OS 4 as well for Sam we only use the scales for pleasure happy the unhappy and arousal board - excited as they were the most pertinent to the study in particular we studied if in any if and how any of those games supported an enjoyable play experience for players and spectators and whether they supported developing the interpersonal relationship between spectators and players and players and players we recruited 15 people split into groups of 3 consisting of ER out the Aryan and spectator with each person remaining in the same role across all three games however due to audio shield being a single-player experience VR out became a spectator for that segment we followed a within subject play test protocol randomizing the order in which each group played each game players were given the iOS array before playing any of the games and given the iOS and Sam surveys after each game as well data from on-site notes and the interviews were analyzed qualitatively bottom-up coding interesting emerging topics which are later grouped somatically the videos were using contextualized information that users provided and the save survey data were used to support the quality of data scores first air were higher across all three measurements of excitement enjoyment and interpersonal relationships and for all three roles forced-air spectators also seemingly enjoy the game the most out of all three rules consistently noting down higher scores because I'll use a single player game VR out players acted as spectators during that round which is why BR in players have no eyes at us scores there was no person to serve as a reference point so our analysis revealed three themes represented by just a few of the quotes above physicality social play and balance so for physicality one player mentioned that it felt awkward and silly kind of like if you're at your first Winter Formal which is a traditional high school dancing in the United States players relate to the close proximity social touch and nonverbal communication of the game encouraged which was a strong factor in the higher scores for social play one player mentioned it was really funny when you guys were late and grabbing at one point and you were trying to rush left while I was screaming for you to get the one right and the Arion got really confused players particularly enjoyed the richness of embodied interactions referring to several game design elements beyond the technology that supported their experience players also appreciated they had equal responses and abilities in the game so that felt like a constantly shifting dynamic one person mentioned that it was more like dancing like I was controlling myself with the other person serving more as a resistance that movement and then instructing the other on what to do so we discussed to design takeaways in the paper but only talked about one of them here VR out was central to the overall experience VR out players anchored the VR in players to the physical realm while at the same time elevating their virtual experience with meaningful tactile input leveraging touch was very relevant for several reasons first touch is a less predominant sense for we are in players compared to sight and sound then it provided VR out players with a plane to operate on to differentiate their roles in a meaningful manner well we were expectant of how VR out affected VR in we were surprised by the importance and impact of lis are out players for a spectator experience we reason that this is because VR out acted as important bridge between VR in and the spectators in VR out could share in the reactions with spectators and have noticeably more interactions with viewers than VR in could they could also react towards VR ins actions and express that in a way that spectators could understand so like I mentioned before this is just one of them and I would encourage you to read the paper for further elaboration with that are there any questions oh great thank you so are there any questions from the audience we have a student volunteer running around to the mic so let's put it on please to raise your hand if you have a question yes there's one in the middle so please say your name and your affiliation and then your question of course hello that's great talk really interesting my name is Sara Wiseman from Goldsmith's University in London in the UK I find the concept of social touch in games super fascinating and you briefly touched on it here I have two questions about that one the participants here did were they known to each other beforehand like what were their what was their familiarity before they took part in the game and - you said you encouraged social touch by deducting points if they separated is that is that correct and did you think of any positive ways to encourage social touch like games such as bot party manage and there are other games out there that positively reward social touch rather than negatively disciplining you for not doing it so alongside this I'm gonna answer the second one first alongside the point deduction it was because they couldn't communicate effectively with each other just using verbal cues so like because one person see is seeing everything in a 3d space just telling someone who doesn't see that space like oh it's over there it doesn't communicate well enough whereas both both you'll can like move each other's limbs because they're holding onto each others arms and bodies and sway them in a way that puts positions them right and then when they say over there it becomes like kind of following their already implied actions through the body and what was your first question again Oh some of them did only one only one pair did for the players themselves okay other questions perhaps I had another one when I was reading your paper I was wondering you know to what extent elegant movement is promoted by the game is that awarded or do you promote silly movements what what what what were you hoping to achieve I mean I designed this game slightly with intention of watching people fall because you've got here yeah so I mean I did line dancing first to encourage like a like ease them in say like oh it's really slow it's easy go back and forth and I threw them into the can-can and then made objects are flying at them so they it's a dodge and like kick their feet up in hind their like when I first made it I made the point too high for like the people for VR out with Victrola gesture like I mean it like heads up so people were like kicking really high up and falling and I should tone that section down a bit but yeah I went for more ridiculous atmosphere so like everyone could join in because if it's like graceful elegant kind of it isn't exclude the spectators but your spectators a joint if everyone's like communicate and laughing about the same thing and acting as if it's a party game yeah okay thank you okay let's move on course
