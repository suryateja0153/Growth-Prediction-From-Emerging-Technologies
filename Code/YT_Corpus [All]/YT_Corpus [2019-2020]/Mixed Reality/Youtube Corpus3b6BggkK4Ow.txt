 hey everyone Daniel Rubino here window Sentra we're in beautiful New York City for HP why they're announcing their brand-new mixed reality headsets a second generation until the HP reverb today I'm gonna give you a quick tour and show you what's new stay tuned [Music] HP is trying to address two separate markets with the Reaver but because of that there are two separate SKUs although it's basically the same headset with some slight differences one of those markets is commercial including healthcare engineering vocational training and entertainment and the one is straight-up consumers for gaming and new experiences now three areas HP were trying to improve upon with this headset versus the previous iteration and its own competition accout superb visual quality as well smarter fit and comforts has just the new strap system that involves velcro and that new back head support and yeah it's a pretty comfortable headset then we'll comes to specifications we're talking 1.1 pounds around 500 grams and compared to previous headsets yeah this is actually significantly lighter it's smaller and Snell has cloth on it and it just looks a little bit nicer they're also redesigned optics and this is really the heart of this headset so instead of circles we now have squares for those lenses which is actually a big change no other headset has that currently that delivers a 2160 by 2160 resolution per eye with 114 degree field of view that's up from 110 degrees there's also now a 90 hurt refresh rate although you will need a GTX 1080 to achieve that they're now integrated headphones with spatial audio and smart assistant compatible dual microphones so you can use it with Cortana if you don't like any nut stuff you can remove the headphones use your own and disable those mics as well it's also now integrated Bluetooth with prepar'd motion controller so you don't longer need to pair up the controller's up to your PC and headset they just pull them out of the box the system supports Windows mix reality and steamvr and finally for connections it supports USB type a and DisplayPort 1.3 which is really interesting so no type-c support there is a mini DisplayPort converter included as well that DisplayPort 1.3 though allows you hit that 90 Hertz refresh rate so it's kind of nice to have but it will limit you on what PC laptop you can use finally for that commercial version there's removable and cleanable cushions for the face mask to make sense for that commercial environment alright so a couple things about this headset so it's going to start around five hundred ninety nine dollars for the consumer version that does include the controllers and adds a little bit more expensive than kind of what we've expected but the quality here is definitely improved and in my conversations with HP I asked so how is mixed reality even doing and turns out it's actually doing quite well specifically in the commercial segment they're seeing a lot of uptake from businesses and training institutions who want to use this whether it's in hospitals or OSHA and so you're going to see a lot of adoption there but consumers too are also using it a lot for gaming now in terms of comfort and design I really like this updated version I've used every Windows mixed reality headset that's been out there this one is significantly smaller especially compared to Samsung who they're definitely not afraid of going up against here and Samsung's Odyssey helm including their new version then that's a pretty big headset this one is much smaller it has smaller panels in it we're talking about a higher resolution display more comfortable design so overall I'm very excited about seeing this if you haven't tried Windows mixed reality yet you really should get into at some point it's really sort of impressive about how much Microsoft is actually done in this Microsoft did work with HP on this headset a bit - along with Alex kipman so this is a big project for everybody involved and I'm very excited about getting my hands on this expect it sometime in April like I said for $5.99 I'm sure will go on sale as well for that leave me a comment below tell me what you think of the HP reverb but what you think Windows mixed reality needs before it goes totally mainstream otherwise about this video give us a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe thanks for watching take care everyone yeah yeah kiss you have to talk for those but
