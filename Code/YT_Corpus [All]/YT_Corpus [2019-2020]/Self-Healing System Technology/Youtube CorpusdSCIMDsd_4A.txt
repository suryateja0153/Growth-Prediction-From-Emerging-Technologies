 we're delighted to be kicking off the seminar this quarter and what we're gonna take the next 45 minutes or so is to brief everybody on the new initiative that the Precourt Institute for energy has launched called storage axe and this was a symposium that was held little less than two months ago so this is still hot off the press and the title of the symposium is to look at bridging the gaps between science technology and economics in energy store so ideally this is a topic that's well suited for the Precourt Institute to tackle and I think the audience hopefully does not require an introduction to the urgency of the energy challenge but perhaps what is not real is that there is an enormous growth needed in the area of energy storage so we're now reaching an era where renewable electricity can be generated that is competitive with conventional electricity but it is not available all the time and everywhere that is needed to resolve this issue you have to tackle storage the application of energy storage goes far beyond that of the electricity grid it goes into transportation and it goes far beyond that of just conventional automobile transportation but into electric flights and other exciting application and this slide just to show you all the possible use cases that can be enabled by affordable energy storage there are many form factors of energy storage we won't get in too much detail today there are small batteries there are big batteries there are energy storage options beyond battery and this is really the X in storage X is to look at all possible scenario that will get us to an energy storage option that can make a decarbonized energy system competitive unless you've been living under a rock maybe some of you have you would have heard that the Nobel Prize in Chemistry last year was awarded on the topic of lithium-ion batteries awarded to John Goodenough Stan winter ham and Akira Yoshino for their invention of the lithium-ion battery technology some 30 years ago and this in the word of their Nobel Prize Committee is a gift to humanity I think this is really not an understatement if you look across this room the number of looking among batteries probably will be well in the hundreds and our life today would not be possible without it but one thing that's quite neat is that although these three individuals are not directly connected to Stanford we're always very good about pointing their indirect connection to Stanford's to highlight our role and it turns out that many of these innovation trace back to Huggins who is one of our esteemed faculty in the material science engineering department who'da pioneering work on battery and related technology in the 60s 70s and 80s and Bob happened to serve as the post doctoral adviser to one of the Nobel laureate Stan Winton him and also another note of battery scientist of a charmant and if you look at the Nobel Prize statement it cites several of the early work by Bob Huggins that laid the foundation to understand the chemistry and the physics that underlie energy storage so this is our small connection to the Nobel Prize and Stan being an alum of our department and the University was very kind to sent a short quote to commemorate the launch of the storage acts initiatives I'll let you read it for a few seconds and for fun the symposium happened just I think two days at the announcement of the Nobel Prize and that was not timed but maybe someone had insider news not sure so now let's go back to the fund a tional science in engineering why are we studying this problem it turns out as a very complicated if you look at energy storage just electrochemical energy storage which is batteries and others you have to tackle this enormous range of time and length scale on the y-axis we have time you have to deal with the motion of atoms that's on the Pico second time scale all the way to the lifetime of a battery that's ears okay so this is 10 plus orders of magnitude in time on the x-axis you have length scale you have to be able to master working with energy storage at the atomic level all the way to the system's level so all the way from atoms to that of an electric vehicle as one example and as Stanford we're really good at doing this we've been tackling this from the synthesis the fabrication the characterization the modeling the analytics so this is giving us the ability to look at the problem more holistically and this is really how the idea of the initiative came about it was well how do we now take it to the next level to span the science engineering from the materials to the devices and then ultimately to the system's level whereby we can make the largest impact and we already have a critical mass of people as Stanford there are more than 20 faculty members involved in various aspects of energy storage 150 students spanning many departments you will find many of those faces right here in this room and I think it's worthwhile to just state the obvious so why do we need this initiative what is the purpose I will tack away from sort of this strategic sense and then shortly after I will tackle it from the pragmatic sense so on the strategic level the reason why we need an initiative organized around energy storage is because we recognize the importance of the problem but also in order to solve these issues we have to do something bigger than were with now we have to build very strong partnership between university government and industry with industry being a significant a significant emphasis we want to continue to recruit the best talent to come to Stanford to work on energy storage we want to be able to enhance the interaction between faculty members already a Stanford there are many people working in the isolated fashion but there is an opportunity to bring everyone together and then lastly we want to be able to go beyond what we can do as individual principals do something bigger to build translational facilities and multi Pi laps so we can do bigger things it's my pleasure to introduce the people behind the initiative of course you've met my colleague E from the material science department but we also involve many other faculty members as well so no Simona or nori in energy resource engineering football chain in as aero-astro and various other members of the Precourt Institute have been involved to get this off the ground as I mentioned the symposium that launched this effort was just a little less than two months ago the symposium was also supported by four schools to indicate the cross support that we're receiving across university the Precourt Institute of course the school of earth energy environmental sciences engineering and the School of Humanities and Sciences as well and everybody pitched in to make this event happen now all of this effort were meant to coil s not only the people at Stanford but also people outside of Stanford so we were very excited to announce that we have assembled a range of industry partners that represents various part of the vertical supply chain as was the horizontal market for example from materials companies the battery companies to OEMs and electric vehicle manufacturers and integrated energy companies to create an initiative that can bring the type of insights from industry and then provided as a guiding feedback for researchers doing work at Stanford so now let me try to get into some specifics here so lithium ion batteries specifically just received a Nobel Prize so you might think the work is done it's hardly done actually it's extremely challenging so one thing I did not read out is the size the economics of energy stores we're talking about in the next 15 or so years the market rising to over 1 trillion dollars it will be the largest market of a single technology it's approximately the size of the silicon industry today there are still many challenges perhaps the most significant challenge is how do we sustain the cost learning curve of batteries 10 years ago a kilowatt hour a battery of looking mountain battery would cost you somewhere on the order of a thousand dollars today maybe 120 so it's a factor of eight just in 10 years but this has to continue to go down we're still about three times more expensive than that is required for widespread adoption of electric vehicles we have good adoption but widespread adoption to have all of your vehicles becoming electric this is still very far away and this is primarily limited by the cost of energy storage if we want to use energy storage on the grid the cost will have to be ten times less expensive than today for looking around battery so we must innovate to find new chemistry new device architecture so we can reach the type of costs that wooden table so where's three to ten times off okay so we cannot be complacent on the technology side the current specification of the batteries are also lacking yes they are enough to drive an electric vehicle for 300 plus miles but if you want to have it really be competitive on the transportation sector with fossil then you have to be able to meet several challenges for example can we recharge the battery in the same time scale as refueling the car can we start looking at light weighting the batteries furthermore to increase the efficiency and there is many work looking also at the lifecycle cost of using lithium ion batteries the co2 costs of manufacturing batteries oh so very high so there are many advantages to making the battery more dents which means we store more energy per weight or per volume and this will continue to be one of the significant technical driving forces we want high energy density high powers of being able to deliver the energy very quickly safe and long-lasting long lasting is perhaps one of the biggest challenge for battery adoption for the electricity grid because you would have to have that work for half a quarter a century at the minimum for it to make economical sense so we're still very far off from it if you want to go to a trillion dollar market from the 50 billion that is today you have to solve significant scientific challenges in scaling up many of you may have heard how many Giga factories we have to build in the next 10 years just to satisfy the demands religious vehicles those members are real so how do we continue to innovate the scaling up process so we can make it faster and less expensive ultimately batteries will fail and we have to do something with it and today's lead acid battery is possible because you have a 95% recycling rate I don't know what you do with your little Mountain battery but after you give it to whoever you give it to there's really nothing beyond that so as the adoption of electric vehicle Rises we have to address the issue of the so called circular economy through not only the recycling but also the reuse of battery purposing and potentially regeneration we will hit a bottleneck very very soon if we don't look at this particular aspect and then finally it's always important to mention artificial intelligence somewhere so we mentioned the following sense the Rd pace is slow for batteries it is a material based technology we need chemistry and it's not something you can just coat up and it works right you have to actually make it and the typical development time for lithium ion battery technology is three to seven years an artificial tell elegance in informatics has an important role to play to accelerate the pace of research and development that's one of the main goals as well so these five things are I would consider technology agnostic goals for energy storage doesn't matter which one you want to do doesn't matter what the X is you will have to solve every single one of these in order for us to make a greater penetration of energy storage and hence renewable electricity now let me talk about the initiative in some detail so I'm going to try to establish what we're trying to do differently and you heard and you many of you know we have a vibrant energy storage community here at Stanford and this is how we've been approaching things we take what's on the left of this screen which I call the academic research pillars we're really good at gaining fundamental understanding we are really good at designing materials making them we operate many big science facilities and then we're also very good at embracing new directions quickly like machine learning but on the other hand if you look at industry research and development they do things a little bit differently there's a great emphasis on prototyping and scaling up the optimization is exhaustive relentless one might say one always cares about how the technology is integrated into the whole system and then you have to think about the business model the cost the lifecycle all aspects of it and this is not simple and what we are trying to do in this initiative is to empower the people at Stanford the faculty to staff the students the postdocs and to get the best of both sight in a pre competitive setting we're not trying to compete with industry but we're trying to take what we do best in academic setting but to syphon elements in a pre competitive setting from industry development so we can merge it and the main outcome that we hope to have is to de-risk the technology for scaling up and come realization to be able to take something that we have say invented or discovered here at Stanford and be able to turn it into a reality so now you have a general sense of our guiding principles and the strategy let me now show you a couple highlights of what we have been doing so far this is pre storage acts and then I will show you a couple of case studies of how we can expand and integrate and then II will show you additional examples from his research that ties everything together so in terms of fundamental understanding as I mentioned this is one of our key pillars we're really good at understanding that detailed mechanisms of things for example on the left here these are the first atomic resolution images of lithium metal which is a very promising material for high energy battery that could be 10 times of the energy density it is today this is from EES group and this is also the first atomic scale image of the passivation layer that protects the lithium metal from further corrosion on the right are examples from my group that shows that we have also the ability to understand how lithium is inserted and removed from battery materials not only at the single particle level but also at the porous particle level so you can see these are advanced measurements of the chemistry the dynamics the microstructure you can see this fly through that's a single battery particle that's about 10 microns wide and the color you see is the distribution of lithium so we have been able to answer some very basic questions about where the lithium are how they get in how it is passivated at the atomic level at the meso scale level and at the micro scale level another example of recent success in the energy storage area is the application of machine learning in two ways on the Left I'm highlighting the work by my colleague Evan Reed who has been using machine learning to accelerate the discovery of materials so as we can appreciate there are many millions of materials we can use for batteries so which one is that well we don't have the resources to examine all of them so one can take a standard approach of using computation and quantum mechanics to predict the right composition but even that takes a long time it takes about four weeks to make one prediction but if you were to combine that with some degree of machine learning to look at the relationship between the data then you can get it down to less than one second per prediction so that can grillak sarah and this is an example of searching for solid electrolyte so these are solid rather than liquid electrolyte which are not flammable and these are considered for the next generation lithium based batteries because it can be potentially safer so this can help the acceleration of discovering new material on the right it's just a cartoon but highlights one of the recent examples where machine learning can also be used to forecast the lifetime of battery one of the toughest thing with batteries is that they are hard to break which means if you want to assess how good the battery is you have to run it to failure and that means sometimes many many months under accelerated settings that we don't accelerate it then there's many many years and machine learning can actually now also help us for example to predict the future behavior of the battery with great deal of accuracy for example in this work we were able to take just the first few cycle of the battery just a first day of operation basically and predict its lifetime out to many thousands of cycles so this can really accelerate the R&D pipeline for battery technology by reducing the time needed to evaluate the battery so these are just two examples now trying to glue everything together we as storage X identified several cross-cutting topics these are topics which don't have just one but several components for example accelerated testing and validation and van sensing and diagnostic battery use I already talked about fast charging so on and so forth even looking at resource availability these are the eight core topics of storage acts that were trying to engage the our industrial partners and also our colleagues trying to address I will give you two quick examples of how integrated this problems are so this photo here shows you a taxi electric car taxi driver in China that is waiting for their car to be charged so these are down time and time that they're not generating revenue so one solution to this is to make battery charging faster today the battery charging time to maybe fifty or sixty percent can be as little as forty five minutes but to charge it to 80 percent it will take about an hour and a half so this is about ten times to twenty times longer than the refueling time of a gasoline car if you think about the amount of power that is required for charging we're talking roughly if you have a 100 kilowatt hour battery pack you want to charge it in five minutes which is roughly the refueling time you're talking about 1.2 megawatt and that is roughly 1% of a Boeing 737 taking off well not the max right now but it's the regular 737 and if you look at the entire flow of energy you have to go from the grid where the electricity is being supplied from to the charging station to the vehicle to the battery pack that's in the car to the individual battery cell that's in the battery pack and then you have to get into the material that does the ultimate heavy lifting so you have to manage this flow of 1.2 megawatt across this times however many cars are charging simultaneously and the type of problems are quite significant you have to manage the grid because this can cause significant disruption charging electronics would have to be made very efficient on the vehicle level you have to optimize how the energy is delivered as a function of time you have to engineer the battery pack there are discussions of using sort of temporary reservoirs to hold the energy quickly such as a super capacitor you have to manage the temperature very carefully once you get into the battery you have to think about how far the lithium would have to travel in order to minimize gradients and obviously the materials will have to be able to handle the type of rates we're talking about and there are also alternatives you can think about battery swapping for example rather than charging the battery you pre charge it and just swap it in and out so these represents the complexity of the problem so many of us are now working on this in order to enable fast charging I should mention that at our symposium we had a speaker from Airbus who told us that for aviation this is even a greater problem because the time a plane spent on the ground as time is not making money and that's as little as one hour and this is that's not the problem that aviation industry is tackling I mentioned recycling already and this is one aspect that is extremely important that we are tackling we call a battery we use recycling and regeneration looking at the three possible cases of what you do with the battery when it comes out of surface from its primary application so for example the first life use could be electric vehicle after you have reached the end of life so this could be 80% of its initial performance 70% depending on which car manufacturer it is you have a decision to make you have to think about do I recycle it do I boil it down to the raw material and get the expensive things out do i repurpose it for something else that's called reuse that could be for example for incorporation into larger systems like storage for wind and solar and we can also think about later use as well beyond that so what are the issues involved here we believe at the heart of this is a performance and valuation model so every decision point we're trying to assess how much is each one of these options going to bring value to the user so for example at the end of use with the car battery is it worth $10 so $100,000 $1000 $10,000 we actually don't know very well because depending on the next application the valuation can change so we're taking a very comprehensive systems approach here to look at for example the data behind it so can we make predictions about how the battery will perform in its next cycle next use on the system side we also have to think about how do we swap these batteries in and out how do we make it more universally changeable if you want to rejuvenate the battery well how do we introduce the regeneration aspect into it and now the materials level we also have to ultimately think about the cost of recycling to boil things down to the most expensive element in the case of lithium-ion battery it's most likely cobalt and that is a very inefficient process as well so all these are being explored right here as storage X and s Stanford so let me now hand over to e who will show you and share with you some of our success stories taking these academic curiosities all the way to commercial realizations thank you will so well thank you this is a very very nice overview storage X I think in the next 20 minutes or so let me use one examples to show you a learning curve and from the learning curve we want to do better in psychology X but let me reveal one information first I look back when Stan Whittingham won a Nobel Prize I say oh my god you know the first paper he published leading to his Nobel winning award was published in 1976 that was the year I was born it took really a long time to get there my job just turned into 97 years old this year 97 media made people live longer that's a good news but lithium battery is actually very very challenging you better leave very long too in order to achieve some somewhere so 96 intercalation mechanism you know instance science paper and night that's 99 or 76 in 91 that was the first commercialization product of lithium-ion batteries so that's roughly about 15 years that's the type of cycle you should expect 15 20 years for jaco materials technology you know from initial invention to commercialization inside storage acts we know one of the biggest challenges we want to address is how to increase energy density of the batteries you know per charge you can learn for longer distance 500 miles or longer that's something we want to achieve we want to really you know made a technology go to that level for about a decade a little bit more than a decade after I join your faculty starting the research on lithium-ion batteries some of the chemistry we want to work on beefing form for 1970s like the existing technology graphite intercalation lithium cobalt oxide and so on we want to look at silicon for example that's very high capacity we would look at you know metallic lithium and no we want to enable solid-state batteries that's safer and we want to use you know a new type of materials polymer that's very resilient for example disease of needle try to punch through this polymer but it's so resilient this needle cannot go through we want to use this type of polymer to prevent lithium dander formation to in the metallic lithium this is the type of chemistry and with new material we want to enable it's very challenging however if you could do that this is the pathway you can get to where we have roughly somewhere wrong 250 in a little bit higher than that right now while per kilogram or energy density per unit weight can we go to 400 500 and more then you can enable the possibility of 500 mile in range but it's a lot of problems right here we need to solve I want to share with you the story you know back to a decade goal until now you know what do we learn how can we do badly in the future to let the academia and industry to work together to speed up this process the example I want to share with you is a silicon coming back to silicon I still I'm still working on this material it's been more than a decade where silicon is a candidate that can replace graphite carbon as the end of the batteries it has the capacity that's about eleven times of graphite and imagine if you can put silicon into your batteries it can boost up the amount of energy he can stop because it's not a lot more charges a lot more lithium for given weight however the volume expansion is very big when silicon expand they can break and also the interface is not stable so these are really really challenging problems not knowing how challenging that is about 11 years ago twelve years ago I started to work on it published the first paper and that just only started them you know all these learning of how challenging the various could be you know at a time we didn't know I only know what I can solve one problem let's go and doing doing this a little bit just a little bit by a little bit just keep learning it's actually very very hard so in a band doesn't a so if hobbies his first paper using silicon nanowire by thinking nanostructures are small now they could you know solve the expansion in breaking problems actually it did it solve the breaking problems let me share with you one of this video in situ video inside TM this particle in the center right there is a hundred nanometers and diameters now I'm charging lithium going into this particle you see the volume expansion is taking place you know its particles are shaking because you zoom in so much magnification is very big and the vibration will show up in size transmission electron microscope and pretty soon you're going to see this particle is broken because lithium coming in this particle keeps eating up a lot of lithium you know this silicon doesn't know this particle is already full you know just keep eating it so at the end what happened you fall into pieces so in using nanotechnology we showed this could be solved by making the structure smaller so they do not play they do not accumulate too big of stress to be broken we identify the critical breaking sighs you know this highlight the volume of fundamental research and university once you know this critical breaking sighs you know what size of particle you need to use to build-a-bear the electrode so they don't break anymore this turn out to be guiding the industry now all the very company try to say well what's the particle size you need to use you know basically those are the particle size 150 nanometers or smaller for the particles nano eyes above 300 nanometer or smaller so this learning keeps going along this process why we identify so many problem we have to solve it's endless well luckily this is also the process we see you know that's why we need government we need a universe the government industry working together this is a different perspective if you are working at different segments of the problems them earlier you know the better that's number one the value because unless you try to optimize they live with their batteries to you they can see all the problems once they deliver a real product if you know those problems coming back you can speed up the innovation and also normally that also from the funding supports temple we need a continuous support you know we know funding cycle go through you know government usually three years you know if you can have is the funding support from internal four must emphasize of GSA is a great example funding some of these early research later picking up by you know Saudi Arabia that house the University of ward providing this funding and later picking up by the De Palma Energy this actually provide about support about 10 years to continues are the ones the understanding and coming up solution to support that I mean within storage X we want to have a support mechanism to really get some of the new ideas to start and also get some of the really good ideas later picking up an industry so over the past more than ten years about her generation of design I wouldn't bother you about that but this is on the university research side but indeed in order to make a challenging materials like this to go into the industry to be used and industry needs to pick up so 2008 I didn't know how challenging a better technology could be I started our company core areas so I was thinking average it took can take 15 years or 20 years to commercialize the technology maybe a staffer right here it'll be a little bit smarter we can make it you know seven eight years but I was completely wrong he actually looking right now mm I I found the Empress seven technologies invented today this year 2020 13 years now so I'm about heating to that 15 years mark he actually took very long time to get there and also a lot of money as well a lot of money as well well let me share with you so after the Stanford Research what happened not an envious Empress has a very dedicated team to develop the manufacturing technology tomatoes wires if you visit my lab you go into my lab right how do you make silicon nanowire it's a two furnace like this bit the court still one inch diameter making a coupon size the silicon nanowire material will be or cone cells we publish your nature nano paper it's very actually easy compared to industry and as you need to make a real product these the the right performance and in the course it's very very challenging I always say this with a little bit of luck a lot of luck now emphasis getting into this is not till furnace anymore right this is almost like 50 meters long row to row fabrication line of chemical vapor deposition it's also a new type of manufacturing technology better industry didn't use here does not use you then to need to validate that so over the past decade these was validated slowly until now that you are seeing those row to row really big row the black color of silicon nanowire going on a metallic foil this is also the opportunity to in a way in the whole manufacturing scare up with in storage X we talked about you know taking the idea to a scalable solution how do you do that and this might be one of the example I would say right there you know traditionally how do you made a bath at your lecture you take a particle you mix me slowly put in a polymer binder we solver you do the coding up to the coding while you do the calendaring you heat it up and all these process multi-step now just those multi steps are gone just one step the foil in foil out and making the holy electro so up to now the silicon wire technology deliver in the water highlighting the red right over the water per kilogram 430 in that level while per kilogram of the batteries you know this is a unit change you know when a university when we work on certain new materials we use million our program that's the charge Kuwait but when you go to industry meaning out program you're not delivering that you are delivering energy it's actually one hour per kilo just simply this unit change four million hour per gram - whoa per kilo means a lot you are doing something real that also means this probably 20 30 big problems already solve and I hope those problems and university research we can see those problem earlier that's why building artist industry university partnerships so important there's some problem we don't see within university research but those are actually perfect for university research to tackle we can be reached the technology and a pre-competitive sense and speed up innovation I want to show you a video in my lab my quad is still done doing this hand by hand right now let's look at this automatic sort of nano are stacking line and I stole from embassy always his permission to show and actually now can you know blow these silicon nanowire low to low and actually stack up is a layer by layer using automatic which is very small at this moment there's still a lot of hard job to do to do the manufacturing much faster so this has been delivered to Airbus in a partner of its Airbus so then I say what silicon is an example of you know how we do materials innovation the Holy Grail is really lithium metal right here little metal combined visa solver combined with other capital even higher much higher energy density and that's the Holy Grail but it's huge problems right here as well indeed before 1970s in the 1960s when people think about lithium batteries they didn't think about Graf I didn't think about inter collision they want to use metallic lithium first to be the end no however fail it's just to ha nobody know how to solve the problem yeah we're running out of choice up to silicon lithium mater will need to uh step in so many exciting problems to work on almost like impossible to solve I think I still don't have having the next 30 years to solve the problem we ever have will have more he has 40 years he's younger so we'll work hard to address this problem so we have a team right here this Grand Challenges is really exciting to bring the team together you know on the lithium metal and aside after Steve comes back to Stanford actually Steve and I have a chat and and also a few other people as it was the most exciting problem you want to solve Steve said lithium metal I said to for me too let's work together so we work together come up new solution I won't go into the details and also bring in the polymer Expo - nan Bao you know turnin is a is a magician on polymer is all type of polymer coming out it's it's poverty can help solving these problems so with this as an example now let me zoom out a lot for storage ax and C in the whole stand for energy landscape right and we know this has been planned since these have time pre call now so many areas of energy come together you know folded into Precourt Institute so we don't work in the back here we work actually within a really large number of talented faculties and students and storage is one part of the solution to a very very big problems these goes in parallel with other initiative such as the Natural Gas Initiative we are learning quite a bit from natural gas initiative how do we run storage acts and you know we need to learn more cuz we we were just born two months ago and also very strong connection is actually speed - and what's your storage not only for the cars but also for the grid and these very strong partnership will allow us to guide the technology development guide the whole system level understanding we told you about when you charge the car five minutes the hundred kilowatt hour battery require 1.2 million water power you know disparities in the grid come hand in hand and also what's also very important is the financing part I was telling you that I mean there's a funding Sapulpa for each faculty we know this is super important to keep stable support once we have a technology going out and need to put into the economic environment to see what else what more you need to solve so the the partnership is the financing is very important as well as least you know the industry you know this is the place of students our postdocs our faculties are highly into the Nouriel starting a company translate move the technology out of the campus and go into the real world so there will be quite a bit of partnership as well I will expect multiple exciting probably new startup can come out of this initiative so let me a my slide by doing the advertisement for Sally and a loon about the Stanford Global Energy Forum this is very very exciting event you know 2008 18 the first event was huge success and I know outside people keep asking when is the next event coming internally we are really looking forward to the event coming up in May 2020 we start our stop view and I will be happy to take any questions you have [Applause] we really appreciate it we now time for some questions do you have two more announcements a one for the audience in general thanks to Sir Weaver and others we are going to do a free hundredth energy seminar on our celebration right after next week's energy seminar right upstairs Sally Benson and Roland horde and I and Jeff Costa may be together so I think it should be a great celebration and we hope this many of you who can will attend secondly our course assistant for the project of course for the project for the seminar of Yvonne McHale Connie is stuck in India for a couple of days so he missed today so we're not actually doing attendance today I'm professor Trey is willing to do a student discussion group if you want to get that out of the way so we'll pull the students right after the class to see if anybody wants to do it so each student has to attend all except for one seminar right the two-page paper at the end and attend a after seminar discussion group so if you're interested in talking to professor's Trey just let us know right afterwards so if those two announcements said let's go to the audience starting with students for a few questions any takers for students job opportunities research opportunities student research opportunities career guidance I was just wondering I understand you're not right now and you're talking about like how expensive it might be and I was wondering when you would break even like as a like right now the model do you have like can you repeat a pipe break even voice for the air possible like okay good I will thinking storage x-ray will be very how we only spend money so I think we are now at a point of breaking even so indeed empress is considering the exit at this moment after actually a decade so it's it's the time well but let me mention more about this the cause of the battery is the Nano why I won I am Telling You the course is still high so it only fit into certain market at this moment that's for the drone market that's why helped us and made the purchase it's not yet for transportation and get to the level will mention $120 per kilowatt hour we are too far away so we'll need to scale up that CVD plant multiple line which is a learning curve I don't know how many years down the world we might get there we might get there other questions comments students I got one that curse don't you go hi so you guys have talked a bit about lithium-ion technologies but also mention that sort of the framework for storage acts is agnostic to the technology I was curious as it's growing and changing in the next couple of years if you guys are planning to try to expand out and include other technologies or if you're more focused on pushing lithium ion for it as fast as possible well I think to get started we are focusing on the segment that has the largest immediate term growth potential and that will be what we call electrochemical energy storage yes and that includes batteries but also other kinds so you are familiar with lithium ion battery but they're also other types of batter for example flow battery for a great energy storage so those are the center of our immediate focus but beyond ESS you can also look at SR es you can also look at thermal storage you could look at other chemical storage and they're also just even simpler ones mechanical tom Hydra and not all problems exist at all the scales so for example but if you talk about home hydro the problems are very different different sorts of problems so we do hope to start to weed those in as time goes on but our immediate focus is on the electric chemical technology I think that is the one requiring most immediate attention and that can be split into your lithium ion battery and related technology for transportation and then something that's much lower cost for the grid I put a slide up indeed we can see the old high wall storage not just the electrochemical battery base this is a thermal for example on there as well hi what kind of matter is application does Imperius produce for like foam renewable energy starting emphasis this high energy one because the cause is not that low yet so it got to be the high margin one starting a company start to learn about all these words important I used not to think about high margin in academia is a more the portable vacation the one giving you quite a bit of you know the market is the tone the particular commercial drone and it require very high energy density and very few companies can make that will be the first one and then next one will be consumer electronics the last one might be the car the grid is still far away for these type of technology so what company should we look out for for battery application of renewable energy storage so the question is great I know you guys have some work going on maybe in the discussion session let's chat about that yeah it's a much longer conversation so you guys mentioned that you're a factor of like three to ten for widespread application of electric vehicles on the road interesting what is your guys timescale for when we can see a future where energy you know what your vehicles are on the road and also what companies are gonna be the ones that are gonna pave the way for this future because Tesla is doing all the work I'm wondering how do you guys think the academic and government so I think first you can delete the government subsidy right so that will give you a forty five fifty thousand dollar Tesla car today so if you think about something like the Toyota Corolla that's under twenty thousand dollars so that already tells you the Delta you have to work with so I think indeed is challenging I hesitate to put a time scale to it I guess the default answer is always in ten years but you know ten years ago you probably have said ten years anyway so I think predicting that times go is always difficult but all major vehicle manufacturers are projecting by 2040 widespread conversion to electric vehicle so it's really a matter of when I think the battery technology cost will continue to come down they will reach a floor because right now about thirty five percent of the cost is already raw materials and those are only climbing they're not falling so that's that the boundary yeah let me add a thing about this problem there's one perspective we shouldn't forget we need to look at the lifetime ownership cost to a car if you only let your car you don't want gasoline and electricity causes low and the maintain is the oil change for electric car you know really nothing right there maintenance you know driving electric car for number of years right now and I will go do a service for my electric car yet so my estimation is only simple estimation when the electric car the price is about $35,000 and to the owner it's equivalent to a gasoline car probably about $20,000 you know the cause of ownership including everything so 35 K is the number I'm looking at if we 35 K and below I select your chi is already as competitive as 20 K of gasoline car that's how think things will fly completely I think we're just about out of time so let's thank our speakers will in [Applause]
