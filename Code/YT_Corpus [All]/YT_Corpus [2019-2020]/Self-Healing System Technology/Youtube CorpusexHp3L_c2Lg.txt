 1991 scientists made a discovery headway that really opened the door to this conversation they discovered every human heart 40,000 or so specialized cells configured in a way that creates a neural network in the heart it's their brain like cells but they're not in the brain they're in the heart and it's actually called the little brain in the heart what they found what the scientists discovered is that these cells think independently of the cranial brain they feel and they remember and then what that means there's every experience that we have even this one right now I'm registering this experience in two places this is a good experience so it's not a problem I'm registering my cranial mind as well as in my heart but if we were having a trauma it would still be registered in both places and if I tried to heal that trauma only through thinking about it we're talking about from my mind that might feel incomplete the healing may feel incomplete and the reason is because I've only addressed what happened in here I haven't addressed what happened in here and we know this intuitively I did an experiment a few years ago every culture I went to in every age grabbed asked little kids I said where are you sitting right now show me where you're sitting and people say I'm sitting right here they say right here or you ask the indigenous people you know where do you live well this this is my home and almost instinctively we know that the heart is is the seat of our existence as a seat of our being you don't see them hitting their head you know or their arm or something else so we talk about heart intelligence what we're talking about is the ability for these neurons to us to communicate with the neurons in a way that is meaningful to those neurons these neurons are linked to a wisdom to an intelligence that is right for us mine is right for me yours is right for you and any question that you ask this intelligence it will answer you in the way that will serve you in that moment it'll never tell you to do anything dangerous or anything that would hurt in anyone else I'll give you a perfect example I was in Australia over 9/11 couldn't get back into my own country until the flights were flying again and when they did fly I was in Sydney Australia and there was a Boeing 747 that's a big plane with fewer than 20 people we're gonna come to to the US and there was at the ticket counter we were at the gate to board and the agent said there are so few people we're not going to board by boarding rows you you can board this plane if you want to go go to America and I said well you don't sound very encouraging she says I don't know what happened in that country she says but this planes gonna go there if you want to go there I don't know what's gonna happen again I don't know if it's over but if you want to get on the plane you know get on the plane and really didn't instill a lot of confidence in me or the other people that were there I said hold that thought just wait a minute I stepped around the corner and there's a technique where you can literally you touch your heart like this and when you touch your heart your awareness will always go the place where you feel the touch so you call your attention into your heart center in this way and you slow your breathing just a few breaths slower than usual when you slow your breathing it tells your body that you are safe you're in a place that's safe and when you're safe and you feel safe it's a switch it's like an emotional trigger that frees the rejuvenating and the healing chemistry in the body because the stress and survival chemistry is not needed if you feel safe so when you slow your breathing and focus in your heart that is the doorway and then shamans will do this all the time monks nuns you see them do this all the time to that heart intelligence and I asked my heart in my heart is this is this a safe flight for me to take because my head if you ask your head this is so interesting scientifically because the brain is a polarity organ left and right brain and there's always going to be a right neuron good in the bad success/failure and if you ask your brain a question under pressure your brain will go through the logic and the ego loops that will keep you from making the answer when you ask your heart to hearts not a polarity organ so you consciously free yourself from those loops into what is called heart intelligence and generally your heart will answer heart knows you're very well spin with you a long time your heart will answer before you even finish the question [Music]
