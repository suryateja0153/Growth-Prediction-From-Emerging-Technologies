 [Music] [Applause] so the next part of the analysis is you know development of the crack patterns over prolonged durations do so due to the loss of moisture when you do image analysis this work was done by my PhD scholar dr. J we pretty shocked she is a faculty member at a 90-30 party Gautam what is that on a public good up so she is working there right now so it is a very interesting concept you know we wanted to see when you boil milk what happens to the milk you know the whole thought process started from this activity when you boil milk tea how the surface looks like what changes the material goes undergoes the problem is when you are boiling any liquid you can't put a camera on the top of this why condensation so we spread one camera also very expensive by putting it on the top of a boiling fluid and the whole lens got spoiled anyway it happens in R&D but next time you are successful so if you take the initial sample this we call this a specimen of tray in the liquid limit state put in a petri dish and then you expose it to the environment and we wanted to see how this crack propagates all right in other words we are trying to see how Sigma T develops in the soil mass this is the crack initiation point so over a period of time this point will keep on moving further and this is how the crack propagates on it and ultimately the entire thing gets split in two parts so for a limb and I think there is nothing much to be discussed over here but for an environmental shoe technologist this was a PhD thesis because a lot of dynamics associated with their material until now you have never talked about C and Phi as a function of time in your shear strain theory is it what you always assumes and file always constant but I'm sure you must be realizing that here this is the case the complete mobilisation of Sigma T partial mobilization of Sigma T what type of material properties are getting changed in the process of all this happening is a big question mark so this is what actually we wanted to first of all capture in the image form and then do the image analysis this is what happens in the nature alright this was a project which I was doing for a huge reclamation which was going on in one of the ports and the question is if you are not using the right type of the soil even after the pad is constructed the entire thing will crack and your filling will become defunct so one of the ways to analyze the whole thing is you convert this into a grayscale results this is what is known as a grayscale results and then by using a software you can find out what are the features or the cracks is developed so I would be more interested in finding out you know what is the length what is the width what is the depth of these cracks what is the intersection angle what is the area which is getting included in one of the crack so for me this thing becomes a sector so if I want to correlate the area the thickness of the crack the length of the crack and the time it takes to complete pattern get form this would yield a lot of interesting results this is a game of patience I hope you are realizing somebody has to really sit down and do all this type of micro mechanics modeling over months and years this show the beautiful third dimension of the crack I hope you can realize that this much scale is 200 micrometer so what is that we have done is we have if you go back to this image and if you if I want to see what are the features of these cracks in the third dimension perpendicular to the plane and what is the width of this crack at a given point of time then this type of analysis is done it looks like a canal separating the two islands but truly speaking these are two splits of the soil samples because of the desiccation cracks so I am more interested in finding out the area of the crack width and depth over a period of time because this can billion with the tensile strength so from this type of analysis we came out with this function that is the crack width equal to maximum crack width which can be attained by a soil mass and this is a ratio of the moisture contents corresponding to the cracking time and the saturation moisture content volumetric and a is some coefficient why these analysis is being done when user agencies like sports you know their approach you their objective is that the picture should not crack in the very beginning of the match commentators are some second they all were third day onwards which will start taking turn and spin and whatever so you can design the pictures like this you can design the terms like this you can design your geo structures like this where depending upon the time how much strength should be mobilized in the form of tensile strength so suppose a landfill cover a lot of methane gas is going to get generated inside and I want to make sure that the methane pressure is not going to be high enough - first of all crack the top covers for that what I can do is I can provide some methane collection points from where I can suck out the methane which gets developed in the system but because the landfills are huge in area so every point you cannot cover by installing a you know gas collection points it might be possible where the internal pressures are building up so high in the landfills that they might influence the stability of the top covers so I can do a reverse analysis a material which has a tendency to show this much of the maximum crack width at a given moisture content if it happens how to retrofit the system and that's what my PhD student Patricia did we devised my materials which can be injected into the soil mass to stop cracking of the soils I hope you understand how the philosophies can be developed out of simple research ideas and you can give a solution to the industry this is where we did the very advanced study which is known as the three dimensional is a microscopy extremely expensive equipment we had this in our laboratory and we could utilize this type of a system a laser beam can be utilized to fathom the third dimension of the crack so it depends upon the concepts of the physics where the light scattering is minimum in case of laser beams and as the name suggests that this is the microscopy which is done up to the third dimension so you know the cross-section of the crack that is the length and the width and you can obtain the depth also third dimension also if I start with the sample you can see very clearly the cracks growing in different directions I wanted to study the depth of the crack which gets developed this is how the grayscale model has been developed out of the real-life picture and this is how we can slice the crack at different different locations so I hope you can realize that this is sort of a valley formation which is quite visible all this is happening at the micro and nano scale because most of the Airlines crack cannot be seen by naked eyes and that's why you require a very high resolution lasers photography or microscopy to do these type of studies this work was done by my PhD scholar dr. color and hope you can realize now this is the third dimensional modeling of the cracks which have been done and this is how we develop lot of mathematical models and we propose the relationships where tensile strength can be related with the length width and depth of the cracks provided the soil properties unknown these type of studies are becoming very contemporary in environmental geomechanics I hope you can realize so this was the initiation of the work which we did in our laboratory as I said most of the disposal facilities be radioactive or you know landfills or domestic waste or toxic waste facilities there are people want these type of studies to be done so that the best possible solutions can be provided now in the current era where research is heading towards the gas migration in geo materials which was done by my rather PhD scholar and some part of this is now being done by jasmine my another master's student I hope you'll realize that unless we are sure about the cracking characteristics of the soils the gas migration studies cannot be done because if cracks develop in the Geo materials there are chances that the gas may short-circuit the entire porous media so it's not only the area of the cross section of cracks which is very useful for us is the third dimension also which is very important which would tell you whether the migration in the system is through the porous media or it is bypassing the porous media and coming all the cracks so these type of studies now I am extending and I am collaborating with different companies who are very eager to come out with the solutions so that they can apply it in the real life I would say this is something which is the future of environmental geomechanics I hope you must have got an idea about where these type of studies are being done now another interesting thought came to our mind that let us find out what are the tensile stresses which are developing in the thin films so we got motivated by seeing the process of chips manufacturing potato chips please first requirement of making the chips is that the chips should be easily packable they should not get damaged and they should be thin imagine a chip which is quite thick what will happen people not accept it it has to be thin it has to be crisp the same time when you are marketing it when you are transporting it they should not get crumbled so this was the idea which we had when we approached these companies were manufacturing chips that you know what type of knowledge they use and we'll be surprised to know that most of the research in geomechanics has been done on cracking characteristic loss files by using the starch which has been extracted from potatoes so these are known as artificial soils so they have used the starch from the potato and then they have treated this as a homogeneous material to study the crack formation in the soils but what we did is we went on with the real-life situations and we used a very sophisticated setup which is again laser operated system this was done by mass was a student solution Shinde and what we did is we used the concept of the cantilevers and these cantilevers are clamped at one side of the system and then there is a silicon wafer silicon wafers are extremely sensitive systems which will deform when you put a small drop of clay so clays are dissolved in water and one or two drops of the clays are taken in the suspension form and poured on the silicon wafer as the drying takes place the silicon wafer bends and the movement or the displacement of the tip of the silicon wafer is measured with the help of the laser source on a detector so if I know that from the initial to the final state the deflection in the beam is X L 1 and L 2 are the geometrical parameters of the laser source and the detector theta is the detection angle I can interlink everything and I can obtain the Sigma T as this function all right so X upon L is nothing but theta term and I can find out what is the final thickness of the plate film if the initial is known and ER is the evaporation rate multiplied by the time so if you take the in the petri dish and expose it to the environment as the weight loss occurs after certain time the weight of the petri dish becomes constant this is a critical time the slope of this line is going to give me the elastic modulus which I can substitute over here and I can get the final thickness of the film TF naught is the initial thickness TF is the final thickness and then X is a function of time and X is a function of Sigma T also and X is the deflection incidentally if you remember X is nothing but the deviation of the laser beam so the more and more evaporation of the drop of a particle or the clays occurs the bending takes place in the silicon wafer and x increases and this is how the tensile strength is getting mobilized so this is a plot of X verses V time which can be correlated with Sigma T versus time so wherever we have the peak that is the tensile strength of the material so this was the interesting effort which was done by my master's student Sudarshan Shinde and we did the complete SEM micrography of the process to understand how the cracking gets initiated in the case so this is the initial sample and hope you can realize that there is the opening up of a crack at different magnification you know this is how the crack initial occurs and if you see it at very high magnification this is how the cab gets opened up these cracks develop in the whole system you wanted to make a video of the entire process it requires very expensive status for that and from these simple experiments we did some relationships where the tensile strength has been linked with the thickness of the film of the clay and tensile strength has been linked with the L by s ratio that is the liquid to solid ratio of the case these are the topics of you know multi-phase geomechanics those of you who might be interested or might land up doing this type of rnd would be dealing with this type of problems which are very intricate very very complicated and they test your nerves but then this is what the cutting edge searches internationally right now one of the applications of all these studies which I have talked about is synthesis of self-healing and self-sealing minerals I don't know whether you have come across these type of minerals or not these are synthetic minerals which are quite in demand in the market because these are also known as intelligent minerals so they understand the mood of the environment and the environment in which they are located and then they behave accordingly a lot of you know chemical processes are involved in creating these type of minerals and I wish to synthesize these minerals in the near future the beauty is that these type of minerals have a you know backup memory so if i intrude them in the case or the concrete and in case because of desiccation the cracking takes place these minerals immediately react and whatever fluid is contained in them spreads out and they seal the cracks so imagine if your these type of minerals are included in the concrete and turf's of the Clay's or the landfill's this will be a pool so these minerals possess built-in ability to stop swelling and shrinking and cracking properties they are known as intelligent minerals and their synthesis would be quite useful for various applications related to civil engineering geotechnical engineering and concrete in the real life unfortunately a multidisciplinary area where we would like to sit with the chemical engineers environmental scientists and make minerals intelligent so through today's discussion what I have done is I have tried to give you an overall idea about where the subject is heading and what all is happening in this area I am sure that you must have realized that not needs to be done before this becomes a well read when well understood subject [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause]
