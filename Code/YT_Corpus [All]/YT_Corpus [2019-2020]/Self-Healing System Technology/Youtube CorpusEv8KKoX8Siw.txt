 in this day and age if you have a computer a tablet a cell phone you probably have a whole bunch of different cables to hook them up and charge them you probably have fistfuls of adapters so you can hook things up to your gear that's a problem for me and my workflow what do you do with these things when you're not using them it's probably a problem for you too and it needs to be solved my name is Eric Strebel I'm an industrial designer welcome to my channel about product design and making I hope that you like and joy and become a subscriber I considered some of the cable holders that are available online made out of bent sheet metal but they didn't really suit my needs as they were too wide or didn't hold the cables the way I wanted I even downloaded something from the internet but the little fingers were spaced too far apart so I did this initial sketch based on those other things you just saw but it was a little too wide for me and I wanted something that was stacked on top of itself so that it could work in the space that I need it and in this case that's gonna be my vocal booth so right now in my vocal booth the little adapters just hang out on the shelf where my keyboard is and getting away and fall on the floor and that's no good there's a link here in the top right to the full-length version of this sketch that I'm doing right now okay so this is our plan so normally I would probably make a cardboard model and I would love to do that in this case to sort of get a sense of the scale but I'm in a time crunch with other projects and so we're gonna build this in CAD and 3d print it so even though this will take longer point a bit longer to make a model it's gonna consume less of my actual physical time to do this so let me explain this it takes me maybe an hour to model it in the computer at which point the printer will then take 15 hours let's say to print out the two parts at a decent resolution if I didn't go this route I would go right into making a cardboard model maybe that would take me three four hours and boom I would be done maybe I might make a final one out of styrene it would still be less total time if that makes sense but do two other projects I need to go this route and that sometimes happens and you have to manage your time that way when you're doing different design projects now my buddy Alex gave me a spool of poly smooth he doesn't own an Ultimaker and for some reason had a school that fits the Ultimaker don't know poly smooth you say what is that so poly smooth prints like PLA I use the exact same settings but it reacts with alcohol and here I'm laying down some 70% isopropyl alcohol to kind of test things out and basically what it does is it melts the plastic now I didn't have a lot of luck with the 70% but then I moved to stronger alcohol 91% and I got much better results and the surface started to get a little bit shiny all right so just after applying the 90% 91% you can see it's definitely more glossy no the alcohol softens the plastic and it stays in a soft state for a little while so you have to let it dry but basically it smooths out the high spots and the low spots and you get a smooth surface yeah it's definitely a lot more brittle I broke one and it wasn't too hard so I don't think it's nearly as tough as the PLA granted the build line is going exactly in the direction that I broke it in so it's a little tough to say do I think it's worth it mmm not really reminds me of the old resin printer days and I'm done with that but if you need a smooth print it may be the way to go Wow so this turned out really really good great place to store my cables with all my little adapters on the top I'm gonna post a link below to Thingiverse where I'm posting the STL and step file for this so you can print one out for yourself and hopefully it'll be useful for you as well leave a link in the comments if you're going to print one out and post on social media at BOTS InDesign so I can see what color you made it and where you used it I'm probably gonna print two more one for the shop and one for the studio where my computer lives now make sure you give the video a thumbs up and feel free to promote on your social media platform of choice that is really gonna help me grow the channel the most with your support thank you make sure you give the video a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already done so hey and don't forget to follow me on social media I'm on Facebook sometimes Twitter usually and now Instagram rock on click here to check out some of the other design and making videos that I have that you might enjoy
