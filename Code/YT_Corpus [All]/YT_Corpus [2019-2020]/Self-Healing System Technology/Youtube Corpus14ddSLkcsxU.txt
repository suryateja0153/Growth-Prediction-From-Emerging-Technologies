 [Music] you know what if what if my data center infrastructure was a little more self-aware and took a little bit more active role in staying healthy you know that might be that might be useful in times like this so you know if your infrastructure could maybe be maybe self managing to some extent maybe self healing to some extent and maybe even self optimizing you know those would all be good things you know in kind of a a modern AI controlled infrastructure so if it could tell you how to improve its own performance or optimize its own resources and maybe even predict its own future growth needs you know these are all things that would be really nice to have in the data center and what's really amazing is that today if you have HP infrastructure in your data center you kind of already have the foundation to enable this the HP ecosystem that kind of knits this all together is known as HPE info site [Music] now HP info site came to the HPE ecosystem through the acquisition of nimble storage and since that time HPE has been expanding info site to really encompass its entire hybrid IT kind of ecosystem all the things that make up its hybrid IT offerings so today not only does info site support nimble but it also supports 3par prime era which is the newest member of the HP storage family simplicity which is the hyper-converged offering from HP enterprise and then also servers that fall into either the synergy or BladeSystem kind of bladed compute paradigm or the standard HPE ProLiant or apollo servers all of these kinds of infrastructure are now supported to some degree or another within the HP info site ecosystem [Music] info site provides global visibility into the current state of all of your infrastructure dashboards and drill downs let you see an explore your infrastructure and it's it's a single cloud hosted portal hosted by HPE you're not paying for it up in the cloud and things like that so first and foremost global visibility kind of the second thing that rolls along with this and this is what the nimble customers really appreciated was the simplified support experience all of the warranty and support contract information is right at your fingertips allows you to do end-of-life planning and asset management and also assist with for more impacting recommendations so those are some of the very you know kind of customer facing and incidentally acknowledgeable things that info site not can do for you but what's really cool is what's behind the scenes info sites predictive analytics engine is always observing and correlating and learning from the data that it's receiving across the entire installed base of HPE infrastructure it uses this data to automate support case generation provide pre-emptive recommendations and even blacklist certain combinations of software and firmware to head off known issues these kinds of things are paramount to protecting your data availability and integrity as you move forward in more of an automated data center environment [Music] so what do you need to get started with something like HP info site well as I said it's you need some HPE infrastructure some HPE gear but anybody that is running nimble or 3par or primary storage should already be using HP info site if they're also running VMware they really should take a look at the cross stack analytics that help optimize would provide more predictive capacity and performance information you know for the VMware and storage ecosystem for people that are running HPE simplicity the hyper-converged offering from HP enterprise those environments are supported with versions 3 7 8 and beyond I think the most current version is somewhere in the 4x area so most customers are getting to the point if they're staying current on upgrades where they can enable em through site capability within simplicity and we can help if if you're you know struggling with that now for HPE ProLiant and Apollo server customers as long as you have something that's gen 8 or newer what you do is you use this on-premises tool called ILO amplifier it's a little vm that runs in your environment and what it does is it talks to all of the isle o ports on your servers and aggregates all that health information and funnels it up to the info sight portal and so that's where you get the dashboard information on all the health the warranty and all that information and if you choose to use the agentless management system that can embed within the bootable operating environment of those servers you can even get some security notifications for things like login attacks denial of service attacks and things like that that might only really show up you know at the OS level so it's a super powerful environment that kind of runs in the background and provides you notifications of things that might take you forever to find out on your own really kind of that self-aware self-healing and self optimizing kind of future automated data center that we're all kind of hoping for [Music] [Music]
