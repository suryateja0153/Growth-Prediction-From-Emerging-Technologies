 Everything we as human beings have created on this planet but they essentially first created in our minds. All that you see which is human work on this planet first found expression in the mind then it got manifested in the outside world so one thing we need to understand is the wonderful things that we have done on this planet and the horrible things that we have done on this planet both have come from the human mind so if we are concerned as to what we create in this world it's extremely important that first of all, we learn to create the right things in our mind how we keep our minds if we do not have the power to keep our minds the way we wanted what we create in the world is also going to be very accidental and haphazard so learning to create our minds the way we want is the basis of creating the world the way we want there is a wonderful story in the yogic lore on a certain day a man took a walk he went for a long walk accidentally unawares he walked into paradise fortunate isn't he just took a walk and he landed up in paradise after this long walk, he felt a little tired so he thought oh I am tired I wish I could rest somewhere he looked around there. there was a nice tree underneath which there was very cushiony grass so it was inviting he went and put his head down there and slept after a few hours he woke up well-rested and he thought oh I am well rested but I'm feeling hungry I wish I had something to eat and he thought about all the nice things that he ever wanted to eat in his mind and instantly all those things appeared in front of him you need to understand there the services like that hungry people don't ask questions food came and he ate stomach became food then he thought oh my stomach is full I wish I had something to drink all the nice things that he ever wanted to drink he thought about it and all of them just appeared drinking people also don't ask questions so he drank [Music] now with a little bit of alcohol in him you know Charles Darwin told you all of your monkeys your tail fell away not me Charles Darwin told you that you were all monkeys and your tail fell away and then you became human yes definitely the tail fell away but the monkey in yoga, we always refer to an unestablished mind you as marketer which means a monkey why we are referring to the mind is a monkey yes what are the qualities of a monkey one thing about a monkey is it's a necessary moment and another thing about the monkeys if I say you're monkeying somebody what does it mean imitation monkey an imitation has become synonymous so these two essential qualities of a monkey is very much the qualities of an unestablished mind unnecessary moment you don't have to learn it from the monkey you can teach it to the monkey and imitation his full-time job of the mind so when these two qualities are on a mind is referred to as a monkey so this monkey became active within him he just looked around but what the hell is happening here I asked for food food came I asked for drink drinking there must be gross around here and ghosts came oh the ghosts have come they're going to surround me and torture me he thought immediately the ghost surrounded him and started torturing him then he started screaming in pain and said oh they're going to kill me and he died just now he said you know he's a fortunate being the problem is he was sitting under a "Kalpavriksha" or a "Wishing Tree" he asked for food, food came he asked for drink, drink came he asked for ghosts, ghosts came he asked for torture torture came he asked for death, death happened now don't go looking for these kalpavruksha in the forest you can barely find a tree these days a well-established mind a mind which is in a state of some "Mukti", he is referred to as a "kalpavriksha" (wishing tree)... If you organize your mind to a certain level of organization it, in turn, organizes the whole system your body your emotion your energies everything is organized in the direction once all these four dimensions of you your physical body your mind your emotion and the fundamental life energies are organized in one direction once you are like this anything that you wish happens without even lifting a little finger actually it would help to assist it with activity but even without doing any activity you can still manifest what you want if you organize these four dimensions in one direction and keep it unwavering in that direction for a certain period of time right now the problem with your mind is every moment it is changing its direction it is like you want to travel somewhere and every two steps if you keep changing your direction the question of you reaching the destination is very remote unless it happens by chance so organizing our minds and in turn organizing the whole system and these four basic dimensions of who you are right now in one direction if you do this you are a couple of show yourself anything that you wish will happen but right now if you look at your lives everything that you are wished for till now if it happens you've finished everything and everybody that you have desired for if all of that lands up in your house today could you live with that so if you want to become empowered it is also important that you become responsible as to what you ask for and what you don't right now the world situation is just this we are hugely empowered with technology today it doesn't take six six billion people to destroy this planet one man by pressing the wrong button can destroy the whole planet when we are empowered like this it's very important that our physical action emotional action mental action and energy actions are controlled and properly directed if it is not so we become destructive self-destructive right now that is our problem the technology which is supposed to make our life beautiful and easy has become the source of all the problem that we are destroying the very basis of our life which is the planet so what should have been a boon we are making occurs out of it what has brought incredible levels have comfort inconvenience to us in the last hundred years or so has also become a threat to our lives simply because we are not conscious action we are in a compulsive state of action so organizing our minds fundamentally mean moving from a compulsive state of activity to a conscious state of activity you might have heard of people for whom they asked for something and beyond all expectations it came true too true for them generally this happens to people who are in faith now let's say you want to build a house if you start thinking oh I want to build a house... to build a house I need 50 lakhs but I have only 50 rupees in my pocket not possible not possible not possible the moment you say not possible you are also saying I don't want it so on one level you are creating a desire that you want something on another level you are saying I don't want it so in this conflict it may not happen someone who has some faith in a God or in a temple or whatever who is her simple-minded faith works only for those people who are simple-minded thinking people, people who are too much thinking for them it never works a childlike person who has a simple faith in his God at his temple of whatever he goes to the temple and says Shiva, I want a house I don't know how you must make it for me now in his mind there are no negative thoughts will it happen will it not happen is it possible is it not possible these things are completely removed by the simple act of faith now he believes she will do it for him and it will happen so if she was going to come and build your house no, I want you to understand God will not lift his little finger for you what you refer to as God, he's the source of creation as a creator he has done a phenomenal job there's no question about it could you think of a better creation than this is it in anybody's imagination to think anything better than what is there right now so as a creator, he has done his job wonderfully well but if you want life to happen the way you want it because right now the very crux of your happiness and your well-being is this if at all if you're unhappy the only and only reason why you're unhappy is life is not happening the way you think it's that's all it is so if life is not happening the way you think it should happen you're unhappy if life happens the way you think it should happen you are happy it's as simple as that so if life has to happen the way you think it should happen first of all how do you think with how much focus you think how much stability is there in your thought and how much reverence is there in the thought process will determine whether your thought will become a reality or is it just an empty thought or how you do not create any impediments for your thought by creating a negative thought process is something possible are not possible is destroying humanity what is possible and not possible is not your business, it's nature's business! Your business is just to strive for what you want right now you're sitting here if I ask you two simple questions I want you to just look at this enhancers right now from where you're sitting can you just fly off you say no right now from where you're sitting can you get up and walk you'll say yes what is the basis of this why you say no to flying and yes to walking because vast experience of life many times you've gotten up on walked never did you fly off or in other words you're using the past experience of life as a basis for deciding whether something is possible or not possible or in other words you have decided that what has not happened till now cannot happen in your life in future this is a disgrace to humanity and the human spirit what has not happened till now on this planet can happen tomorrow human beings are capable of making it happen tomorrow so what is possible and what is not possible is not your business that is nature's business Nature will decide that you just see what is it that you really want and strive for that and if your thought is created in a powerful way without any negativity without any negative thoughts bringing down the intensity of the thought process it will definitely manifest the whole existence. Today modern science is proving is just a reverberation of energy it is a vibration. Similarly, your thought is also vibration if you generate a powerful thought and let it out it will always manifest itself so generally, people are using faith as a means to remove the negative thought today once you have become thinking human beings your faith is not too deep it doesn't matter how much faith you think you have somewhere doubts always crop up right now the way your minds are made this moment if God appears right here you will not surrender to him you will want an investigation whether he's really God or not with this kind of mind you should not waste your time on faith so there is an alternative which is commitment if you simply commit yourself to creating what you really care for now once again your thought gets organized in such a way there is no such thing as to whether it's possible or not possible there is no hurdle in your thought process your thought flows freely towards what you want once this happens making it happen will also naturally follow so to create what you really care for a first and foremost thing is that what you want must be well manifested in your monitor and this is what I want is that what you really want you must look at it because of any number of things in your life you have thought this is it the moment you reach there you realize that's not it. It's the next one and the next one and the next one so what is it that one really wants is one thing, first of all, we must explore once that is clear and we are committed to creating it now there is a continuous process of thought in the direction once you can maintain a steady stream of thought without changing direction definitely this is going to happen in your life or it will definitely manifest as a reality so either you make this human form into your kalpavruksha or you make it into one big mess which is happening all over one reason why we have not created the kind of world that all of us would want to live in is too many people are busy looking up too many people are interested in other planets they are not interested in this planet but every aspect of their life they're checking out with other planets and further too many people are in service of heaven they are not on service of this earth I think right now we need people or in service of this earth not heaven I believe if Heaven is closer to divine them where we are if that is so I believe they're little more organized in us they don't need help from us this has been a major problem on the planet anything that is valuable for a human being anything that is good the highest aspects of human life have unfortunately been exported to heaven for example if you say love people say God is loving we do not know whether God is loving or not human beings are capable of love it is very very important that people understand human beings are capable of Lao human beings are capable of compassion human beings are capable of joy and blissfulness all the good things that are possible for a human being, unfortunately, have been exported to heaven if we want to create the kind of world that we want to we need to understand whatever you refer to as God the idea of God has entered our mind only because we have seen the creation around us because there is creation we have assumed a creator God is a great creator what you refer to as God he is the source of creation that source of creation has not failed us has done a fantastic job but now the question is about management if you want to leave the management in the hands of the creator he will manage it in his own way according to his agenda but that's not what you want you want life to happen the way you want it now, for example, let's say all of you here are the India soccer team for the next World Cup and I am the coach so these next four years everything that you need to know about football is taught to you everything that I know about football is poured into you in so many ways now the time to play the match has come you're on the field and the ball comes near your foot but you look at me and it's no good you've seen those coaches sitting there and boiling nothing happens because now once you're on the field it's your job so this is the same thing the Creator has done a fantastic job now you're here it is for you and me to see how to manage this how we want it how to keep this world how in what condition would all of us enjoy it best is something that we have to look at so at every stage in our life we tend to think this is it if this one thing happens everything will be fine with my life you reach there and you realize that's not it and you postpone it to something else and something else this is going on the first and foremost thing is you must be clear what is it that you really want if you do not know what you want the question of creating it doesn't arise if you look at what you really want what every human being wants is he wants to live joyfully he wants to live peacefully in terms of its relationships he wants it to be loving and affectionate or in other words all that any human being is seeking for he's pleasantness within himself pleasantness around him even this pleasantness if it happens in our body we call this help and pleasure if it happens in our mind we call this peace and joy if it happens in our emotion we call this love and compassion if it happens in our energy we call this blissfulness and ecstasy this is all that a human being is looking for whether he is going to his office to work he wants to make money build a career build a family he sits in the bar sits in the temple he is still looking for the same thing pleasantness within pleasantness around if this is what we want to create I think it's time we addressed it directly and commit ourselves to creating it so you want to create yourself as a peaceful human being joyful human being loving human being a pleasant human being in all levels and do you also want a world like this a peaceful world a loving world a joyful world no, no I want greenery I want food when we say a joyful world that means everything that you want has happened so this is all that you're looking for so all that you need to do is commit yourself to creating it to create a peaceful joyful and loving world both for yourself and everybody around you every day in the morning if you start your day with this simple thought in your mind that today wherever I go I will create a peaceful loving and joyful world if you fall down a hundred times in the day what does it matter for a committed man there is no such thing as failure if you fall down 100 times 100 lessons to be learned if you commit yourself like this to creating what you really care for now your mind gets organized once your mind get organized the way you think is the way you feel your emotional get organized once your thought and emotion is organized your energies will get organized in the same direction once your thought emotion and energies are organized your very body will get organized once all these four are organized in one direction you are ability to create and manifest what you want is phenomenal you are the Creator in many ways why I am saying you are the creator ease I want you to look at the nature of your life right now if you eat a banana in four hours time this banana becomes a human being there is something within you a life creating process a process which builds this body the manufacturer of these bodies within you give him a banana he makes a human being out of that banana transforming a banana and your human being is not a small thing it is a phenomenon it is just that this phenomenon is happening within you unconsciously if you could only consciously manifest this making a banana and your human being you are the creator you are nothing less than that as the theory of evolution goes to make a monkey into a human being it took millions of years over an afternoon you can make a banana into your human being or whatever else a piece of bread that you eat into a human being so the very source of creation is functioning within you if you organize these four dimensions of mind emotion body and energy in one direction the source of creation is with you, you are the Creator what you want to create will happen to effortlessly once you're organized like this now you are not a mess you are a cult for fiction you have the power to create what you want there are tools and technologies as to how to organize the system in such a way that instead of being a psychological mess you can make yourself into your culpa bookshop this culture these traditions the whole technology of yoga is just about this transforming yourself from being just a piece of creation to the creator himself this is not in search of God this is in search of becoming a god this is not in search of divine this is in search of becoming divine because that which you call as divine that which is the source of existence is throbbing within you every moment of your life otherwise a piece of bread cannot become a human being in the course of an afternoon so shifting from being just a piece of flesh and blood to become a creator there is a whole science and technology for this there are tools to make this happen that which is the source of creation is functioning within you every moment of your life it is just that have you kept access to that dimension or not organizing the four basic elements of your life will give you that excess there are tools and technologies to do this the whole science of yoga the whole technology that we refer to as yoga is just about this transforming yourself from being just a piece of creation to become a creator for example 100 years ago if I picked up something like this and I start speaking it speaking to someone who is across in another part of the world you would think it's some kind of a miracle either I must be a messenger or a son or maybe God himself but today this is just another gadget that every one of us carry and use today is sitting here without using this instrument if I speak to someone, someone in another part of the world it is still a miracle for you so this instrument happened or because of human mind wanting it to happen 100 years ago nobody thought this was possible but today it is just a common thing similarly many many many things which are not in our perception yet can be brought into our perception and our ability to create our lives can be greatly enhanced so first and foremost thing is to organize the mind and to organize your emotions body and energy that line once this happens you are in touch with the fundamental life creating a process within you once you are in touch with it once you're in excess of that power you have the power to create you have the power to create your life and your surroundings the way you want it because we have lost our power to create we are making a mess out of our selves and the world around us if we operate it as the true creator as it is operating within us creating this body for us if we could create our lives with the same sense of organization and sense of purpose this world and the human being would be in a completely different state it is my wish and my blessing that every human being in this world should have this access to the source of creation within himself so that he can function here as a creator not just as a piece of creation
