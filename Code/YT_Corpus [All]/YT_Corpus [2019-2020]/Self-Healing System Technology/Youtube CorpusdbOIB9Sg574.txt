 [Music] [Music] hi guys and I'm just gonna explain a little bit about what we're doing today and then we're going to introduce and Hasler Navarre not so much and then gonna throw it over to you guys for a little bit to talk about like what you do and like the important and how it came to be and we're gonna start with you guys finished your hopes and then we'll go on to hear some of the incredible work that Salma's doing um hi guys my name is alia I'm one of the associate curators of the department of dreams and we've really been looking at like how do we imagine what's possible and what changes sometimes taking things from the past sometimes from the future are sort of times of presidents sometimes picking it out nowhere and today's session is one very close to my heart and looking at how we use the things that we eat and consume to like lead to a healing feature whether that is with in spirituality mental health physical health and especially in the midst of a pandemic where we're currently at how we can use some of the medicine of our ancestors to really like help push us forwards and to be okay because if all we have is ourselves to control and let's see what we can do I'm joined by the brilliant dish your halves so half the ether somewhere and Nirvana suffer and so have Salma and Melanie from seeds of Salman on Instagram all which are doing some incredible work looking into health and nutrition and how we use herbs food different like medicinal things in order to pay for ourselves it's going to be like a very informal conversation I was just saying this is now more like the way that conversation is just like a podcast we're just not area now people might swear some people might not like this is a very free and open space hamdullah and so we're going out we're going to jump straight in sophie robinson sends her apologies for not being able to be here today but we'll catch up with her post festival with hopefully some other events we're gonna jump straight in and obviously you guys at dis your home and more about what you guys do how it came about and like what the mission is we've been best friends yeah each other at schools so we've known each other I think since we're about 12 or 13 years old probably I think 12 and we've been through pretty much everything together in life in general so we like like that like whether it's like boy issues or work problems or anything in life just everything we've we've been through it all with each other but what's amazing is that our passions really collided really nicely so we both love really like we really love to cook yes you know I'm Iranian and we're both very much still connected to our roots so we just exchanged yeah all the time and what do our culture's say about healing yourself in terms of herbs and nutrition and things like that and taking from what our cultures say and so we thought well we both love cooking you're a trained herbalist so how do we kind of marry the two together and we created this your HAP so what we do is we incorporate herbs ancient herbs and medicinal to you everyday cooking so we'll make like things like cakes or like yeah and normally people think natural stinging or disgusting actually so yeah it's just more about you know people I think being a medical herbalist I know that a lot people don't like the taste of herbs as medicine so we thought how can we put that into an easier way to intake them you know especially for kids kids don't like bitters they don't like things that taste bit pungent so we looked at making like chamomile ice lollies gummies for kids like teenagers like using rosemary and things I've got to kind of open up their sinuses and I can up their Airways and their minds to get them thinking you know so we've really had to kind of it's been a challenge but really fun and exciting to look at how we can incorporate the medicine into modern-day food and all the trends that go on as well and just kind of incorporates it all together yeah it's been it's been really exciting and we only just launched in January so you guys it's my new friends but we're loving it yeah yeah we did yeah we did I think you know with quarantine and lockdown and everything it's been a bit challenging but when I've had time I've gone on my walks enhanced even I forage and I've learned I've it's a learning curve for me even though I've been doing this like six years it's still as a herbalist I'm still discovering things and learning so yeah it's been and we're each other's guinea pigs yeah and then like the plantain pancakes yeah various things I just think the weight doesn't make some things up is so like interesting yeah you know when you say oh we use her medicine in our foods I think sometimes you might think oh but we're trying to make it you know tasty and easy as well because it's not sometimes herbal medicine can be hard to get hold of living in the city you know you might want to go outside where you know outside of London Epping or whatever likes the bigger forests and look for stuff but actually there was there is a lot available it's just knowing where to find it yeah what to look for and we kind of want to bring that herbal essence to Londoners and make your own medicine my um you know just enjoy enjoy it exactly I think you super important point there the fact that these things are easily accessible it's just by the No I think sometimes like that knowledge element is what is missing and then that then limits are not only that availability but us even thinking that though there are those possibilities yeah and you also mentioned rosemary oil which means selling I were just talking about and so over to Salma I think the first time I like found out about your work was during Khalid Ramadan and you were doing an IG live with is diva mag but anyone who doesn't know is even mag go check them out and they do something work like basing like women from like the Middle Eastern region and just do it right activities like workshops and their content is just ten out of ten I'm a big fan and but yeah so you were doing an IG live with them and talking about like nutrition and health and like the spirituality element and I was just like you're talking so much and so I just just wanted to like explain a little bit more about the things that you do like what centers work and the importance of nutrition so thank you Aliya interesting my name is summer and I recently graduated from UCO where I studied medicinal natural products in photochemistry so a lot of that was looking at the urban constituents and how we can into plants to heal I'm quite aunty like Big Pharma I'm just enraged I have been sick and we're really becoming out of touch so following and I think after I actually okay this time last year I did my first event where I was looking at sort of consciousness but from a mission perspective because all of these conscious paid is not great but I wasn't seeing anyone like reaches from a religious perspective so I just throw myself out there talk about a bit about energy healing ancient medicine because it's like something I really I take inspiration from and then following my submission of my dissertation in September I decided to launch my page season summer where I decided to continue on I'm talking about consciousness and energy visibly a visible Muslim and I did a few events as well and I'm hoping to do more events in the future because there's a real need for this conversation and to see things like a decolonized lens as well yeah because your actuality spirituality herbal medicine yoga things like that have unfortunately been commodified I aim to do is to shed is to give credit to where it's due you know the ancient the ancestors who in their knowledge passed it on but we don't give them the credit unfortunate it's just another money-making Pat canal so so yeah through my work I aim to continue just teaching and sharing what I do know and I'm hoping to become a health coach in the future I plan on certification so yeah so and I I did find the passion in sharing white know I'm just like for women in particular I'm creating safe spaces as well for women to explore neutrality without being critical fire zone on Bolivar or you know just to be comfortable and to create in my slumming space so that's what I'm continuing to do unlike some of those pockets of like the way that spirituality is often viewed as not being an essential part of Islam or we're not being like the part that I think we like in religion this happens but like we we come back pick and choose and sort of like divorce it from the holistic nature of like the way that religion works and so like I've got a book with the profits medicine and all of it is basically like horrible medicine what we're talking about today unlike the various Hadees that continue to speak about like the importance of looking after your body and how much you eat and how little you eat and all of those things that prove that culture through different transformations of how that take on religion and then change what that outcome of those things are or how its viewed so we then get sort of like a detachment from it being like that holistic thing of mind body and spirit is how we are able to be full actors or full like agents of religious spirituality and I think it's super interesting when you are like told that when you've been talking about like the fact that people are then considered like for doing those things what have I guess some of the people you were speaking to don't those experience has been about trying to merge the two when like the understanding from others might not necessarily be there mm-hmm I think the first thing is we need to understand the religion properly and what it asks of us and to remain firm in your intentions because with the New Age movement as they call it there's been a lot of things like astrology and crystals which is from what we believe in we believe that healing comes from God's knowledge common good and unfortunately what I've seen with the New Age movement so it's a self worship when all of what happens you all look good that ever happens to your health everything is from God so always bring it back to God and like leave aside your ego because if you start to connect with your ego you that's a recipe for disaster I'll handle I'm really wait the sisters who've attended my talk really open-minded I didn't jump to conclusions they allowed me to drift through everything give the the hadith sources right as well to back up my point and then they love them this face doesn't reflect on what I'm saying for a lot of people though it was like they didn't they haven't seen this stuff before so then I could see that they were just trying to understand it and then they would come back to me and just say well give me like a new perspective I hope that through my work I will encourage people to do that when research as well because everything is a journey and you shouldn't not understanding that my specific moment in time but it's a journey to yourself as well and I feel like you get to good you start to understand how you guys that digital hurts how is named but mentioned a little bit earlier how culture informs the way digital heads runs and that I say I just want to like I'm a memory person I love memories what was one of like the initial memories were like things growing on that were from like cultural settings then I guess like wore out the work that you're currently doing or that you like when you're a young girl they bought these feelings and well I mean for me I I was quite lucky I grew up in Iran to Louis about five and I grew up with my grandma great-grandma and my great-great grandma who was ass you know on both sides but one of them was a hundred and thirteen and they were medicine women and every time I had like a belly ache or whatever my nan would do who's actually she's heavily into Islam and her belief but she also taught me a lot about energy and said that if I you know she used to teach me to heat up my hands and put it on my body to feel like comfort a month and fuel like energy moving around me she took me to a woman circle and I was like five years old that was my first experience I saw a Sufi dog and all these women like expressing themselves it was amazing and then I remember I had this like crazy experience where I had like a little wart on my finger and we had a fig tree and she went and picked like this fig that was not ripe at all it was just starting to grow and she took this up and put it on every day for like two days and it went and I was like this is amazing like even though I was little I was like this is magic you know and it kind of just stayed with me and you know these traditions have been passed on and there were times when I was a teenager and I wasn't coming on my period and my mom would give me like parsley and saffron tea or like she'd make things for me like remedies and I just you know I just want to cherish that like what Salman said it's so important to honor our ancestors and the work they've done to continue these traditions and it really terrifies me that I'm scared that Instagram and the social media and this New Age movement is gonna demolish that and take it like it's theirs and make it trendy and so stuff like that in Topshop I've already seen ashwagandha being sold in Topshop which is insane you know I'm really passionate about this and I couldn't keep talking but I'm not going to but that's one of where my story stems from and there's a reason why they all live till their 90s so you know they obviously think I was also conscious to herbs having the plants holding an energy as well and not all plants wiped for all body types and I was taught and I know that we as Iranians we use we've been using sage since they won you know like it's not this big net people of with you know just cleaning their house with this something we've done traditionally to clear space to do prayers you know I just feel like they just deserve so much more respect that's how we're using it but that's my story and what inspires me from smiley or I am from Somalia but my parents were born and raised there and my maternal grandma was a nomad up until I think she was about thirteen years old and then after thirteen she was moved to the capital city and lived there but basically my grandma was a nomad and what that means is essentially you don't have an actual home you're kind of moving from place to place and she was very much raised to like the women nomadic women are responsible for building the house so you get everything together it's not the men who do the house it's the women they are tasked with all the skills so they actually have to build the hut for them she's responsible for looking after camels goats sheep chickens everything and and and and also you can just see and her like in her psyche today she's not one of those I eat those sometimes I used to wish I wanted a really nice like soft gentle grandma who babies you all the time but she's not like that she's very like a strong very tough she can also be like she can also come across as being a bit rude but it's because she doesn't take any BS basically so she's very tough about that but it also chilled down into how she raised my mum my mum born and raised in the city capital city but she was pretty much a city girl but my mum tells me about how even in the sixty they had like a huge type of compound house where they'd have goats they'd have pigeons they'd have chickens and like and you'd every now and again gradually slowly but surely my grandma was the one who's responsible for like slaughtering them and stuff like that but also like as well as that also nomadic life frankincense is really like important to nomads in Somalia so my grandad who's no longer with us like my maternal granddaughter nomads I think until he was about nine or ten and his job was basically when his father died he was responsible for going out to the really really far parts of like the savannas mallya and extracting the frankincense from the trees and then what you would do with the frankincense is a multitude of things you can either chew it and that's apparently really good for your gum health and it's something that my today like we burn frankincense at home so you either burn it or you chew it or you like infuse it into your food because frankincense is like really important to us it's like gold for us like it's so super important for us to like really make sure that you have like I don't think any Somali house doesn't have frankincense because it's that important to our culture it's like central to what we do when you have guests come over before you come over you set in the house you burn a bit of coal you drop it on the coal and the smell of frankincense like you're supposed to like fragrance yourself with it but also it's the element of eating it as well actual it so like it's like a chewing gum it becomes like a thick resin like a chewing gum and that was really important for my parents when I was growing up as well as that there's this specific herb that looks like it looks like hibiscus but I don't remember the Somali name for sorry the English name for it but anytime I had like an infection like a throat infection or like a boil anywhere what my mom would do is you boil it and it looks like it's horrible it tastes nasty that you boil it for a while and then my mom would actually force it down my throat so that was also I had more tradition that we had willingly younger um what's this Somali I'm just seeing someone's name I for the life of me right now I cannot remember but it's always been etched into my night it's it's been etched in mind I just can't remember the name if I remember I'll let you know but there was also that but also if you're ill my mum would literally put together like random halves who you don't know about making soup that's why my remedies always work yeah it's like it's remarkable to see like those traditions have really continued like my mum grew up in the city she didn't really live the same life that my grandparents did but for her that's still really important for her and for me I don't live in my family but I make I make sure that when I clean my house and make sure that like I don't know like I don't live with them but I'm like okay when I clean my house I need to make sure I sent my house I still continue those traditions and I still take into account that my mom has always said to me half so like your house it's based on what you eat if you've got this issue look at this look at this book and then also you mentioned about the book with the prophets medicine the bookshop we've got the chef's in our living room and I have that book as well I remember buying it years ago in Saudi Arabia I went for Umrah and you like you look at all of the different herbs as well like honey honey is really big for really like I guess soothing honey from Yemen and you're not supposed to like I used to accidentally just drizzle it all over my cereal I'm always shouting and she's like no this is supposed to be like you're supposed to like you're supposed to put it in your mouth you let it sit for a little bit and then and then swallow it so those are like really big traditions for that I kind of grew up practicing so that kind of reminds me of like a big part of the course when I'm studying to be a medical herb list was we looked at materia medica and we looked at how certain herbs actually resonate our organs so like an example of Latin or food is like walnuts is good for the brain and it's interesting like to make those kind of connections so there's there's so much that like we should always go to food and herbs first before we go to anything else for our healing they're there for a reason like the divine call it God call it whatever you know the divine out there made this for us for a reason so yeah yeah it's good to carry those traditions for every like disease has been placed on this like I pray the remedy there is a remedy that was created for it and I think that's like I just like linked in with some of those traditions it's my parents and from the Caribbean and converted to Islam in like the nineties and even then I look back at like my Bayesian heritage and not talking to my grandma and he was Muslim but like in wood we had this bark in Barbados school more be when it's it's so bitter he's got it well I hate it growing up oh yeah by this tree that is really good for hypertension really good for lowering like blood pressure on all those things but the way that it's drankin is like moving loads and loads of sugar or loads of glucose on top yeah but like my dad used to take it just straight like without any of the sugar and stuff and we just how and then we grow up and see how good like based on that environment those was called the health issues that were so prevalent in Barbados like hypertension and gout all these different things and there were like specific remedies in that specific geography that were able to deal with those situations as well as like alkaline recipes my grandma every will actually have the macaroni cheese the chicken the whole shebang but you would always have like a cucumber salad and I actually pulled it out cucumber great or whatever and it was basically like I found the dish in an alkaline book the other day and it was talking about like how to increase your immunity and move and I was reading it with regards to that covered we can talk about a little bit in a sec but then I'm just reading there smells like wait that's my grandma's like cucumber green and just with like lemon and lime and like a little pinch of salt and it just like brings people together and it's just she'd have it marinate in and have some Advocaat on it as well and this is what I found really hard when I baccardo started trending because I didn't like them as a child because I've always associated them with my family am i having diabetes because it was something that they ate in order to like counter them and yeah so it's just it's so interesting that you guys say with how these things are now become modified and completely detached from like their their heritage um so um I I wanted to you ask if there was anything you wanted to chip in with regards to the conversation and just having and also like elaborating a little bit more on like some of the nutrition work you've been doing and how that continues to like impact based on the things that we've learnt previously so through I mean the house should be view to completely realistically because we are not a new physical body spiritually and mentally as well and it was expanse you know our Environmental Health Elizabeth so they sort of just radiates outwards so through my work I mean I'm not a registered nutrition since long as a kid and this sounds so cliche like but since I was a kid I remember having this passion I couldn't fix I didn't know where would leave me but I had like a little notebook distracted what I would find clippings of like just might just stick everything so foods and bitumen II and have like a lot home you can either there and I slowly diverged out of that and I'm I'm slowly finding my way back but I'm note by names in a dietitian or nutritionist a passion but I fall into my research so my work I I leave I prefer to leave nutrition to the experts for the time being but what I Center one is in this room you're being switch finding the connection from the extremes long elect community become so colonized and I mean colonized now colonized mines make us think that our relationship to nature it was permitted when in fact Mitzvah for me is one of the biggest signs the intelligence you know I was in running was saying earlier the price I have like these energy intelligence they have a specific each plant is for specific purpose and I think through consciousness until it awareness you become humbled by all of the science and me like a lot of my lessons come from just observing it's learning nature observing my thoughts well not judging accepting on surrendering as well at least one you might have some say no no patient it's crazy on the ante [Music] the antique furniture folks in the clinical setting you know there's been a lot of research that has potential of using it because the number one cause for illnesses is essentially it gave me slight PTSD but am i appreciated it was used as well with like religious figures like a psychoactive component it's really it allows people to connect it's bouncing off what you said I mean everyone works in a different way in this kind of herbal nutritional field but it's really important to understand that there is loads of ways to connect that to the medicine as well and like you said about psychological and the spiritual connection I sometimes I might sound bizarre but I asked the medicine what it wants me to do for the treatment and I that's that is a big conversation itself but I think it's such a huge like nature of such a huge world and it's not there's so many ways to connect to it you know spiritually well and I love I love that you're tapping into that because it's just so not I just want to bring us back like not be debbie downer but like the context were currently in the pandemic I know like by for me how all of you guys have spoken about like I'm the inflammatory nature and how that can sort of help with that viruses and different things and so I know it's been quite a touchy subject during the pandemic but the role of I guess ancient medicine and being able to safeguard our immunity during this of time the use of frosting to strengthen our immune system during this period of time and I just went empty I'm being calm not with you guys and then what are some of like how have you been keeping healthy during the midst of this pandemic and what knowledge have you been sharing with others I I mean I found it very difficult from going I was almost I like to think I'm a conscious person but I realize how unconscious I am I mean I found it really hard to surrender energetically to my lifestyle that I had because I was working so many hours and trying to get my [ __ ] together and I realized that my body was finding it hard to surrender because mentally I wasn't letting go and eventually as I did I realized so many things like to flare up and I think the biggest thing you know the fatigue and everything starts to flare up and I thought I was quite conscious person when it came to my health but it's um for anyone that has gone through something similar it's actually it's amazing to let your body to release and surrender as someone said before to let things come up because our nervous system is so important we kind of disregard that focus on so many other things but our nervous system and how stressed we are and how it causes inflammation the body it's when you let go you actually then start to realize there's other things going on underneath the real root cause of problems start to flare up and then that's when you can kind of work through it but personally for me I think always start with your nervous system because if you start to regulate that then your mind can you know you go into more parasympathetic states and then if there's inflammation or infections or any kind of disease then you kind of work your way through that so but I mean that's my tip for anyone who's been going through anything is really look after your nervous system and surrender don't be scared to let go and kind of let your body do its thing I mean even Cove it in itself as a flu whatever it was a virus type disease it's so easy for people to think when I if I got a bit I'm gonna suppress it and quickly just shut it down I recovered but there's a reason why we need to the body kind of goes through pain and Exxon's you must and a paralyzed you so that things can flow up so suppressing anything is just a big no-no and yeah that's kind of good back to you on it but yeah I know if you want a doll think for me and you're the professionals you know speaking about this from a personal perspective I was um like living the complete opposite to how I am right now right now my life is so peaceful and calm but right endemic I was like super busy working lots also like at the gym non-stop like weightlifting running all the time doing this doing that personal commitments like literally no time to sit down or rest at all and there have been occasions there was also one time last year that I was just had like a very similar work mode where you're just constantly working and you do not have time to rest whatsoever and I kind of drove myself sick at that time because I was just so busy and I didn't have any time to rest no time to sleep but for now what I've kind of done now is I just thought you know what the first few weeks I tried to do my homework outs didn't work out I didn't really like it I really wanted to the rhythm of going into the gym and my routine so I've hardly worked out but I just thought you know what I'm gonna actually take this time to just sit and just be still so I've tried to be as still as possible not making life as crazy pace as it was before and I think it's rewarded me a lot because honestly now like where I am physically in terms of my body and also mentally it's just completely different half so to perhaps in lockdown and I speak to some of my friends and my family about their life pre lockdown and I think a lot of them are saying that they don't think that they really can go back to how it was before just because so much has happened in the past three months so much and you cannot put a number on on you can't put a number on your health you can't put a price on your livelihood you can't put a price on who health you know and I think now it's time for like we're emerging out of it slowly and gradually but a lot of the time we mean we just didn't really have very fruitful or print like kind of the good yeah good ways of living that will conducive to our wider well-being I'm just saying attachment in itself like being inside to trying to get somewhere is like a disease in itself you know if you can't be open to check let go if there's one thing we've learned is you can't control anything I mean in the tension that I guess our everyday regular routines kind of did manifest I know how many people just talked about that game on the tube for example public transport hoping so much what they're saying with regards to the nervous system and how like we're constantly on edge like one thing I always say no sector shoulders and I'm not even aware of it I can hear it but like we build this tension up and then like when we're in a space of intensity or just like general tenseness we're more susceptible to disease and to like being able to take on things that aren't serving for us and I think when quarantine and that complete lockdown like to my housemates had Co bid it was common okay if I could say each one these thing I'm like we were I'm genuinely like very slow-paced but also have a very like hectic hectic schedule so as soon as I was told that I didn't have to do that anymore I was like yay and just got into a new routine very very easily but somehow friends it was really like then they just sat down and because they've been on so much overload and asked me they like they were there was so much more susceptible to like get the disease and then might be irritated by it and like some of the ways we came through it were white using rosemary T and time T I like drinking that so like cleanse their bronchioles also Mincy and garlic and all the things that we would use generally if we had a flu but again because of the hysteria listen to the scene on TV that were continuing you telling us and I am cannot that anxiety are both weren't lack able to receive like the nutrients like you were saying you have to start with your nervous system first before we like take on and those additional things and like a hamdulillah they both like got healed of covert but it was literally like the medicinal medicine and the rest I'm the being tunnels that like you have to drink all this water and look after yourself and just like relax that got them through face it it is exactly like you're saying and thank you so much Salma feelings and I guess like the same question of what do how how is this current context affected how you looking after yourself I mean so with the pandemic and with health in general health is one of those things where you only realize the value of it when it's gone and I think that's one of the important lessons that puts either one has come to terms with is that helpless it should always be your priority and when you look at like ancient systems of medicines and how they about their homes they didn't wait until there were disease they didn't wait for the disease state so everything they would do would be preventative so they would nourish their health through like daily practices and so like the main thing for me that underpins all these ancestral healing lives is awareness consciousness awareness of how you feel in your body and that's something that the meditation and mindfulness practices teaches you is that I mean we're so distracted all the time like brains are just like non-stop and even like how many thoughts do you think you have in a day is roughly 30,000 thoughts and how many of these thoughts are actually leading you to the self-destruction the self-effacing works and it's just about like you were saying earlier about feeling uh something about the and releasing we're never you sure like we need to release find a woman that works for you for me personally it's gentleman I mean it's helped me so much yeah you know yeah gentleman yeah means suppressing Ling whether it's physical state or mental state with me allow it to fester and then at one point it will just explode so just taking things and taking things in your stride and so awareness has been like the number one thing for me and I take inspiration from the grace like and when I talk about ancient medicine I'm specifically talking about to see em so traditional Chinese medicine and I so it's not only a it's not a diet but it's a lifetime it's the philosophy it's something that they lived back because of a to get their lives and unfortunately like the medical system that we see today is only a hundred years old right but the way they go about it is this concept that everyone is the same that everyone has the same like the genetic makeup and broken makeup when in fact we what completely independent and and what I really appreciate with TCM entire is that they take the time to look at you as an individual so one thing but then you've got the emotional state someone's temperament and all of these things can contribute to how you react to different lifestyle factors and and that's why for example two people can have the exact same illness but the symptoms can be different so I think we need to actually go back to our books and start studying because these are the things that they'll never teach you in medical limited to English education because how I'm a missionary would it be right if you take control of your health in meeting that control that because ultimately no one will be better than you do and I've always been skeptic in we're like hundred they're my parents they never resorted to like clothes or personal those always be like okay this is this means that I've pushed my body a bit too far so now I just need to rest and even like with fasting I think it was mentioned earlier like fasting initiates recorders and kamila system there's a phone call on top of you which allows the body to heal and ensure like renewal process and a recycling physically destroys like old if toxic cells and it uses that to make new ones and even like greet physicians like Hippocrates like even in the fifth century wisdom well time ago they knew what they were doing they had this intuition and whenever and his patience with continent was like an ailment or something tell them fast for one to see there's at least at minimum and when you see what's happening today people don't even use them they don't make use of the natural immune system it's almost like it's been worked out and I see a direct link to coloniality though we must have modernize all of these people and all of their ways of being and today they're actually Big Pharma is the only way that we can heal I think you're saying that everyone's body is very specifically different that you have to look on an individual basis yet knowledge that difference is okay and that like within specificity is where the answers are but even like the way that geographical boundaries were created through like the formation of the Scramble for Africa for example that genuinely show that uncomfortability with new ones or difference within the West and so I think that's like part of the narrative that we're fighting so deeply when it's like let's just acknowledge that actually not only does our geographical position and like spacing effects not like the hub's taken but like the remedies that may be needed for some of the things that you can got some of the conditions that we might like courage you might be produced in the West but that actually if we move away from like the homogeneity of turnback pame or any of those things we actually are able to get beneath the surface and I wanted to hear a little bit more about like traditional Chinese medicine and then we're going to take some of the questions that are in the chat right so traditional Chinese medicine it's made of many different concepts and country six but ultimately they believe that everyone its life force energy that they could chew so they live their lives in a way that Marsh's this Chi and this free flowing energy so this free flowing energy goes through meridians so 12 meridians in the female body and think of it like a she's like a stream and I'm these meridians growth from the different organ systems and if you get a blockage of this chief home you're gonna is going to give rise to symptoms and eventually a disease state if the blockage is not relieved so they aim to nourish this Chi and Chi by the way is not just internally it's excellent it exists everywhere everything so from the truth to the wind to the universe everything possesses is Chi as long as it is living so they nourish this Chi from various processes so the number one way is nutritional supplementation if needed following advice and they also do acupressure I can just and it's very specific points in the morning that relate to all their systems and even if you look at like our hands and our feet so specific and the region so by stimulating these you're relieving that tension and that blockage of energy and so they also use like meditative practices like Qi Gong which is a movement which is something that I've recently taken up and really like it was very calming and the whole point is to become aware of this engine and even lick Allah Tesla like one of the greats who unfortunately as many others did not get the recognition of his work so his state of not if you want to understand the secrets of the universe you have to think in terms of energy food preparation if everything requires these things even ask we are electrically being one soul yeast requires 1.500 led yeah and if you look at the cleaning system like our hearts it's the biggest producer story of electromagnetic energy and the brain is wrong I could measure the heart but heart beats and heart waves so they ain't in restore energy and again like I said chorus preventative so for them if they've received reached illness it means that they were neglected everything that should have come before that because ultimate raindrops will eventually call of course it flood um and they also believe in the five in inferi which is that everything that exists internally is a reflection of what its aspects every five elements I'm just so it's a wind metal no real talk and this manifests a it's more symbolic by it manifests itself in organ systems in emotions and seasons in times of the day like it's so it really shows that the relationship with interpersonal relationship we have everyone so for example the fire element is associated heat so what produces heat in our body it's the heart the circulatory system and then the emotion that we associate with the heart is locked and if you have an excess of the fire and then you might be trying to anger extreme frustration but if you're lacking it then it would be things like love don't feel passionate and they aim to re-establish this balance by looking at you as an individual what what elements not imbalance on your exam require a little balance and there's this concept of yin and yang as well as cause like that everything is in balance so yeah that's just it's very interesting I could literally like listen all day go to questions from the chat its poppin off and they want some of your guys advice I was like what are the herbal medicines or like the herbs or it means that you guys take on a daily as part of your routine and why I take I mean like at the moment I'm quite big on my nervous system so I take passiflora Melissa which is lemon balm I take skullcap and I take I take those my nervous system as teas because I just enjoy them they're quite aromatic but then I'm really at the moment I mean I have I have a hub like every now the knife really connected and I rinse it out to really experience it right now I love ashwagandha because it's a adaptogenic which means that it's so clever it will balance your body so if something is high or bring it low and vice versa it really supports the adrenal glands at the stress levels and right now obsessive nettles because I've said well like I believe in eating with insulin and it's natural is popping off and we did loads of nettles so that's my herb but yeah at the moment I'm kind of you know like I said nervous system is the key with everything going on and occasionally like you know with cooking I mean we add loads of spices worries new time and all that anyway and garlic for immunity so yeah and for me like you said you're big on your nervous system I'm big on balancing out my hormones so I deal with a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome which means that there's an imbalance of hormones and so for me I'm kind of like trying to balance it's like a delicate balance of estrogen versus the testosterone and so on so I we've been both drinking experiment II suspend the tea is really good for balancing hormones testosterone also I'm really big on ashwagandha as well I drink that every night so I just get a bit of a power mix that into like either a tea or coconut water and then just down it and then after that I just really after I think about our it really mellows you out and then I've noticed that when I wake up in the morning I'm like like a spring chicken you just wake up and you're ready to go also I take like images you also do skullcap I take agnus castus vitex also known as my tech skullcap so those are really good for balancing out your hormones again also maca so yeah what I use the macro is amazing for balancing out the hormones is great also for giving you a lot of energy and I incorporate that into a lot of my baking and my cooking because I like the taste it has like a Nazi caramel face a bit multi as well so what I do is I just mix it with some like peanut butter and drizzle that or I'll mix it into like any cakes that I make or cookies and stuff and it's just a good way of balancing your hormones but not really feeling like you always have to mix tons of powders and stuff I really take a lot of herbs in pill form so I just incorporate it into my smoothies and my baking and stuff so yeah I think that's pretty much most of the Habs I take I do take a lot more I just can't think of them so for me so my go-to is ginger turmeric so what I like to do is I like to chop up turmeric and ginger the root by the way and I let it boil and I might add other things like rosemary and sage and whatever I have very time and I let it boil and I make it internal medicine tea and it has excellent anti-inflammatory and sleep back to effects and it's ginger is amazing especially Michael Anderson I use it for everything there's very big ginger in and it's quite warming as well as really good for circulation is I'm also a big fan of your neck so Gertie know just be there slipping slipping like in the keynote and I really like the process of going out to pick and it's like a point self-care because you know that you've picked it with like loving hands and everything is intentionally so just me going out to the park to get that was an act of love and then everything else it came so in that all excellent detoxifying properties and and e90 is model yeah what I'd love is to have my own patch of land and just a grow all of this I also take a few green powders so I alternate between spirulina and chlorella so again detoxifying I think my focus recently has been not just physically but emotionally these Green powders work is that they pull heavy metals from the body they bind to it and we allow it to be especially in the pesticides will be found in their chlorides and those things are going to have a massive effect in the system and it's like it very much that gets targeted and it's an attachment based for the way so yeah for my chlorella capsules but for the spirulina just comes as a loose powder so I like to be like my juices and I've been especially big one juices recently I prefer to smoothies but I automate depending on how I feel and juices are great because it allows quick absorption of the nutrients so when he doesn't have to go through that digestive process that laborious contacts and process you can just get straight into a bloodstream and there's a really quick news and once you start to juice your own food you can never go back to yeah it's just they fill it with you know you can just taste the sugar preservatives as well where it lives and all of that stuff which is taxing on Komori body doesn't know how to deal with it it's not actually anything that's not struggle is well the long side and don't blame vibrance the after drinking it when you have to use that I've started putting that black seed we all like a little drop especially that at the height of that Cove it'd need juices as I another way of absorbing it but you're not going to get that in trouble Connor unfortunate thank you guys so much like if you guys haven't been writing them down you should be writing them down and and if you like want to find out more definitely go follow dish your hubs and see it's biased Alma we're gonna of summer Thank You Annie we have a question from anakata who says have any of you experienced any link between trying to look after your nervous system and not being able to see family special connections in real life I mean that's quite a big question I'm trying to understand that your link between the two that I mean I guess you should always the car to your nervous system and I know that if you don't have great relationships in your life obviously that has that's quite taxing on your physical mental state has an impact there right if you know for something like that I would recommend Bach Flower Remedies because the Flower Remedies also work on emotions they're actually known to have these beneficial effects so if you feel like you're dealing with a lot in your life with your health and you're not connecting to people around you in your relationships what flowering these are a great way to bring on to kind of deal with that process so I would look into that I hope I'm trying to I'm understanding your question quite right but I think that's what I would kind of divert you into that kind direction yes and no one can say you've got a soft connection with I guess you just kind of have to feel into that and yeah that's quite a big big question I think I think a Mundell quickly like the quarantine things not being able to like the social distance in and being like that way of calming your nervous system but Anika's then added something cool I think there is a healing value in the love our families usually the poor in the remedies they tend they tend to us with whether that is haldi or the plants they water every day no one Starbucks attempts to colonize golden days and it can't have the same healing properties and because of like their love and the energy transfer when those things been given some said no no I going off on that actually sorry what's interesting is my sister is kind of during the quarantine my sister was learning how to do a lot of Somali traditional recipes or just like even normal foods that my mom used to cook so she like it's time her and say hey like what's going on or she'll take photos and send them what's happened then my mom will be like good keep that up or my mom would like troubleshooting questions that my mum my sister might have and say oh I think my my chicken is and like it's not it's not as moist as you make it for example so connecting with your family my FaceTime and other tech just to kind of still keep that tradition going but connecting I'm a food but naturally you wouldn't be able to do it physically but technology that can they are finding our way to the future we've got another question from rich he says I'm curious about natural remedies to migraines and I think it's been hospitalized three times in his life but appear once a week with a link to depression and manage with Zoomer trip attend trip attempts are active and which contact blood vessels around brain any alternatives for like reoccurring migraines I mean again that that's I don't like to ever advise unless I know more information but just going bouncing off that if you look at it from an Ayurvedic or TCM perspective normally migraines are excessive heat in the body that's rising and causes a severe headaches and tension so perhaps looking at either from a Chinese perspective made it perspective on how to balance the heat in your body that might bring down some of the migraines and kind of cool the system down and again within that looking after your nervous system and taking magnesium is a great supplement it please whoever's buying herb supplement keys don't go to Holland and Barrett just because I feel like I don't ashame any brands but overall I don't feel like their qualities up to scratch going to pick like planet organic or Whole Foods they normally have advisors there that specialize in supplements they can advise you better so get really good quality magnesium so that you're actually absorbing in the right way my tester magnesium I've actually been hospitalized from migraines before as well like about six years ago I had migraine I had like I think a week-long migraine that was just not ending and I was taking hospital for it and definitely make an easy really helped me I don't remember yeah well like your footpaths and stuff like just like soaking in like the magnesium flakes or like the spray like and the thing is if you spray it anywhere on your body your body will still take it in and I think that's one of the fastest ways and being able to take in magnesium as well so yeah migraines I haven't had migraines in a while but definitely magnesium has really helped me because they're kind of releases I think some of that tension yeah definitely I mean that is you know that's a symptom that's a symptom of something deeper that's going on and so is the depression that's a symptom so you want to maybe look a bit deeper what's what's causing these flare-ups but you know human touch is really important you'd be surprised but how healing a massage can be so treating yourself to like an Indian Head massage or something like that to kind of open up the Airways with this nice essential oils it's just I know for me that's what soothes my migraines because I do get them quite bad sometimes when I'm stressed so there's some tips for you to play with that I think we've got one more from Fatima he says what happens would you recommend to reduce period pain I know the pain often comes from an imbalance of hormones but wondered what your thoughts are I've got my favorite herb is called cramp bark and it's in the name cramp so when I have cramps that is my go-to you can get cramp bark in capsules and tinctures that's another thing I actually forgot to mention the form of herbs that you take is quite important obviously look at your your you as an individual but tinctures are really good for things like menstrual menstrual problems or hormones because the alcohol and the tincture itself absorbs into the body real quick if you don't want to take alcohol you can mix it with a bit of hot water in it the alcohol evaporates but the medicinal benefits just stay so that can work but cramp work is the go-to but you've got to be careful how much you take so it's quite an intense herb but yeah it's great for period cramps and period pains and PMS and Mary could you explain what a tincture is yes so when we like when we forage for herbes whether it's a bark or you know the root of whatever it is we put it in alcohol in equal parts according to the quantity of herbs that we have and the alcohol draws out the phytochemicals so these are the medicinal properties of the plant and we leave it six weeks at a time for weeks sometimes we put it under the full moon because the moon pulls all the gravity set pulls all the phytochemicals out and then once that's ready you start taking that as a medicine you obviously drain out all the excess bits of perhaps that are left in there and yeah that's it and other ways of making teachers for those who don't want to take the alcohol because of something just popped up on the chat box is what you can't do you can't do it without using the alcohol so you can use you can draw out the phytochemicals with the alcohol but once you've got the tincture you mix it with a bit of hot water or you let it kind of simmer and then the alcohol will evaporate and then you can take whatever is left over as medicine and that should still work just as fine because that's what we do with babies sometimes or kids or someone who's got liver problems we kind of have to make it work yeah you don't have to have a tincture you know you can go for the tea or the cat thank you so much for sharing like I've got so much it's been amazing just to hear all of your knowledge and just like the humility in a little bit and it just being like the work that is being done it feels like this it just feels like a very like warm energy around all the things that you guys are doing and I yeah I can't wait to see more things that you guys and do moving forward before we run away into the rest of our lives and are there any like final things and that you wanted to say to anyone or like things you have coming up that you want to promote or share and also tell us where you're at I know that it will be posted online nothing but people still watch him I just had to point about boot camps on the healing journey I've come to realize that pain signifiers there's something not right and there's something that I need to address so I mean I'm still struggling because they're not as one disease sleep where u s-- actually because it can throw up because for me I'm still trying to get to the root of my as bad because in TCM they understand that good cramps it came from the incremental flow means that there's a stagnation in that area so I don't know where this gluten or sugar it can be anything but again the like developing your relationship with your own body and trying to listen and trying to see how it reacts to and certain freezes and emotional reactions as long and I follow like your intuition because I mean they've been doing that years ago disabilities interns at fast and they were doing fine and so that's just a note we're all healing different ways like I think that's something that people need to understand but when people do share platform about health whatever it may be even I still never jealous we shouldn't young master ox is wrong thank you so much for sharing and on a period note is where I forgot to say I just have really bad cramps and it was linked to a gluten intolerance so when I still eat bread though shouldn't but well my period I don't have any carbohydrates at all I try and have neck as like I tau I can not even necessarily cooked foods for the first couple days and as well as possible and that's completely sports my cramps and again like some said everyone's body is different so it's locating the pain being so when you guys are coming up and those has posted the links of where people can find you so please do make sure you check out Caesars online digital hub and yeah continue like celebrating and sharing their work because I love to see it and one of you guys got coming up well we were meant to do a massive event at shortage house but then this all kind of yeah that's something that we're still planning to do for sure when co vid is over I think would it would love some happen event wouldn't we yeah and in the meantime we're still looking at how we can do like zoom calls and recipes we'll try and make it work but yeah and if if anyone has any questions on like the hormones or menstrual issues I just specialized that's the field I specialize in as a medical herb list away from additional herbs and on my page I've made loads of videos on hormones and stuff so yeah um and you go into this your hives obviously you would see me in half so you can have a look at my page for some information on hormones but other than that I think yeah we're just gonna keep going amazing I'm still needs to try to come about ice cream and it was vegan cream double cream and you kind of make it my nuns like favorite art not perfectly Krishna ice cream was and it just the moment a manager honestly Salwa what we've got coming up so similar to the sisters I was originally planning to do a Ramadan healing sessions fasting but thankfully I managed to convert that into an online session but for me like on the online ones is amazing but I need that connection I really need the energy of the person in front of me I'm gonna pull it's like online mantras for now and but what I was planning as well coming into the summer one was to do a sister's hike so to get a group of sisters I had my group ready I had everything ready and I'm outside so it wasn't written good until tag into to restart that just grabbed us we need to move nice especially people who've come on our listeners that may need to normalize being up there it shouldn't be a predominantly white space like we have every right time to access them to enjoy on to to appreciate our surroundings and the place that we do so I'm hoping to get that done as soon as it's not done I'll be out there so I might make a bigger group thank you guys so much and I was there so it or like I just knew you like just fine paging like wow I'm not crazy like that this medicine is so important and urgent thank you for sharing all of your knowledge your wisdom
