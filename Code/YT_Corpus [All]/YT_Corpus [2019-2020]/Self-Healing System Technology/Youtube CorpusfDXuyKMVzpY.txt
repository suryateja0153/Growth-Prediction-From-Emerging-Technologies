 I'm delighted to see so many of you here delighted to also see the diversity of people in the audience so I'm coming from a power electronics background I will assume none of that background in the stock although the talk will throw up a lot of stuff that will probably look like power electronics I'll try and explain it in simple terms as Sally mentioned I'm going to talk about dynamic wireless charging of electric vehicles and Sally is certainly more bullish on on this but I will also try and convince you that the future of Road transportation could very well be transformed if we had dynamic wireless charging and our reason is that the three big themes in transportation or road transportation today are electrification automation and ride-sharing and all three of them can benefit tremendously from dynamic wireless charging and I'll go through all of those in a minute but let just to kind of give you the summary one of the big hurdles for electric vehicles in terms of penetration has been associated with their energy storage which is basically batteries and we will see how we could potentially reduce that road block by dynamic charging also the other aspect that kind of puts people off from electric vehicles is that you have to go and remember to charge it and if you want an autonomous vehicle you certainly don't want it to be autonomous all the time except when it needs food or charge and so to be truly autonomous it needs to be able to charge itself which is also going to be enabled by the technology I'm going to talk about and then finally if you want to reduce the amount of traffic on the roadways you want to reduce essentially the number of vehicles on the road and so if we had vehicles which really didn't have to go off and wait a few hours to get charged and they were running all the time picking up passengers essentially doing autonomous full-time ride-sharing we'd be able to bring the amount of traffic on a road weighed down as well so hopefully I'll convince you that all three of those can happen if we had really good make wireless charging capability all right so let's just back up and kind of see why we are even here and why we're talking about this subject I remember when I was an undergrad at Cal Tech I was there for the first quarter maybe first half of the first quarter before we got a little bit of rain and I realized that actually Pasadena has mountains close by because you couldn't really see anything in the smog back in the 1980s things have obviously cleared up quite a bit but if you go to Beijing it's probably more like this certainly Lahore is like that's but when we have our advisory board meeting sometimes the planes can't land because of the the smog although they may claim it's fog it's actually really small because you look up it's all brown it's not even white and so if you could pair transportation which is driven by electricity with renewable sources of electricity which is completely separate topic and I'm not going to dive into that I think there's lots of lots of interesting possibilities and challenges there you could really go to an environment which looks clean and nice and transportation by the way is the second largest creator of greenhouse gases in at least the u.s. it's about 22 percent and this is just road road transportation I think transportation as a whole is even large it's like 27% and electricity production only sort of beat set by another percent or so so it would be a sort of a tremendous benefit to society if we could actually convert into this kind of environment well let's kind of dig one layer deeper and see what are the real pros and cons of electric vehicles so the thing that makes electric vehicles very cool and good is the fact that we can one certainly move the the fact that we're no longer burning gasoline in the engine sort of further away and hopefully that will all kind of get mitigated when we have renewable energy but even if you were to be produced you were to produce electricity through sort of burning hydrocarbons the electric motor is so much more efficient than the internal combustion engine that you end up having a Wells to wheel benefit in overall energy efficiency now where electric vehicles are really essentially beaten out and they slam the brakes on you is essentially the fact that the energy density of even the best lithium-ion batteries we have today is roughly two orders of magnitude below that of gasoline and so you're going to drive long distances or if you're going to have to pump the amount of energy you will need in order to go that long distance you're going to be essentially waiting a long time or you're essentially not going to have any space in the trunk for any of your luggage not to mention the the batteries are still expensive and so you also then pay for all of that from your pocket so the bottom line of all of that is that even though we see a lot of Tesla's out on the roads it's essentially mostly in New York and California went and our total sales of electric vehicles is off the order of two percent this these are numbers from last year I believe the numbers have gone up a bit this year so that's Lomb I think it's all like 350,000 vehicles this year or thereabout so we are creeping up but it's nowhere close to where we'd want to be and so the first thing that I'm going to talk about is that with dynamic wireless charging you could potentially move these batteries out of the vehicle and leave just a small amount of of batteries that allows you to get to the roadway which has the dynamic charging capability now let me also kind of explain what dynamic charging is with what I cannot get to history it's essentially the ability for us to deliver energy to the vehicle as it's moving right and I'll talk about different ways in which we can do that all right so before we hit the road in terms of figuring out what today's technology is let's just sort of go back a hundred years and actually realized that this is not new stuff this is stuff that Nikola Tesla more than a hundred years ago gave a demonstration off at Columbia University this is actually a newspaper or maybe even an some journal photo drawing of some reporter who was there at the event when Nikola showing essentially a tube light lighting up when he had a couple of plates on either side but nothing no wires connected and he was able to light up the that you blight around the same time in France Hutton and the Blanc actually developed a system to transfer energy from the rail tracks or from the tram tracks into a tram essentially using a transformer but it was very loosely coupled transformer so you have one coil in in the in the ground another one which is a pickup on the tram itself and that could be used to sort of drive the tram it didn't really make make it into the real world but people were already thinking about it more than a hundred years ago the first next major effort on this was actually in California it was part of the path program which was in I think I believe it was actually started in the early eighties or maybe even earlier one phase of the path program actually looked at again putting similar kind of a structure which is coils in in the roadway and then having is a pair of coils in the vehicle and trying to transfer energy what they ended up realizing was that this thing was not at all energy efficient was too expensive and it just didn't actually work out in a practical sense so nothing really came out of all of this except that people had been thinking about it and they were trying now around the same time out in New Zealand there was a group of boys and green who actually did use this technology and were able to commercialize this technology but not roadway traffic or any other kind of transportation system but in factory automation so in factories you still need to have things that move around and and carry goods from one place to another and their work in essentially the same kind of technology but the big difference being that the gaps that we were talking about through which the energy had to transfer was much smaller because here this was in a controlled environment your clearances could be in millimeters millimeters instead of tens of centimeters or so you were able to more efficiently deliver energy and so this technology actually did take off it was commercialized and a number of companies especially led by companies out of Japan have basically deployed these systems in various factory settings so none of that would have probably changed our lives except a professor out of the applied physics or physics department at MIT took what I guess other people had thought of as mundane technology and really put it on top burner by popularizing it as to some extent making it seem magical similar to how Tesla probably made it look magical it wasn't magic I mean if you go down and you sort of read their papers and you look at what they're doing it's essentially the same technology they're the distance that they were covering was larger but what they had available to them were devices and electronics that could now operate at much higher frequencies and by sort of leveraging that and doing clever designs they were able to basically deliver energy across a larger distance and they demonstrated something that was a couple of meters across and they were able to light a light bulb which was 60 watts at that distance this really brought it back into the limelight and spurred venture capital money being thrown at this problem with the same folks starting a company by the name of by tricity which you probably all heard of which essentially tried to take this back into the or motive old so in the automotive space this technology has essentially taken two sort of two directions one which is the stuff which seems much more realistic and more short-term is what's called stationary wireless charging so this is where you come home you park in your garage and the car automatically starts charging and if you've gotten to plug it in the next morning you come back you still have a charged battery and you're not stuck at home so it seems like this would be a no-brainer but even today even the stationary wireless charging is coming only as a aftermarket product so it hasn't really made it to where you can go and buy a Mercedes with a built in system there they've been a little a few sort of experimental or pilot type of projects but that's essentially where this technologies the more out-of-this-world kind of technology is dynamic wireless charging and that's what I'm going to focus on which is where you're actually not delivering energy to the vehicle as it's driving down the road alright so how does it work so I've kind of hinted at it it's essentially a loosely coupled transformer so you've got a coil in the roadway you have a paired coil in the vehicle as the vehicle goes over these pairings you have magnetic flux which is coupling across and you're basically picking up as long as you have time varying magnetic fields you'll induce a voltage on the other side on the coil and that is able to deliver you the energy that you need to charge your battery and if you can get enough energy that couldn't essentially be enough to propel you as well so you don't then need as much battery or you could completely eliminate the battery as long as you're going to be always on this track which has this capability here's a sort of an actual system that you can see this is from Oak Ridge National Labs who were one of sort of the pioneers in the u.s. in sort of bringing this technology along with sort of why tricity was essentially not making products but they had designs and they were trying to sell them to companies like Toyota Oakridge was actually building the products in the US and has been sort of giving these as essentially demonstration things to companies like so US Post and things of that sort now in terms of the state of art of this stuff as I mentioned there's the systems that have been developed at Oakridge so Oakridge has built quite a few stationary systems they've also delved a little bit with sort of the dynamic charging so here's one of their demonstration systems that they both a few years ago so you have just a series of the same kind of charging pads and the vehicle as it drives over would pick up the charge here's sort of a artist's rendering of the why tricity system and then the most sort of state of the art in this is a system that was built by Qualcomm a year and a half or so ago and this is based on technology that was actually developed on top of the New Zealand technology that had been developed originally for factory automation this is today the longest single track for dynamic wireless charging it's believed it's a hundred meters but might be a little longer than 100 meters and it can have up to or they've tested it with up to two vehicles on it at a time and it delivers up to 20 kilowatts of energy to those vehicles all right so all of that is very nice there seems to be sort of a linear trajectory of this technology what are sort of the bottlenecks well a few bottlenecks are related to the fact that magnetic fuels and in fact I would say that is one of the biggest hindrances of magnetic base systems is magnetic fields inherently closed on themselves so if you have a loop and you create magnetic fields the magnetic fields will go out and come rap back on themselves so what that means is if you have a system on the ground and then system in the vehicle and the electric feels have to go up if you don't have a mechanism to shield the passenger compartment those magnetic fields are going to enter the passenger compartment and they're gonna interact with your body and that can be not a pleasant experience and it's certainly not a healthy experience so what all companies do is they put what are called ferrets which are essentially materials which have a higher permeability for magnetic fields and magnetic fields before going through those pathways and then they sort of wrap around and come back in back into the ferret that is underneath the roadway now these ferrets are ceramic materials so they're intend to be fragile they're also lossy materials and one basic principle of sort of these systems is that if you can operate the magnetic field at a high frequency that means they're oscillating at a higher frequency then you can generate a higher voltage even with a smaller sized coil so if you want to reduce the size and not sort of take up the entire vehicle or NEADS face more than what's underneath the vehicle you really want to run these at high frequencies but since ferrets are lossy you can't really exceed a certain frequency and typically these systems are built with frequencies under 100 kilohertz the other thing which I mentioned is that they are fragile which means if you put them into the roadway then just because from a thermal expansion and contraction they will crack if you have heavy truck traffic going over the roadway they will tend to crack and the ferrets are not cheap either so it's a it's a fairly expensive system and it has all of these limitations not to mention now you're putting these ferrets which are going to take volume and add weight to the vehicle side as well so what I am going to be talking about is actually a system that doesn't use magnetic fields at all and that's based on the other field that we know about which is the electric field now this word essentially in theory work as follows that you would have two plates or two metallic plates on the vehicle two metallic plates the roadway and essentially you are exciting these at high frequencies and you're sending displacement currents from one plate to the vehicle it'll charge up the battery and then the displacement current returns back through the other pair plate that create a close of the circuit the advantage here is that electric fields start at positive charges and end at negative charges so there is no need for the electric fields are not going to go into the passenger compartment so they you have got a self-healing system so you don't need to put any shielding behind it secondly because you have none of that ferrite type material or any other dielectric material to contain the fuels you can operate this at much higher frequencies and when you operate at much higher frequencies you can shrink the size of the system furthermore it's a much simpler system so it's a lot cheaper and it's much easier to embed in in roadways so you would say well that's a no-brainer why don't everybody else do this the reason is Nature Made magnetic fields far superior to electric fields in terms of their ability to transfer energy for a given frequency what that means is that there are two universal constants one is called mu naught which is the permeability of free space the other is epsilon naught which is the permittivity of free space the permeability which is the one that goes with magnetic fields is five orders of magnitude greater than the permittivity of free space and so if I want to generate the same amount of effective power transfer with electric fields I essentially need five orders of magnitude higher voltage compared to the amount of current that I would need for magnetic fields right so they kind of do also for another one runs off voltages the other runs off currents so but the one thing and so essentially at once people realize that no although nobody actually quite explicitly said it in those words people tried it earlier on and they're realizing that it doesn't really work they completely what wrote it off the one thing that people forget is that if you can so this is all equal if you were operating at this frequency but now if you can somehow go to five orders of magnitude higher frequency you can essentially compensate for that difference actually you don't even have to do that because you can deal with a hundred volts much more easily than you can deal with a hundred amps so if you can have ten amps you can certainly have a hundred volt so you really only have to bridge a ten to the four orders of magnitude of four difference between the two so as I was mentioning the conventional wisdom in this area was that this is a technology that would never work because our capacitor charging as it's called would never work except for some really tiny applications like cell phone charging where you essentially have no gap you can just put the device on the pad itself and you can charge it at like you five Watts kind of levels rather than 20 kilowatts kind of levels there was some early work in Japan done trying to get the energy through the tires because the tires come closest to the road unfortunately the tires don't provide enough surface area for you to actually transfer reasonable or any appreciable amount of energy and you have a lot of losses in the tires because the tires are actually full of carbon black which is highly dissipative all right so I have started to look at this whole area in 2014 almost five years after sort of the hype had already kind of been created and I had a undergraduate student just kind of play with this to see if we could bridge this gap by just going up in frequency so we built our little prototype where all we were trying to do was go across half a centimeter and that was 5 or 5 times bigger distance than anybody else had done successfully the record at that time was one millimeter and 50 watts so we went at at a frequency of one megahertz and we were able to deliver over a hundred watts with reasonable efficiencies using his little toy experiment and then we had a little senior project design team actually build a little toy car luckily for us we were able to leverage this and write a half a million dollar grant proposal to arpa-e and they thought it was crazy enough for their ideas program to fund it and they gave us 18 months to demonstrate that this could be done at scale which meant at least at 1 kilowatts with 90% efficiency across the air gap of a model Tesla Model 3 which is 12 centimeters and while meeting safety standards so that was the challenge that we were faced with this was around 2016 and so we sort of had written the proposal we had sort of back-of-the-envelope concepts that might work but it was kind of might work and so off we went to really kind of look at the problem and see if we could address what the inherent problems were and see if we could solve them so first of all we have to cross a barrier of the air gap which even if we had so so another target I didn't mention was that we had to do this at 50 kilowatts per meter square for the arpa-e goal so which basically meant that if we had a meter we would need to deliver 50 kilowatts through it through it so our target was a 1 kilowatt system so we had proportionately less area so what it meant was we had to deliver 1 kilowatts through 6 Pico farad's of capacitance which is tiny right so so it was a huge amount of reactants that across which we have to deliver this energy which meant that one we had to really go at very high frequencies - we had to boost our voltages up to a fairly high levels in order to make this happen so we kind of started to work on it and we have to meet the safety levels which are actually set by ik nerve which is the body which sells these field limits is also the same body that sets the field limits for MRI a type of equipment so the first thing we needed was a a system that provided voltage gain so essentially we come off a DC voltage we invert that into a high frequency using an inverter this voltage is still a few hundred volts because our DC voltage would essentially come off the line and get rectified so it'd be a few hundred volts then you have to boost this up it into the kilowatts level and then transfer the energy and then sort of convert this back into the voltage levels needed for a battery now one of the challenges here was that because we have to meet these field safety levels we could not allow the voltage that was appearing between the ground and the vehicle to be very high because that's the one that's actually going to create the electric fields to which a human being standing next to the vehicle might be exposed so that really meant that this displacement current had to be tiny which then meant to deliver the same amount of power this voltage which is on say one side or just on the roadway side had to be really high so we really needed a network that could take the hundreds of walls and transfer them into sort of thousands of walls at the same time this network had to provide compensation which means this is a highly capacitive network which means that you wouldn't be able to deliver much energy or real energy because it will all be circulating energy unless you were able to compensate it with an equivalent inductance which would allow you to then actually deliver real power across the system so I will try and keep the math and the sort of the really hardcore power electronics aspects of it to a minimum but I'll give you just a flavor of of the sort of work we did that allowed us to proceed forward be the typical way the way you would generate a high voltage or at least one way to do that at fixed frequencies is to basically utilize what are known as matching networks now the art of matching networks has predominantly been developed for RF engineering where people are sort of trying to match antennas to power amplifiers and so there the focus has really been on things that were relatively different from the ones that we've wanted to focus on which was getting this done very patiently so we took a completely new look at the design of these matching networks and set up sort of the problem as an optimization problem to figure out what is the best way to design these matching networks in order to be the most efficient that they could be and so I'm going to just kind of summarize in a few slides the results of of this analysis because those results essentially changed what was conventional thinking the conventional thinking let me just point that out was that if you have a large reactance what you want to do is you want to compensate it from the very first stage closest to it on either side and that makes sense from a conventional thinking perspective because that's where your currents are the smallest so if you're putting in large inductor that inductor is carrying the smallest amount of current so it's best to do it really upfront so so that was one thing that we discovered is actually not not exactly true but sort of broadly the few lessons that we learned one was related to sort of how you distribute the gain a network provides versus the compensation it provides since you have a network that can be on the primary side and a network on the secondary side the lesson to sort of to take away was that depending on the voltage that you had on your input relative to the battery voltage there's a certain amount of the gain that this system overall needs to provide because in the end you're either stepping up the voltage or you're stepping down the voltage end to end now depending on whether you're going up or down in voltage each of these networks is either going to provide a voltage gain or it's going hold a step-up or a voltage step down and if it is providing a large voltage gain then what you want from that network is as little compensation as possible so essentially this really in a summary it says that if if this is going to provide a high gain then make this a low compensating network and then make most of your compensation on the side the next question was well each of those networks on the on the primary and the secondary side could potentially have multiple stages and what how should you distribute again the compensation and gain between these stages the conventional thought as I mentioned was to put all the compensation close by and make the gain equal four and really use the rest to provide gain and provide equal gain from all of those stages well it turns out that actually it's better to distribute that compensation across there's a very specific way in which you want to distribute that compensation and also the way you distribute the the gain is in a sort of it is roughly what you would think that most of your stages are providing equal gain but it's not exactly true because your last stage actually becomes non realizable if you're still providing the same amount of gain that you're providing from the first few stages so what it tries to do is essentially get the maximum gain that you can get from this closest stage in while the system is still realizable by realizable means that when you pick the values of L and C's they don't come out to be negative or something like that and then you take the rest of the gain and you distribute that equally from the other stages so these were sort of non-conventional results which we were able to discover and it allowed us to kind of achieve efficiencies that were higher than what you would otherwise be able to the the next question to ask was well how many stages do you put in on either side and it turns out that you can as long as you're putting more stages on both sides you can keep increasing the number of stages and the system's starts getting more and more efficient that was also a non conventional thinking because earlier work had shown that there is an optimum level and not in this context early the real work was again in the context of mostly antennas that there is an optimum number of of stages that you should have here what we discovered was that the optimum number is not there as long as you are sort of adding stages on both sides but if you have a limit on the number of stages on one side then there is an optimal number of stages on for the other side in in general you can just keep adding stages and your efficiency goes keeps going up however it starts to saturate at some point so there's no real benefit of going to an extremely large number of stages and we were able to sort of come up with sort of analytical limits on what these efficiencies would be the end result of all of this was that the approach that we took and our methodology allowed us now to build systems which was significantly more efficient than what the conventional approach would have allowed and more importantly they were they allowed us to build these systems more efficiently at low air-gap voltages which is where you want to operate if you want the fringing fields to be low and the system to be safe so we really want to operate with air-gap voltages which are sort of around a kilovolt or less so that your electric fields that are then being generated are also lower and that is where you get a huge amount of benefit using this design approach so this work we validated again at small scale first to show that what we were sort of showing in theory was actually true in practice and and it was we build systems that using our approach as well as the conventional approach and demonstrated that in practice this was true so now that we know how to build these matching networks which are efficient I'm not going to talk much about the design of the inverters is there's a lot that can be said there as well but the inverter design that we are using is essentially a h-bridge kind of a inverter so it's it's a fairly standard design the next piece of the was to go back and try and now build the system and see if it would work so if he takes the environment in which we are building this so we've got the road we've got a couple of plates on the road a couple of plates on the vehicle chassis side we've got some capacitance between these things and our goal was to basically have our matching network would connect here to these plates another one on the outside and you would feed the energy through this it'll go through these plates nicely and get to the JC except when we actually built their first sort of little prototype we got no energy across nothing zip zero maybe like a few millivolt watts if we were being generous with the noise that we were picking up and the reason was then we go back and you look at this system and you're kind of thinking of it well we've got high enough frequency you got all the impedance matching to compensate for these plate capacitances and it should really work and it's not it's because of that because while yes you can kind of squint and imagine that's the only capacitance that's not there's like huge amount of capacitance from anything to anywhere like this capacitance between me and all of those chairs and this capacitance would mean me in the moon and between me and the end of the universe and it's all finite capacitance and in this case actually these capacitances were were bigger than the capacitance through which I wanted to send energy so if I am now energizing this I well the energy just squashes goes up here goes down there comes back and it's nicely circulating on one side of the roadway nothing's getting across so so we were essentially stumped at this point we had like four months into the project our PI is on our heads we're writing our quarterly reports and we have zip to show except for lots of theoretical papers winning best paper prizes but essentially useless from a practical perspective which is exactly what sort of maybe scientists do many times so then we had to kind of go back and put this back into our hours okay so here's all right so here's a nice little inverter that's I said so an h-bridge this was the inductor that was going to compensate him he kept the system simple so even though we've done the theory for these n stage matching Network we said ok we can't even get like 1 milliwatt of energy transfer through this system forget about all that matching network let's just put 1 inductor and let's try and get something to work all right so if you look at that capacitance network it actually looks this complicated and if you look at you simulate this what you'll see is that essentially these two capacitances that are connected taking essentially the this is the the road or this node represents the the road itself and there's a capacitance from that road to the ground of the inverter essentially you're trying to pump energy and it's just coming through here it's coming through here it's coming back through this capacitor and completing the loop and as as long as you don't have zero capacitance as long as that capacitance has some value well you just suck that energy out so nothing gets across and then anything that does get across well this second capacitance then sucks it out there right so and you can't eliminate this capacitance because obviously your whatever circuit you're going to build it's gonna sit in the road and there's gonna be capacitance from there to the road alright so you then scratch your head and try and figure out what to do well I should say that we really scratch their heads and what we figured out was the one principle of physics that we had not use yet was symmetry and I can never sort of highlight how important symmetry can be in not only helping you find fundamental laws of physics but also taking fundamental laws of physics and applying them to real world problems so we took that inductor and we just split it into two half inductors and then our simulations showed that it didn't really matter what that capacitance was we could get right across and I'll explain why so if we go back so essentially what it does is you take that inductor you split it and as if those capacitances don't exist now let me just explain all right so the thing is the capacitances exist between this road and this node and that they're sort of your sort of worst nightmares and from the vehicle back to wherever the sort of this the ground is for the battery and essentially where your everything is reference to now if you have equal split inductances then because you're generating an AC voltage here the by symmetry the voltages on these sides are always the negative of the other so if this is plus X this is minus X and by symmetry essentially then this is zero if that's zero again also from symmetry on the other side this is zero as well so that basically means that between this zero and that node there is no voltage it doesn't really matter that I have capacitance there if I have no voltage across it I'm not going to drive any current through it and similarly this capacitance it doesn't really matter now because of zero volts here and zero volts here now in practice it'll be hard to make them exactly the same so you may have a few walls across it but that's still nothing compared to the thousands of volts that you were dealing with initially and these are small Pecola picofarad level capacitances so we eliminate essentially these three capacitances and essentially are left with that that's still pretty ugly to work with so what do we do well we go back and we use symmetry again so if you look at these two capacitances these two capacitance is coming to a point but they're coming from again voltages which were X and minus X so whatever current is coming down this part because it's coming from X to zero is exactly the same except in opposite direction from the current that's coming from here to that which essentially means that the current that's coming from here from top to bottom is essentially flowing down here if it's that it's what it's doing then that node can be dis connected from there and you can put that capacitance here you can do the same for this guy and you can move that there and now you can start to combine these capacitances into sort of lumped capacitances and you can all merge this stuff here that just leaves you these diagonal capacitances and those diagonal capacitances you can look at this system and do effectively what's called an equivalent Tevin equivalent except it's a two-port Haviland and what it does is its effect is as if you had reduced the main capacitance by the by that diagonal capacitance because it's essentially sucking current out from where it would have otherwise gone and it's added some capacitance to this so now we actually have a system that looks exactly like what we wanted this is what we were hoping that our system would look like because these were the capacitances that we wanted to deliver energy across and these capacitances are essentially capacitances that would have been part of our matching network in fact we can absorb them into our matching Network and not put a matching network capacitance at all so in our actual system we're not going to have any capacity on sazon board we're just going to use these parasitics to essentially create the matching Network itself and essentially just have these half inductors so with that we were successful and I'm going to cutting the story short because we built three generations of systems our first generation system only produced 146 watts but that was still zillion times percent higher than the milli watts of power we initially had and then the next generation system was even higher and we hit our target of over a kilowatts with our third gen system and we nicked the ninety percent mark and arpa-e allowed us to pass with that performance and we broke the 50 kilowatts per meter square target as well so in the end we were successful and our PI e project ended but we had other funding by that time so we continued to keep going so our next thing was well how do we push this even higher because one kilowatts is great and I'm going to accelerate because to kind of just finish on time but so we went back and we looked at where our losses were our biggest loss mechanism was in the losses in our inductors so we focused on making these inductors better the first thing we did was we increased our frequency so I missed to mention that this systems that we both were six point seven eight megahertz the choice of frequency was basically driven by the fact that six point seven eight is one of the lowest frequencies for a the industrial scientific and medical band which is a frequency band in which FCC allows you to operate non-licensed things but by jumping to the next band which is at thirteen point five six we were able to reduce the size of these inductors it goes by so you double the frequencies you get a benefit of a factor of four and then we optimized it further to where our current inductor actually looks like this and both of these inductors are actually on the same core it's an air core inductor so it really doesn't have any magnetic material it's just on it a plumbing PVC pipe and by sort of putting both inductors on the same core we were able to leverage the mutual magnetic coupling between them to actually make it look bigger than it actually is so we were able to sort of work on these inductors and get their efficiencies up the QL is essentially a metric for measuring the quality factor or the efficiency of the inductor and we've got them up to 2,000 a factor to a value of 2,000 which as inductors goes is actually very high and we were able to most recently build a system which is 3.75 kilowatts and his efficiencies are in the ninety five percent range and still has the power transfer density that sort of you've been targeting so this is sort of the main theme of what I wanted to talk about I'll just show you a few other sort of ancillary things we've been we worked on along the way as I mentioned one of the important aspects is to read use the fringing fields the sae has has a has a proposed standard for that where they want you to limit the fields outside the region where you're actually transferring power and we proposed him a third of doing that by first of all obviously our basic design does that but to further improve safety what you can do is have multiple such modules you can phase shift those modules so as to do actually field cancellation so we were able to demonstrate this field cancellation where a single module produced this blue level of field so you were able to this is sort of right underneath will be transferring power to where your sixty centimeters away by the time you get to if you double the power by adding two modules you'll double the fields but if you run them in anti-phase you can cut those fields and you make it even more safe so you get down to sort of this green line next the challenge so far I've shown you was predominantly for things that was stationary right so there was nothing about moving so what happens when things move well when they're moving this whole system which is essentially a resonant system because your inductance has to match the capacitance precisely is no longer going to stay in resonance if you move also if you have a vehicle which has a higher clearance you need that to be matched as well so to enable that what we developed was a an architecture whereby we can continuously meet this matching requirement without having to change frequency which is sort of the alternate way to do that but in order to stay within these is and bands and so we were able to deliver continuous power as we moved by sort of changing the voltages on on this network and this is one of our sort of dynamic charging prototype where we can actually move this vehicle across and we can maintain full power even though we are misaligned and we can also maintain full power even though we have a vehicle with a higher height clearance so we can sort of control this and we built this both in sister where you're essentially doing this automatically so I won't go through sort of the math of this but essentially rather than trying to measure these very high frequencies we have control loops whereby we able to essentially get this thing done by measuring just the DC quantities which are much easier to measure and are able to maintain sort of this finally this is just sort of experimental demonstration of that finally we've also studied how foreign objects affect this system so if you have a piece of metal that comes in between or a piece of wood or water or saltwater and what it turns out is that most objects actually don't affect the system water does any material which has a dielectric constant other than air would affect it and it acts as a detuning mechanism but you can again bring that system back in tuning through this approach that we talked about earlier this is just demonstrating that you're not heating up anything even though you have got water in there it's essentially just a detuning effect and you can either change the frequency slightly to reach unit or you can change that network that I've talked about where you are able to control the impedance match the open question and I'll leave you with this is how do you actually put this in the roadway this is a problem that is completely unresolved it is a huge infrastructure effort for sure so whether this technology starts in sort of contained area environments such as warehouses factories docks and airports is still open for sort of for discussion and thought but in the long run if it is actually going to make it into sort of long distance travel then it could potentially go into one of the lanes where initially things like long haul trucks may use it especially with trucks where you have to deliver megawatts level of power in order to sort of propel them or sort of or at least if you are going to stop and charge them you'll need multi megawatts of power so if so just to give you numbers like a model 3 would require you something like seven kilowatts of propulsion power so we're very close to that level with our 3.75 kilowatt system but with trucks you'd have to be sort of probably 10 times higher than that so this is still open and it's ready for all the young bright people in this room too as well as older bright people in this room to to figure out and and clearly this whole methodology could enable all these three things that we want what's interesting is that these ideas have been around for a long time I found this ad from 1960s which essentially if you if you really have really good eyesight you can read it really says that we this is an ad by the electric utility industry which put out in the 60s because they were encouraging people to buy more of things that would used electricity and they were saying well we're bringing this to light and we're bringing that to light and they were also saying well we're gonna bring cars that will be driven electrically and propelled electrically and essentially you will you can have a sort of a game of I don't know whatever they're playing while the car is driving itself autonomously and this is sort of way back from like I think 1963 or four or something like that so people with great vision I guess have been around for a long time and we've all been kind of trying to get to this we're still trying to get to that but hopefully we go I'll just kind of leave you with that these are our sponsors we've also had some additional more recent industrial sponsors but this work that I presented is essentially done under arpa-e and NSF funding I'll leave it at that I would describe that as an action-adventure with a lot of big ups and downs I felt I was on the edge of my seat but ultimately a happy ending so I think I'm gonna side with Sally on the outlook for the next ten years or so easy for me to say it it was really the hard work was done by the graduate students I should really acknowledge apart from the funding agencies it's the students who really put all-nighters and tried to figure out how this thing would actually work that made it happen great so we do a few questions we have time for just a few questions any students maybe were to see a Tesla Model T with a mere significant difference so the goal would be to actually put in infrastructure that is compatible with both so most most likely it'll be a modular architecture so like each one of those pads would be able to deliver power that is more appropriate for say a medium sized vehicle you could you could power it at a lower power for a very small vehicle but then if you had a semi or some big truck come by you may actually need to power multiple of those things because I mean you especially if you can use the trailer that you have much more length available to you so if you're powering let's say ten of them you'd get ten times the power other questions since they are discussions we're like electric vehicles can also be used as storage facilities to balance out your research as well yeah so that's a very interesting problem and it's much more of an optimization thing which is to decide whether to have no batteries some batteries are a lot of batteries and what essentially is the answer really I think depends on somebody looking taking a deeper look at that I think the answer is gonna be somewhere in the middle so cars will still have batteries but probably fewer you would certainly still potentially be able to pull energy out in fact I'll give you a use case or suppose you're on a on a highway and you're accelerating you may want to pull energy from a car that's decelerating at the same time and use it for your acceleration so in addition to sort of providing balancing or reactive control for the grid you may even be able to just help roads cars that are sort of within a few miles of each other or when people build roads they plan not to touch them again for about twenty years roughly and so any system that's put in that would be the requirement from the road construction company's perspective that essentially it goes in for 20 years and then stays there until the road is has to be redone now roads when I say roads are redone there's always a continuous paved like surface finish that might happen in a more frequent sense so this system would be buried below that so it's not going to be right at the surface so it might have a in an inch or two inches of a surface coating on top which may wear off and may get replaced at more frequent timescale than three years okay I think we're just about at a time soon [Applause]
