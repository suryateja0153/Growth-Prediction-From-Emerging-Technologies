 Kubernetes is the hottest topic in cloud computing trending in the open-source community with over 61,000 stars on Github As a Kubernetes advocate we spoke with many business and developers in our community and learn that only and helpful of them are aware of Kubernetes to help those that want to learn more about Kubernetes we decided to run a VLog series on this topic. Hi! my name is Angel Ramirez founder and CEO of Cuemby I am a Certified Kubernetes Administrator will over 10 years of experience in software architecture in this video series we'll cover the documentation I hope you become familiar with it. In today's video will define what's Kubernetes and some of these high-level benefits before we go into Kubernetes let's do a quick history recap about application deployments back in the days companies used to run applications on bare metal servers this approach may resource a location hard to manage because there were no boundaries between the apps with a high probability of an app taking over the resources resulting in on the performance or even crashing the system a common way to solve this issue was by running each application on a dedicated server this solution was costly hard to maintain and non-scalable then virtualization came into the scene a VM is a machine that runs its operating system and all the components on top of a vectorized hardware with virtualization people can run multiple machines on a single server CPU enabling isolation between the applications among other benefits we gain security fair resource management and significant cost reduction also being able to create elderly the end was a massive advantage over traditional deployments with the breakthrough of Docker the container revolution just began containers are similar to a VM but lighter they are isolated from the host for the containers as well make it portable and for the clouds and operate the systems some of the benefits we came from containers are simple and faster image creation immutable images resource allocation and predictable performance taking advantage of the containers boom we head into the Kubernetes era culinary's is a portable extensible open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. initially created by Google are now backed by a growing open-source community called the Cloud Native Computer Foundation plus there is a specific list of companies featuring in the end user community such as Uber, Pinterest, Apple and Spotify just to mention a few you might ask what's the benefit of using communities when building this division systems using containers aren't the way to go but management is hard and messy who likes to wake up at 3:00 a.m. because a container or service crash in production certainly not me that's why you need a platform like Kubernetes that helps create manage distributed systems with Kubernetes out of the box, you get; Services Discovery, Load Balancing, Storage Orchestration, Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks, Self-Healing to mention just a few features in a nutshell kubernetes help you manage container eyes were closed efficiently and set you up with a framework for automation which allow you to be more productive and able to reduce costs by optimizing your resources. We cover enough in this video I hope you now have a better understanding of Kubernetes in the next video we'll go over the underlying architecture if you ask to stay tuned go ahead and subscribe and hit the notification button see in the next video
