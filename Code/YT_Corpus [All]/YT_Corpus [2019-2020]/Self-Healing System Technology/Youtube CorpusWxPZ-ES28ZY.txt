 A really good use case that we're working through now is, you know, CompuCom has a very long-standing partnership with Intel so what we're doing and actually have done already is we have integrated that next iteration of that management capability they call it EMA into our platforms into Self-Heal, so that we can do things out-of-band and what I mean out-of-band, think about it like this: Self-Heal gives us the capability to do anything we want to inside of the operating system. When we integrate that with the EMA, it gives us capability to do stuff outside of the operating system. Or even if using geofencing and you have a device that's in a store, for example, and that device leaves that store, we can do something as, you know, maybe not as intrusive as throw a notification on the device: "Hey, this this laptop is in an unsupported area, please return now", or again leveraging that Intel capability do something like a remote disk erase so that, you know, again it's all about security and being able to protect the asset and the customer data.
