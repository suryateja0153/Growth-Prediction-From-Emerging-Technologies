 The robotics industry needs sensor solutions  from SICK for every challenge.    Safe robotics, end -of-arm tooling and position  feedback motor feedback systems deliver data   on the speed, position and status of the drives  and build the foundation of sensors for all   robot movements p.m. headlock one since we're  on the background you see our current five kilo   robot it is used especially for pick-and-place  applications and handling tasks within mortal   feedbacks with motor feedback systems from SiC the  position accuracy and repeatability required here   are achieved and the robots can also be used  in the future for safe robotics applications it's a sama bite but the cooperation was sick was  excellent because we had a competent contact for   all issues who gave quick and expert feedback  the future is here sensor solutions from sick   make flexible automation solutions and freely  accessible robotics applications possible
