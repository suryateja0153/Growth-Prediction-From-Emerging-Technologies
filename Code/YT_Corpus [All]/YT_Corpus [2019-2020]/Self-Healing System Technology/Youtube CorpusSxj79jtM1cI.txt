 Could planetary habitats be fabricated with fungi? A team of researchers at NASA Ames is working to prove this idea isn't farfetched Research shows that mycelium (the branching, thread-like part of a fungus) has many valuable properties It has a higher bend strength than reinforced concrete and a higher compression strength than lumber It is an insulator, a fire retardant, and when supplied with food and water it is capable of growing and repairing itself This material could revolutionize how NASA designs structures for planetary exploration For more information visit: www.nasa.gov/niac This video represents a research study within the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program. NIAC is a visionary and far-reaching aerospace program, one that has the potential to create breakthrough technologies for possible future space missions. However, such early stage technology developments may never become actual NASA missions.
