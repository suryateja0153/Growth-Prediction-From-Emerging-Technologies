 from the cube studios in palo alto in boston connecting with thought leaders all around the world this is a cube conversation welcome to this cube conversation i'm lisa martin and i'm joined by two guests from ivanti today please welcome its president jeff abbott and it's chief product officer nayaki nayar jeff and nayaki it's so great to talk to you today pleasure to speak for you lisa pleasure to be here lisa look forward to this me too so jeff let's start with you transformation you got some big news that you're going to be sharing and breaking through the cube conversation today which we're going to dig into but there's been a lot of transformation at the top at ivanti you're new tell me about that and what's the shake-up that's been going on there to really drive this company forward yeah uh we have got a lot of transformation going on lisa and it's been an exciting ride for the first six months of my tenure at avonte i came in in january as president along with our our new ceo who has been chairman jim shaper and when jim and i started talking about avanti last fall the the challenges were pretty clear it's a company that's had uh outstanding employees fantastic customers and a real heritage of innovation but they had leveled off a little bit and uh the idea behind the new executive team was to bring in a team of veterans to take it to the next level really to grow to a billion dollars and beyond both organically and through acquisition so you're right we brought in a fantastic team of veterans people that jim and i have both worked with angie gunter new chief marketing officer mary trick a new chief customer officer we recently hired nayaki nayar who's with us today our chief product officer john flavin the head of our industry business unit and a host of others that have all come in with a single mission to take ivanti to the next level so nayaki let's dig into ivanti's vision a lot of change a lot of momentum i imagine with that change but what's your vision so uh let's take a step back uh lisa and you look at what i call ivanti's position of strength and when you look at the entire portfolio ivanti has one of the key strengths ivanti has is its ability to discover secure manage and service the endpoints right and if you look at the entire marketplace there is no vendor in the market today most of the uem vendors don't have service management service management don't have uem our ability ivanti's ability to do this end-to-end management of end points all the way from discovery to security to uh service management is what our key strength is that's a competitive advantage uh bringing these three pillars together under one umbrella and having a holistic story especially in this day and age of hobit and post covert where everyone is trying to manage those endpoints secure those endpoints and have almost a seamless experience as remote becomes the next normal going forward for every enterprise lisa yeah the next normal well there's data scatter there's device scatter and it's now almost like you know so many people working from home overnight a few months ago that now sort of have almost a more almost a relationship with our devices because they're our lifeline so for an organization to be able to understand where all those devices are people are you know now working from home but as you shared nayaki with me the other day there's some gartner data that demonstrates that 3.6 of the workforce before code was working from home it might be 10x that postcode so the amount of device scatter and data scatter and need to secure that challenge is even going up so how does ivanti help how do you solve that challenge so lisa if you put yourself in any large enterprise and organization that is dealing with this post coverage or addressing the needs of a remote worker the remote workers are growing through i would say explosive growth where they used to be like single digits three percent four percent before covet and now uh during coverage and after coverage it's probably going to be i would say 30 40 of remote workers that every enterprise has to now provide that service the seamless service experience as they are working from home they could be on the move so providing that seamless experience is i would say number one priority and a key challenge for for every enterprise so what we are going to be releasing and launching and announcing to the market given our position of strength in managing endpoints is how we help that seamless experience and what i call the ambient experience for an end user independent of where they're working from they could be working from home they could be on the move or office which is critical these days but before we dig into to the announcement jeff i wanted to ask you some of the stats that i've been seeing in terms of the c-suite and the amount of decisions that the c-suite has had to make in the last four months has been more than over the last five or so years talk to us a little bit about how your ivanti got together this new c-suite to make the decision to announce what you're going to talk about today so quickly oh no that's a great point and it's it's one that we had to quite frankly lisa the the market is demanding a hyper automation it's demanding more uh agnostic deployment it it needs more flexibility in terms of the ability to to be self-driven and sense and and service without a whole lot of intervention so we knew that when we came in as a new leadership team the first thing we had to do was get sort of the the go-to-market strategy in order which we did we we balanced the kind of our direct sales strategy with our our partner strategy we made some changes in the marketing organization to a more contemporary content focused demand generation style and we reset the company's focus on customer outcomes and in so doing we we changed the mentality to success is measured by are we meeting our customers intended business goals and that led us very quickly to say listen the unified it message we've been using for the last few years has been great and our customers have responded well to it and we've acquired a lot of new customers with that message but the game has changed and as nayaki was leading up to the expectation has changed the entire i.t space is relatively mature but the expectations and the pressure on that space has grown tremendously as you pointed out in the last few years just think of uh the number of devices we all now have to manage uh as a as as a company and it's growing and as nayaki will point out if she discusses our launch it's growing almost exponentially so uh we knew that we had to have a new product strategy we had to take the unified i.t message and start to think differently about how the it leaders in the field in our various customers around the world how their game has changed and sort of lean in to what they need in terms of automation ai bot technology and so on and that's what we're announcing with this uh with this latest release all right nayaki take it away what are you announcing yeah so what we are super excited about uh lisa is um to jeff's point to handle this explosive growth growth of devices growth of data that is being generated from those devices and also this explosive growth of remote workers you know the only way to handle this growth is through what we call automation and we are taking that next advanced automation that leapfrog strategy of what we call hyper automation embedding that into our entire stack into our uh uem endpoint management stack into our security stack and also service management to uh help customers what we call self-heal discover all the devices continuously optimize the performance optimize any configuration drifts and proactively predictively remediate any issues any issues that you see on on those devices and get into a world of what we call self-healing autonomous edge right where it's continuously detecting every issue and being able to predictively and cognitively self-heal that edge and this is what we are launching is what we brand it as ivanti neurons is the brand that we are launching for these automation these hyper automation bots that every company can deploy these hyper automation boards into their network that will constantly discover every device you have across your entire network discover any performance issues configuration drift issues uh security issues vulnerabilities anomalies and really get into what we call self-feeling self-securing and providing a service experience that we are used to in our day-to-day life or in our consumer world right so that's what we are announcing super excited about uh the overall launch the fact that every enterprise every company and it's not tied to any single vertical lisa any vertical organization can leverage these neurons and get that closer to self-healing of those devices that they have to now manage every organization that has to know i know ivanti has a lot of strengths in several verticals one of them being healthcare and i can imagine right now the last five months the hyper status that every hospital and clinic is in i'm curious though about the name jeff talk to me about in this new the next normal that we're living in neurons what does that mean what does it mean to your customers yeah great question and i know this uh this will uh resonate with you lisa as an accomplished biologist uh what the idea is is uh with what we're providing and what we're launching with neurons there's a there's a sense of of hyper scale hyper automation like the synapse in your brain handles so much information at once so we wanted to personalize the launch of these solutions when when you see the announcement next week you'll see a series of products across the spectrum avanti solutions the itsm endpoint management security and so on and we address in each of those areas uh the self-sensing self-healing self-servicing of each of those business processes so like your synapse or your neurons in your brain uh there'll be a lot of uh super fast automation super fast sensing of challenges and addressing those challenges and that's why we want neurons it was actually a pretty fun contest in the company and uh uh we we really believe neurons will connect with our with our target market i love it and the biologist part of me is going that makes sense so naoki over to you and in terms of that connectivity perspective there's so many disparate data sources out there it's only growing and and jeff you kind of mentioned this how can like one of your existing 25 000 customers use deploy this on top of their existing infrastructure to start connecting data sources that they may not even know they can connect or that they may not know does it make even sense to connect them yeah so so the beauty of the entire neuron network is uh it uses mqtt protocol lisa which is the protocol that immediately detects every device be it endpoint desktops laptops mobile devices or even i was interested in iot devices that it automatically detects and census if there is anything happening on those devices any any kind of predicts if there's any issue that may happen like i said performance issues configuration differential security issues and who's that data in real time the beauty of this is the speed at which it holds this data i have seen customers who can deploy this across their entire network around the world and within seconds it's able to pull the data um into a central console and give a i would say a full 360 view of every device you have every uh user that's using those devices all the applications that are running on these devices and the services that are being delivered those devices so just the power of being able to hold that much data in seconds and provide that 360 view of what we call a neuron workspace for any it organization to have that full 360 view and detect and predict if there's any issue and almost like get into a self feeling to mediate it before it interrupts your productivity or interrupts your uh any service disruption so i think you were trying to say something go ahead i was just going to add to that nayaki and and you asked this or made this point lisa nayaki and i are speaking to the healthcare industry almost every day we are very in tune with the challenges they're experiencing obviously with what's happening right now around the world uh and as as nayaki is describing this the neurons we intend to be a very seamless improvement to their existing i.t uh processes and so on in fact when i describe this to some of the hospitals i've been speaking to and certainly the i.t staff and and leaders within uh they are fascinated and very excited about what we're describing because if you think about it um you know uh i.t challenges down at the device level in the healthcare industry can be life critical and they need to solve those i.t challenges very fast they need to know when their new endpoints are online they need to know when they need servicing they need to know when the software needs patching we're not talking about uh you know just being on hold and being frustrated if you're having an i.t challenge we're talking about life and death so uh neurons is absolutely what the healthcare industry is asking for in terms of self-healing self-sensing self-securing and so on they need those attributes in their business model now definitely more than ever absolutely they do and so nayaki talking to customers in healthcare whatnot i can see this being a great tool for the it analyst but also maybe even helping the it analysts and business users have better relationships that overall help drive a business forward yeah so you you put yourself in in an end user or a line of business uh they expect when especially in in this day and age of post postcode uh lisa they expect a consumer grade experience to be delivered to them you know they expect their service provider to know exactly where they're working from what devices they have how all those devices are not just secure but understands the preferences i need as an individual and provides that service experience to me so i mean that i would say a close tie-in between what the business wants the end users in those lines of business want and how it or any service organization can provide that service to employees customers and consumers is what really neurons i would really uh helps us get closer and closer to the consumer grade experience that we all are used to in our day-to-day life and and to jeff's point in addition to healthcare which is a strong industry vertical for us some other industries retail is another big industry that we are very strong in lisa and also supply chain rugged devices in a warehouse so it really gives us a huge expansion opportunity beyond just managing the it devices or endpoints to also managing the iot devices by industry vertical in those segments where we already have a very very strong foothold because of the technology that we have that powers this whole thing in the backend and we're seeing some of the numbers of you know 40 plus billion connected devices in the next few years so jeff let's end this with you i know there's more coming but you probably have a great partnership suite that you're working with to enable this talk to us a little bit about the partners and then what's next yeah no great point lee said that i come from a heritage of companies that have leveraged partners and we continue to grow our partner network we believe strongly in the strength of the extended ecosystem solution partners delivery partners global systems integrators they all have a role in neurons and we're excited to continue to provide the platform for mutual growth between us and those partners and what's really important is these are companies that our customers really love as well so we're going to continue to in some cases tie our solutions together in some cases extend our services organization through partners uh and in some cases we'll actually service our customers through our channel partner network we actually went through a little bit of a rationalization to really zero in on our most strategic partners we've done that we finished that in the first six months of coming on board and now we are uh hitting the gas pedal and going full speed to market with a great group of partners and again that you'll see that ecosystem more and more as part of our strategy excellent so neurons announced what's next well there's quite a bit behind neurons so it will take us uh uh probably into at least 2021 getting all the solutions launched and getting them uh engrained with our customers out there well we fully intend to continue to innovate and if there's one thing i leave you with lisa it's that that's our our big announcement more than anything i mean ivanti's had a history of innovation it's a company that uh practically invented patching uh uh and keeping all the devices up to speed on on the latest virus protection software and so on uh there's a lot of uh you know legacy companies within our footprint that are now completely tied together and under the neuron strategy under nayaki's leadership we intend to put innovation out into the marketplace quarter after quarter after quarter but neurons for now will keep us quite busy so we're very excited well congratulations on that ivanti innovation hyper automation jeff nayaki it's been such a pleasure talking to you thank you for joining me on thecube today thank you lisa for my guests i'm lisa martin you're watching a cube conversation [Music] you
