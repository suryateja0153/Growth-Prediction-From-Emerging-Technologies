 all thanks for the introduction and also thanks for coming to our presentation I'm Correa and she is fun and we are going to talk about the self-healing UI mechanically and electrically so healing materials for sensing and actuation interfaces so this is a collaboration works between HCI researchers electrical engineers and also a material scientists in Carnegie Mellon University's so as all of you know existing interfaces work very robustly but once broken it's really hard to fix them for example my smartphone has a lot of cracks on the board surfaces but on the other hand if you look around the nature we see a lot of examples of living things healing their own for example giggles and of starfishes can regenerate their tails and arms and drafty trees can share nutrition even between the different kind of trees so our motivation needs to build interactive systems using such kind of so hidden phenomena and there are two research questions to achieve this goal the first question is the fabrication method how can we add social ability from such kind of self-healing materials into the devices and even after fabricating a device there comes another questions of design space so how can we leverage such kind of self-healing devices into the interaction so first of all I like to overview the material preparation in the fabrication process although we made a lot of effort for material selection and experiments due to the time limitation please refer to the paper or ask a question later for more detailed information or a quantitative data so what is still here in polymer different from a conventional polymer that cannot be healed after cut into pieces there are some polymers called self-healing polymer that can form a physical or chemical bonds after damage so as you can see in the left video this is a pneumatic robot made from a self-healing material which is using a chemical reaction called diels-alder reaction on the right you can see the material starts to heal in about one over if we apply 95 degrees Celsius of heat so although there are enormous numbers of reports on the sieve material sciences community the main material we use is called poly boron silicon PBS a derivative material of PDMS and what is interesting about this material is PVS can sell here in six hours without any material supply or external stimulus such as heat to trigger self-healing process and this amazing phenomena is enabled by the special cross-linking called beta bond between boron and oxygen so which makes it possible to repeatedly breaks and connects the polymer chains but only using the pure PBS as interface systems is not enough due to the two problems one problem is the creeping effect although we do nothing to this material a PBS starts to deform as time passes due to the gravity force and the other problem is it's not conductive so we might sometimes need some conductivity to build a practical electrical systems so in order to solve these problems of creaking and insulation we use the material multi-walled carbon nanotubes PBS this is a composite material of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and PBS and carbon nanotubes forms a network structure inside of the composite and this prevents and sustain the PBS from flowing around and the other benefit of using multi-walled carbon nanotubes network is it can also work as a conductor so as you can see the video again although PBS shows the large deformation but multi-walled carbon nanotubes shows almost no deformation and this material is also conductivity tunable which is very very suitable for device fabrication and of course this carbon nanotubes PBS inherits a mechanical heating property from PBS so as you can see these pieces stick starts to stick to each other in as short as sin in seconds and then perfectly healed in six hours so our idea is to build a hybrid system of PBS and on multiple carbon nanotubes PDS to build a hybrid key level system in which PBS works as an insulator while multiple carbon nanotubes PBS works as a conductor and also a mechanical support to constrain the whole system so for example if you wanna make a device like a controller we can use carbon nanotubes PBS at the bottom at a mechanical constraint and also work use it as a sensor matrix in the middle layer which are sandwiched by the insulated previous layers then and we built this kind of system using a CNC cutting plotter first of all we cut the sheet of PBS and amount of all components of the PBS into the designated shape and later on we just stack them together into the 3d structure and one interesting thing about this fabrication process is due to the intrinsic mechanical and electrical heating property we do not need any kind of glue to build a continuous body will propose reasons on mastering our paper we can sense attach of a human finger we could also sense how much pressure is pressed down the material a strip of multi-walled carbon nanotubes can be used as a cat sensor as our material can help you we can sense the cut and then heal the strip back you´d this sensor multiple times our approach to realize touch sensing is by measuring the capacitance between multi-walled carbon nanotubes and the human body the working principle for pressure and cousin singh is relatively simple so they share the same logic for the circuit multi-walled carbon nanotubes is used as a matching resistor between 5 volts and the ground before looking to the applications for paper we would like to summarize design spaces commerce no shape changing interfaces could afford depending on surfaces of material this includes solid solid liquid and liquid solid shape-changing interfaces has been widely explored in 1d 2d and 3d form based on reconfiguring voxels solid equation ship changing interfaces has been introduced by elastomers dynamically transform or comfortable the prescription the interfaces has been introduced by manipulating magnetic field or electrical field to hear of use multiple droplets since our paper is highly based on the material properties for self-cleaning material we include our three phases in the design space for our paper we demonstrate transferability and conformability for the solid-liquid phase reconfigurability for the solid phase since our material can heal and self use it belongs to the liquid phase for the material our first application is a transformative soft controller it has a cousin sir pressure sensor and Caxton's are all made out of multiple cabinent - integrated in one controller we want to demonstrate dynamic transfer ability depending on different user cases so originally the controller is in the normal mode at a pressure sensor the red dot shows how much pressure is pressed on the controller if your join two controllers together they will heel into one piece and you will become a touch enabled keyboard for the piano as our materials conform Bo you can also wrap this around your waist so it will become a wristband with the slider inside if you cut this long piece into four smaller pieces the cousins are inside will detect the cut and enter the cat mode so the controller will become four sliders and you can share those with your friends our second application is a confirmed Bo damage sensor imagine how your skin works your skin can feel instance will you have a damaged and then here is self pack so inspiring by how human skin works we fabricate this damage sensor as a second skin we use PB s fabric as the substrate so it could stick to human skin really well this damage sensor can detect different predation of cats so it is contrast of cousin sir matrix with the body using self-healing materials you can cut this sensor and heal this sensor back our next application is that reconfigurable actuator the body of this actuator is made of Koh flex dragon skin with the joined parts coating with PBS originally this actuator will give us a pending curve if you cut it out flip it round reattach it and let itself kill for well you could get the S curve out of the same actuator in the third column will show we can get a short version for this pending curve by removing part of this actuator our next application is a heating heart imagine how you go through a heart broken moment after a while you feel better and your heart is our hope is again so this heart is a physical and material version for that moment we want to show examples of us embedding electrical components like LED inside the devices when users sprint to broken hearts together the the castle's are inside will detect the electrical connection and LED will start flashing with the top cover later PBS self here in six hours the red hand side video shows and time lasting image for the PBS to self here in six hours our last application is a fusing dose puzzle with die PBS with different colors after we connect them they will sell feels into a continuous and uniform body after six hours multiple multi will come in a little strips will also self-heal into one strip so when we provide in part with it will generate heat for the thermal crock making a layer to change color on edge so here our conclusions in the previous slides I propose two research questions the first question was how can we add self-heal ability and I propose a we propose hybrid structure of PBS multiple carbon nanotubes and other components and built a layer by layer glueless fabrication method and as for the second question of how can we leverage the social ability we propose the five design space of transformable conformable reconfigurable healable and infusible nature which self-healing materials can allow and propose the 5 corresponding applications to them and here i like to discuss about the safety of the much mark multiple carbon nanotubes because one of the biggest concern from the reviewer was about the safety so as some of you know carbon nanotubes can be dangerous if you absorb the particle into your cardiovascular system so in the material fabrication process it is only safe under a suitable wet lab environment and also under training but in use our so here in UI is safe even when cutting hearing and interacting with bare hands this is because after clearing the multi-walled carbon nanotubes PDS the interaction force between PBS and carbon nanotubes are so strong enough to prevent nanotubes exposure to the air and of course there are some limitations to our project first of all there is no trigger to control to control the healing so there should be another design space if we have a self-healing material which have a kind of switch to turn on and turn off the cell healing property and the next question next limitation is a slow healing speed so far for six hours in our implementation but if we just make the material sustaining a certain amount of mechanical force we don't have to wait until the perfect healing for six hours but we can just wait for example 10 second 10 minutes or so and the third limitation is that device design so anyway previous flaws inside of the devices so we always have to constrain that device with some stiffer material like a motorboat carbon nanotubes PBS or other silicones which decreases that design freedom and the last limitation is the stocking based fabrication method we are using the reason why we do not use a 3d paint in processes after extrusion in general it is really hard to keep the shape of - so healing materials into the same shape and the reason why we didn't use a laser cutting processes the heat generated from the laser cutting will drastically ruined the self-healing property of the polymer so I like to conclude this presentation with some visions of multi material interfaces as autonomous life-form so conventionally these people mainly focused on the sensors or conductors which can sense the environment or think like rains or send informations to your body as nerves or actuators as muscles over your body but we father envisioned future directions of material interfaces as an autonomous thing like so heating UI works as a high-level body and so self assembly techniques words works as a metaphor of metamour forces for example from chrysalis or cocoon into the butterfly or a mean we might be able to use some other autonomous functions with the material we do not have so far so we believe the interface system with some novel materials will drastically enrich and extend the current border of the interaction designs yeah this is the end of the presentation thanks so much [Applause] here we have time for a few questions great Todd thank you what's the effect of temperature on the self-healing speed if you go cold if we go hot and how does it affect the brittleness of the material so far we didn't check the temperature relationship between the healing speed but I think as the temperature goes higher the circuiting speed also gets higher because the moving speed of the material goes faster and faster but I don't think in the room temperature that that change is so drastic I do want to answer the first question also at one more point so there's a limitation for the material there's a limitation for the temperature you can go if you go feel above 808 T sorry 18,000 degree the PBS and multi will come and nanotubes will melt so you don't want to go that high for the temperature how important is it that the cut you make is clean if I was to just tear it with that make a difference so you've cut with a razor blade but if I was to just tear the thing in half with my hands and have a very unclean cut would that make a difference to how well are you the material is stretchy and is soft so if you apply too little force it cannot break it's like you stretch a elastomer so you will be elongated okay oh by the way we will have a demonstration today so you can come by and I feel the material yeah I'll try that Thanks any more questions hi Lisa Pelican University of Washington um I noticed that when you were using your material as a touch sensor you were using it for these really like discreet elements that mapped one-to-one to things on the screen if you were going to use it for a much more fine-grained touch sensor like a trackpad or something do you have accuracy and like morphing issues when you break things and like things might not align right back together yeah like if you were going to use your material as a touch sensor but firm in a much more fine-grained way than having these like blobby keys that map to your keyboard do you have to worry about when you cut things and then put them back together things don't heal like that realigned yeah that is a good question yeah every time you have to make it heal you have to care about the alignment of that much video otherwise it's really hard to decompose the material if you make a misalignment so that's why you just use those like described spaces thanks okay let's thank the speakers one more time [Applause]
