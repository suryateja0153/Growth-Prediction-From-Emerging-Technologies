 So when we talk about self healing, the top questions are, one, there's a lot of concerns around security. Not every customer is ready to adopt the Cloud and with that we've got some different options around deployment. We can do certainly a full on Prem which we try to stay away from because there's cost and operational overhead tied to that but we also can do a hybrid approach. So, if for example, let's take Office Depot where their cash registers never go online... we can install a gateway in the store so that the devices are point-of-sale device is connected to the Gateway and then from the gateway it talks to the SAS based instance. So, we've got a lot of flexibility and scalability around the deployment options in order to get there. And then from a deployment perspective, you know, a lot of customers are wanting to know where is this installed and really the biggest question is: What is my return on investment? And the ROI as we measure today is solely based on the automation and the number of incidents that we can detect and resolve automatically in the environment. But there's certainly other experience aspects that aren't part of that and an example that we're working on for a future state later this year is, you know, I am a service owner... I have branches or stores that I'm responsible for. I can use a mobile application or even some type of online portal so that I can see the assets that I'm responsible for. If there are issues for them and then be able to schedule automations to run let's say outside of store hours. Learn more about self healing that 800-350-8430. zero
