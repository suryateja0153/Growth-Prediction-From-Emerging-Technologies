 welcome everybody to uh today's connie conversations chris moore and i are going to be hosting this discussion together with our two colleagues at brown lee hochberg and david borton we'll be focusing on a discussion around restorative neurotechnology so it's tremendously exciting to have both lee and david here very good dear colleagues at brown fabulous researchers uh in this area of neuro restoration neurotechnology so starting with lee lee is a professor of engineering here at brown he's also the director of the va rehabilitation research and development center for neuro restoration and neurotechnology at the providence va medical center also the director of the center for neurotechnology and neuro recovery neural critical care and acute stroke services in the department of neuro neurology and mass general hospital and um also a senior lecturer uh on neurology at the harvard bentical school so very multi-talentedly probably not much time left to do much else um but uh as leigh will tell you and we're gonna give lee and david um a good amount of time to describe uh their passion um and and their their goal and their mission um around their research but um just as a very high level leads really um been at the forefront of developing and testing your novel neurotechnologies to help people with paralysis and other neurological disorders and i said we'll jump into this he's received a number of different prizes and um outside of doing all that he does um in this area he is also a passionate um brown alum and captain of the browns fencing team which we were just discussing and this is a connection that we and i have which we can talk about ad nauseam but we won't because this is not the topic but i did find a quote from lee um way back i think you were interviewed for an alum magazine and he said if brown didn't have a fencing team i probably would have end up matriculating somewhere else there you go so david um david borton is a neuroengineer also at brown he's an assistant professor in the biomedical engineering section of the school of engineering uh and in addition lee um also has an appointment at the providence va medical center in the neural restoration and neurotechnology group david um has on his website and i think very beautiful summary of of what really drives him and motivates him and his group to design develop and deploy neurotechnology to better understand the nervous system and improve human lives um so i think both both lee and um taylor will probably get into what is motivating them uh in their research why i'm certainly going to ask you that question as i head into it um but really fabulous and these really um sorry david is really um in his research uh he said independent research here at brown has really expanded the the scope of of using neurotechnology um to record to provide a restoration and and also for neural stimulation and so that the breadth of what um what david is working on now i think is really quite impressive and so we'll also get into that and i read that or i heard earlier that david is a real soccer fan and used to play soccer in college a little bit just jump into a few kind of opening questions so so the audience can hear more about your research and and as i said what motivates you actually one of my own vivid memories in fact it's seared into my brain this is how um incredible i thought what i was hearing when i started brown about 30 years ago now and um i was sitting listening to a presentation by john donahue and i'm not i'm far from neurotechnology and engineering and systems level neuroscience i'm more on the molecular cellular end of neuroscience but i was just completely blown away by listening to john in his early discussions about their hypotheses and their ideas that it was going to be possible to record sufficient information from the motor cortex to be able to drive and operate artificial devices and i remember sitting listening to this i can see john now on the stage i can see the auditorium and that tells you all what an impact that had on me and i was like really that seems impossible and of course it wasn't impossible it just took incredible amount of work incredible amount of basic research um years and years and years uh in order to be able to develop that technology and so you know to begin with i just thought it would be really fun to ask you both um a little about what got you going in this field um is there a moment or a discovery or an accomplishment that keeps you both going in research which we of course understand there are ups and downs but a lot of ups so lee do you want to pick up on that set of string of questions there you can pick whatever you want but like is there a moment that you can tell us about or you thought ah this is what i want to do this is what i see myself doing in research absolutely and uh and thanks dan for that really uh very kind introduction and it's great to be here today the i i do remember exactly that moment but i think i probably have to start a couple years before that when i was an undergrad in neuroscience at brown having all kinds of just incredible opportunities sitting as a first-year student in alumni hall hearing wayne bowen talk about neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter receptors and just being captivated i remember where i was sitting in the very big alumni hall and certainly remember where he was standing at the lecture in the front and and then a year later i talked to my then became concentration advisor uh leslie leslie smith uh i was trying to figure out you know how can i get involved in research in neuroscience i'm already captivated by the courses how can i how can i learn more and uh and her suggesting that i take a few courses that were part of the concentration and and and subsequently working with foreigner who is then director of the uh that then program in neuroscience um and then taking a wet lab neurobiology course taught by john donahue who at the time was uh i would guess just a few years into being an assistant professor at brown and uh and and hearing the magic of neuron firing and kind of watching you know what would happen with an aplegia as one record from a uh from a ganglion and just the uh i was so excited by each of those moments so the course work at brown the opportunity as an undergraduate to then work as i did with uh with fordhamner and to to watch a vibration that is a rat whisker get wiggled and to listen to that sound of neurons firing that was particularly particularly a percussionist that was mozart and uh and i knew that you know i wanted not just to hear that sound but to really help to uh to understand how the brain works and uh and to understand how to repair it uh when it's not working the way that it could and that led me so eventually getting to answer your question uh there are other moments i should mention that this was in the period of time where you had to reserve a spot to use the laser printer to print out your thesis your undergraduate thesis because there was only one laser printer and i'm pretty sure it was in john's lab so i had to go across the hall make sure nobody else was using it my mother typed my thesis actually so we could talk about that for a long time we understand what we should the um so towards the end of my undergraduate career was looking you know it was because of the brown neuroscience program that i became interested in really doing science and becoming a scientist in addition to what was a long-standing interest in medicine so i began to apply to md phd programs and as i was traveling to various places and interviewing for md phd programs in february of 1990 having taken john's course in neurobiology being interested in learning and memory i met a guy his name was don humphrey and i remember being in his lab and him talking about the research that he was hoping to do in the next few years and casually mentioning that his plan was to record from non-human primate cortex and allow those recordings to drive a robot arm and he said it and i nodded as a good undergraduate interviewee hoping to land a spot in fdp program might do and then i just i remember saying can you say that again and he again said that his plan was then he was then submitting for what would become the first nih neural prosthesis program contract uh to do real time at that point offline neural decoding of of voluntary movement and i was completely captivated by that idea not only for all the understanding of fundamental motor neuroscience but for the obvious potential that that then really only idea had uh to become a technology that would help people with paralysis and other forms of neurologic injury so uh i remember that moment i remember that it was really sunny out which is atypical in new england for february and is really more common in atlanta i don't know where it was from february so i think everything uh aligned nicely there and uh i could continue for quite some time john donahue was subsequently on my thesis committee uh and got to continue the uh the the great interaction i got to continue to benefit from that mentorship and teaching throughout my graduate school and uh then was quite fortunate to continue to contribute to the work uh after i uh completed my residency so that and and that's the short version happy to go on twitter i love that you you know the that you began to talk about the action potential because i think that we probably of all like you know the first time i saw an action potential on an oscilloscope i was like what and it and the thing fired again and this kind of the same way and i was like how is that possible i mean it's just the most beautiful thing and the speed and the precision i mean it's just incredible so i love that you started david so i'm gonna should i repeat what i asked of um lee but like you you trained um for part of your phd at brown and worked with arto nirmiko and um and john donahue and went off to epfl and came back to brown the best place to to do neurotechnology but um you know what do you have give us a little bit of your background and thinking about what the training meant to you and then a few moments of of the wow moments that that we've all experienced what were they for you yeah uh first again thank you for inviting me to this conversation and for the lovely introductions it's wonderful to be chatting with all of you uh you know virtually during our times of being pretty isolated these days so it's really nice to see everyone's faces and have a fun conversation um so so yeah i you know i came at this perhaps from from many uh steps of occasions that have all built to perhaps where i am today and i think they all follow an underlying thread of uh perhaps naive kiras curiosity that i sort of had throughout this time and it's taken me on somewhat of a random walk but gotten to me to where i am today and it starts with as as you mentioned briefly sort of this fascination with soccer that i have when i was younger and really i thought that was my life my previous life was a soccer player until i was about 16 and a half years old uh and i thought little of anything else before that um and i won't go into the stories of what transpired at that point but sort of coming to realize at that age that i had a lot of curiosity my parents drove into me a love and fascination of the natural world and soccer was wonderful but it wasn't going to appease that curiosity and so i i decided to come back from brazil where i was at the time and and apply to college and a long story short here again is that college was actually quite difficult for me to get into as an undergraduate most colleges didn't understand and i wasn't very good at the time of explaining what happened for a couple of years that i wasn't really in high school and at the time the internet was not so ubiquitous and his communications were all you know email was not really all there and so it kind of got lost in a couple of my application packages and i ended up getting into uh the university that i ended up going to was washington university in st louis which is a great biomedical engineering school um and i sort of randomly checked biomedical engineering as an interest when i applied there it turns out by checking that box it actually put me to a separate pool of applicants to apply to the school of engineering at washington university in st louis i didn't realize that until i got there but it was great and there i was an engineer at washington university of st louis one of the top engineering schools in the country and i had a really wonderful time both learning fundamentals it was a big on-ramp time for me coming from a sort of different background but i had wonderful wonderful teachers as lee described here at brown there are a whole host of wonderful teachers i had at the at washington university in st louis and in particular i had incredible research opportunities there as many students do here at brown i started out doing uh computational modeling of behavior believe it or not and sort of using something called uh pdp plus plus if anyone remembers that sort of a computational cognitive modeling software where todd braver steve menoric josh brown who've been on gone on started their own programs at other universities the computational modeling at that time it was a little abstract for me so i then switched over to a lab actually the steve manderick's lab right doing um xenopus oocyte gaba uh channel recordings and and thinking about the flow of you know charges from the inside of the outside of a cell as a uh you know i think that was a junior at that time and while that was really interesting and it got me exposed to these beautiful physical connections to the biology where you're using probes and looking at a cell and recording from it that was really beautiful in its own right it didn't have yet sort of the um it didn't quite appease all of my different curiosities so i moved on to a laboratory uh of larry snyder where he started looking at for the first time uh fmri uh functional magnetic resonance imaging of the rhesus macaque uh primates of awake animals so we were actually the time building this new structure to test out how we would do fmri and look at brain uh blood flow or oxygenation in different brain areas uh in this really uh appropriate and interesting animal model and that tool development process really i think stuck with me and that wow we're gonna really work on building optimizing this tool to look at the brain in a sort of a new way at the time uh and i played a small role in that as an undergraduate writing lots of shell scripts to you know register this image of that image things like that um but while i was there one of the uh you know big findings in early fmri work was this resting state uh networks of the brain uh washu played a big role in development of resting state networks and i was sort of in the middle of this wonderful computational mathematical thought group while i was building these fmri tools and that i think solidified my very solid interest in brain and systems of the brain and tools that could be applied to that now my perhaps aha moment was when i came then to apply to graduate school and was in conversations with argenomico and john donahue i came to visit to brown and i remember them showing me i think it was john in one of his offices in the basement of some biomed building showing me the uh the utah array uh it was a little microelectric array connected to a pedestal that was metal piece and it just seemed like such old technology i mean i don't know i was i was at a time it was news at the time it was still fascinating to me where he says today we're putting this in the brains of people to help them move again uh but look at all these wires we've got to find how are we going to bring this into really the 21st century and really leverage our knowledge of engineering and tool building to make this a much more streamlined process uh to really gain true access read write to to the brain and that was i think for me i realized this is tools can we can build tools to really change the trajectory of this neurotechnology initiative at brown at the time and sort of the big push that was going on so i fell in love with that at my phd time and continued to work under artur amiko and john and my phd and we'll probably maybe i'll stop there maybe we'll get to some other uh aspects of beyond the aha moments of the phd time into our career yeah that's great thank you i didn't know you recorded from other sites wow yeah long time ago this is what i love about these conversations yeah i'm gonna jump i think i'm gonna jump back to lee and perhaps pick up you mentioned the utah array and um the development because it's early development the brain machine interfaces and wires and of course going wireless but lee i think you know i think for many of us we you know we look at all just what it took to pull together the research teams you know that are needed in order to be able to really drive advances uh in this really important area and um i wonder if it'd be really great if you could say a little bit more of course about what brain machine interfaces are um a little bit but but then tell us a bit about um the importance of of the of the bringgate consortium um with brown mgh harvard case western stanford and the va just a real incredible group of phenomenal scientists neurologists but coming together not just multidisciplinary but also multi-institutional to just continue to really drive this area forward and to share know-how and share technology and how important has this been you have a really a leadership position of course in that group but so perhaps say a bit about what you what our brain machine interfaces uh and then i think it would be really fun to hear about the importance of of that of that multi-institutional consortium as well yeah sure the um as i think about brain computer interfaces lots of different ways to define them but broadly speaking in any brain computer interface there's a real-time recording of brain signals lots of ways that could happen and those brain signals are then interpreted in real time to do something useful so an interpretation of course is happening by a computer so broadly speaking a bci or brain computer interface should be able to restore some function or provide some function that's been lost as a result of neurologic injury or disease in our particular brain gate research as you alluded to and as david mentioned the we've been using the utah array which continues today to be the gold standard for chronic intracortical recording to be able to record ensembles of individual neurons and the motor cortex of people with tetraplegia for for years on end they would also very nicely described the still state-of-the-art uh method for doing so which is uh one or a few arrays in the brain connected by fine wires to a percutaneous pedestal and uh and then connecting that either by a hard-wired kind of mid-1990s looking serial cable uh to an amplifier and or a bunch of computers um and more recently again thanks to david archer and amico and and john and and john simrall and others planning uh to a wireless external system and then uh hopefully soon and people to a fully implanted and wireless system so uh the the technology for the participants in our study and can uh speak more of if of interest later about the brain gate study but uh for the people who've joined us who either have spinal cord injury or brainstem stroke or als who have lost or losing the ability to move their hands that utah array that recording system and all of the computational neuroscience that permits that real-time decoding of the language of the nervous system into some useful output in order to bring all of that together not only for our participants in the trial but we hope for many many more people uh with paralysis uh in the future uh it takes exactly the multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary team that you mentioned and all the progress that we've made has been the result of that team of neuroscientists and neuroengineers and neurologists and computer scientists and neurosurgeons neurosurgeons and applied mathematicians and i'm sure i just left out several and offended them in the process of leaving now for which i apologize but the the group and worth mentioning at the beginning um and uh this started as a spin-off company from brown called cyber kinetics it required investor capital uh to really launch this big of an endeavor so uh now fully back in academia we can talk about that if interesting or but that to me it took years to get everybody who was extremely uh well trained if you will had a deep understanding of neuroscience or of electrical engineering or of neurosurgery or of neurology i had the great fortune of watching that group of people sit around the same tables drinking the same coffee and learning each other's language learning that autonomy means something different to a neurologist and a roboticist they are nearly uh completely different words but both really need to understand what each other's talking about when they're using the same word and thinking about how we're going to bring the very best of engineering ingenuity and innovation uh to clinical practice really requires clinical insight to be at that engineering bench uh when it begins and it took years to develop that and it was fun uh incredibly rewarding to to watch that occur and and ever since then the braingate research has involved not only that multidisciplinary group that continues to teach each other every day and learn from each other but as you mentioned just an extraordinary multi-institutional collaboration uh where the very best of some great institutions are brought together in a transparent brutally honest collaboration where my graduate students have either the benefit or the challenge of getting the same kind of review of their science not just from me but from other pis at other institutions and the same thing uh kind of across the country so uh we've learned a lot from each other and i think at the end it just speaks to the uh not just a meritocracy which is a convenient phrase but of really having an open venue to to develop ideas out loud to learn from each other and in what has to be a multi-disciplinary endeavor uh to really benefit from uh from teamwork and as a result i think it's been really successful thank you as you said like this nothing comes easy just my summary and you really need experts who've you know worked for years deep deep deep knowledge in in specific areas but for this to really come together i think chris you had um there's a question that came in do you want to post that to david yeah sure so we got a great question on the feed here which is almost identical to the question i was going to ask i think the question is do you see future brain machine interfaces relying on wires or maybe in a decade or so the state of the art could be a combination of optical electrical magnetic acoustic or even genetic recording and manipulation my version that question was give me the hard science fiction version of what's coming that isn't possible now but this is probably a much better stated version of that so david maybe take a crack at that but obviously if you wanted to offer yeah sure i'll start and then pass it around so great question right uh so so wires are everywhere uh it just depends on where you're actually gonna put the wires uh you know i think let me get concrete about that um you know every chip that you put into uh you know some on a cell phone so apple's big events and new cell phones today great those chips have millions and millions and these little wires connecting up these fancy parts of certain chips to other fancy parts of certain ships and they've decided that it makes the best sense for them to put all these different chips together and connect them with all these different wires in this thing that we call a phone and we put it on the outside of our face in the bmi breakthrough interface world or implantable neurotechnologies i think it's a real serious question of how we distribute these chips or these computational uh resources around the whole system which includes in the body out of the body in the cloud right there's lots of wires everywhere um but when you think about where are the critical places to remove wires uh and i think one of those these days is removing wires that go from inside the body to outside the body because that's one one of the reasons that we've had a very one challenge in moving to clinical adoption is having a percutaneous connection not the only and it's not even necessarily the biggest one but it is a a challenge um and you could solve that by optical methods potentially uh if you want to you know we've worked hard to enrico and i have spent a lot of time developing and with ykk song and others uh developing an optical data transmission pipeline to send data at very high bandwidths outside from the inside to the outside of the body wirelessly there are around the country who are particularly working on ultrasound to send power into devices at different locations in the body there's a whole program from darpa called electrics it's all about you know trying to stimulate different nerves around the body peripheral nerves most particularly and a lot of those are using ultrasound as a way to deliver power to an implanted device but all of those in the end have wires they have a chip somewhere it's going to be you know connecting little pieces of the circuit to another piece of the circuit so i really think it's more a question of the distribution of wires and where we choose to put our computational resources and i think all the methods that were described in the question are all great opportunities and it's just a matter of where you use each one of those different ones and how to optimize the benefits and drawbacks of each one yeah dave i couldn't agree more and i want to bring this question in part back to uh a comment that uh that diane made a little bit earlier just about motivation uh for this research the uh and and to me one of the biggest challenges that we have not only in the lab but as a consortium as a field is is deciding what to do next and how do we how do we prioritize of the huge range of research both neuroscience and neuroengineering that we could do and development which in some ways is different than research what should we as a group focus on and uh you know as we as we thank chris to your question and the one that was posted uh there's a range from what do we need now to what could we do in the future that's clinically useful to what is in the realm of science fiction and uh as mentioned i spend some of my time as a neuro-intensivist and i was on just a couple weekends ago and that's that is i work as a as a clinician in a neuro-intensive care unit uh helping people who have uh either just had a traumatic brain injury or subrecording hemorrhage or a large hemispheric stroke or life-threatening infections of the nervous system unremitting seizures and i was on it was two weekends ago and uh there were two people on that same weekend who i met who had some version of locked in syndrome and when i walk in to that person's room and i see somebody who yesterday or last week was able to walk and able to speak able to move and suddenly can't move and can't speak or has been progressively losing that ability the motivation is is clear the the need is immediate and trying to figure out what can we do now so that the next time i'm in the intensive care unit and i see somebody who was moving yesterday but isn't moving today how can we at brown and more broadly the rest of the field whether it's in our brain collaboration consortium uh or elsewhere how can we develop the technologies that can tomorrow not next week but tomorrow restore communication restore mobility and restore independence and the need for it is clear the path for it as david was just alluding to can be challenging on lots of different axes but as we reach for the most exciting future technology there's also a really key imperative to get the stuff done now that's going to restore function on the near term really meaning next week or next month and not even next year or the next few years and and i think that's a it's a tension that we all feel as we as we think about the next step in our research as we think about the next grant if you will and if you think about the direction of uh of where either our consortium our lab or uh or the field should go kind of leads me to think a bit about you know where and i'll probably kick this to david and then david you can kick it back to lee but you know falling on from from lee's comment about motivation and the need um here's the impossible question for you david it's like what is the big um some of the big challenges that that you're really facing right now is that like do you need you know do you need some transformative new technology that or do you need people with particular skills or you need everything like where would you place the huge hurdles that are kind of looming in front of you right now for your research and um i know that you know you're doing so many different things and doing neural stimulation as well as recording and so that and really touching on a very large um scope of of areas of incredible need right now in that in society so but what are those big hurdles david so hurdles there are many in sort of every subspace we think we work in and so it's difficult to say here's one hurdle for everyone or here's five hurdles that everyone you know is gonna have i think um you know i'll take a couple of examples so in the same one part of my laboratory we're looking to develop responsive uh adaptive neuromodulation strategies this means to sense something from one part of the brain and then stimulate to another part of the brain to to make a change in the therapeutic efficacy this is a part of a dbs and adaptive dbs program deep brain stimulation is used for therapies parkinson's disease and we're exploring it in ocd obsessive compulsive disorder but you know in a way hurdles to making a difference in the ocd community are even separate from research related right so i think we need to put in a sense that it's there's a stigma around mental illness it's getting much better these days but still it's still there and everyone it's a huge hurdle just get people to go in and be okay with talking to their doctors about how they're feeling and what they might need and you think about where hurdles are in your domains of what you work in like it's they're all over the place so i think we in in research hurdles in my specific narrow slice of the world that i'm working to try to help a narrow slice of of patient population um in in the couple fields i work in i think the technologies are actually pretty okay these days i mean i think we have a lot of wonderful tools that we're using in uh brain recordings like lia's describe the utah array and braingate technologies that we can use to record from motor cortex that's doing wonderful work in understanding how motor cortex works how pre-motor cortex works and how we can use that to deliver stable uh control over time in the neuropsychiatric domains we have tools from uh commercial companies companies that allow us to record from areas of the brain while we are stimulating other areas of the brain and we're now learning a lot we need we're sort of digesting all this information and learning about what all means um and in in the space of spinal cord injury where i also work we are sort of uh also leveraging tools that are available today and doing very early studies to help us learn more about what the nervous system can tell us and how this read right relationship between the nervous system and the particular spinal cord may help drive new therapeutic avenues for spinal cord injury um so i think you know today in my narrow slice of my laboratory i think our hurdles are really time we're all doing great work and we're learning a lot every day and we're trying to to figure out what this all means and i i think right now it's just a matter of time in our narrow slice i think as a field if you want to step back and think what is stopping us from you know being all neural link uh neural links in our heads or links in our heads and connecting to the ar or vr verse um you know i think at that point the hurdles might be just maybe individual comfort levels at that point are you okay getting a device like that put in your head but maybe i'll pass this to lee and maybe we'll have some back and forth after uh let me uh let me jump in because the next question on the queue was how elon musk's brain computer interface uh work overlaps with ours at brown or your efforts at brown um you know what where is the overlap where is the difference um you know if you if you're in the twitter verse there's only ten thousand opinions about the recent uh uh efforts that they've been making but yeah how does that and this was the next question that you you raise it so how does that fit in how does that work phenomenal where what ed brown is going on first important disclosure which is that uh mass general has a clinical research support agreement with uh uh with neural link as well as with paradromics and synchron so i'm going to respect what i should uh respect from a confidentiality and disclosure agreement and that that's probably not of any particular value for me to speak of uh what any individual company is doing but i'm happy to uh make two points one is uh that's a real privilege for me and i think it's important for all of us and academia to uh to do whatever we can to help share the knowledge that we're gaining whether it's through our academically driven clinical trials or what we're learning at the bench either in the wet neuroscience lab or in the in the neural engineering bench to uh to help industry however we can uh to develop what they're developing and there's a really simple reason to have that interest which is that academia medical centers do not make finalize market and support medical devices we just don't it's that is the role at the end of the day of a company of a medical device company and if the goal of any of our particular research which it doesn't have to be but in my case it certainly is i know uh it is uh for david as well if part of our drive is to develop a technology that's gonna reduce the burden of neurologic disease that technology needs to get out there it needs to be available and it's ultimately available through a company and so anything that we can do from the insights we've gained either yesterday in the lab or over years in a clinical trial to help those companies to succeed in their mission i think is uh is an opportunity that as many of us as possible should take uh whether graduate student in the lab postdoc faculty however we can those uh those efforts those industry if you will based efforts bring focus and resources that are critical to getting a technology not from point a to point b from but from point a to regulatory approval uh a reimbursement method that will make it available to the people who would benefit from these devices and a support system to continue to create them and and distribute them and uh all of those business-like sounding phrases are not in my usual vocabulary it's it's those are not in general the kinds of things that i think about um but i'll tell you when i'm in the neuro icu i think about him again uh because i am desperate to bring our brain gate related research or any other brain computer interface research that can help people with paralysis or as david describe and help people with uh with any number of mental health disorders who may be helped by a closed loop neuromodulation device another type of brain computer interface in order to put all of those pieces together uh basically always uh requires a company if i can just add a little bit to a question that i think uh diane was asking about the hurdles and that's coming up in the collaborations and it's kind of been balanced between academia and the translation to industry and it's it's i think historically and always is a challenging process to know when do you take something from academia and then throw it off over the fence to to a commercial company or whatever and then even if you want to be an academic go start a company and go try to go through this process of taking your technology up to say up and the y should be up over to to through clinical translation and to the fda um i just want i think that that is a big hurdle and i think there are ways we can leverage the non knowledge that we've all gained through our collaborations across institutions industry and domains um but that's really it's a wide range of expertise and to make that all distilled and available in a open way is a really challenging topic um i i think so the braingate consortium has done an amazing job at doing this for the brain gate technology and they continue to flow new algorithms and hopefully do tool sets in the future through that pipeline there are other companies out there that do it for their own company purposes of whether it's medtronic or boston scientific or whatever but for a new device developer it's actually really challenging and i think we uh we can as a field do better at making some of these some of that knowledge that's been developed making it available in some consolidated way uh you know how do you make an id uh investigational device exemption application to the fda what are the what's risk analysis what does that all mean what's the qms system all these things that are that sound really boring and company-like but they don't have to be done by a company and uh they're really important for all of us to think about even the device not device development stage but sort of early translational stage um and i think we can you know by sharing that as a consortium in the field we do better lowering the barrier of entry for everyone yeah we can certainly say that about a number of different fields but um i mean you know paralysis i mean you know there are many devastating things this is devastating and uh you know as lee described it a lot 10 syndrome of course you have patients who have als and these aren't super super common disorders but they're common enough that i mean just just giving someone the ability to do some level of communication when they can't is is just enormous for for all those individuals so huge admiration for what you're doing um david there's both of you actually there's a there's a question there's a bunch of questions coming in so i think what chris and i will do is just tag team and then jump in here because they're great uh love the participation so there's a question maybe david you started to talk about um you know the the use of of neurotechnology in your engineering and in other areas um and touched on some of the psychiatric disorders and i i guess i'm perhaps going to ask this question just with a little preamble again some of these vivid things that you remember seeing as then you're a scientist you're thinking like how can we not make this really reproducible and reliable like deep brain stimulation to change someone's mood from depressive morbid you know depression to you know an enlightened mood just in the flick of a switch but of course we know that's not reliable enough and um and so is this an area that that you think about a lot david that there are these few examples of neural stimulation being incredibly effective but how do we bring that to the point of of being reliable reproducible and applicable for for much wider group of individuals psychiatric disorders yeah i i um and this goes you know why i how did i get into the field of psychiatry neuropsychiatry to a degree i mean i think it's i'm a tool maker by trade and i'm a curious scientist and when i saw the opportunity of well there are tools out there the brain stimulation is being used to debris for psychiatric illness um and wow it has such an amazing impact on people with mood disorders and to see those you know videos of a psychiatrist uh uh you know doing these quote unquote programming sessions when they're tuning the system when it's first implanted uh i work very closely with wayne goodman at uh baylor college of medicine but many others do this work uh to see the session of you know with a person there who is you know had a difficult time leaving their room for the last uh for six months at a time you know they really are stuck in a state and then literally at the flip of a switch um the stimulation is turned on and the person smiles they're laughing they're very happy about their situation it's both it's fascinating on many levels right it's fascinating from wow this is the good we can do um but then you i think the next wave of thought that comes is wow it's fascinating because we don't know very much about how this is all working and there's so much underlying this smile on that person's face created by this burst of stimulation and a particular node of the brain and it's that curiosity which has driven me to explore this space and to use tools that are out there right now that we can explore with with human participants meaning uh devices that we can from medtronic where we can record from an area of the brain and stimulate another area of the brain and essentially have the scientific payload on the device where we can be doing science while delivering the therapy to that person over over a long period of time that's really been a wonderful i think development from the tools perspective and now we can explore the science now in the same time i think we should be continuing to develop new tools to explore the science or underlying neuroscience even more but i think this fascination that with the the tools can do so much good in so many different domains you know yes we think of brain machine interface that might be kind of the canonical response of neuromodulation it's not neuromodulation but the responsive closed-loop system where you record from the brain then you you move a cursor on a screen and to control a typing interface why can't that sort of paradigm also be used to help us modulate or titrate therapy to uh mental disorders or in a sense in my postdoc time where i study quite extensively the the uh control of spinal cord stimulation from brain activity so if a person is wanting to walk why can't that want or desire to walk drive stimulation of their lower limbs below the site of the injury to help them walk again i think that connects together most of the work that i do in my lab is this these we have the tools let's apply them across spaces to help to see how we can uh improve human lives i guess as it goes to my mission statement of my laboratory yeah i'll just underscore uh what david just said the one of the the opportunities that we have in the course of doing uh this research with the assistance of people who volunteer for clinical trials and help us to develop uh intra-cortical brain computer interface to help other people with paralysis is that we have the chance to record neuronal ensembles for hours days weeks years at a time and to really study fundamental human neuroscience and it's the only opportunity to get at those data and those data are going to be the ones that provide in some to some degree and growing over time a normative set what what are the neurostatistics what is the comp the basic expected computational neuroscience of human thought and emotion and volitional movement mood these are uh these are opportunities which we can barely scratch at the surface yet at the moment but we're beginning to we're going to collect those data and that is what will serve as the first step for exactly what dave is just describing is the closed loop neuromodulation that's informed by not just initially which is still initially uh you know at outside important the the increase in firing rate of a few neurons in one particular place in the brain but looking at a distributed network of activity the same distributed network of activity that actually generates that thought and that memory and that emotion mood how can we understand that how can we understand it or begin to understand it in real time so that it can become the signal we can detect the neurophysiologic signature of a change from a status of health and happiness to one of perhaps depression or mania for one example or relatively comfort relative comfort to one of uh an obsession or upcoming compulsion if we can capture that information understand it again in real time either strictly by your uh a standard neuroscientific approach or by any of the machine learning approaches that are being just beautifully deployed at the same challenge then we've got the afferent limb of a closed loop system that can intervene and hopefully return uh that person to their uh to the their center if you will to that to the health uh and the uh the ability to function the way that they hope so uh it's uh the work that david's doing is just uh incredible and i'm excited about what the future holds for one of the challenges that everyone's familiar with is that the dsm itself in terms of what are the phenomena or what are the even the maladies are some of the definitional problems there are one of the hurdles here so let me we're getting close to our time and so i want to make sure this question gets in from what i presume is a a student at the point you were at when you began your you know you're uh giving us some background about what got you in so what are the basics one would need to get started with research and brain computer interfacing so maybe looking back or giving advice to i don't know an undergrad or like what what should they be working on if they want to get going in this is there a you know that obviously they might emulate either of your paths which are somewhat different some are similar are there other things they should be thinking about the most important advice is one that uh i know many of us uh on the call have given over time which is uh which is find your passion and follow it and it's uh and the principal reason for that is uh is not a broad philosophical unnecessarily it's a really pragmatic one which is that this is hard science is challenging engineering is challenging and it is that passion and that commitment that is going to sustain any of us through the uh yeah unremitting very predictable except for the unpredictable parts up and downs of of uh doing good research and really crafting hypothesis and testing it appropriately and analyzing it objectively and having any number of things completely out of your control happen and then trying it again or trying to do it better or learning something that you didn't expect to learn at the right moment so the uh there's a list of courses one could take there's a list of skills that one could gain in systems neuroscience and uh you know how to record from single units head record from multiple units how to program and language of your choice whether it be in matlab or python or sql plus or anything else you know how to really you know understand neuroimaging kind of understanding the physics behind creating a bold signal uh understanding electrical engineering well enough to be able to develop the chip that one needs to really achieve uh you know one's goals in the future the um uh that the the right answer is gonna be one that's uh uh i think passion driven uh there's i think david and i are both probably biased in terms of computational neuroscience and neuroengineering uh skills so of course we'll we'll jump to advocate for those but the i think the opportunity to learn in a multi-disciplinary environment as as much as possible is is one that will uh support you well as you can go forward in your career i will echo these thoughts i think we put it very well passion is the best guide can we just go like super speculative and jump 20 years forward what um applications do you think will be um you'll be using in the clinically 20 years training other people to use 20 years time so i hope it doesn't take 20 years this isn't speculative that's very insane jumping right way into the future yeah you're so uh i know what you want me to do no no but no it's a question that came in from the audience all right well so thank you for that question it's a good question it's an important question it's what should drive a lab and a uh you know a field of science um i i want to be able to tell somebody that was diagnosed with als that they will never lose the ability to communicate that is what drives me i want to be able to tell somebody who's just lost the ability to move that they'll be able to move again tomorrow seamlessly intuitively easily 24 7 just as they did before uh the onset of their injury um so as i think about where will we be in 20 years i really hope that none of that takes 20 years i think some of it can happen a lot sooner some of it will take longer but trying to map out the steps to getting there is uh is part of what keeps me up at night and uh and hopefully is uh for uh many of us on the call who are i know uh equally committed to uh to the branch of science that you're thinking about every day is uh you know how do we how do we get to what we hope will be the case in 20 years and how do we get there uh and sooner than 20 years i knew that you would achieve that answer actually you did well i mean i you know i i'm not in the clinic i know you are and i know the patients that you see and many of my colleagues and uh yeah it's hard it's so i was hard a talk um having a conversation with the founder of um never a little while ago who brought a new spinal cord stimulation technology to market fast um in the span of 10 years so going from what was their scientific finding in 2006 i think it was into their commercialization to disrupt the spinal cord stimulation space for neuropathic pain uh uh it was a ten-year development process and they felt like that was pretty successful uh so 20 years it's just i i love to think that 20 years is a long time from now but i think some 20 years is tomorrow and the you know technologies will be changing rapidly of course and then the labs even faster but you know uh transformational technologies that we can get out and distribute in a way that gets to enough people that we really feel like we're making a big difference takes time um and a concerted effort by everyone that we you know we mentioned lee mentioned early on and sort of you know consortium multiple parties many many parties involved all the way up to uh reimbursement mechanisms that you know insurance companies you know so they um i want to be in a place you know lee is very therapy driven i'm sort of a little more back on the you know science the technology driven and and where it can be applied to particular therapeutic applications um and i want to be at a place in 20 years where we are no longer thinking about the brain in terms of motor cortex might i poke there and that's that's that's doing my motor control and i poke over here and that's doing my emotion control or you know or my readings it's it's a brain it's a huge dynamic system and we need to really treat it that way from the bottom up and the top down and that i think is where i hope we are in 20 years as a field there will be lots of different technologies developed to help us get us there uh and a lot of hopefully therapeutic applications that will come out of that way of thinking in that time frame um it's gonna take a lot to get there chris i thought you were gonna jump in and say and it isn't just neurons oh totally not just neurons i totally agree it's so much better if you say it and i don't have to but it isn't just i don't need technology to read your mind no no reflected in these classes to know someone very wrong but it's true great questions from everybody who attended thank you um i know that you have many more in your head and you didn't get them down but um i just felt that was just so stimulating i'm going to give a very few super quick wrap-up remarks and talk about our next connie conversations but to just remind everybody this will be up on our website so you can listen again and keep listening um it feels like this is one of those things that you're just going to keep listening to over and over and over because every time you hear it you're going to get something new out of it but i think um as you were all talking i wrote down passion as something i i wanted to highlight that i felt and i heard from both of you and um you said it in your post ditto or directly like your closing remarks i mean it is this is hard this is these are hard slog research working into multiple interfaces not just like in one interface with one discipline or another but like you're crossing multiple areas and have to be a master of many many many different pieces in order to be able to pull this together to think about building better faster [Music] intelligent technologies um you know to support quality of life um for individuals who just don't have it and so i think we are hugely grateful you're doing this um it feels like you both said there are great ideas out there but something something has to change in terms of of grabbing great ideas don't let them die and find ways to to get more dissemination and sharing and uh implementation i heard that from both of you and i think that you know that should be a message that that we really echo um after this conversation and we need um the next generation of scientists coming in during neurotechnology and doing the brave thing that you both did which is not to pick one area but to pick 10 and integrate them all you know for for society so just that was hugely inspiring and thank you i'm just going to do a very quick um reminder then that the next connie conversation is going to be on november 24th from 3 to 4 p.m and that's going to be with uh steve salway who's the martin zucker professor of psychiatric human behavior and ashley webb who's the richard and edna solomon assistant professor of molecular biology cell biology and biochemistry and they're going to be talking about another area of of great need in the area of alzheimer's and alzheimer's research um and so we'll be chris and i will be with uh ashley and with steve in conversation on november 24th at three so thank you both again that was fantastic thanks a lot guys
