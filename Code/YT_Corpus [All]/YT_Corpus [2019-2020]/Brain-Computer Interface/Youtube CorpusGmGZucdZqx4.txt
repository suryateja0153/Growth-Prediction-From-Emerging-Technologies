 you [Music] okay hello everyone thank you for thank you for coming to this talk you know series of BCI related talks here at MSR it's my great pleasure to introduce dr. Brandon Allison from UC San Diego he's been working on BCI's for two decades and he's gonna talk about mainstream BCI's today so without further ado Brandon yes okay well thank you for the intro and for coming and thanks for inviting me yeah my name is Brendon Allison I'm a visiting scholar with the cognitive science department at UC San Diego and also on a volunteer basis I'm an officer with the brain computer interface Society which I'll talk about a bit later however for the first part of my disclaimer this talk just represents my perspective I'm not representing any other person or entity and I'm not being paid by any one MSR as kindly reimbursing my travel costs and meals but no one's paying me in fact the only entities that have paid me are these two so I'm a visiting scholar with UCSD I'm loyal to them but I don't receive any salary from them so one thing I'd like to do to start and this is a risky way to start because it involves audience participation but we'll see is just to sort of establish a baseline and especially since this is being recorded I thought it would be fun to just run a few questions by the audience and see how you react and what people think about BC is today and so it's audience participation time and the first one is I just like to ask you to raise your hand if the answer is yes the first question is can you name some BCI's alright so for those of you at home most people are responding yes and then do you agree with this statement modern BC is can be useful for patients with ALS or other serious neurological conditions please raise your hand so yeah most people are raising their hand and then raise your hand if you agree with this modern BCI's can be useful to healthy people in everyday life yeah so nobody now we have zero and then the last one can you raise your hand if you used a BCI in the last month alright so we got three I think sorta three all right so this is Speaker out on a limb I obviously have not had time to edit this slide I do not have such a fast BCI so my guess is the audience would say yes I can name some BCI's yes modern BCI's could be useful for some patients but I was also guessing most people would say no I don't think modern BCI's are useful to most mainstream people in everyday life and I thought most people would say no I haven't used a BCI in the last month to provide a little additional detail I've asked the same or similar questions at recent brain computer interface conferences and at a talk at Google and other places where you might think these would be early adopters of BCI's if there were people who really knew about computing interfaces working with software these would be the ones and yet even here at Microsoft like these other entities this is a nice baseline right now as of February 2020 even people who are knowledgeable who are sort of insiders in the field or at least would be well connected to them aren't using BCI's and and don't see them as being useful except for patients and this has been the case for quite a while most people have believed this and I generally agree with it so that's another thing to help set the tone for this talk my my goal in this talk is not at all to promote mainstream BCI's as something imminent in fact I'll publicly say now I don't think they're imminent I don't think these answers are likely to change for most people in the near future but when will they change right so let's say I were to give this talk here in 2030 what do you think people would respond 2040 I I hope I'm still speaking by then and so on when you know and I would guess if I said something way out there if I said in the year 3000 you think modern DC is as of that time might be useful yeah I think most people here especially given its Microsoft recognize that keyboards and mice and other interfaces are more temporary and transitory than they seem right now we're used to them that's the main way to interact with systems but may not be that way forever an old friend of mine worked for Microsoft and he would say he'd be giving a talk and some people in the audience would be critical and make trouble for him and so he would say look I understand that the reason you're doing this is not because of anything related to my talk but just because I'm with Microsoft and you want to complain and so that's part of the job that's fine and so similarly I'm not at all the avatar of BC is for everyone I'm very interested in it and I always have been but just as with my talk before I very much aware there are practical issues and one of the main ones is of course why not use something else some other way to communicate and that's on a later slide so this raises the question of why why would I use a BCI unless I basically have no other choice and this is the classical view so for a few slides I'm going to review what seems to be the classical established view that I get not only from papers but talking with people in conferences and this is the classical view which was consistent with the little survey I did that is most people here say yes BCI is for users with disabilities intentionally these are all older images this is from 1999 this is around 2000 from Graz this is at least 10 years old but these are examples of publications that are well-established showing patients with disabilities and for ethical reasons I should say of course these people have had their allowed their pictures to be shown and therefore the classical view is that widespread BCI adoption requires replacing conventional interfaces for conventional users and conventional settings that is a lot of people might look at that slide and say okay there's a certain setting where BCI's are useful it's a patient that you've got no other choice but to make BCI's useful for other people you would need something where people are doing a common mainstream thing like for example playing a computer game and the BCI has to replace other interfaces and I think that's a mistake in other words part of what I'm getting at in my talk is that although I still don't think mainstream VC is or imminent I see very consistent mistakes being made in papers in talks and talking with conferences and in other people business people or students or whoever who are trying to think of a mainstream DCI and they're like well you've got to come up with this or it's never going to happen instead the emerging view is first you can replace or supplement a conventional interface this is a critical point in fact I'll go further the first mainstream BCI will be something used in combination with another interface or another task so the idea that you would have a BCI so a key point of this is notice this person has hands on the table even though there's another way to communicate and and this is not how it's going to happen you're not going to see someone saying wow I need no other way to do anything the BCI is everything it will be a BCI combined with other interfaces or ways to interact this is what's called a hybrid BCI and also for specific settings and so here again you have an example of a user at home free to use keyboards no problem and what if there are certain settings or certain environments in which the cost of using a keyboard or another interface is is higher than it normally is and this is also something that's come up before and was in my 2006 talk where people have looked at cases such as drivers where the driver's hands are busy you you can't really use a keyboard or mouse or texting on your cell phone or something quite as easily mechanics or airline mechanics came up your head is inside you can't speak it's too loud various military applications have come up that I haven't worked on soldiers you want to be silent and you don't want to move how do you send information and again I'm not saying this is imminent to my knowledge soldiers aren't using this either and another issue with with disability is this term that I've learned from the HCI literature of situational disability that is in certain situations a healthy person may be somewhat like a disabled user again if you're driving or for some reason your hands are busy in a sense you're like a person who doesn't have hands available and assistive technology designed for someone who doesn't have the ability to use hands might seem more practical for you in that specific setting and an example I like to give with with this is laziness and so once I I gave a talk at Philips headquarters in Eindhoven we were working with them on a grant and they you know they of course very well known as as electronics manufacturers and so I asked do you make any televisions anymore without remote controls and they said no of course not you know why would we the remote control is a great example of sort of disability by laziness and I'm used them too but you're watching TV you could get up you could get up and change the channel you could push a button you could turn that old dial there are lots of ways that you could do it that you do not have a medical need for that remote control yet I'm not gonna ask but if I were to say show of hands and say yeah most people have used them have any of you actually gone up to your TV and played with it probably not but again I won't I want to ask that publicly and if you think about that that's actually a tremendous imposition on your TV viewing experience so you're watching TV you wish to change the channel you have to disengage a little bit from the TV you have to dig around in the couch to find the remote control you have to look at it you have to orient it the right way you have to push a button all of this is disrupting what you're doing otherwise is there an easier way to do that right now with the BCI no but this is just an example of an environment in which people would not normally think of a TV viewer of someone who is disabled or might need an assistive technology but that remote control example is is getting in that direction again not quite the same and another conventional view that I want to get at is that widespread BCI adoption requires dramatically new capabilities in other words we need a BCI that can do something way beyond what any existing system can do because right now they can't really do anything useful and this is necessary to get around the problem that wired and ugly systems are unappealing in other words nobody's going to use a system with a cap and gel and all that well of course that's all changing so in particular practical electrodes by which I mean either dry electrodes or various electrodes that rely on water instead of gel or this company advanced brain monitoring they have a an electrode that releases gel as needed over time all of these things make BCI is much more practical especially for people who don't want to put gel in their hair which is basically everyone except me and I think there's tremendous fun so you have these dry ones and then wireless this is a big deal of course if you've got to get up get up and walk around and their cables that's not going to work and so concordantly you have a change in cosmesis that is cosmetic appeal and I'm arguing this is of course a factor for mainstream BCI adoption that many people either don't think about or like I said they think its secondary to capability in other words first you got to make the ultimate BCI and then nobody cares about this and that's just not not correct so these are a few examples of different efforts to make be CIS that would be more cosmetically appealing to users and in the next few slides I'm not just getting at objective cosmesis because there's no such thing it's a judgement call if the DCI looks appealing to you but also perceived cosmesis what do people think about it so here one way you can do this is you can hire a model it sounds trivial but if you look a lot of pictures of BCI's they have some grad student in engineering who's Shaggy and doesn't have any makeup on another interesting case is over here this was a specially made device called the unicorn and this woman is a fashion designer and she was trying to get at the problem of persons with high-functioning autism so many children with autism are not comfortable with the EEG caps you put on a cap that looks like this and they don't like the feeling of it pressing all around their head and so she designed this for children with autism it's called the unicorn and you can see it most of the head is exposed it's not like you're covered up right there and it has this little unicorn thing on it which is not functional but apparently this was much more popular with such people if you want to do research with this population you need a hat that they will will wear regarding the perception of whether something is cosmetically cool these are all examples in the last few years or so this is a bit older of movies or other things in which you have electrode caps that aren't presented as sort of weird future things but sort of mainstream so there's a talk show host Colbert and there's President Obama talking to a guy wearing electrode cap this is from x-men you guys recognize this famous author science fiction hero this is Andy weir who wrote the Martian and when we when he was nominated for an Oscar we made him these little 3d printed Oscar statuettes and put a but he nicely got that picture the point is that this cap looks the same as other caps this cap here that he was wearing it appears to be the same type of cap that I remember using in the 90s but the fact that you put it on someone who's popular and is and whatnot effects perceived cosmesis yeah right yeah he he knows Lord of the Rings better than all nerds speaking of nerds and I say this in a nice way one of my friends in the field is grooveshark and another issue in the common view that i mean to challenge is that speed is the critical factor for broader adoption so you get this a lot and various papers like this one and the idea is well DC eyes are very slow they have to get faster and I just sort of adopted this part here in other words this this text is mine and not from the image where I was looking at this in terms of the hype cycle in other words right now you know BC is might be sort of severely disabled and you might see them with people with less severe disabilities for example there are cases now where people who are able to use another interface choose a BCI for example there are cases of patients choosing a BCI over an eye tracker because the eye tracker is fatiguing if you have very limited muscle control than doing this looking around left and right it is exhausting and so I was saying then you get eager users and finally the mainstream healthy users this is just an adaptation of the classic hype cycle but in response to that 2008 paper I this framework here where I'm trying to get far beyond speed in terms of looking at what matters in terms of any user including a mainstream user in terms of BCI adoption and you see speed is really only a part of it that's only one thing one example that keeps coming up from people who work with patients is that patients will often not choose to maximize information throughput but instead to maximize accuracy right this is very well-established so you probably know that you there's you you can alter your systems so that accuracy goes down and speed goes up or vice-versa and you can work out the the way to maximize bitrate or infamy and transfer rate and yet many patients say even though it will slow the system down I'm very frustrated by errors and so that already starts to to challenge the importance of speed you know so accuracy is also there another big one is the size of your alphabet which is a tremendously ignored issue so if you can choose one out of ten items versus one out of hundreds that's a really big deal and I'm happy to talk about this indefinitely but one issue that I mentioned already that I want to get at I made up this term called distraction quotient and what I define that as is a representation of how much using the BCI distracts you from whatever else you're doing now it might be that your only goal is to use the BCI you you just want to use the BCI because you're playing a BCI base game or something you have no interest in anything else but generally using the BCI is quite distracting if you haven't used one a lot of them you have to count flashes you have to pay attention to something you have to imagine movement this makes it much harder for you to type or speak or do other things and there's a type of BCI that's called passive BCI in which at least theoretically if it works the distraction quotient is zero meaning it doesn't require anything for you to get information from the BCI you don't have to count flashes you can do whatever else you were doing and it might give you information such as alertness or do you think you made an error I'll get into examples of this and I think this is also still very much ignored people think about the BCI but not the BCI as part of an integrated interactive platform in which the goal of the user is to send information through whatever means are most effective at that point in that situation might be brain activity might be eye activity a keyboard or whatever like the one I mentioned the this was a paper by Robert Lieb in which he provided a B C I think it was 2006 but I'm not sure he provided a BCI and an eye tracker to pee people and many of the patients said we we prefer to use the BCI it's it's just easier and another interesting issue is that the types of BCI is haven't really changed much so in 2006 my talk was mainly focused on BCI's themselves the different types of BCI is rather than mainstream applications and I said these were the main types of BCI's looking at it today hasn't really changed so slow cortical potential BCI's are no longer that prevalent but otherwise the these are the same and this is another fundamental challenge that has yet to be overcome is there's something else you can do mentally is there's something else you can think something else you can pick up with the EEG or other methods that is useful and although this hasn't developed a lot I'm not at all saying there's no hope for it in the future as I was discussing improved machine learning is creating all kinds of options and concordantly you have an ongoing increase in EEG research what what can people do that might influence the EEG and how does it influence the eg you know talk more about this a bit later that's a link to my talk from before but it's mainly for people at home because I think you guys can find it at Microsoft and so I would also say yeah ease is a critical thing ease and utility that is what is the BCI doing for you this is also a big thing you okay great you find out that someone just made a mistake or is looking over there and thinking about something who cares and so these are a few examples of trying to integrate them with devices like cell phones or hats or whatever which so far have met with pretty limited success but I don't think that will be forever so inevitably when you're thinking about this question of BC is that this is one of the first things to ask and this happens all the time I'll talk to someone and the person will have a great idea for a BCI and I'd say that's great but why not use an eye tracker and they say you've destroyed my idea so one it could potentially be faster than an unavailable interface so is a BCI faster than a keyboard no but if you have no keyboard if it's not practical then it might be faster now for a BCI to be more practical you've got to have something on your head there are various environments where people already tend to have things on their heads we've talked about that unfortunately my experience is that people who do that don't want anything more on their head notably pilots so my grandfather was a pilot he he flew marine one on presidents Kennedy and Johnson so he was a senior officer and he basically said that pilots will not want something on their head reading their brainwaves no matter what and I said don't you have the authority to order other people lieutenant colonel and he's mmm I'm retired anyway if it's impractical can't easily be used or would take longer to provide the same information so we chatted about this over lunch with usability testing and another example as neuromarketing you could have someone view an advertisement or use an interface and then afterward you can say hey what did you think of that were there any things in the ad that got your attention when you are using that interface was there any period where you were a little confused and disoriented well you could get that information or at least some of it but you you now have an objective way you can have someone using something you can say without interfering in any way well when that person used this particular software or this particular environment we saw an increase in these sorts of problems such as feeling disengaged dozing off stuff like that and you're probably aware neuromarketing has got a lot of attention there's a company called neuro focus that was sold to Nielsen marketing and I don't know what's happened with them since then but that was their focus and I know that two of the people involved Bob Knight and Jon Polish or top electrophysiologist Jon Polish was my boss Yunos p300 literally I think better than anyone in the world and that's another example you want to know in real time what someone thinks you can stop them I have been in focus groups and they'll stop you in the middle of an ad and say what do you think of this and this and that and that's disrupting the whole process it's wasting time you have the 600-pound gorilla problem there's one guy in the room who says oh that's wonderful and nobody else wants to talk none of these problems exist at least theoretically if you're getting information passively some way through BCI eye tracking or other means another big answer to why not use something else is that at least in some cases it might be easier to use than other interfaces and again I'm not saying this is the case right now but this is what things are developing toward it might be more practical in a real world setting TV remote control another one is that could potentially be more intuitive and this is something that really is changing in the field and is a dramatic development is the prospect of of auditory reconstruction which has been getting a lot of attention primarily with invasive BCI but the idea that from electrodes you can determine what someone is thinking about saying what words someone is thinking or even which sounds or music someone is thinking about if that develops especially if it develops non-invasively then you have something BCI's have never been able to do before which is a direct literal BCI instead of spelling by accounting this flash or thinking about this and then thinking about this you just think of the word this keyboard which everyone is used to is also a highly unnatural unintuitive interface it's just that we're used to it if I want to convey Apple what is me pushing these buttons have to do in anyway with Apple Nisour at any anything related to fruit I it's it's an arbitrary mapping that happens to be the best way to send information to a computer that we have that most people think but it's certainly not the best ultimate interface and privacy I talked about this a little bit that you might be able to determine if someone wants to pay attention to a certain region or whatever that's private in other words most other ways of sending information someone can watch you they can listen to you talk they can record it this way at least in theory the process of you sending information nobody knows exactly what you're sending and one example of why this might be useful as some security settings and then on the other scale of sort of fun as is gaming you're playing a game you don't want the other person to know what you're doing again I think this is somewhat further in the future but it's it's there and this one is not in the future so this this has been the answer most of the time so just as I've said well you talk about BC is and you can always get people to say oh well they're useful for patience you can also always get this out of people you say well what if people want to use BCI despite everything else yes it's inefficient I don't like it I don't want this stuff on my head I just want to use it for fun you nobody has any answer to that except well there aren't that many people who do so but that's out there I mean there is something cool about putting a thing on your head and communicating even though I'm obviously kind of biased so now we'll talk about some applications for the public and intentionally a lot of these slides differ in time that is some of these are things that have been pursued for decades like alertness monitoring and then others are relatively new so this is one that's been around for a while from Paul Tschida and his colleagues of image triaging and what they could do is if they presented images to people very quickly they could tell from the EEG which images stood out for example you can show them pictures of trucks and one of them is longer you would have a slightly different reaction to the longer truck and so although I don't know image triaging the idea was to reduce the time so instead of someone looking at images all day and you say oh that one's important and that one's important if you can present something ten times a second which is of course much faster than you can type that would be one example not so much of a mainstream user but at least of a healthy user where this is useful as far as other possible applications for mainstream users I don't know yeah by the way if you're coming expecting me to tell you the killer app for DCIS I mean you should have known better so yes I'm not presenting the killer app I'm just talking about the process when someone does come up with the killer app for DCIS I'm gonna be really really mad that I didn't think of it but here we are and I thought again I don't know immediately but studying so you have a list of a hundred words that you want to remember if you had an EEG system on that's locked to each of these you could probably determine from the p300 and other things which images you are likely to later remember this is research from Manny Don Chan dating back a long time you need to remember 100 words right now you read the words you test yourself you go back and iteratively now you get rid of the testing yourself words just keep coming up you never have to test yourself as words come up you start noticing boy some of those initial words are gone what's happening that you don't know about is it's doing something similar to this that is words that you are likely to later remember you just don't see again again this assumes the system is accurate in a few words that you're not likely to remember it just presents them again or or other information and another very well much better established extension of BCI is neurofeedback which has also been around a long time and done properly neurofeedback can be helpful for some people but part of the problem is that this has become heavily saturated so many people and so many companies for decades now have been talking about it this is these are just a few examples I haven't used any of these so I don't mean to say that they're good or bad these are just examples and if you're a an end user how do you know you're you're not an AG expert you see some ads and there are a lot of examples of sort of unethical neurofeedback I have a little that later this is one that most people don't know about but it turns out the p300 and other signals can be used for detecting lies or when I say a lie it's in quotes what it's really detecting is whether you perceive an image as familiar or unfamiliar and so Larry Farwell and his team have a company called brainwave science where they've tried to use this for forensic purposes for determining whether people actually are guilty or innocent and a lot of people don't realize this was approved in a court and I of in Iowa over 10 years ago so there was a court and they had a trial that addressed the question of whether brain wave fingerprinting should be admissible in court the court ruled yes and so unless something has changed if you're get arrested in Iowa you can use brain wave fingerprinting as part of your defense I would recommend not getting arrested in any state that you know neuromarketing so I've mentioned this how to focus groups who react to sounds or images so first it's not literal it's not like party or brain lights up and says coca-cola and this is an example that I used so this is harley davidson cologne and i would not ask you to raise your hand if you're wearing harley davidson cologne because i'm pretty sure you're not and they don't make it anymore but I was talking about this with some ad person and this was apparently a famous example of a focus group failure Harley Davidson made Cologne and they got focus groups and they said here you know try it and it was a classic 600-pound gorilla problem you've got a few big guys in the room who are bikers and they say yeah Harley Davidson cologne and it turned out in fact many people in the focus group were not that positive about it but didn't want to say anything okay whatever and so in theory I don't pretty sure they didn't do neuromarketing this might be an example where you would have got a different result instead of people being afraid to share their opinions they just their opinions come out as they see Harley Davidson cologne not just EEG alone I mean maybe their mouth turns down or right eye activity but a that might have prevented Davidson from making Cologne which I assume was bad I don't know so yeah another confirmation technically face expression processing and getting emotions or anything else from the face is way more advanced it and that's one of the texts which is that niqab use it today instead of be shy which is still down the roles right yeah I would say neuromarketing it I would think it would be most effective using a headset that's sent picking up a lot more than a eg if I were involved the first thing I would say is hybrid BC III I would like to go ahead and put an electrode cap on them if you want but one of the first things I'm gonna look at is eye activity which you can get from the EEG facial muscle contraction so yeah I would be the I think this is a good example of a case where a EEG might be useful as a supplement to other things but I'm not saying you just put a cap on them and get nothing else but yeah you don't have any delays you don't have to wait there's no distraction you don't have to stop them you don't have follow-up question airs you don't have pleasing the experimenter so another example as someone made peach Christmas lights and nobody wanted to say you're such a nice guy but this is terrible you know not noticing forgetting the 600-pound gorilla wow that guy likes Harley perfumes so I'm not gonna argue would you argue with that gorilla and I talked a little at lunch over error detection so there's the signal called the arrow related negativity and this is an example of a study from awhile ago 20 years ago and with four persons it was showing that three of the people had some overall improvement in their information transfer rate with a BCI using this and so I'd be quite interested in studies where they're looking at error detection while someone is not using a BCI but using other things I'll get to this soon with an example from Scott mikeg and so Jung and colleagues and you know the main problem with this is it's difficult to get on a single trial basis and so I've thought a lot and I've talked with the guy here named Disney tan and the professor named Anton my holt and others about if you're not so concerned with the real-time constraint then this is much more viable and so I mentioned the example of usability assessment not just for software but other types of settings and then this is something I actually talked with Eric Orbitz who's still here on my way to let my last talk with this example of using Microsoft Word so you're using Microsoft Word which why I'm at Microsoft and you're typing and the computer recognizes that you've typed a word that the computer doesn't recognize what happens that word becomes underlined in red and now the user has to stop typing and do one of two things either just engage from typing and probably use the mouse to right-click on that and correct the error in other words you're telling the system that you believe an error was made you're telling the system you're right I did make a mistake option two is the opposite the system is wrong you didn't make a mistake you want it to not underline that or add it to dictionary automatically or in some other way not distract you from typing I'm in the middle of an important sentence so I got something to say and so this is something I was talking about with him is it's not just detection or error but also the absence of error in other words if you can tell someone thought no error was made that might be useful and I'm also saying this is a largely underappreciated direction again if not not just using it as an error correction system for BCI's but for other types of interactions and this is what I was just talking about with Scott McCaig and C Peng Jong and colleagues and this was a study based on only two EEG channels in the late 90s a little over 20 years ago and red shows targets that were missed by professional sonar operators so these were people who were naval personnel who had a position of sonar operators so they they worked on submarines they had experience and these this red thing here is showing sort of lapses in in their attention that the system predicted and then green is the their their hit rate and so you see here with red and blue what this is showing is that blue is the actual error rate and red as the predicted error rate so there are two parts of this one of them is was not so new which is if people are in a state where they're more likely to make errors we can pick that up from the EEG with only two two channels which is pretty good but the second part which I thought was much more interesting is they could predict these alertness lapses by a few seconds with the EEG that is they could there was a certain time period when there was no other way to know that the person was more likely to make errors except the EEG or at least no way that we know of if you could have found something then that could be real useful you call in a replacement supervisor or you play the voice of the crew chief yelling at the guy or whatever they do on a sonar actually ask the sonar people they say yeah the chief will you let you and in the case of alertness monitoring here it's even more than a car I mean a submarine hits a mine that's very bad yes Rosie one of them was Ozzie and one of them was fcz so they're both midline channels and these two people so Scott mikeg is still at UCSD along with his colleague si ping Jung and you know so this this is going beyond real-time alertness monitoring this is almost proactive alertness monitoring usually you said that I mean it looks to me like the blue is leading the red so the blue the actual error rate the red seems to be lagging a little bit so I mean but I thought what you just said is that no they predicted it ahead of time so I I'll check I might have reversed that but I remember the key point is that they were able to predict periods of increased error likelihood ahead of time all right so then the question is great you're aware that the user might be more likely to make mistakes or for some reason you're getting something from the eg well so what what do you do with it and this is an example from a group and NASA there's a guy named Alan Pope who retired a while ago but he had some work on adaptation based on EEG measures of task engagement so the idea was that if a pilot or astronaut or another person was overloaded in other words the EEG indicated this person was already getting too much information you would reduce the incoming information switch it to an automated system get a backup person whatever and also vice versa if the person was bored maybe this is a time to call in increased engagement and another example is this Ewing at all paper where he was getting it the same idea for game adaptation so if someone is playing a game just like doing a neurofeedback task or a lot of tasks there's a risk if the person could be getting really bored or could be getting overloaded just like the pilot example and this paper was getting at how you could modify the game difficulty level and the incoming information accordingly and this is also the sort of thing that I mentioned as neat an here along with Anthony Holt and colleagues have been interested in for a while that this this adaptive interface where ideally from the user's perspective without any extra work you don't have to say I'm overloaded or something you just wear this thing on your head from the users perspective the games always really engaging you're you're doing really well you're not perfect you have to work a little bit harder or else you get bored you're certainly not overloaded that could be very appealing not just for games for fun but training and other applications so he was presenting the idea this bio cybernetic loop where the EEG would effect the difficulty of a Tetris game but you get the general idea I have several slides that'll be quick on gaming and fun so there's not a lot of text these are just examples and these are all systems that may not necessarily be BCI so they claim that they're working on a eg I have some things to say about that but not right now and this is for example called the mind flex so this was a game and you're supposed to use the BCI to manipulate this ball of the game this is another one this is called the Star Wars Force trainer you can get it on Amazon for about 50 bucks right now and the Star Wars Force trainer what you do is you use the Force to move this ball up and down to control the height of a ball how it works as many people have seen the trick where you if you have a ball and a fan under it the ball appears to be suspended and so what you're actually doing is you're using the EEG to control the strength of that fan so with the EEG you can make the ball go up and down is that the same as using the force I don't know this this may be it so it was it was it was a long time ago in a galaxy far far away I mean who knows what they used and this is a company called it emotive you may have heard of them where they they have this game and notice also they're working this headset doesn't look like a classical cap they're trying to make it look cool and they got red red on there this was one that I worked on so a few people have done brain computer interface World of Warcraft's and this one was an example that used SS vep we also had a different one with motor activity but basically you can move around the environment with these four controls left right forward and select you can do a fair amount largely because of the good World of Warcraft interface a key reason is that this select icon Changez two different things depending on where you are we didn't do this this was Blizzard Entertainment but it it was a nice example we were thinking well how could you use only four commands to convey more than four potential instructions in a context dependent fashion and like well these guys I already did it and the movement commands I mean you can go anywhere in 2d space with just those three and so we've we gave this demonstration that UC San Diego and I told the story that I was unable to do it because UCSD blocked all the ports for World of Warcraft so we had a network guy and we were trying to everything was working from a BCI standpoint and yet we couldn't actually get online and so the network guy had about 45 minutes you know I said could you please talk to a supervisor or something and came back and said I couldn't like I did talk to his supervisor I did I was saying there's a professor giving a talk they just couldn't get to that point in other words they're so committed to that they had so many problems with students doing that I also gave this talk at Blizzard headquarters in Irvine California unsurprisingly we have no trouble getting onto there wow sir whoo it was really fast the funny story there is many of the people in the room were on the production team so they're constantly yelling at me you know go laughter shoot that or like I'm not demonstrating mastery of the game I'm just showing this BCI thing and I said I had some slides about fun this is a great one the necomimi cat ears I love this so this person is wearing these cat ears and what the cat ears are supposed to do you can just see that headband up at the top there is they perk up if the user is interested or engaged and they droop if the user is not interested and so I thought okay that's a great example of sort of a cute thing it's not really meant as a practical one but people might buy it for fun later on I thought this would be immensely useful for public speaking so what if every time you have someone here everyone in the audience has to wear one of these right and so if all the ears start drooping it's time to move on tell a joke if all the ears go up you're doing something right I've often wanted to do a study you guys could do it right here like a you you kindly bought me a coffee before this and I was wondering you could plot that so what is the average time per talk plotted against how much coffee did you get them just before then you know and so that would be another one if people are bored give them coffee this is sort of the opposite one where it's a competitive relaxing game this is called brain ball and by the way I'm not with these companies I'm just so this was a group in Sweden and they made a competitive relaxing game so the ball moves toward the more relaxed person and so whoever looks the most relaxed will win so this is kind of a funny image because you can't tell if they're relaxed or dead but I'm just bringing this up because all these slides are things that are for the most part fairly well-established people have done them in some case has made money from them and yet they're not mainstream I gave the example of the force trainer now if you have an electrode right there over the forehead is that a pure EEG system I don't need to answer this is a new one this is a novel example of BCI for fun this is not high on my list of likely mainstream applications but I would recommend doing it here in Microsoft because if you had a remote control cockroach please do and if you do put a little camera on them I want to be like I want to see Bill Gates reaction when their remote control cockroach goes in this is this is true so I edited a book chapter we we have a contest for the best BCI research for the annual BCI research award and this was one of the submissions and I was happy that it was nominated for a word because I got to edit the book chapter and in a way they kind of had a BCI system for the people and a computer to brain in her face a CBI I guess for the cockroaches so first they sell this kit and this is online you can go to backyard brains right now and buy it you can buy this kit and the first thing they do which is nice is they make you anesthetize the cockroach like okay that's you put it in ice cuz frankly after reading this I felt bad for the cockroach and then you can essentially put this on which will direct it to move in a certain direction the part that they also had as they then had humans using a brain-computer interface to send commands to to cockroaches running a race so you're sitting here and your buddy's right next to you and your job is to use a BCI to direct a cockroach you would probably prefer to do something else but direct a cockroach to move through that and so it's it's new I've never heard of that before and slide it's if anything it's closer to the work from Rao and colleagues here and others with the brain-to-brain interface but to be more specific the human is a brain to a computer interface and then the cockroach is a computer to brain interface it would be intriguing to have the reverse can cockroaches control people probably so I thought this was a good example of fun it's technically impressive and in the end in the acknowledgments when I was editing it I thank their subjects and I made him specifically say we want to thank our subjects , both human and cockroach because honestly after this there's a lot of poor cockroach they're ugly but yes just a little sidebar dvdt she's one of the guys who works sort of senior guy in with a bunch of hardware groups his here's a master's thing he had a basically this exact thing with moss he was controlling moths I didn't know but just just a little sidebar for you guys missed you yeah well in a precursor to this there was a paper that was published in Nature tower at all 2002 which was interesting so what they did is they had computer to brain interfaces I think it was for rats or mice it was it was a rodent they implanted electrodes in three areas one was the medial forebrain bundle which humans have also that's a big area that involves reward and an addiction and other things and then the left and right mr. barrel cortex so rats have an area of the cortex that responds to touch here or here humans have this also but in rats it's exaggerated it's called barrel cortex because they're really sensitive to these little whisker whisker barrels sticking out so they implanted these and they demonstrated that they could make mice move through a maze or an obstacle course basically you could if you you they train the rats so that if they stimulate the left side and then the rat chooses to move you give it a rewarding stimulus so pretty soon as soon as you do that the rat moves to the left if you do them both at the same time the rat moves forward the part of it that was particularly ominous toward the end is they did the following they had their rat move up a ramp and moved to the edge of a precipice unbeknownst to the rat there was a clear plastic panel under there but the rat didn't know that in other words the rat believed that going forward could be fatal they gave it the little zap and the rat didn't move forward they increase the current and the rat jumped off so the rat believed it was jumping to its death and I see no reason this wouldn't work in humans not that I promote that another issue that's come up is the idea of some kind of head mounted display application and when I say it's come up we gave a talk at Google we're talking about this and a lot of other people had said what about something involving an hm D which makes a lot of sense if you're already wearing glasses on your head or headphones where it's much easier to put on electrodes and people were working on earbud electrodes these guys nam were nominated for an award a few years ago and so you know with Google glass you might for example use it to select among different options so this is getting back to the question of why would you use this if there's another way to communicate at that time there was this term called glass hole which you know for people who are using Google glass but we're being visibly distracting they would do this or they would say okay Google all the time and so this is a case where yes they could communicate with the interface another way but they might choose to use the BCI for privacy and and courtesy you know or maybe you could choose different parts of an image to my knowledge this wasn't implemented but I know some students with Professor Cruz e on skis lab we're interested in it and a lot of other people have talked about it and that might happen or virtual navigation I guess I've had to Google slides and they didn't pay me anything driver alertness I've talked about that a lot where the the question here is why not use something else can you detect alertness with EEG yes is that better than eye tracking or other ones people have different answers to that but it's challenging to give it a solid yes right now but to be fair there are people who've said no you can get more depth and detail from the EEG than you can from an eye camera and then other people don't agree so I'm that's getting a bit beyond my hand thing and I'll talk about some emerging examples of big BCI mainstream BCI and this is also a pretty new thing in the field so prior to 2017 there weren't any big examples of this of a very large company or an individual like Elon Musk who not only presented an idea publicly to mainstream persons about BC eyes but also was talking about BC eyes for mainstream users you know it's Facebook was talking about a non-invasive system that could work with with anybody not just with patients and they presented a lot of applications and our problem with this and I talked to a lot of BCI people is we don't really have any information from Facebook and so it's very difficult for us to comment they gave a talk at the 2018 BCI meeting and similar to some videos and things they talked about optical imaging but we don't really know what they're doing and to be fair of their company there are for-profit entity they're not necessarily required to tell us I just really wish that they would or at least tell me yes well this is gnarly that's here so this is a new effort popularized by Elon Musk and there you see talk about neural link and they're a lace and this is a similar case where you have someone who's very well established very well known to mainstream people who's talking about this in the case of neural link there seem to be focused on invasive approaches so specifically they have this idea that something would be implanted just behind the ear or somewhere and so that's kind of a different direction but still these are quite futuristic ideas I mean they're not imminent and I'll talk about this over the next few slides the field does need a breakthrough we could benefit from the the scale of research that this is our people like me able to come up with the sorts of developments that companies could spending millions of dollars over the course of several years certainly not I'm familiar with a lot of the BCI labs their grants exactly how much money is involved and of course the scale matters another example is Galvani bio electrics which not as many been as public but they're a company that was started by I believe laakso SmithKline and verily so these are two big companies I believe it was a 780 million dollar start starting companies so it's quite big and they're talking about electronic bio medicine which seems to be kind of like the term adaptive neuro technology from Wolpaw and colleagues where they're talking about devices that both read and write not only to the brain but the nervous system for example the spinal cord to help persons with spinal cord injuries so although that's sort of broader than what most people think of as BCI is it's still related sports yes first my colleague Christophe cougar GU ger he has some publications involving sports and high athletic high altitude athletics so for example he studied people while they did a simulated ascent from 3,000 to 5,000 meters advanced brain monitoring I think the author was Chris burka BER ka they had some work also involving sports optimization and it was similar to work they did with the US Marine Corps they had a study where they were studying people as they learned how to fire rifles to try to help them be more accurate and similarly they were working on trying to help acquisition of sports knowledge and I know there are some other examples I just don't know them right now but yeah people have talked about it and this is another example of something where you might have more eager early adopters if I were to use a BCI to become better at tennis or something well nobody cares if you're an Olympic athlete even the tiniest improvement could could matter and could be worth a tremendous amount of money sports another another Sports example although it's a different application ge and Siemens had a grant call several years ago for new concussion detection systems so that's an another application with sport if you're wearing a helmet and you can have an EEG system that can help determine things like concussion that's quite helpful of course I would say again it should be a hybrid system the first thing I would say is have an accelerometer and the helmet have something that measures neck flexion but given all those things is it possible that EEG would provide additional information not so much on the injury itself but how it affected the brain well yes that I think that's a reasonable direction so that is an application with sport and if it makes people safer oh great not not boxing also not getting punched in the face so I'm not a medical doctor but I am a brain scientist try not to get punched in the face so yeah with these it's hard for me to make a comment without knowing more about them comment about exactly their technology but I will have a few slides where I'm talking about applications and so these are some of the questions that I think need to be asked critically not just of them but of other ones so one thing that's not clear is what is the training time great you have a BCI that is a hundred words per minute that would be an extraordinary breakthrough I'd say ten words per minute I call that pretty good how long does it take to train the user how long does it take the train the system literacy does this work on 90% of people who try it is it is it just one person who works in Facebook out of all the employees you screen them all and you found the very best or is it something more Universal error rates and error Corrections so you might show a video where someone spells perfectly is that representative of normal operation and error correction that if an error is made what happens that's an issue another big one is word or sentence completions so is it a 100 word per minute BCI in which you're actually thinking each individual word or is it something where it's inferring or assuming some parts of the word based on part of the sentence which is a common thing I'm not saying these are bad I'm just saying these are examples of details that I would need and I think most BCI people would need to be able to really evaluate is this a breakthrough or what's happening and I mentioned number of users or takes you know again does it work on everyone I do object to this so none of these entities are really engaging the DCI community much this is not just my view comes up all the time and this raises another question of how does this affect public perception of BCI's and so I'll get to these slides but here's an example of where this gets worrisome and I'm not citing any of these companies but this is a specific example from a paper so a lot of articles for me and from others have raised concerns about regulation or at least act information about direct-to-consumer brain devices this is an example that was quoted in this article because the sleep Shepherd lets you directly control your brain rate you can naturally build a better healthier sleep cycle that allows you to fall asleep faster stay asleep longer and have more energy during the day by the way these comments are not endorsed by the FDA well a few things first if you know what it means to control your brain rate please let me know I'm a professional neuroscientist I have no idea I've asked other neuroscientists they're like we don't know maybe it means control brain frequencies like alpha or beta but does that mean you have more activity at a certain frequency are you trading for a different peak frequency are you training the ratio but moreover if if this were true wonderful I mean everybody would do it it might be true I don't know but this is an example of something where you could imagine that someone who bought this and then found that their sleep didn't improve would then be a lot more skeptical not only about BCI is in general but people like me so I've said this before a friend of mine from Microsoft it resonated with me and I go and people say oh BCI's are are stupid they're not useful for mainstream people or they're unethical they're potentially dangerous they don't work and I can understand why many people would think that given what's out there and so in 2018 to talk more about this mainstream BCI or big BCI this is a list of the sponsors of the 2018 BCI meeting so this was the main conference for BC is in 2018 none of these are big companies with respect to them none of them are like Elon Musk or Facebook I know most of these guys of course we appreciate the sponsorship but this is it's kind of like the beginning of my talk where I sort of liked having it frozen in time as of 2020 this is the involvement of BCI this is the perception of BC is as of 2018 these are the biggest companies that are sponsoring the biggest conference another issue from I call science fiction about BCI's it's bifi it's not sci-fi and another common view that we have to address that comes from this is that basically BCI is is evil right a BCI is made by evil people to be used for evil purposes a major exception the first Star Trek pilot this is a very realistic and altruistic portrayal of BCI's Captain Pike is a disabled person he was a military hero he saved many cadets from Delta radiation they described in detail how this works he can do one thing for yes or two for no he can move around that's about right that's about consistent with the wheelchair level controller we have for a lot of people but all these other ones are examples where the BCI is used to to oppress to spy on people to cause harm in some way and the worst one is of course more than 50% of black mirror episodes have BC is I refer to this as the Bricker BCI because it's a guy named Charlie Brooker it's usually the same it's a tiny thing that you just stick right there on the temple and there appears to be no limitation of its capability it has complete read/write capability totally immersive and with arguably one exception they're evil I mean they're being used to in really really iffy ways I say this not theoretically I've run into people you know and you mentioned what you do and they have a very bad reaction to it and when you talk to them it's because of things like this they believe this is what BCI's are the bigger problem is that it messes up public discussion of ethics that is these are these are more pragmatic and realistic ethical things we do have ethical discussion boards if anyone's at the BCI meeting I'm I'm leading a workshop where we're trying to work on ethical guidelines for companies and mainstream applications any of you would be most welcome and you know there are good sides of it big BCI in particular could reduce system cost this is huge it's just like a car if you start manufacturing EEG systems on the scale of tens of thousands or millions becomes far far cheaper it could foster new applications including patient applications and this came up a lot during lunch that I think even if a company is purely focused on mainstream users has no interest in patients whatsoever indirectly that will lead to patient benefit partly through reduced system costs partly through new application partly also through improved integration so it might be easier for a disabled person to use Microsoft raise public awareness that's good inspire more funding that's good and I mentioned this before lead to a breakthrough a large-scale research has never really been done before with BCI but there are some problems could encourage false claims and hype draw attention away from patient applications could lead to public mistrust or fear less funding and so this gets to the issue of managing expectations which is relevant to mainstream users what if it doesn't work what if a system causes harm even if it's not a real DCI that the media interprets it as such someone miss reads the article you know so there's been some work toward real-time brain stimulation systems you know that and this was one example that I saw at a conference a company called focus where they were presenting this as a system for gamers to maintain vigilance it's a brain stimulation tool so it directly influences the brain so these gamers that stay up already for 72 hours drinking Mountain Dew don't need a system to make them stay up longer this it's called no more wolf this is you can look it up and it claims to be a BCI that can determine your dog's mental state and I think it says it can find 13 different mental states or something like that's pretty good that's better than I can do with people and this one what if the BCI a system or the practitioner hasn't been represented accurately you know dude due diligence is an issue that's a story I can tell tell later what if the BCI person is not trained and ethics are working with people so a lot of us when were working with patients were trained on issues and there are things like ethical training getting approved by a local IRB many companies don't don't have that which may be relevant this is a story where I was talking about this topic at the BCI meeting in 2010 and Neil's beer bomber stood up and he said in 1975 I was doing neurofeedback researcher research I was a know none respected expert in the field and neurofeedback was hot it was popular and by 1979 the field had become so saturated with bad companies and bad claims I no longer said that I would send out grant proposals doing the same thing but I would never use the word neurofeedback because it became a bad word and is it possible this is where BCI is going where I've already talked to people Torsten Zander is one where they've talked about using alternate terms just because a lot of people are saying Oh BCI is a bunch of hooey or whatever you want popular BCI articles sensationalized so this was an article from salon and it was referring to and non-invasive as a BCI that would just detect activity now it's true technically this is thought control that is you are using your thoughts to control something else but I think most people who see this and are familiar with Pink Floyd would instead interpret this very differently they're referring to controlling the users thought rather than the user controlling something else with the attendant implications of nasty government and so on and I haven't talked very much about implanted BCI's or invasive BCI's because of course right now the view is that these are only appropriate for patients who really need them but I can see this changing so cosmetic or dental surgery used to be taboo there was a time when you would say you want surgery to change the shape of your nose you want surgery to change oh that's ridiculous you don't need it it's not a medical need and yet a lot of people have said this has a huge impact they didn't feel comfortable going out in public and changed their social life people have talked about minimally invasive neurosurgery which is still neurosurgery so this is you know there's a lot of us can you drill a hole through the head yeah or something that would be the Elon Musk answer right so this was a great one at what the one of the BCI meetings so I didn't bring it up but someone was talking about minimally invasive neurosurgery and a guy named Eric loot heart stood up and he said I'm a neurosurgeon and we knew him he really is a neurosurgeon and he said all of its still neurosurgery if you're drilling a hole in the head if you're putting something in the brain it's not something a regular medical doctor can do it's not something a surgeon can do you need to be a neurosurgeon but the other thing he said is that relative to most neurosurgery's the risk and the time involved is relatively low he said I have put direct DBS stimulators deep in patients brains where you got to go through lots of brain tissue and so he said that yes it's still neurosurgery but it doesn't have the same level of risk as as other neurosurgeries and the reason I mentioned this is when you're considering the cost-benefit trade off of of that so what I recommend an implanted BCI purely for casual means no not right now but that might change this I won't go over in great detail because I only have a few minutes left and you know but this these are more the ethical issues that we discuss in the BCI community things like it--on autonomy identified entity agency things like that and of course healthy users are a little different than patients they can give informed consent unlike many people I've worked with who are diagnosed as comatose there's no way you can get their consent ahead of time there might be a lower risk of harm maybe not they may have more options to call you on something if they have a complaint they have a problem perhaps with healthy users medical investigations are less likely I say perhaps and in the 2002 BCI conference there is the notorious forget the patient's approach where people were saying what if instead of focusing on patients we just focus on healthy users because that will ultimately create the most benefit to patients patients are a tiny group nobody's doing anything with them the money is in big BCI let's do that and that's what will ultimately help the patients that was a huge controversy there along with this issue it was a big everyone was talking about it anyway getting toward the end does the cost-benefit change with public users and so I'm saying yes certainly one of the reasons why BCI has been so focused on severely disabled people is not just ethical and practical reasons but if you're working in academia that that's where the funding is you have a grant proposal and you say we're gonna do something to help people with ALS the NIH would be interested in that and you say we're gonna do something to make a lot of money that's not really fundable at least through those grant mechanisms and if you go for an SBIR or something they're not interested in public benefit they're interested in profitability transhumanism has the even this idea of future disability which is that we're all disabled right now because in 50 years we're gonna all have super abilities and relative to those future people we're stupid slow so here are some options the last couple slides are just some things about ways to help address this problem which are relevant to Microsoft or anybody anybody that might be interested in paving the way for mainstream BC is you know and talk and give talks I'm doing that right now talking to various entities complaining during lectures like these I'm doing that right now I mentioned I would plug the BCI Society so this is a nonprofit organization to encourage ethical good use of BCI you want more public funding you guys are private so I'm not bugging you for that and here's some things that are also changing so first you see a lot of improvement in sort of BCI training and infrastructure so another way to look at DC is going mainstream or even going toward more users is not just the end users with the developers how how are students or developers even going to think about BCI is in the first place so for example this entity a national center for adaptive neuro technology has summer schools and more people are teaching classes that are either explicitly focused on DCIS or at least mention them that's a huge deal you're an engineering student how are you going to learn about this there's a lot of stuff online so those of you watching at home if you'd like to learn about DCIS you can do a search BCI 2,000 open vibe open DCI they're really a lot of examples you can find online not just of of training videos but software so that you can can work on BC is there has been a growth in official entities so every two years we have this BCI meeting I told you about every odd-numbered year there's a BCI conference and Graz which is a top Institute for BCI activity there is now a BCI Journal that's been around for a few years special issues and frontiers and I've had some contribution to trying to get DCIS in museums and public hackathons there all these public BCI hackathons that are fun I wanted a plug or upcoming conference which is near Waterloo and finally I'd like to thank both Hannes and Yvonne for inviting me to speak here and here's my email if you have any questions thank you so you spoke mostly about getting some information from the brain and controlling something but when you talk about human-computer interfaces they are bi-directional how much work have been done and I deeply understand ethical concerns here on the opposite direction a lot so one example I mentioned the control of cockroaches I also mentioned control of rats these are both in that erection so this was a this used to be some of my intro slides and the problem is that understandably everybody wanted argue about what BCI's are which is true so to answer your question first the term BCI the acronym is terrible terrible choice of acronym in the literature it's defined as a device for sending information from the brain to a computer but there's no reason you would believe that from the acronym also it's defined as something direct but Edwin Hutchins who is a professor in the cognitive science department he says a keyboard as an interface between a brain and a computer and monitor is so I agree I've railed against it in papers but with no luck so the term BCI again is defined in the literature and not defined by the acronym because it's not a clear acronym it's defined as something that only reads from the brain then the European Commission came up with this BNC I by which they mean reads from the brain or the peripheral nervous system then this broader term adaptive neuro technology means something that can read and write to either system I would be very happy to work with you to come up with some new terminology or taxonomy I really don't like this it's not obvious and every time I give it to like I said I've given up having this similarly I was gonna start my slide with this Wolpaw and Wolpaw hat or my talk with this the Wolpaw and Wolpaw model replace improved supplement enhance restore he was presenting it from the five different perspectives of how you could use a BCI but then again people say well that's good but what about writing to the brain and that just yeah right this is all over this was this 2012 book you know and so then you can break it down this way so for example prior work on replacing using a BCI to replace a lost function that's been very extensively explored you know so this is a big big issue with patience you've lost the ability to spell so we give you a wholly new way to spell for the general population that's not applicable it's designed to replace a loss function you've lost nothing or to restore so the idea here is that you're not replacing a loss function but you're you're taking something that they've lost the ability to do like move their hand and restoring that ability so the difference is here you're just it's you're replacing here you're using the same system like stroke rehab similar thing for the general population by definition they have nothing to restore but you look at some of these other things can you use it to improve by here he meant improve something beyond your normal function and so this is a hot topic for patients it's promising for the general population it might be scary to you do you really want half the population probably the richest half or half of 1% to have different abilities so so yes you're right and I I cannot defend the term BCI but incidentally there there are a lot of examples in the literature of trying to come up with different terms Scott McCaig who I mentioned use the phrase brain actuated control Jayne Huggins from the University of Michigan called it direct brain interface which is great because it gets rid of the direct part but there's still how is it clear that it's a brain - computer interface this is yet another reason why there's some talk about just moving away from the term altogether but that would require us all to agree and that's just not going to happen and it's one of emily Mugler no us okay oh look into that and thank you look into that thank you the second question or comment was that there's a lot of work being done in new ethics guidelines from the center for new technology here in Seattle yeah so I have very great respect for Professor Rao Chantel Pratt and their colleagues and have for many years I've visited their lab they've been around for a long time they got some good publicity with their brain-to-brain interface I I would be delighted if them or their group could come to the meeting where we have a discussion on on this issue I mean of ethical and practical guideline issues another quick comment is that they also were some media articles came out based on their archive presentation of some work and so I interacted with them a bit because I was saying to those two people this seems like it's unethical from a media perspective you're supposed to wait for the article to get published and they didn't that doesn't seem to be something that you would it was just a preprint and they were saying yeah it was not our intent for that to be picked up by the media yet of course she wanted to get peer-reviewed first so I I sympathize with them on that but that's also an issue and neuroethics that I'd like to discuss and develop guidelines you know so one might say there's already that guideline it's called the engl finger rule it says you're not supposed to publicize something until it's been peer-reviewed and yet even though that is known it seems that a reminder something might be necessary because it has been happening I just saw something on CNN that I was really interested in it it was talking about mysterious radio signals that repeated yeah and then as I'm reading it said this was based on an archive preprint and I was looking to see if they directly interviewed the the people involved and so I was then wondering the same thing is this something that's ready to show to people like me I'm not an astronomy expert what if it goes through peer review and their problems arise or something I mean this is a really common thing that I know a number of journalists basically just roll through archive right to find cool stuff and it doesn't matter whether it's because cool stuff it's cool stuff it's going to get a good print it's gonna be a good clip I mean it sucks but I don't think there's really that's not really an ethical issue on the part of the scientists because there is a lot of benefit to uncomfortable putting that off scientists I don't mean to what I was my interaction with with them is I had been contacted by a journalist who wanted me to comment on it and so when I realized that I asked professor Rao and professor Pratt hey just wanted to double-check with you it seems that they haven't worked with you yet and I don't feel comfortable talking about this unless I'm missing something and they wrote back and they said said that so that's what I said to the journalist I said very politely I can't do this and I I said something like I think this would be unethical it's a preprint and it's not meant for public dissemination and to be fair that journalist and that newspaper never published anything about it so I wish I knew I remembered who because I'd like to publicly think it was good I'm happy to take more questions at the beginning of the talk you said that applications for healthy people would include cases where a healthy person is disabled within some sort of environment or setting that is when people can be useful for healthy people and is the difference between it is an actual disabled person and a health person being disabled temporarily is that potentially some sort of brain connections are the universe's are not working on a disability so that would be another challenge right certainly that in some cases it's not simply in a case of disability by the situation but also in any situation you might have limited capability one common example that has come up that didn't quite seem to pan out is that there was a lot of concern with p300 and sspe PBC is because of the presumption that they required control of gaze and so they thought well if you can move your eyes why not just use an eye tracker why bother with the BCI and there were two answers that came up one is that first various papers showed that p300 and SS vep DCIS can function without gaze shifting in some cases so even a patient with no eye control can choose to pay attention to the left or right side but the other thing that came up was as I mentioned some people chose them anyway and you might even look at it as sort of situational disability in the sense that you can use an eye tracker in one situation which is that you're not tired after using an eye tracker until your eyes become tired in some way that's a little like situational disability now all of a sudden you can't use an eye tracker anymore and so at least temporarily you know so this is what that paper I mentioned from Robert liebe and Jose Mian and colleagues was getting at was the prospect that people might switch between a BCI and another interface based on their situation including just fatigue so yes to expand I don't mean the situation meaning only that you're in a certain environment or using a certain type of interface it could it could be various situations that would lead you to want to use a VCI when you might not otherwise in a different situation normal questions [Applause]
