 IGN had a half-hour interview with gabe newell and robin walker about half-life Alex and valve this video will summarize it the feeling I got is that gabe is living about 15 years in the future in some matrix light reality and that robin is the one who has to try and convert this all into fun gaming experiences for us all to enjoy there are key bits of this interview where i suggest you check out the main video because words can only describe so much for gamers saying but I'll let you know when those times are Gabe said that it's a huge amount of fun to work in the half-life universe again it symbolizes that they found some new game design challenges and half-life is like the crowbar they're using to tackle them and I assume to make them into a fun playable concept he wasn't surprised when Robin told him it was VR since it can greatly improve a single-player immersive experience and he thinks people will realize that when they play it as Robin kept telling himself as long as it's good fans will be happy Gabe couldn't be happier with it but he says newer members of the team were afraid with the challenge of living up to the series expectations he urges people to tell him what they think of it by sending him an email a lot of Gabe's day is spent on his email or trying to solve problems which aren't super obvious he's working on brain computer interfaces at the moment Gabe does all sorts of stuff in valve ranging from dealing with personal issues to press he varies it up because it keeps it fun he describes his job as being like playing a game except on steroids rather than looking back at what they've done they look ahead of what the future challenges they might face will be as an example rather than thinking about how their past stuff has changed the world he'll it instead work on figuring out why artifact was a disappointment because there helps them more when it comes to making better decisions in the future he says he learned more from failure than you do from success before valve Gabe worked for Microsoft on Windows people didn't believe for an operating system could handle intensive games so they ported doom to show it could game devs said he'd have more fun making video games so he contemplated whether it was a good business venture but also saw her as a good reason to play games he self-funded half-life 1 with his Microsoft money and he says that being private helps them to have as few people between themselves and their products and customers as possible meaning they get to make the product for the people who are going to be using it the alternate if I assume would be something like shareholders who might be more short-term and profit driven which might not always benefit the way that valve do things for a while they had publishers that was a headache too I suppose you could see steams their way of going publisher free I suggest you watch from 856 to 937 Gabe speaks about how he can't think of a better way to spend a few decades than with Game Developers and how he's still in touch with the co-founder of valve Mike Harrington his responses are quite moving Gabe says that they achieved stuff with half-life 2 and then the episodes but after two of these they decided that this approach would be better suited to a connected economy in a multiplayer environment which I guess led to stuff like the hats in Team Fortress 2 and the skins and operations in csgo I've got the impression from the interview that they didn't even seriously consider half-life 3 until VR came along but once it did it seemed like the perfect match since they felt really strongly that VR would open up new and exciting opportunities modders have been responsible for many of Valve's game series Robin explains these people might not have had the resources to build a full game but they might have had a lot of ideas and later went on to form indie studios and he told Gabe that they should pay more attention to these types of people because they do all kinds of interesting stuff a few years ago valve acquired the Camposanto game dev studio who were working on Firewatch at the time gabe explained that an acquisition isn't financially driven or about the games that they've developed but instead because they like the people in the organization they're acquiring after a lot of chatting to the guys at Campo Santo they decided they were the perfect fit for valve Gabe describes game development as a bit like married life and that they've got to be able to tolerate spending 40 60 80 hours a week with those people that they're working with in Valve's case this has how they enjoy it so the guys from Campo Santo helped to finish off half-life Alex and integrated a lot of their ideas from Firewatch into it Robin talks about how the development team comprised of a bunch of people who had worked on older half-life games and yes ricochet to experience ricochet evolve Bruce and others from the Firewatch team who came along with very different narrative forms the result is a new blend of narrative for half-life Alex which Robin says contains a lot more and more dynamic narrative than in previous games in the series when it comes to constructing half-life Alex they went back and looked at all of the half-life games and cherry-picked what worked best from each Robin said that something seemed better on paper but in practice weren't as good and you couldn't quite understand why at the time they've had the time to pick the best of everything this time half-life alex is also better because the team developing it has gotten better than there used to be and the new developers helped bring something fresh to the experience robin comments that from his point of view as a game dev he remembers less about the game and more about periods of time when a set of people worked on solving a problem of some sort gabe also shares the kinds of experiences that i rise from gaming development which i can summarize as gabe just sees consoles is a way of delivering games to people he's more interested in what their design means for game devs I recall him having some strong negative opinions about the PlayStation 3 back in the day because it was held to develop for with its custom multi-threaded processor but he says that their hardware is becoming increasingly similar to those found in PCs and that's good news for game devs he doesn't explain what's new with source 2 but they pretty much says that they've done some stuff to source 2 for half-life Alex and that the engine will be licensed out to other developers and if there's interest in it and valve will invest more into it but I got the impression that they're not that interested in what other developers do with it source 2 is something valve has made for valve and if other people like it then great but it's not a priority for them unless they get told that if given a choice between half-life 1 and 1/2 I've - Gabe chooses portal 2 he prefers it because he did less on it so he's more easily able to appreciate it for what it is he says that when you work on something it's never really finished only abandoned so with the half-life games he can see all of the compromises the flaws and the mistakes but with portal 2 he's all like that's pretty good but he still says that alex is the best Chocula Li seriously right now okay pretty much only place dota 2 and rather jokingly can't imagine why anybody would play anything other than that but Robin thinks that's sad because he thinks there are many good games out there when asked which half-life game was closest to half-life 3 aside from half-life Alex game seems confused by the question it says that alex is the closest and that is a progression half-life as a series is about solving interesting problems and while that's the case with its gameplay I think he's saying that from a developer's point of view the half-life games have typically introduced a new element a bit physics or VR and Alex represents the collection of interesting problems and solutions that they've used to transform it into a gaming feature even goes on to say that they don't crank out half-life games for the money he then talks about how much of a risk half-life alex is more as how from their point of view they won't know if half-life alex is the right direction to take the series until fans have played it and given them feedback about it he explains how they've made mistakes like steam machines he doesn't even beat about the bush he calls artifact a great disappointment and that he screwed things up I suggest you watch this next bit of the interview for yourselves it's powerful to hear him talking about it so earnestly and with genuine interest in what the community will think of half of Alex and they want to know if they're on the right track or if they're just out of touch with the community it's time to release the game out into the world and to see what people think of it how the community receives it it's going to affect every internal conversation at valve for the next 18 months this is actually a really powerful moment for us this is as good as we get we want people to come back and say oh my god the magic still is there I think we've nailed it they're not expecting it to sell well but they'll gauge a success by how much the people who play it enjoy it and not from the sales numbers which will no doubt be constrained by the current state of VR adoption when asked what they want to do in the next 10 years Gabe thinks that valve as a company is productive a great place to work and will continue to grow Robin says he wants to make more half-life which he thinks turned out amazingly and there has taught up as they've been in a while Gabe believes the valve index is a good step forward for them to use to develop products around and that they need to do more with that and bring computer interfaces talk to you very often oh yes Gabe talks about this throughout the interview it's the big challenge that he returns to whenever he's got spare time and isn't playing dota 2 it seems more important to him than anything else it looks to be the next step beyond VR with the valve index you can see here and interact with objects convincingly but brain-computer interfaces will be the big leap beyond that to put it into perspective he says that when arrives it will be an extinction-level event for any entertainment business that isn't doing it and if they're not thinking about it now they will be he says that we're way closer to the matrix than people realize but it won't be the matrix because that misses the interesting technical subtleties that make up how weird this new world is going to be but it'll have a huge impact on the experiences that they can create for people so what is it exactly I'm not sure if he's talking about something that can pick up brain signals or if he's suggesting something that can create brain signals he goes off on tangents about it throughout the video like how he explains that visual and motor stuff is easy to do but getting somebody to feel cold is harder because your brain receives inputs from various places including your immune system he's excited about it and it shows so it sounds like a fully immersive world without the same limitations or rules as the one that we currently live in it may have the wrong connotations but we're listening to him describe it the word drug came to mind he likens brain computer interfaces to trying to describe the Internet to somebody who doesn't use the Internet once they know it allows for rapid transport of information they'd understand that it would help them to do stuff that they can do already like cookery recipes but they probably wouldn't have thought of uber or automatic car updates even though those things have proven to be incredibly useful the next bit is my speculation about it because it's too exciting not to speculate about what Gabe was saying reminded me a lot of what Jeff Bezos said in his plans for space travel in Jeff's presentation he said how he didn't see his purpose as being to find uses for space travel but rather about lowering its barrier of entry and making it as accessible to as many people as possible in order to let them to find uses for it he said how it will be the next generations who will find the best ways of utilizing ed Jeff just saw it as his mission to enable them while I don't know Gabe's master plan for brain computer interfaces if it's anything like what valves been doing with steam and VR it could be about building a platform for it which other people can use if you want my opinion on it it does seem scary listening to gape talking about these things he's 10 steps ahead of the rest of us it seems like to him VR is old hat he's already trying to advance things to the next stage beyond that I don't know how I feel about computer systems which can tap directly into my brain but then I know people who feel that way about VR and uncool with that so who knows check out the interview here [Music]
