 how the human-computer interaction would be in the future what will be still using mouse and keyboard will even talk loudly toward virtual assistant I don't think so imagine if you can control everything around you by just thinking but how can we achieve this and will it be practical first we have to understand the different modes of human speech the first mode of a speech is called an envision to speech in which the user think of the world clearly the same way he think about it when he speaks normally the pattern of the brain waves generated in the Broca's area can be captured and later be used to train the system beside the complex settings needed to capture those EEG signals most of the research papers in this field achieved an accuracy range between 15 up to 65 percent on limited Vocabularies and achieve a higher accuracy rate and invasive methods should be used the second mode of his speech is called the silent a speech in this mode the user table naturally but without any audible sound in this mode the EMG signals it can easily be captured from the facial muscles while the user is silently speaking the signals it can also be used to train the system as explained working envision speech is not practical due to the lower recognition rate complex setup and violating users privacy we cannot also work in the silent mode as it doesn't fit in our requirements as it required a facial muscle movement to this point there was no way the project can be done but thanks to NASA as well the mode of speech is first mentioned in one of the papers in 2004 they called the sub vocal speech in this mode no lips for facial muscle movement is required you can think of it the same way one reads to himself or do a mathematical calculation silently when the users talk to himself some vocally a very deep EMG signals is produced by capturing the very deep EMG signal to understand some vocal speech we were able to build a system that can understand the unspoken his speech was accuracy rate was 99% on to commands 97% of for commands and 94% on think elapsed see up Oh see them see ya see you down down down so young so yo Oh down down so you down huh see you um very young Oh so you stay on so y'all say Oh three on sale see ya say Oh say on
