 Quasar has produced the revolutionary dry electrodes that form the foundation of the DSI-VR300. This active dry electrode EEG is designed to acquire EEG data from its seven channels built into a lightweight headset. The DSI-VR300 allows researchers to fully control immersive digital environments. The headset is user-intuitive and can be put on by the subject themselves in only a couple of minutes. This setup functions entirely without any gels or skin preparation, the only adjustment is the parting of the hair to ensure good contact between the electrodes and the skin of the scalp. The attached HTC Vive virtual reality system allows for the subject to be fully immersed into the required scenario for the acquisition. This level of immersion would usually be difficult for EEG measurements. electrical noise artifacts are no hindrance for the system because of its ingenious design. Each electrode is surrounded by an additional shielding electrode blocking out unwanted background noise. The disassembly of the EEG headset is as easy as removing the system from the head and cleaning the electrode tips with a brush and a small amount of cleaning alcohol to remove remaining residues.
