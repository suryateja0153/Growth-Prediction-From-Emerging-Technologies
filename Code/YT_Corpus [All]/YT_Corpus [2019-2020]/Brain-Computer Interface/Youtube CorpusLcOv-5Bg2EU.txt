 Neuralink a rather mysterious brain-computer interface company In July this year, it was announced that in 2020 a "brain implant chip" will be tested on a paralyzed volunteer to complete the "intentional manipulation" of mobile phones and computers by humans The CEO of this company is Elon Musk a Tesla boss who recently smashed a window Musk said that the Neuralink ltimate goal of Neuralink is to achieve human enhancement Because in the future, humans can only be eliminated by robots if they are integrated with machines So how does this "back-intubation" technique work? It starts with our brains The reason the human brain is so developed is because there are nearly 100 billion neuron cells in the brain Between neurons, syna pses through connection points rely on neurotransmitter exchange to complete information transmission and generate micro-electric fields and chain reactions in the process, just like Avatar's tree of life and eventually form a large neuron network The cerebral cortex is the highly concentrated part of the brain Previous studies have shown that the cerebral cortex can be divided into different brain regions according to function For example, the temporal lobe area is responsible for memory and language processing; the frontal lobe is responsible for spatial reasoning and attention, and so on Therefore we can place microelectrodes in the cerebral cortex to record information expressed by neurons Brain-computer interface technology is developed based on such principles of cognitive neuroscience As long as the human brain, equipment, and sensors capable of recording neuron expressions are in place "mind manipulation" can be achieved For example in 2016 a study implanted a microelectrode array on the motor cortex of a paralyzed patient After acquiring the information it was decoded by a machine and transmitted to the neuromuscular electricity on the arm to stimulate the muscles thereby restoring hand movements Conversely mechanical equipment can also replace sensory organs to capture information which can be transmitted back to sensors through computer coding to directly stimulate the sensory nerves Cochlear implants for example are the most successful implantable hearing repair devices today Through the surgery electrodes are implanted deep into the cochlea, and wires are connected to the annunciator and microphone in the external part After the signal receiver receives the signal the external device converts it into an electrical pulse that can drive the electrodes directly stimulating the auditory nerve The same method can also restore human vision So brain-computer interface technology is a great progress for amputees and disabled people but obviously this requires dangerous craniotomy Therefore scientists have also developed a non-intrusive EEG recording technology that uses the form of an "electric cap" to achieve brain-computer integration But companies like Neuralink don't think so The signals obtained invasively are direct neural signals which obviously can acquire more brain data and realize more possibilities So at the moment Neuralink's goal is to implant human brain-computer interface chips safely and painlessly like minimally invasive surgery Neuralink will conduct a human experimentation product next year which looks like a hearing aid from the outside The operation method is to insert a polymer probe with a diameter of 4-6 microns which is finer than hair strands and insert it into the cerebral cortex at a rate of six wires per minute through a neurosurgical robot to obtain information about neurons At the other end of the line are four sensors attached to the brain that are used to read, clean, and amplify computer signals The chip will be hung on the human ear in the form of a wearable device The system can directly interact with mobile phones, computers and mobile phone apps like Bluetooth and WI-FI Musk's idea is that "in the future, human intelligence will be left behind by AI and brain-computer interfaces will allow us to keep pace with AI" Therefore in the future the other end of the brain-computer combination may not be a robotic arm or a Neural repair equipment but a game a small animal even a robot Imagine if Alpha Jelly was implanted in Ke Jie's brain what would happen if the human brain combined with the digital brain Proponents and opponents of this technology have their own words On the one hand brain-computer interface technology can indeed provide better assistance to people with disabilities and the elderly in the medical industry But if uncontrolled development is likely to lead to many conflicts and crimes in the future After commercialization commercial companies will also create programs that experience happiness one after another, becoming "electronic cannabis" Of course all this is still far away but dozens of brain-computer interface companies like Neuralink are still being developed day by day Behind this is not only the exploration of the future but also huge business opportunities Would you like to implant a chip in your brain that can control a robot?
