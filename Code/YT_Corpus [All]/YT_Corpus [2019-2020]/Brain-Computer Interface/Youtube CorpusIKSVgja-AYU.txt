 MY NAME IS RICHARD AND I AM THE SCIENTIFIC DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INNSITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING. AND IT'S MY GREATEST PLEASURE TODAY TO WELCOME PROFESSOR MIGUEL NICOLELIS TO THE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON LECTURE SERIES. DR. NICOLELIS IS A PHYSICIAN SCIENTIST WHO IS INTERNATIONAL RENOWNED FOR HIS PIONEERING WORK ON DEVELOPING BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE TECHNOLOGY. THERE'S ONLY TIME FOR ME JUST TO SAY A FEW REMARKS, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE TIME HE WILL BE TALKING. BUT HE--DR. NICOLELIS IS FROM BRAZIL AND HAS ALSO RECEIVE AID Ph.D. IN PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOPHYSICS FROM HENEIMAN UNIVERSITY IN PILL FACAS. DR. NOCOLELIS IS A FULL PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND CO-DIRECTOR OF THE NEUROENGINEERING CENTER AT DUKE UNIVERSITY. HIS LAB IS BEST KNOWN FOR STUDIES ON NEURONAL POPULATION CODING, BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACES AND NEUROPROSTHESIS IN HUMAN PATIENTS AND IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES. HIS WORK HAS ALREADY ACCUMULATED SOME 30-THOUSAND CITATIONS AND IN 2010, HE WAS AWARDED THE NIH DIRECTOR'S PIONEER AWARD TO PURSUE HIS RESEARCH ON BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION TO HIS FACULTY APPOINTMENT AT DUKE UNIVERSITY, DR. NICOLELIS ALSO DIRECTS THE NATIONAL EN--STRATEGIESITUTE FOR NEUROSCIENCES OF NATALL IN THE BRAZILIAN STATE OF RIO GRANDE DEL NORTE, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE EDMUND AND LILLY AFFRON FOUNDATION. DR. NICOLELIS HAS CHOSEN THIS SOMEWHAT REMOTE AREA FOR HIS INSTITUTE BECAUSE IT WAS EXTREMELY UNDERSERVED AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHEN I SPOKE WITH HIM EARLIER, HE TOLD ME THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TOLD HIM HE WAS CRAZY TO SET UP AN INSTITUTE IN SUCH A LOCATION. HOWEVER, IT HAS NOW BECOME A HUB FOR NEUROSCIENCE AND FOR TRAINING TALENTED YOUNG INVESTIGATORS AND IT IS DEMONSTRATED HIS BELIEF THAT TALENTED STUDENTS EXIST IN PLACES EVEN WHEN THE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES THERE ARE EXTREMELY POOR. AND DR. NICOLELIS IS--HE'S A FOOTBALL FAN AMONGST OTHER THINGS AND HE--IN 2014 HE WAS THE GUEST OF HONOR AT THE WORLD CUP IN BRAZIL BECAUSE HE WAS ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPENING HIGHLIGHT WHEN JULIAN O PINTO, A 29 YEARLY PERRA PLEEJIC WITH COMPLETE PARALYSIS OF HIS LOWER TRUNK DELIVERED THE KICKOFF AT THE OPENING GAME THANKS TO DR. NICOLESIS, TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT SO IF YOU LOOK ONLINE YOU CAN SEE HE'S GIVEN FANTASTIC TED TALK AND HE'S BEEN FEATURED ON MULTIPLE TV AND RADIO SHOWS INCLUDING THE DIANE REAMS SHOW. THE TITLE OF HIS TALK TODAY IS BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACES, FROM BASIC SCIENCE TO NEUROPROSTHESES AND NEUROLOGICAL RECOVERY. DR. NICOLELIS. [APPLAUSE ] THANKS VERY MUCH THIS IS A GREAT HONOR, GREAT PLEASURE TO BE HERE, I NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS WHEN I WAS GROWING UP AS A SCIENTIST IN BRAZIL COULD IMAGINE I WOULD BE HERE GIVING A NIH DIRECTOR'S TALK, AFTER 31 YEARS FUNDED BY NIH, IT IS REALLY A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR ME TO BE HERE AND TO I GUESS, SINCE 2010 TO GIVE YOU A PROGRESS REPORT ON WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH THIS WONDERFUL THING CALLED THE PIONEER,A WARD TO ACTUALLY TRY TO MERGE MY LONG INTERESTING, BASIC QUESTION ON HOW BRAIN CIRCUITS OPERATE, HOW THEY WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPLES, MECHANISMS, PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW THESE CIRCUITS TO GENERATE THE BUSINESS OF THE BRAIN, THE BEHAVIOR AND HOW IN A GIVEN MOMENT BY CHANCE, WE MADE A FEW DISCOVERIES THAT ALLOWED US TO TAKE THIS KNOWLEDGE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE AND EVENTUALLY DISCOVER THAT NEUROSCIENCE CAN DO A LOT OF GOOD IF YOU JUST WANT--I COULD HAVE THE LIGHTS OFF IF SOMEONE IS CONTROLLING THE LIGHTS ON THE STAGE A LITTLE BIT OF IN FRONT BECAUSE SOME OF MY SLIDES ARE LIKE THIS. BUT THIS WAS MY BUSINESS FOR 20-SOMETHING YEARS. I CAME TO THE U.S. IN 89 TO MEET A PHENOM WILLINAL MAN JAN CHAPIN, HE WAS A POST DOCKERAL FELLOW, HE HAD THE SAME IDEA, WE WANTED TO RECORD THE EXTRA NEURON SIGNALS MORE THAN 1 TIME. AND THE LATE 80S, PEOPLE WERE SO ENAMSORRATED WITH NAWR O RECORDED PEOPLE WOULD ASK US, WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT WHY WHAT--WAKIND IS THE POINT OF RECORDING MORE NEURONS AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME WE RECORDED AT DUKE IN THE LATE 90S, 1 NEUROSIMULTANEOUSLY FROM THE RECESS MONKEY BRAIN AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT TURNED THIS FIELD AROUND AND ALLOW US TO ASK A VARIETY OF NEW QUESTIONS, PARTICULARLY WHEN WE REALIZE AND THIS IS A SUMMARY OF MY LIFE IN 1 SLIDE. I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULD HAVE 1 SLIDE TO DESCRIBE YOU MY JOURNEY OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS. WHEN I STARTED OUR GOAL, JOHN CHAPIN AND I WAS TO DEVELOP METHODS IF ARE CHRONIC MULTISIDE BEHAVING ANIMALS. WE WANTED ANIMALS TO BE FREE TO BEHAVE AND WE WOULD TO DEFINE THE CIRCUITS SIMULTANEOUSLY. WELL I START DEVELOPING THIS AS A POST DOC BUT THEN I SPEND ABOUT 20 YEARS ON MY CAREER APPLYING THIS METHOD TO LOOK FOR NEUROCIRCUIT DYNAMICS AND THE RULES OF NEUROCIRCUIT PLASTICITY IN A VARIETY OF SPECIES, FROM MICE TO RATS TO MONKEYS AND MORE RECENTLY TO HUMANS. FROM THIS WORK, I CAME TO DERIVE A SERIES OF PRINCIPLES, I CALL PHYSIOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES ON NEUROSYMBOL PHYSIOLOGY AND IF YOU'RE A MATHEMATITION, I WOULD CLAIM THESE ARE MY AXIOMS AND THESE ARE WHAT I WANT TO DEMONSTRATE BECAUSE THEY BECAME VERY GENERAL AND THEY WERE PRODUCING MANY DIFFERENT CIRCUITS IN MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES BY NOW AND WE HAVE A ALMOST GOOD FEELING THAT SOME OF THIS IS HOLD ACROSS SPECIES AND ACROSS CIRCUITS AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THEM, A FEW OF THEM, FROM HERE, AS WE--THIS ADVENTURE WAS GETTING MORE AND MORE INTERESTING, JOHN CHAPIN AND I 1 DAY GOT TOGETHER IN THE LATE 90S AND WE SAID LOOK WE NEED A NEW PARADIGM. WE NEED TO PROBE THE CIRCUITS IN A WAY THAT WE CAN CONTROL THE OUTPUT, WE CAN CONTROL THE FEEDBACK, THAT IS BRAINS ARE RECEIVING, LET'S CREATE A NEW PARADIGM AND WE CAME UP WITH THIS BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE IDEA OF LINKING BRAINS TO DEVICES, AND INSHALLLY OUR OWN GOAL WAS TO BE ABLE TO MANIPULATE THE OUTPUT COMING FROM THE MOTOR CORTEX FOR INSTANCE, AND TEST A VARIETY OF HYPOTHESIS, AND A VARIETY OF COMMUTATIONAL MODELS ON HOW PEOPLE PROPOSE SYMBOLS AND EMERGE THEIR ACTIVITY TO GENERATE MOTOR OUTPUTS AND ALSO HOW FEEDBACK CAN BE MANIPULATED TO GO BACK TO THE USER'S BRAIN AND MODULATE THE ACTIVITY OF THE MOTOR CORTEX, THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL GOAL, BUT NOW, SOON AFTER WE START PUBLISHING PARTNERSHIPS ON THIS, WE REALIZE THAT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL CLIN OF COMPLICATION FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT I HOPE TO SHOW YOU IS THE FIRST APPLICATIONS THAT ARE NOW COMING OUT IN THE CLINICAL ARENA FOR BOTH SPINAL CORD INJURY AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS I WILL MENTION VERY BRIEFLY BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK. SO THIS PAST JULY, JULY 20th, WE CELEBRATED 20 YEARS OF THE FIRST PAPER THAT DESCRIBED THIS DEFINITION OF A BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE, IT WAS DONE IN RATS, IT WAS A BIG, YOU KNOW SURPRISE IN THE NEUROSCIENCE COMMUNITY, A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN WE SEND OUR FIRST GRANTS TO NIH, WE COULDN'T GET A PENNY AND IT WAS REALLY NICE THAT WE GOT THE PIONEER AWARD FOR THE SAME THAT COULDN'T BE FUNDED IN 1999, AND IT WAS A REASON THAT ALMOST IRONICAL I'M HERE NOW, TODAY. BUT BASICALLY WHAT WE DESCRIBED IN THE FIRST PAPER, IT WAS THIS IDEA, HAVE YOU A BRAIN, YOU RECORDING USING PLENTIFUL DEVICES OR MORE RECENTLY OF COURSE OR SINCE THE BEGINNING YOU COULD THINK ABOUT NONINVASIVE TECHNIQUES BUT IN OUR OWN WORK, WE STARTED, WITH CHRONIC IMPLANTS THAT COULD RECORD THIS HUNDREDS OF CELLS SIMULTANEOUSLY, SEND--REROUTE THE SIGNALS TO COMPUTATIONAL MODELS THAT COULD EXTRACT MOTOR INFORMATION, MOTOR PARAMETERS OUT OF THIS RAW ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY, TRANSFORM THEM IN DIGITAL COMMANDS THAT COULD BE REROUTED AGAIN TOWARDS DEVICES THAT COULD NOW BE MOVED BY THE VOLUNTARY MOTOR INTENTION OF THESE INDIVIDUAL, THIS SUBJECT WITHOUT THE NEED OF WE THOUGHT AT THAT TIME, OF MOVING THE SUBJECTS OWN BODY. THE IDEA IS, IF YOU CAN EXTRACT THE SIGNALS FAST ENOUGH, IN LESS THAN ONE-THIRD OF A SECOND OF A SUBJECT THEY COULD BE ANYWHERE ELSE IN TERMS OF SPACE LOCATION, WE COULD ALLOW THE SUBJECTS TO MOVE THESE DEVICES AND RECEIVE FEEDBACK VISUAL TACTILE AUDITORY, DOESN'T MATTER SIMULTANEOUSLY AS THE OPERATION OF THIS GOES ON. EVEN THOUGH WE STARTED USING RODENTS VERY SOON WE REALIZE THAT WE HAD TO MOVE THROUGH PRIMATES AND THAT'S WHEN I STARTED MY PRIMATE LAB AT DUKE AND I--THE IDEA WAS, TO IMPLANT WHAT YOU WENT TO SEE IN THE MOMENT IS BUNDLES OR CUBES OF MICROWIRE ERASE IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS OF THE MOTOR, SOME SENSORY AND PARIETAL CORTEX IN BOTH HEMISPHERES SIMULTANEOUSLY SO YOU COULD RECORD HUNDREDINGS OF CELLS FROM THESE ANIMALS FROM LONG PERIODS OF TIME. FROM THERE WE DEVELOP, WE ARE IN THE THIRD GENERATION OF USING IMPLANTABLE DEVICES, NOW OF COURSE YOU CAN USE 3D PRINTED CUBES TO INSERT YOUR MICROWIRES, THIS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN TERMS OF YIELD, YOU CAN NOW DEAL WITH DEVICES THAT HAVE 10 BY 10 BY 10 CONTEXT, CLOSE TO A THOUSAND CONTEXT IN EACH OF THESE CUBES THAT WE CAN IMPLANT IN UP TO 10 LOCATIONS IS THE RECORD THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAB. FIVE IN EACH HEMISPHERES AND RECORD SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AFTER FEW MONTHS OF IMPLANTATION, WHICH WAS A BIG SURPRISE, FOR US WHEN WE STARTED TO 20 YEARS AGO, THESE ARE FLEXIBLE FILAMENTS THEY'RE NOT RIGID ELECTRODES SO THEY FLEE THROUGH THE BRAIN AND AFTER A FEW WEEKS WHERE THE INFLAMMATORY REACTION AROUND THE IMPLANT IS RESOLVED THEY BECOME ATTACHED TO THE TISSUE SO THEY MOVE WITH THE TISSUE, THEY DON'T DAMAGE THE TISSUE AS RIGID AS THEY WOULD WHEN THE BRAIN IS MOVING, SO, WE GET BEAUTIFUL EXTRA CELLULAR ACTION PROTENTIALS, MONTHS, YEARS AFTER THIS IMPLANTATION, SO THE AVERAGE YIELD OVER THESE 20 YEARS AND NOW HAS BEEN NORMALIZED BY STUDIES IN MICE, RATS, OWL MONKEYS, RECESS MONKEYS AND HUMANS AND 1 SINGLE THROUGH MICRO1 IMPLANTED. I'M ROUNDING TO 1. THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE ACROSS THE SPECIES SO IF YOU PLANT 700, 800 ELECTRODES YOU ARE VERY MUCH GOING TO GET CLOSE TO 800 NEURONS RECORDED SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS IS THE LARGEST EU WE HAVE HAD SO FAR, CLOSE TO 2000 MIEWRONS, 2000 WIRES WERE IPT GREATER PLANTED IN THIS ANIMAL AND THIS THE BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THIS IMPLANTATION WHICH HAS BECOME A GREATER MODEL NOW AND YOU CAN ENCASE ALL THESE IN THE BONE AND YOU CAN ON TOP OF YOUR IMPLANTS NOW APPLY, YOU CAN SEE IN A MOMENT OUR WIRELESS MULTICHANNEL CHIPS. SO HAVE YOU ABOUT 128 CHANNELS PER CHIP, SO CAN YOU STAGGER, YOU CAN GET STACKS OF WIRELESS CHIPS SO CAN YOU DO THIS ALL WITHOUT CABLES COMING OUT OF THE HEAD OF THE ANIMAL. SO YOU CREATE THIS CONE, THIS HELMET TO PROTECT ELECTRONICS BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO MONKEY WITH BANNANA STICKING FINGERS DESTROYING $20,000 OF NIH FUNDING, SO YOU BASICALLY KEPT THIS THING AND THE MONKEYS CAN LIVE A DECADE WITH THIS IPT GREATER PLANTS. WE DON'T DO ANY SURGICAL PROCEDURE AFTER THAT. AND THE GREAT ADVANTAGE IN 2014, AND IN IN CASES I IMPLANTED A MONKEY BEFORE THE 2010 WORLD CUP IN SOUTH AFRICA ANDY ARE STILL RECORDING THIS ANIMAL, STILL RECORDING THIS ANIMAL IN 2017. WE HAD A RECORD OF 7 AND HALF YEARS IN 2 MORVEGIES IN WHICH WE RECORDED CONTINUOUSLY BECAUSE AFTER THESE RECORDINGS ARE STABILIZED, THEY BECOME VERY CONSISTENT. YOU CAN REALLY, NOT NECESSARILY RECORD THE SAME NEURON FOR 7 AND HALF YEARS BUT YOU ACTUALLY CAN FULFILL JOHN LILLY'S DREAM FROM HERE FROM NIH IN THE 50S THAT WANTED TO RECORD NEURONS FOR DECADES HE PUBLISHED A FEW PAPERS WITH THE ELECTRODES AND IT'S SO FUN TOW READ THE PAPER FROM 57 OR 58, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN BECAUSE HE CLAIMS THERE THAT HE GOT ALL AMPLIFIERS THAT EXIST IN THE NIH CAMPUS TO CORD ABOUT 50 SIGNALS. ALL AMPLIFIERS IN CAMPUS, SO NOW WE CAN RECORD THESE WITH VARIOUS SMALLING CHIPS IMPLANTED IN THE HEAD ABOUT 70 YEARS LATER. SO THE 2 MAJOR ADVANTAGES OF THIS APPROACH IS THE YIELD, YOU GET LARGE SAMPLES OF NEURONS IN THE LONGEVITY OF YOUR RECORDINGS. SO, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU, THE FIRST STUDY ON RECESS MORVEGY VERY QUICKLY AND SHOWING THAT WHEN WE HAD THE FIRST RECESS MONKEYS TRAINED TO PERFORM A BRAIN INTERFACE TASK, WE TRAIN THEM TO USE A JOY STICK TO MOVE A CURSOR IN A--CROSS CROSS THE TARGET TO GET THIS REWARD AND AWE KNOW ANYTHING WILL DO ANYTHING FOR ORANGE JUICE REWARDS AND COULD WE GET AFTER THE ENEMY STRAIN FOR A IF YOU MINUTES IN THE TASK OF THE JOY STICK COULD YOU GET THIS JOY STICK OUT AND MAKE THE MONKEY INTERACT WITH THE BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE SO EVERY TIME THE MONKEY PRODUCES THE ELECTRICAL PATTERN THAT IS RELATED TO OUR MOVEMENT, CAN WE GET HIM TO MOVE THESE ROBOTIC ARM THAT WAS IN A DIFFERENT ROOM SO THAT THE ROBOTIC ARM MOVES THE CURSOR INTO THE TARGET SO THE MONKEY CAN GET THE JUICE. NOBODY KNEW ABOUT THAT IN THE LATE 90S WHETHER THIS THING WOULD WORK. AND IT TURNED OUT THAT IT DID. I WOULDN'T BE HERE ACTUALLY IF IT DIDN'T. SO YOU SEE HERE THE MONKEY PLAYING THIS SIMPLE GAME, SHE'S GOOD WITH THIS LOW FRICTION JOY STICK, SHE'S EVEN CHEATING BEFORE THE TARGET APPEARS TRYING TO GET IT BY CHANCE BUT SHE CANNOT DO THAT BECAUSE THE TARGETING SYSTEM SET GOING TO SHOW UP IN ALL LOCATIONS, 32 LOCATIONS IN THIS SCREEN, BUT WHEN SHE CRASHES SHE GETS JUICE AND YOU CAN SEE THE HUNDRED CABLES HERE, COMING OUT OF THE AMPLANT AND A WALL OF COMPUTERS AND AMRIIN--DIMITRIIFIERS GENERATING OUTPUTS THAT ARE GOING TO A ROBOTIC ARM THAT'S TRAINED AS SHE IS PLAYING THE GAME TO TRY TO MIMIC THESE MOVEMENTS SO WE HAD A 21 COMPUTER MODELS RUNNING IN PARALLEL, TRYING TO EXTRACT 21 PARAMETER THAT WERE REROUTING TO THE 7-DEGREE ROBOT TO GET THINGS DONE AND TO OUR SHOCK THAT NIGHT WHEN WE REMOVE THE JOY STICK AND WE FACE--YOU KNOW LET THE MONKEY FACE TO GET JUICE, IT DIDN'T MATTER ANYMORE TO MOVE THE HAND BECAUSE THERE WAS NO COWS OR CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN MOVEMENT OF THE HAND AND THE CURSOR. NOW SHE HAD TO IMAGINE WHATEVER SHE COULD SO THE ROBOTIC ARM COULD MOVE THE CURSOR TO THE TARGET, IT DIDN'T TAKE TOO LONG FOR HER TO GET THERE. SHE STARTS MOVING, THE CURSOR, EVEN THE CHEATING, YOU CAN SEE THE CHEATING THERE WHICH WAS A GOOD SIGN WE'RE GETTING THINGS RIGHT AND AFTER A WEEK OF THIS PRACTICE SHE WAS PERFORMANCE THIS TASK THE SAME PROFICIENT LEVEL OR PROFICIENCY LEVEL THAT SHE WAS DOING WITH THE JOY STICK. AND THIS WAS BAKELY A BIG SHOCK TO EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE AND EVERYONE THOUGHT THIS WAS CHANGING A LOT OF STUFF. WELL WE STARTED EVOLVING IN THIS PARADIGM. I WILL SHOW YOU THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESULTS BUT I WANT TO FEET FORWARD TO SHOW YOU HOW THIS EVOLVED SO QUICKLY BECAUSE A FEW YEARS LATER ABOUT 80 YEARS LATER WE DISCOVERED THAT NOT ONLY WE COULD HAVE A BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE TO CONTROL VIRTUAL ARM TO MOVE AND EXPLORE VIRTUAL OBJECT VETERINARY RESOURCESSUAL REALITY BUT WE COULD GET ELECTRICAL SIGNALS GENERATED BY THE TACTILE TEXTURE EXPLORATION OF THESE VISUAL OBJECTS DELIVERED BACK TO THE BRAIN DIRECTLY, BYPASSING THE SCHEME, GOING DIRECTLY THROUGH MICROSTIMMULATION, TO THE PRIMERS AND SENSORY CORTEX, SO THAT THE ANIMAL COULD NOT ONLY MOVE THIS VIRTUAL ARM AND TOUCH THESE OBJECTS BUT IT COULD TELL US WHAT IS THE TEXTURE OF THE VIRTUAL OBJECTS THAT THE VIRTUAL HAND AND TOUCHING AND IN 2011 WE SHOWED THAT THIS COULD BE DONE IN A DISCREET WAY. WHAT ARE GOING TO SEE HERE, THE MONK SECONTROLLING THE VIRTUAL ARM AND THERE ARE 3 TEXTURES THAT HE CANNOT SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM BUT THEY HAVE VERY DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES, SPATIAL FREQUENCIES ON THE SURFACE AND EVERY TIME HE'S TOUCHING THIS HERE, HE'S TRYING TO FIND THE CORRECT HIGH FREQUENCY TEXTURE, AND WHEN HE FIND ITS, HE HAS TO PRESS THE CENTER OF THIS OBJECT TO GET A REWARD. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, THE ANIMAL TRIES HERE AND THERE AND EEIVETTUALLY GETS IT IMPRESSIVE AND WE SHOW HIM WITHOUT A ABOUT A WEEK OF TRAINING THIS ANIMAL COULD GET A PERFORMANCE TO USING THE FINGERTIPS TO GET THERE. JUST 2 WEEKS AGO, WE ADVANCE THIS PARADIGM FURTHER, WE PUBLISH THIS PAPER EVEN THOUGH THE DAILY BASIS THEA WAS COLLECTED IN 2012, IT TOOK US A LONG TIME TO GET THIS DONE, FINISHED AND WHAT WE SHOWED IS THAT THROUGH THIS BRAIN MACHINE, MACHINE BRAIN INTERFACE THAT,'S THE NAME WE GAVE TO THIS, YOU CAN NOW USE CONTINUOUS ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF THIS SENSORY CORTEX. SORRY. BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE SHOWING HERE DIFFERENT FROM THE PREVIOUS EXPERIMENT IS THAT THE ANIMAL CAN USE THE BRAIN TO CONTROL THE VIRTUAL ARM BUT NOW THERE ARE 2 TEXTURES NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND HE CAN CONTINUOUS EXPERIENCE THIS TEXTURES AND SELECT 1 WITH THE HIGHEST FREQUENCY. AND WE BASICALLY SHOW, THAT IF YOU RANDOMLY CHANGE THE DIFFERENCE IN TEXTURE BETWEEN THESE 2 TEXTURES THAT--SO IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU COULD EXPECT IF YOU ARE USING A FINGERTIP TO SCAN THROUGH THESE TEXTURES AND GET A DISCRIMINATION OF WHICH IS THE 1 WITH THE HIGHEST SPATIAL FREQUENCY. SO THIS IS JUST TO SHOW YOU THE STATE-OF-THE-ART OF WHAT CAN BE DONE IN MONKEYS AT THIS POINT. LET ME NOW TURN TO WHAT IS FOR ME, THE MOST IMPORTANT BASIC SCIENCE FINDINGS OF THIS 20 YEARS OF EXPERIMENTS AND THIS IS THE PRINCIPLES. THIS IS WHAT I TOLD YOU BECAME THE AXIOMS THAT WE DERIVE EXPERIMENTALLY USING MANY SPECIES FROM MICE TO HUMANS AND THEY SEEM TO BE HOLDING FOR EVERY 1 OF THESE SPECIES. I'M GOING TO FOCUS PRIMARILY HERE BECAUSE OF TIME ON DISTRIBUTOR CODING, THE FACT OF THE REPRESENTATION OF BEHAVIOR PARAMETERS CAN BE FOUND ACROSS MOST OF THE CORTEX, AND EFFECT THE INDIVIDUAL NEURONS NOT ONLY CAN EXHIBIT PLASTICITY, TO A LEVEL THAT IS VERY MUCH MORE THAN I EXPECTED ON WHEN I STARTED MY CAREER, BUT ALSO THAT IT CAN MULTITASK, THE SINGLE NEURONS EVEN IN THE PRIMARY MOTOR OR SENSORY CORTICAL AREAS WHAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY IN THE LOWEST LEVEL OF THE CORTICAL HIERARCHY, BY THE WAY I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE HIERARCHY ANYMORE BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RETRIEVE BEHAVIORIAL PARAMETERS FROM CORTICAL AREAS THROUGHOUT THESE EXPERIMENTS YOU CAN SEE IN A MOMENT BUT THE MULTITASKING IS A VERY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT THE SAME NEURON OR THE SAME ENSEMBLE BEIN INVOLVED IN MULTIPLE COMPUTATIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY AS BRAIN AND THE CORTEX IS GENERATING AN OUTCOME OR A BEHAVIOR OUTCOME, IN FACT, THIS& IS SO DRAMATIC THAT IN A FEW YEARS AGO, 3 YEARS AGO I HAD PROPOSED A MODEL FOR THE CORTEX THAT IS A CONTINUOUS MODEL, IT'S NOT ANYMORE A MOSAIC OR DISCREET AREAS BUT IT IS AN LOG CONTINUES AS IF THE CORTEX IS COMPUTING AS A WHOLE AND YOU WILL SEE WHY I SAY THAT. BUT THERE ARE 10 OF THESE PRINCIPLES, CONTEXT PRINCIPLE CONVERSATION OF FIEBD, BUDGET OF FINDING, BUDGET AND ENERGETIC, METABOLIC BUDGET AND WE HAVE FOUND IF YOU ARE RECORDING FOR MULTIPLE STRUCTURES SIMULTANEOUSLY THAT IF SOME NEURONS GO UP AND/OR A MOTOR OUTPUT ALL THE NEURONS WILL GO DOWN AT THE SAME MAGNITUDE, WHEN YOU USE SOME OF THE SPIKING, IT REMAINS HOVERING AROUND THE MEAN ACROSS THE CORTEX SO THATTA WHAT I CALL THE CONS SERVATION OF FIRING PRINCIPLE. SO THE DISTRIBUTOR STARTED VERY SIMPLY BY PLOTTING IN THE EXPERIMENT THE FIRST EXPERIMENT THAT YOU SAW, THE NUMBER OF NEURONS FROM MULTIPLE CORTICAL AREAS THEY CARRY ANY VARIANCE ABOUT THE DIFFERENT MOTOR PARAMETERS WE ARE EXTRACTING IN REALTIME FROM THE RECORDINGS TO CONTROL BRAIN IRPT FACE AND TO MY SURPRISE, WHEN I PLOTTED PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX, PRIMARY SENSORY, MOTOR AREA, DORSAL, POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX, I PUT EXTRACTING INFORMATION ABOUT ANY OF THESE PARAMETERS FROM ALL OVER THESE CORTICAL FIELDS, VERY FAR APART IN THE FRONTAL PILOT PROJECTITETTAL CIRCUIT. CLIERICALLY PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX, AND THE NEURONS IN THE PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX, CARRY MORE INFORMATION FOR NUMBER OF NEURONS SO YOU HAD MORE INFORMATION FOR THE NEURON FOR EACH OF THESE MOTOR PARAMETERS BUT LOOK AT THIS, YOU COULD FIND ENOUGH INFORMATION, SUFFICIENT INFORMATION IN TERMS OF VARIANCE FROM THE PRIMARY SENSORY, BUT POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX, YOU JUST NEEDED, I'M SORRY, YOU JUST NEEDED MORE NEURONS FROM THE POSTERIOR CORTEX TO REACH THE SAME KIND OF PERFORMANCE THAT YOU GET FOR LET'S SAY 50 NEURONS IN THE MOTOR CORTEX. MORE THAN THAT, IF YOU LOOK FROM 1 PARAMETER TO ANOTHER, HAND POSITION TO GRIPPING 4S, THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE COLORS CHANGE SO THERE IS A DEGREE OF SPECIFICITY ON TOP OF THIS DISTRIBUTED REPRESENTATION BUT ALL THESE NARROWS, THESE ARE THE SAME NARROWS FROM 1 GRAPH TO ANOTHER, THE SAME 1S IN HERE IN THE CORTEX THAT ARE CODING FOR GRIPPING FORCE, ACCORD FOR HAND POSITION, THEY DO BETTER FOR GRIPPING FORCE, NONETHELESS ALL THE STRUCTURES ARE CODING APPROXIMATE FOR ALL THESE PATHWAY GIVES RAM TERPS AT THE SAME TIME. SO WE COULD ACTUALLY CONTROL THIS BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE WITH THE POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX WHICH OTHERS LATER PROVED TO BE TRUE BY SAMPLING NOR NARROWS OR A LARGER SAMPLE NARROWS THAN YOU DO BY M1 ALONE. BUT THE BEST RESULT WAS OBTAINED WHEN YOU SIMPLE NARROWS FROM ALL THE STRUCTURES SIMULTANEOUSLY, BY THE SAME TOKEN WHEN YOU PLOTTED WHEN THE ANIMAL IS USING THE JOY STICK THERE, THE DISTRIBUTION OF 120 NEURONS RECORDED SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TUNES, SO THIS IS DIRECTION, THIS IS NEURONS, CAN YOU SEE WE RECORDED THESE NEURONS TO SHOW THE BEAUTIFUL DIAGONAL, FOR A PHENOMENA THAT IS WELL KNOWN IN OUR FIELD THAT IF YOU GET A RANDOM SAMPLE OF A CUBIC VOLUME, CUBIC MILLIMETER OF MOTOR CORTEX, YOU WILL HAVE ALL THIS BEAUTIFUL AND DIAGNOLL HERE. SO IF TURNED OUT IF THE JOY TICK IS REMOVED AND THE ANIMAL IS USING A BRAIN INTERFACE TO CONTROL THE ROBOT TO DO THE SAME TASK IT WAS DOING WITH THE JOY STICK THEN NEURONS VERY QUICKLY CHANGED THEIR TUNING TO BASICALLY BECOME TUNE TO THE DIRECTIONS OR MOVEMENT THAT,A LOWED FOR THE ROBOT TO MOVE IN SPACE. JUST A VISUAL AND TACTILE FEEDBACK WAS ENOUGH TO REPROGRAM THE TUNING FUNCTIONS OF THESE NEURONS AND BASICALLY BY ALL PURPOSES AND MEANS, THIS WAS LATER CONFIRMED BY OTHER STUDIES, AND IN FACT, STUDIES USING 2 REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX IS SUGGESTED THAT THE MOMENT YOU PUT A THIS CONTROL OF THE DEVICE IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S ROBOTIC, ELECTRONIC OR VIRTUAL. THAT DEVICE IS STIMULATED AS AN EXTENSION OF THAT PART OF THE BODY OF THE ANIMAL AND YOU GET TUNING PROPERTIES TO BECOME TUNE OF A VARIETY OF PROPERTIES RELATED TO THE MOVEMENT OF THAT DEVICE. PROFESSOR [INDISCERNIBLE] IN JAPAN HAS SHOWN THAT IN A DIFFERENT PARADIGM WITH MONKEYS USING REAKS TO GET FOOD THEY COULDN'T REACH WITH THEIR OWN ARMS THAT I HADITOUS - I RAKE TO EXTEND IT, AND IN THE PARIETAL CORTEX THEY SHOW A VERY SIMILAR CONCEPT. THEY BECAME TUNE TO THE RAKE TO COLLECT GRAPES SO THERE WAS PLASTICITY GOING ON AS THESE ANIMALS WERE USING THESE BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE AND THE TUNING PROPERTIES OF THESE WERE CHANGING BUT IF YOU GO BACK TO A SITUATION WHERE THE JOY STICK IS BACK, THIS DIAGONAL IS BACK. YOU CAN BASICALLY RETRIEVE IT IN A FEW SECONDS AS FAST AS YOU CAN RESET YOUR COMPUTERS AND DO THE MEASUREMENTS AGAIN. BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL. ONLY RECENTLY WE WENT BACK TO OUR DATA AND WE DISCOVER IN THE MID2000S THAT YOU DON'T EVEN NEED THE ANIMAL TO USE A JOY STICK TO LEARN HOW TO USE A BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE. YOU CAN BASICALLY HAVE THE ANIMAL JUST OBSERVE THOUSANDS OF TRAJECTORIES PERFORMED BY THE ACTUATOR THAT YOU WANT HIM TO CONTROL, OR IT TO CONTROL WITH THE BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE, THAT OVER TIME, IF YOU DO THAT OVER SEVERAL DAYS, YOU SEE THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR COMPUTATIONAL MODEL INCREASING MEANING THE BRAIN MACHINE PRODUCES BETTER AND BETTER MOVEMENT AS TIME GOES BY. SO JUST OBSERVING THE INTENDED BEHAVIOR WAS ENOUGH TO TRAIN THE BRAIN SOMEONE INTERFACE AND ACHIEVE ITS GOAL. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS DATA MORE CAREFULLY, WHEN YOU USE FULL MONKEY AVATARs OR A VIRTUAL ARM WHAT WE NOTICE IS THAT WHEN THE TARPGET APPEARS AND THE MONKEY HAS TO MOVE ITSELF OWN BIOLOGICAL ARM, YOU WILL SEE THIS BEAUTIFUL FIRING MODULATION OF 200 NAWROONS IN THE PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX, NOW WE--IF THE ACTUATOR IS NOT A MONKEY'S BODY BUT IS AN AVATAR OF AN ARM, THE SAME NARROWS ARE STILL FINE BUT THERE'S NO BODY MOVEMENT HERE, THERE THE MONKEY IS NOT MOVING AS YOU SAW BEFORE, THIS IS ALL DONE BY VISUAL FEEDBACK. AND THESE ARE BEHAVING PRETTY MUCH LIKE MIRROR NEURONS. THEY ARE IN PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX, FIRING LIKE PROFESSOR [INDISCERNIBLE] DESCRIBED IN THE 90S IN THE PREMOTOR VENTRAL AREA, HIGHER CORTICAL MOTOR AREA, PREMOTOR AREA AND WE CAN FIND THIS IN PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX AND PRIMARY, SO MUCH SENSORY CORTEX WHICH WAS A BIG SHOCK TO US. AND THIS WAS WHAT WE USE TO DRIVE THE BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE, THIS WAS THE KIND OF ACTIVITY THAT WAS ENOUGH TO ALLOW THIS ANIMAL TO LEARN TO CONTROL THIS AVATAR DEVICE, BUT HOW FAR COULD YOU PUSH IT? DOES IT NEED TO LOOK LOOK A MONKEY BODY, THE ACTUATOR DOES IT NEED TO BE LIKE A LIMB, LIKE A BODY OF A PRIMATE OR A HUMAN. NO? WE SOON REALIZED THAT THE MOMENT WE HAD THIS WIRELESS INTERFACE WORKING WE COULD TEST THIS IDEA BY USING ACTUATORS THAT A MONK NEUROECTODERMAL ASIA OR IN BRAZIL HAS NEVER INTERACTED WITH LIKE AN ELECTRONIC WHEELCHAIR. AND WHAT WE DID WAS TO ASK THE QUESTION, CAN THIS MONKEY FROM NOTHING LEARN TO NAVIGATE TO CONTROL 2 MOTORS, ELECTRICAL MOTORS, 1 FOR ROTATION AND 1 FROM TRANSLATION, TO ALLOW THIS--ELECTRONIC WHEELCHAIR TO NAVIGATING A ROOM AND GO TO A PLACE WHERE WE DROP GRAPES, SO IF THEY DRIVE CORRECTLY THEY CAN GET THE GRAPES AND BE RELOCATED TO A NEW POSITION IN THE ROOM AND DE NOVO FIND A NEW TRAJECTORY, I DIDN'T DO THAT. I AM NOT USING A BRAIN SOMEONE INTERFACE TO INTERRUPT MY PRESENTATION. SO, OH IS NIH ASKING ME IF I WANT INTERNET? I DON'T WANT INTERNET? SO THE REQUESTY IS CAN YOU PLACE THIS MONK NEUROECTODERMAL DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE LAB AND LET THE MONKEY FIND A NEW TRAJECTORY EVERY TIME IT NEEDS TRAJECTORY AND FIRST YOU WILL SEE THIS CAMERAOT CEILING OF THE LAB. THESE ARE 3 ORIGINAL LOCATIONS WE PLACE, WE PLACE THE ANIMAL IN THE BEGINNING OF THE TRIAL AND ANIMAL CREATE A REFRACTORY WHERE THE TARGET IS BEING DROPPED AND THEY LOVE GRAPES MORE THAN THEY LOVE JUICE, SO THIS SAY GREAT MOTIVATOR FOR THEM. SO WHAT YOU SEE FROM THE CEILING FIRST, THIS IS A WIRELESS RECORDING OF 300 NEURONS SIMULTANEOUSLY IS THAT WE PLACE THE MONKEY THERE, AND THE MONKEY DRIVES THE WHEELCHAIR TO GET THE GRAPES. NOW WE PLACE THE MONKEY IN A NEW LOCATION, AND THIS GUY FINDS A NEW WAY TO DRIVE THE WHEELCHAIR BACK TO THE TARGET TO COLLECT THE GRAPES. AND IT'S DOING THAT BY TRANSFORMING ITS BRAIN ACTIVITY INTO COORDINATE INTO A COMMAND TO ELECTRONIC WHEELCHAIR THAT OF COURSE NO REASONS MONKEY HAS DRIVEN BEFORE. YOU CAN IMAGINE, I GIVE THIS TALK IN A MEETING WITH LOTS OF COMPANY EXECUTIVES AND SELF-DRIVEN CARS AND I SAID GUYS YOU'RE DOING ALL WRONG, WE CAN GET A MONK TOW DRIVE A CAR. [LAUGHTER] THEY WERE NOT HAPPY. I CAN TELL YOU. WELL, THIS MONKEYS ARE DOING THIS BY THEMSELVES. WE ARE NOT PUSHING THEM, NOT DOING ANYTHING. WHEN WE ELECTRIC AT THE BRAINS OF THESE GUYS AND REMEMBER, MULTIPLEXING AND DISTRIBUTOR CODING IS THE PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX, I WILL REPEAT 1 MORE TIME. PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX SHOW THE REPRESENTATION. WHAT WE FIND IS PLAY CELLS, WE ACTUALLY COULD FIND PLACE FIELDS NEURONS THAT BEHAVE LIKE THE BEAUTIFUL HIPPOCAMPUS PLACE FIELDS THAT EVERYBODY TOLD ME MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THEN IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AND THEN WHEN I WAS A POST DOC AND FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS THAT YOU CAN ONLY FIND IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS, IN THE HIERARCHY, THE TOP OF THE HIERARCHY THE CORTEX, SORRY PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX, AND IT IS THERE, BEAUTIFUL. WHEN WE TRY TO PUBLISH THIS, WE PUBLISH BUT FIRST TIME WE SEND IT TO SCIENCE PEOPLE, SAY HAVE YOU CONTROL FOR CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY FUNCTION WELL I DON'T REMEMBER ANY OF THAT BEING CONTROLLED FOR THAT WHEN THEY DESCRIBE PLACE CELLS IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS, WE DIDN'T BUT NOAEVER THELESS, WEEP COULD PREDICT TRAJECTORY LIKE PEOPLE DO IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS OF HOW THEY WILL NAVIGATE THROUGH THE ROOM. PRIMARY 1 AND S1, VERY STABLE OVER DAYS. THE PLACE FIELDS VERY BEAUTIFUL, YOU DO ALL THE CONTROLS PEOPLE DO IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS, THEY STAY THERE, OR THEY SHIFT ACCORDING TO WHAT PEOPLE HAVE REPORT INDEED THE HIPPOCAMPUS LITERATURE, MULTITASKING THE SAME NEURONS CONTROL LIMP MOVEMENTS, DYNAMICS FOR THE MONKEYS LIMBS BUT THEY CAN ACQUIRE AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THEY CAN ACQUIRE PLACE FIELD LIKE CHARACTERISTICS, IF THE MONKEY'S NAVIGATING THE WHEELCHAIR ACTIVELY. IF YOU PUSH THE MONKEY PASSIVELY IN THE ROOM, YOU DON'T SEE THEM. THE MONKEY HAS TO BE CREATE THANKSGIVING TRAJECTORY TO CONTROL THE WHEELCHAIR. WELL, HOW BAD DOES IT GET, THIS MULTIPLEXING? AS YOU CAN SEE, SOON AFTER WE ACQUIRED THE CAPABILITY OF RECORDING WHIERLESSLY FROM HUNDREDS OF NEURONS IT WAS A STEP TO RECORD FROM MORE THAN 1 MONKEY SIMULTANEOUSLY BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WOULD WE SEE, IF WE ARE DEALING WITH MILLION NEURONS IN THE PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX WHEN THE MONKEYS ARE CONTROLLING BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU HAVE 2 MONKEYS NOW INTERACTING SOCIALLY, THIS GUY IS USING ITS BRAIN ACTIVITY TO DRIVE THE WHEELCHAIR AS YOU SAW BEFORE, TO ROLE COLLECT, AND THIS IS THE DRIVER OR THE DRIVER OF THE WHEELCHAIR AND THIS IS THE OBSERVER, THIS IS THE MONK THAT'S IS OBSERVING THIS GUY AND IF HE GETS HERE IN THE ALLOCATED TIME, HE GETS JUICE AS A REWARD FOR THIS GUY TO GET THE GRAPES. SO THERE'S SOMEWHAT LINKED AND THE REWARD CONTINGENCY AND A SOCIAL INTERACTION, MORE THAN THAT, WE KNOW WHO IS THE ALPHA AND WHO IS THE DELTA MONKEY IN THE COLONY SO WE CAN FLIP AND PUT THE ALPHA DRIVING FIRST OR THEN PUT IN THE DALTON WITHERSPOONA DRIVING THE CAR WHILE THE OTHER ANIMAL OBSERVES. SO LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. BOTH BRAINS ARE BEING RECORDED SIMULTANEOUSLY, AND WE ARE RECORDING FOR MULTIPLE CORTICAL STRUCTURES, THIS GUY IS DRIVING, TOOK A PICTURE--I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. MY BRAIN MAY BE CONNECTED TO ALL THESE THINGS. YEAH, IS IT WORKING NOW? SO HE'S DRIVING, HE'S GOING TO COLLECT THE GRAPES, THE MOMENT HE COLLECTS THE GRAPE THIS IS GUY IS DRINKING JUICE, OKAY? VERY SIMPLE. LOOK WHAT WE FOUND. IF YOU ARE LOOKING NOW AT THE MOTOR CORTEX OF THESE GUYS HAD'S SYNCHRONIZATION OF THE MOTOR CORTEX ACCIDENT ACCIDENT I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AND YOU CAN CLEARLY IDENTIFY THESE PERIODS--I'M SORRY--YOU CAN CLEARLY IDENTIFY THESE PERIODS AND THEN WE ASKED THE LOGICAL QUESTION, WHAT INFORMATION IS EMBEDDED IN THESE HYPER SYNCHRONIZATION STATES. WELL, FIRST OF ALL WE CAN PREDICT THE WHEELCHAIR POSITION BY LOOKING AT EITHER BRAIN. WE CAN EXTRACT WHERE THE WHEELCHAIR OF THE DRIVER IS BY LOOKING AT THE DRIVER OR PASSENGER'S BRAIN. WE CAN EXTRACT THE VELOCITY OF THE WHEELCHAIR BUT NOT THE ACCELERATION, BUT MORE SHOCKING THAN ANYTHING IS THAT WE CAN DETECT SOCIAL RANK AND SOCIAL PROXIMITY BETWEEN THESE ANIMALS. SO IF THE ALPHA MONKEY IS DRIVING THIS CAR AND GETS TO ABOUT A METER, 2-METERS TO THE OBSERVER THAT IS A LOWER RANKING MONKEY, THE HYPER SYNCHRONIZATION REACHES ITS PEAK. IF IT'S THE OPPOSITE, THE LOWER RANKING MONKEY DRIVING TO THE ALPHA MONKEY, YOU DON'T SEE AS MUCH. SO YOU CAN TELL, WHO IS THE DRIVER, SOCIAL POSITION OF THE DRIVER AND THE COLONY AND YOU CAN TELL HOW CLOSED THEY ARE AND BY THE WAY, 1 AND HALF TO 2-METER SYSTEM PRETTY RESEARCH THE RANGE OF A RECESS MONKEY TO THE MAP, OR THE OTHER MONK TOW CARESS THE OTHER MONKEY SOPHISTICATEDY THEIR DISTANCE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR DEFINING HOW YOU RELATE TO ANOTHER MONKEY IN A COLONONY. SO THIS IS PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX, SO FAR YOU HAVE SEEN KEENAMATICS, PLACE FIELDS, HAVE YOU SEEN SOCIAL RANKING, I HAVE 1 MORE THING TO TELL YOU BEFORE I SHIFT TO THE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AND THAT IS THAT YOU CAN MULTIPLEX REWARD AND REWARD EXPECTATION AND MISMATCH AND REWARD WITH THE SAME NEURONS THAT YOU JUST SAW. SO IF YOU HAVE A MONK THAT'S IS DOING A VERY SIMPLE TASK, JUST MOVING EITHER MOVING OR OBSERVING THE MOVEMENT OF VIRTUAL HAND GOING TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN SPACE, AND ACCORDING TO THE COLOR OF THE TARGET, THE MONKEY IS AWARE THAT YOU ARE GOING--HE'S GOING TO GET AN EARLY-LATE REWARD. SO THE BLUE IS THE EARLY, THE PLURIBU IS THE--IS THE LATE REWARD. WELL NOW WE'RE RECORDING FROM MULTIPLE AREAS IN 3 MONKEYS AND WHAT DO YOU SEE? SO WHEN THE HAND IS MOVING OR WHEN THE ANIMAL IS JUST OBSERVING A VIRTUAL HAND, THE RESULT IS THE SAME. YOU BASICALLY SEE NAWRONS THAT CAN CODE FOR POSITION AND VELOCITY AT THE SAME TIME& THEY'RE ANTICIPATING THE REWARD AMOUNT THAT'S ABOUT TO COME. THIS IS THE SAME CELLS, ABOUT 30% OF THEM CAN MULTIPLEX. SOME CELLS CAN JUST DO KINEMATICS SOME CELLS CAN ONLY DO REWARD EXPECTATION BUT YOU CAN HAVE BOTH IN THE SAME NARROWS ISOLATED. MORE THAN THAT IF YOU PLAY A TRICK WITH THE MONKEYS AT THE TIME WITH THE REWARD YOU DON'T DELIVER AND AWARD, YOU SUPPRESS THE REWARD, THIS IS WHAT IS NARROWS WILL DO. THIS IS CALLED THE REWARD PREDICTION ERROR. THEY WILL INDICATE THAT THEY DIDN'T GET WHAT THEY EXPECTING IN FACT, THEY GOT NOTHING. IF YOU NOW GIVE DOUBLE REWARD ISSUES THE REWARD ERROR GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IS TELL BY LOOKING AT THE MOTOR CORTEX, WHETHER THIS MONKEY GO THE WHAT HE EXPECTED IN TERMS OF REWARD OR DIDN'T GET ANYTHING. AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN TELL WHETHER THE MONKEY IS MOVING THE ARM OR JUST OBSERVING THE VIRTUAL ARM DOING THE TASK. PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX, I SHOULD EMPHASIZE. OKAY? WELL WHEN WE SAW ALL THIS, WE REALIZE THAT BMIs WERE HERE AND NOT JUST TO PLAY THESE BEAUTIFUL TRICKS AND GET US TO FIGHT OVER WHAT IS THE CORTEX DOING AFTER ALL, BUT WE COULD ACTUALLY TRANSLATE AND THIS WAS THE TOPIC, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PRONOUNCE THIS NAME CORRECTLY, I WAS THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF NIH, SWRER HEWNY WHO I--ZERHE'RE OUNI, WAS ARK NOUNSING THEY WERE& GOING TO DO TRANSLATION SCIENCE, I WAS A BASIC SCIENTIST SO I SEND MY PROPOSAL HERE FOR PIONEER AWARD AGAINST ALL THE JUDGMENT OF EVERYBODY I CONSULTED FROM MY FRIENDS AT DUKE, EVERYBODY, SAID YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS, YOU ARE A BASIC SCIENTIST, I PROPOSED A DECADE BEFORE, IF YOU HAVE A PARALYZED PEOPLE WITH A LESION ON THE SPINAL CORD, THEY CAN STILL PRODUCE THE MOTOR SIGNALING BUT THEY CANNOT TRANSMIT THESE SIGNALS DOWN TO THE PERIPHERY. WHAT ABOUT IF WE USE A BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE TO GO,A ROUND AND BASICALY CONTROL WITH THE BRAIN AND CO PROVIDE FEEDBACK BACK TO THE BRAIN, I ACTUALLY DID THIS IN THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL HERE, I SEBD A MONKEY EQUIVALENT TO THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE I WAS BT BRAVE ENOUGH BUT I DID THE SECOND BEST THING AFTER SENDING MY GRANT TO [INDISCERNIBLE], I WENT TO MY HOME COUNTRY, BRAZIL AND SINCE I KNEW BRAZIL HAD BEEN AWARDED THE WORLD CUP FOR 2014 I HAD A CHANCE FOR 2 YEARS CHANCE TO BE IN THE ROOM IF WITH THE PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL WHO WANTED TO DO SOMETHING INTERESTING FOR THE OPENING CEREMONY OF THE WORLD CUP AND I BASICALLY SAID WHAT ABOUT IF WE HAVE IN THE OPENING CEREMOY A SCIENTIFIC DEMONSTRATION IN WHICH A PARALYZED BRAZILIAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR USING FIRST ROBOTIC EXOSKELETON CONTROLLED BY THE BRAIN TO DELIVER THE OPENING KICK OF THE WORLD CUP TO AN AUDIENCE OF 1.2 BILLION PEOPLE AND SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID WHERE DO I SIGN? SO IT WAS THE BEST PEER REVIEW I EVER GOT IN NIGH CAREER. AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE--YOU KNOW LEARN FROM THAT. SO I GOT TO LEAD THIS PROJECT AND OF COURSE WHEN I LEFT WITH MY ONLY TIE I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE, I GOT MARRIED AND I GOT THIS GRANT FROM THIS TIE, I LEFT IN THE FAME FOWS SQUARE IN BRAZILLIA, CALLED THE 3 POWERED SQUARE BECAUSE HAVE YOU THE SUPREME COURT, PRESIDENTIAL PALLANCE AND CONGRESS, I SAT ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY THERE, THE EQUIVALENT TO OURS HERE AND I SAID I HAVE NO TEAM, I HAVE NO PATIENT, I HAVE NO EXO, SO I START CALLING MY FRIENDS. AND LUCKILY I HAVE A FEW. AND THE CALL WAS PRETTY MUCH LIKE THIS: WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE GORDON, GORDOON MY BEST FRIEND, WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ON THE FIELD, ON THE OPENINGER CEREMONY OF THE WORLD CUP IN 2014. AND--ALLOWS PARAPLEGIC PERSON TO KICKOFF WORLD CUP, NOT ONLY BY BEING ABLE TO KICK THE BALL BY FILLING THE IMPACT--SOUND WAS SILENCE, NO SOUND, AND THE ANSWER WAS INEVITABLY ISN'T THERE AN EASIER WAY TO GET TICKETS TO IN THE GAME? I SAID NO THAT'S THE BRAZILIAN WAY SO WE WILL DO IT THAT WAY AND TO CREDIT ALL THESE AMAZING PEOPLE CAME FROM 25 COUNTRIES--AND WHY ACTUALLY DID IT. AND FOR THAT WE HAD TO GO TO A REGISTRY OF SPINAL CORD INJURIES IN BRAZIL, 65,000 PATIENTS AND SELECT 8. EIGHT CHRONIC COMPLETELY PARALYZED PEOPLE, 3-14 YEARS OF LESION IN THE SPINAL CORD NO SIGN OF ANY KIND OF NEUROLOGICAL FUNCTION BELOW THE REGION AND WHAT WE DID, IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW WITH THE MONKEYS. FIRST BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN PARALYZED FOR SO LONG, WHEN YOU TRY TO RECORD EEG, AND EVOKE A MOTOR INTENTION RESPONSE, YOU COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING BECAUSE THE CORTEX HAD FORGOTTEN LITERALLY WHAT IT IS TO WALK, WHAT IT IS TO HAVE LEGS WHAT IT IS HAVE TO DIDY VIER TO MOVE, AND PUT THEM IN A VIRTUAL EMBED IN THEM THROUGH VISION AND TACTILE FEEDBACK WHAT IS TO WALK, VIRTUAL AVATAR THAT WAS CONTROLLED BY EEG, NO IMPLANTS. NONINVASIVE BMI. LATER WE MOVE THEM TO OFF THE SHELF ROBOTIC WALKERS YOU CAN GET AND FINALLY, WE GOT THEM TO CONTROL WHAT WE--AS TD BABY HERE AND HERE'S THE COCKPIT, THIS IS WHERE THE PATIENT IS PLACED. IT'S SORT OF SUSPENDED, IT IS& USING EEG TO CONTROL CENTRAL COMPUTER, PROCESSING UNIT THAT IS IN THE BACK PACK THAT IS CONTROLLING THE ELECTRICAL HYDRAULIC MOTORS SO THAT THIS MOVEMENT IS VERY SMOOTH. WE USE HIGH GRADE OIL TO GENERATE VERY SMOOTH MOVEMENT. WE DEVELOPED THESE SENSORS FOR US, FOR THE RECEPTIVE FEEDBACK TO THESE PATIENTS AND THESE ARE APPLIED TO KEY POSITIONS IN THIS CASE, THE SURFACE OR THE FEET, THESE ARE EMBEDDED POSITION AND PRESSURE, AND TEMPERATURE SENSORS THAT WHEN THE PATIENT TOUCHES THE GROUND GENERATES A WAVE OF PRESSURE THAT IS DELIVERED TO THE ONLY PLACE IN THE BODY THAT WE COULD GUARANTEE THESE PATIENTS WOULD HAVE ANY TACTILE KIND OF CELL PHONE VIBRATOR ELEMENTS TO CREATE A WAVE OF TACTILE FEEDBACK THROUGH THE FOREARMS OF THE PATIENTS. SO YOU CAN SEE HERE, 1 OF OUR PATIENTS TRAINING HER BRAIN TO RECOGNIZE DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF SURFACES LIKE GRASS, SAND AND HOT ASPHALT. SHE'S BASICALLY SEEN THIS SCENE OF AN AVATAR WALKING THE SOCCER FIELD AND SHE'S MOVING HER HANDS TO FIND THE BEST COMBINATION OF MAGNITUDE AND VELOCITY OF THE WAVES OF PRESSURE SHE'S RECEIVING ON HER ORMS SO EFFICIENT PATIENT DID THAT TO PERSONALIZE THE PARAMETERS ASSOCIATE WIDE DIFFERENT TEXTURES OF THE GROUND. FUNNY ENOUGH WHEN THEY START DOING THIS, THEY DEVELOP VIVID PHANTOM SENSATIONS OF THEIR LEGS SO WE FOUND A WAY TO INDUCE ARTIFICIALLY, SENSATION, EACH 1 OF THEM HAD A DIFFERENT 1 AND WAS SOMEWHAT RELATED TO THE ORIGINAL INJURY THAT THEY EXPERIENCE IN A DECADE OR MORE BEFORE. SO WE LITERALLY USE THEIR BRAINS TO ADJUST THE PARAMETERS OF THE FEEDBACK THAT THEY THE EXO WOULD PROVIDE TO THEM. SO THIS IS THE TIMES DURING PERIOD IS THE FIRST DAY THAT 1 OF THESE PATIENTS WOWK IN THE LAB, USING EEG TO CONTROL THE MOTORS OF THE EXO. HE HAS THE SENSORS IN THE FEED SO SHE'S RECEIVING TACTILE FEEDBACK IN THE FOREARMS AND SHE'S LOOKING TO A VERY BIG MIRROR BECAUSE THE VISUAL FEEDBACK WE BELIEVE WAS REINFORCING HIM BEING AGAIN UPRIGHT AND WALKING BY HIMSELF. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE SOME LIGHTS POPPING HERE IS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM ISSUES THE EEG BASED BMI IS INFORMING HIM OF THE DECISIONS HE IS TAKING, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, AND RIGHT BECAUSE WE REALIZE THE PATIENTS LEARN TO ALTER NADE TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT HEMISPHERE TO CONTROL THE LEGS SO THEY CONTROL A RYTHIC WALKING SO THIS A PATIENT WHO IS THE T-6 AFTER 6 YEARS, WALK BY HIMSELF. AND YOU CAN SEE HIS CONCENTRATION, HIS FOCUS AND WE'RE BROADCASTING THIS TO ALL THE LABS AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAD PARTICIPATED AND I CAN TELL YOU NOT EVEN THE SWISS COULD RESIST, THEY CRY, EVERYBODY BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN REHAB, SPINAL CORD RESEARCH FOR 30-40 YEARS AND THEY'VE NEVER SEEN A PERSON WALK AGAIN WITH WITH A SPINAL CORD INJURY LIKE THAT. AND I DON'T NEED TO SAY ANYTHING, YOU JUST LOOK AT HIS FACE. WELL I SAW THIS 8 TIMES AS I SAID, EACH OF THE 8 PATIENTS BECAME PROFICIENT IN 3 MONTHS TO ACTUALLY DELIVER THE KICK BUT ONLY 1 GUY COULD DO IT. SO THIS IS JULIAN O PINTO, YOU HEARD BEFORE, 29 YEAR-OLD, T-4 COMPLETE SPINAL CORD INJURY, ATHLETE BEFORE, PARAATHLETE NOW, WENT TO THE OLYMPICS BEFORE, HE'S GOING TO MAKE THE BRAZILIAN TEAM FOR TOKYO, HERE I CAN SHOW YOU THE IMAGES OF THE FIELD BECAUSE FIFA WANTED TO SELL THIS TO ME BY A PRICE THAT NO SCIENTIST CAN JUSTIFY, THAT MAY EXPLAIN WHERE HALF THE PEOPLE I DEALT WITH ARE HERE WHEN I STAY ON VACATION ON KD--SALLY BASICALLY BUT I HAD THE SECOND BEST THING, YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE HAD THE SWISS BODY GARD GUARDS SURCHING US GOING TO THE STADIUM AND THE FIELD YOU COULD NOT HAVE ANYTHING WITH YOU IN BRAZIL, THERE ARE SPL BRAZILIAN NEUROSCIENTISTS ON THE TEAM AND BRAZILIAN NEUROSCIENTISTS CAN FIND A WAY TO HIDE A CELL PHONE THAT NO SWISS BODYGUARD CAN IMAGINE, IT'S POSSIBLE. WE DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THE LAST ESTABLISHMENT THAT JULIAN O MADE BEFORE HE WENT TO THE FIELD TO DELIVER THE KICK. SO WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THAT WHEN THE LIGHTS DEEP BLUE OR LIGHT BLUE IS BECAUSE HE PUTS HIS ARMS ON THE ARM REST, THE EEG TAKES CONTROL FOR THE WHOLE MOVEMENT. WHEN YOU SEE GREEN ANDIOLE O FROM THE ARM AND HEAD TOWARDS THE LEG IT'S BECAUSE HE'S READY TO MAKE THE DESIKS TO COCK THE LEG AND KICK THE BOWEL BALL. AND 1 OF MY STUDENTS PUT A BALL THERE AND THE REST IS HISTORY. SO JULIAN O IS NOW MAKING A DECISION, READY TO GO, THE BALL WILL BE PLACENTAISED AND HE KICK THE BALL. WHAT HE DIDN'T KNOW, WE DIDN'T DO HERE, IN THE RAMP GOING TO THE STADIUM, THERE IS 75,000 SCREAMING BRAZILIANS ON THE STADIUM IS 1.2 BILLION PEOPLE WATCHING THIS. SO WE'RE IN THE RAMP AND JULIAN O DOESN'T KNOW WHEN HE WENT TO THE FIELD WE TURN ON ANOTHER SENSOR ON THE TOES. ON THE HAPTICK DISPLAY, SO WHEN WE'RE CELEBRATING WITH HIM, THE MOST AMAZING THING I HEARD IN THAT MOMENT, HE WAS NOT SCREAMING I DID IT, I DID IT, I MOVED, HE WAS SAYING I FELT THE BALL. THAT WAS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE FOR A GUY WHO HAD BEEN 9 YEARS PARAPLEGIC, NOT MOVING, NOT WALKING NOT TOUCHING ANYTHING WITH THE FEET. SO WE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS THE END OF THE STORY AT 1.2 BILLION PEOPLE SAYING IT WAS OKAY, IT WAS FINE FOR US BUT IT WAS NOT. A MONTHAR THE WORLD CUP IN BRAZIL, YOU HAVE TO DO NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION FOR THE IRB EVERY 3 MONTHS, DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH A SPINAL CORD INJURY PATIENT, 10 YEARS HISTORY NOTHING HAPPENING& YOU HAVE TO DO IT SO WE HAVEEUR INTERNATIONAL TEAM EXAMINED THE PATIENTS AND SUDDENLY JULIAN O WHO WAS A T4, ON JUNE 12, ON JUVENILE HE WAS A T11. WHEN WE DID THE PIN TRICK TEST FOR TACTILE SENSITIVITY HE HAD REGAINED IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS 7 SEGMENTS, 7 DERMA TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS, HE COULD FEEL THINGS UP DOWN FROM HERE, THAT WAS SHOCKING ENOUGH. SO WE DID PATIENTS IN JULY 2014, THEY HAD GAIN ON AVERAGE 5 DERM - TELOMERES, WE KEPT TRACKING THESE GUYS FOR 28 MONTHS WITHOUT TELLING ANYTHING BECAUSE WE COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS HAPPENING. THIS IS THE CURVE OF THE EVOLUTION OF INCREASED GAIN OF DERMA TOMES, OVER TIME, AND THE AVERAGE OF THE 10 DERMA TELOMERES, JULIAN O COULD GAIN 15 SO WE COULD TOUCH HIS TOES AND WE COULD TELL WHICH TOE ON EACH FEET WE ARE TOUCHING. WELL WHEN I SAW THAT, OF COURSE, I REALIZED FROM WAY BACK IN MEDICAL SCHOOL THAT IF YOU SEE ANY TACTILE, YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR MOTOR, WE STARTED RECORDING EMGs ON THESE GUYS. IN THE BEGINNING IN THE LEGS BELOW THE LEVEL OF DELETION, THERE WAS NOTHING, SUDDENLY, 12 MONTHS AFTER THE TRAINING IS STARTED. WE COULD SEE VOLUNTARY MOTOR CONTRACTIONS HAPPENING BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE LESION. ALL THE WAY DOWN AND WHAT IS THE END RESULT OF THAT. HOW DOES IT LOOK LIKE? WELL THIS IS 1 PATIENT. WE USUALLY DO A TEST, YOU KNOW VERY WELL, YOU SUSPECTED ON THE 0 G, THE GUY, YOU LEAVE THEM FLOATING IN THE AIR AND YOU ASK, TRY TO WALK. OF COURSE, 99, HUNDRED% OF THE TIME BEFORE THIS THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING, THEY RECORDED THE BY O. WELL WE DID THIS TEST, 12 MONTHS AFTER THE TRAINIG STARTED. SIX MONTHS AFTER THE WORLD CUP KICK, AND THE FIRST PATIENT DID THIS TO US? THIS IS A T-1114 YEARS OF AGE OF COMPLETE PARALYSIS AND SUDDENLY PROUS DOOING A COMPOUND MOVEMENT OF THE RIGHT LEG, REPEATEDLY, I CALL HER THE BALLERINA BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A PLEAU OF A BALLERIN ON, AND I ASK HER TO DO THAT FOR AN HOUR AND WE WOULD MOVE HER BACK UNTIL FATIGUE, SO WE KEPT QUIET, WAITED A YEAR, REDID EXAMINATIONS IN ALL PATIENTS AND THIS IS THE SAME PATIENT AIER LATER, WITH A LOT OF EMG CABLES NOW SHOWING UP AND I ASKED HER TO DO THE SAME THING, 13 YEARS AFTER ORIGINAL LESION AND SHE FIRST DID WHAT YOU JUST SAW, SHE MOVED THE RIGHT LEG. BUT SUDDENLY, SHE MOVED THE LEFT. SO WE MOVE HER BACK, WE REPEATED THIS TASK FOR ABOUT 20-30 TIMES AND SHE COULD BASICALLY WALK IN SUPPORT. WITH SUPPORT, BODY- WHAT IS THE END RESULT OF ALL OF THIS? WE STARTED WITH 8 COMPLETE, 7 ASIA, 8 PATIENTS IN 1 ASIA, B, THIS MEANS COMPLETE PARALYSIS BELOW OF THE LEVEL OF THE SPINAL CORD INJURY, ASIA B MEANS A BIT OF SENSITIVITY AROUND THE LESION SITE AND AS TIME WENT BY, BY THE END OF 28 MONTHS 1 PATIENT DROP OUT, BECAUSE HE MOVE OUT OF SAO P A ULO, BUT THE OTHER PATIENTS ALL PROGRESS TO BECOME ASIA Cs WHICH IS PARTIAL PARAPLEGIA, NOT ONLY DID THEY REGRAIN MOTOR CONTROL OF SOME DEGREE OF MOTOR CONTROL OF THEIR LEGS, TACTILE SENSITIVITY BUT I ALSO RECOVERED AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IN THE SAME DERMA TELOMERES THAT THEY REGAIN TACTILE SENSITIVITY SO PATIENTS THAT COULD NONAPOPTOTIC THE HAVE THE CONTROL RECOVER A SIGNIFICANT GERONTOLOGYSTS GREE OF BLADDER CONTROL, SPHINCTER CONTROL, SEXUAL FUNCTIONS 1 OF THE PATIENTS YOU SAW PLAYING WITH THE VIRTUAL REALITY, SHE RECOVERED SO MUCH SENSITIVITY, DEEP SENSITIVITY THAT SHE BECAME PREGNANT AND HE FELT ENTIRE PREGNANCY SHE FELT THE TRON TRACTIONS, BABY KICKING SO SHE RECOVERED AFTER 13 YEARS ENOUGH VISCERAL SENSITIVITY TO DELIVER A BABY BOY. SO A FEW MONTHS AFTER THAT, WE REACHED OUT SO FAR A NONINVASIVE CHANNEL ELECTRICAL STIMULATION TECHNIQUE TO DELIVER A BUMP OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY TO THE MUSCLES OF THE LEGS TO SEE IF WE COULD MAKE THIS PATIENTS EVEN MORE AUTONOMOUS AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN 3 OF THESE PATIENTS. WHAT YOU SEE HERE, THEY DON'T NEED THE EXOANYMORE, THEY CAN USE THE BRAIN TO INTERFACE TO TRIGGER ELECTRICAL STIMULATION TO TRIGGER THE MUSCLES AND THIS IS A PATIENT ASIA A, WHEN WE STARTED. T6, 6 YEARS OF LESION, THIS IS THE FIRST SESSION USING THIS FUNCTIONAL EELECTRICITYRICAL STIMULATION, 12 CHANNELS, 6 IN EACH LEG, HE NEEDS ABOUT 50% OF BODY CONTROL OF BODY SUSPENSION AND JUST THIS LITTLE CARD, TEN DOLLARS CARD ALUMINUM CARD, AFTER 9 DAYS, HE STARTS BECOMING MORE AUTONOMOUS, HE DOESN'T NEED PHYSICAL THERAPIST ANYMORE TO HELP HIM WALK. SO, 1 OF THESE GUYS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ABOUT 5000 STEPS USING THIS SYSTEM. SO WE JUST REPORTED THIS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR SUGGESTING THAT AFTER ALL THIS PROCESS OF RECOVERY, PARTIAL NEUROLOGICAL RECOVERY IF YOU PROVIDE A FURTHER BUMP WITH THE ELECTRICAL CURRENTS BEING DELIVERED IN A WAVE IS NOT AS SIM ALL TAINIOUS IS THE WAVE ACROSS THE LEG MUSCLES YOU CAN GET A HIGHER DEGREE OF AUTONOMY, AUTONOMY FOR THESE GUYS. YOU MAY BE ASKING MYSELF HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN. THESE WERE DIAGNOSED AS ASIA A, COMPLETE PARAPLEASIA, 10 YEARS, AND THEY HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY SEEN BY VERY GOOD PHYSICIANS TO CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS OVER A DECADE. ETERN OUT THERE WAS A VERY FORGOTTEN PAPER IN THE LATE 60S, 69 BY PROFESSOR [INDISCERNIBLE] IN AUSTRALIA, WAS THE ONLY FAZ FAR AS I CAN TELL THE ONLY GUY WODID A LONG-TERM STUDY AFTER PEOPLE PASSED AWAY OF NORMAL CAUSES, 1200 PARAPLEGICS ASIA-A PARAPLEGICS HE LOOK AT THE SPINAL CORD OF THESE PEOPLE AFTER THEY DIE OF NORMAL CAUSES HE FOUND IN 65% OF THESE PATES THERE IS BETWEEN 2 AND 25% OF CONNECTIVITY DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY'RE COMPLETELY PARALYZED AND CLASSIFIED CLINICALLY AS ASIA-A PATIENTS. WELL, WE DECIDED MRIs OF OUR PATIENTS AND LOW AND BELOCALED, WE FOUND IN HALF OF THEM SOME RESIDUAL CONNECTIVITY OF THE SPINAL CORD. SO THE HYPOTHESIS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THAT BY INDUCING TRAINING OF VIRTUAL REALITY AND THE BRAIN INTERFACE, WE REKINDLE THE MOTOR CORTEX TO GENERATE COMPLEX PATTERNS OF LOCOMOTION, THEY WERE TRANSMITTED SOMEHOW BY WHATEVER WAS LEFT IN THE SPINAL CORD, BUT THE SAME TOKEN AS THESE GUYS BEGUN WALKING AGAIN, THEY RECEIVE PROPRIMATES O CEPTIVE FEEDBACK THAT, LOW THEM TO BASICALLY TRIGGER THE CORTEX WITH INFORMATION COMING FROM THE LEGS IN ADDITION TO THE FEEDBACK WE PROVIDED AND THERE WAS ENOUGH FOR CORTICAL AND SPINAL CORD PLASTICITY TO TAKE PLACE AND ALLOW FOR THIS PARTIAL RECOVER TOW HAPPEN. THAT'S THE HYPOTHESIS. I JUST WANT TO FINISH TO SHOW YOU THAT THIS IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE IF YOU WORK FOR SPINAL CORD INJURIES, CERTAINLY WE ARE HAVE A SHOT OF DOING THAT IN STROKE VICTIMS, INFACT THERE ARE LOTS OF STUDIES WITH BRAIN AND INTERFACE INTIEWSING SOME LEVEL RECOVERY IN STROKE VICTIMS BUT I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING OUT OF THE BOX THAT ONLY CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF THIS GLOBAL CONTINUOUS VIEW OF THE BRAIN AS A DYNAMIC ANALOGUE COMPUTER OR GANNAIC AN LOG COMPUTER. TEN YEARS AGO, MY STUDENTS CAME TO MY OFFICE AND I EALZ LED MY STUDENTS TO WHATEVER THEY WANT AND MOST OF THE TIME I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. AND THEY CAME TO ME, AND SAID, LOOK, LOOK AT THIS, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE ARE DOING, I SAID WHERE ARE YOU WORKING ON EPILEPSY AGAIN. WE FINISHED THIS YEARS AGO, WE DISCOVERED THAT THE THRI GEMINAL NERVE CAN BE ANTIEASURE AS GOOD AS SEEDSURE TO TIMMULATE THAN THE VEGAS NERVE AND WE'RE DONE WITH THAT. THIS IS NOT SEIZURE, THIS IS CLEAR, A TYPICAL PATTERN OF HYPER SYNCHRONIZATION OF THE BACK BETA BEND. THIS IS [INDISCERNIBLE] PARKINSONIAN MOUSE MODEL AND WE'RE RECORDING ALL OVER THE BRAIN AND WE FIND THIS PATTERN ALL OVER THE BRAIN. IF I SAID IF YOU FIND THAL, I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT PARKINSON'S BUT I'M TELLING YOU THIS IS--EPILEPTIC SEIZURE, LET'S TREAT PARKINSON AS IF IT WERE A SEIZURE. WE STIMULATE THE NERVE AND THEY WERE COMPLETELY FROZEN BECAUSE THEY'RE DEFLEETED 90% OF THE DOPAMINE SO THEY'RE--YOU WILL SEE IN A MOMENT, WELL, WE STIMULATED I TRI GEMINAL NERVE, I SAID WELL THAT WILL DO IT LET'S STEMMULATE THE DORSAL COLUMN OF THIS SPINAL CORD EVERYWHERE, AND LOW AND BEHOLD IF YOU DO THAT A HIGH FREQUENCY, THE SEIZURES DISAPPEAR AND THESE GUYS MOVE INSTANTANEOUSLY. NO MATTER HOW BAD THE DEPRIVATION OF DOPAMINE IS, SO THIS IS 1 OF THESE MICE, HE'S IN THE CORNER HERE, SHAKING, HE'S FROZEN BECAUSE DEPLETION HAS BEEN DRAMATIC REDUCTIONARTIC OF DOPAMINE, THIS IS SWEET WATER HE WANTS TO DRINK THE SWEET WATER BUT CERTAINLY HE HAS NO HOPE IN THIS STATE TO CROSS THE CAGE TO GET HERE. BUT IN 1 SECOND. WE ARE GOING TO BASICALLY--IN 7-SECONDS WE WILL START STIMMULING THE DORSAL SPINAL CORD AT 150-HERTZ. AND LOW AND BEHOLD, THAT'S A DIFFERENT MOUSE. HE BASICALLY IS UNFROZEN AND HE CAN GO HERE AND DRINK THE WATER AND AS LONG AS WE CAN GET THIS GUY UNDER STIMULATION, HE WILL DO THAT. IN FACT WE DISCOVERED THAT WE DEPARTMENT EVEN NEED TO KEEP THE STIMULATION GOING ON, 1 HOUR OF STIMULATION EVERY 48 HOURS WOULD GET THIS GUY VERY HAPPY AND GOING AROUND. WELL, I APPROXIMATE UBIQUITINNATIONLISHED, THIS DISCOVERED SCIENCE, MONK SKPE BAKUGAN STUDIES AND PEOPLE SAY OH THIS IS JUST MICE, WELL, SOME PEOPLE PICK IT UP. MY FRIENDS, THE DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSURGERY AT UNIVERSITY, MY ALMA MATER, SINCE I PLAY IN THE SOCCER TEAM 30 YEARS AGO, THEY BELIEVE IN ME, THEY TRUST ME, SCORED VERY GOOD GOALS FOR THAT TEAM SO THEY GOT 1 OF TYPICAL SPINAL CORD STIMULATORS IMPLANTED IN THE SAME LOCATIONS WE DID IN MICE, TRANSITION FROM THE CERVICAL TO THORACIC SPINAL CORD, USE THE SAME PARAMETERS WE DID AND THEY LOOK AT TERMINAL PARKINSON IN PATIENTS, POST DBS, IN PLANT, DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION, THIS SAY GIT FREEZING PATIENTS THAT CANNOT WALK ANYMORE, THEY'RE COMPLETELY FROZEN ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN, THESE GUYS ARE--WITHOUT STIMULATION,OT RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN THEY'RE HAVING SPINAL CORD STIMULATION, HIGH FREQUENCY LIKE WE DID FOR THE MICE. AND SO THIS LADY COULD BARELY STAND UP. AND SHE CAN BARELY WALK AND AFTER THE STIMULATION IS ON, SHOOY CAN MOVE. THERE ARE 4 CASES IN THIS STUDY. THERE ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED PATIENTS IN THIS THAT HAVE DONE THIS EXPERIMENTALLY AND IT'S WORKING. ALL THE REPORTS PUBLISHED SHOW THAT IT'S WORKING. SO THIS SAY 20-METER TASK WHERE SHE HAS TO WALK 20-METERS, AND YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFICULTY HERE, SHE NEEDS HELP, TO EXTEND TO KEEP UP, AND HERE WE HAVE A LITTLE STICK, SHE'S WALKING. I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU THE SECOND PATIENT BECAUSE HE'S READY TO GO TO THE SOCCER FIELD AND IT'S A SHOCK TO ME BECAUSE HE WAS A DEEP, DEEPLY FROZEN PARKINSONIAN. SAME THING, ON THE LEFT SIDE, IS WITHOUT STIMULATION, DBS IS ON BY THE WAY, DB S DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR GAIT FREEZING AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW. SO LOOK AT THIS GUY. NO SPINAL CORD STIMULATION, SPINAL CORD STIMULATION. STRIDE LENGTH INCREASED BY 5 OKAY? AND THE EFFECTS SO FAR HAS BEEN FOLLOWED UP FOR 2 YEARS, NOT IN THIS STUDY, BUT IN OTHER STUDY BUT IT'S GOING ON, AND STILL YOU DON'T NEED TO STIMULATE CONTINUOUSLY. CAN YOU STIMULATE 1 DAY, HAVE 2 DAYS WITHOUT STIMULATION, GET BACK, GET AN HOUR OF STIMULATION. QUEE HAVE NOW PUBLISHED A SERIES OF PAPERS IN THE FINE SALIVA--SALIVA CORD STIMULATION, I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BOTHER WITH THAT BUT UNTREATABLE MODELS OF EPILEPSY, CHRONIC EPILEPSY, WE DO SPINAL CORD STIMULATION WE HAVE REDUCED THE SEIZURES IN RATS BY 40%. SO IT CAN BE THAT EPILEPSY IS MORE THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT. AND I LEAVE YOU THIS SUGGESTION BECAUSE THESE ARE ABOUT TO BE PUBLISHED I HOPE, THAT EPILEPSY MAY BE THE COMMON PHYSIO PATHOLOGICAL PATHWAY OF A HUGE NUMBER OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND NO WONDER MOST OF THE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THESE DISORDERS ARE ANTISEIZURE DRUGS, PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHY THEY WORK, BY SCHIZOPHRENIA, MAYBE INDEPENDENTLY OF THE REGIONAL CAUSE, GENETICS, CELLULAR, I DON'T KNOW. TO MANIFEST ITSELF IN SYMPTOMS AND IN BIG DETERIORATION AND NEURONAL FUNCTION YOU NEED A MECHANISM TO DESTROY NEWONS VERY QUICKLY AND FOR ME THAT IS EPILEPSY. EPILEPSY HAPPENING, DIFFERENT COMOPPOSITE BEHAVIORIAL PHENOTYPE INTENSITYS OF BRAIN. DEPENDING ON WHICH CIRCUIT IS RECRUITED, WHICH FREQUENCY IS WHICH PHASE ANGLE YOU GET A DIFFERENT OUTCOME. AND MAYBE ONLY, MAYBE ONLY MAYBE SPINAL CORD INJURY, SPINA CORD COULD BE A COMMON PATHWAY TO DELIVER A MODULATION OF THESE SEIZURES, THAT'S WHEY HOPE TO DO IN THE NEXT 20 OR 25 YEARS THAT I HAVE LEFT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ APPLAUSE ]  THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL LECTURE. WE HAVE TIME FOR JUST A FEW QUESTIONS. PEOPLE CAN CONDITIONAL UP TO THE MICROPHONES.  SO WHAT IS THE RESIDUAL FUNCTION YOU NEED FOR THE PATIENT TO WALK. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE SPINAL CORD NERVE FUNCTIONAL?  YEAH, GOOD QUESTION. NOBODY KNOWS. I HAVE A FEELING THAT ANYTHING BETWEEN 10% UP MAY BE ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN SOME DEGREE OF NEUROLOGICAL RECOVERY. I HAVE NOT TESTED THAT, BUT THAT'S JUST A HINT FROM WHAT WE SAW IN THIS MRIs OF THESE PATIENTS.  AND IN TERMS OF THERAPY, YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THEM RECOOPERATE QUICKLY, SO IN TERMS OF THE BUILD UP, SO WHAT ARE YOU BUILDING UP, ARE YOU MAKING NEWS, SPINAL--NERVES OR SOMETHING ELSE IS HAPPENING?  I THINK WE ARE--THERE IS PLASTIC SPINAL CORD AND LEVEL IS A HEAVY MECHANISM. I THINK AS THE CORTEX GETS LIGHT UP, IT'S DRIVING THE SPINAL CORD AS FEEDBACK COMES BACK THIS IS HEAVY MECHANISM TO IMPROVE AND CERTAINLY NEW CONNECTIONS, CERTAINLY MAY BE FORMED BUT I'M GETTING A SUSAPPROXIMATE PICION THAT THERE IS MORE THAN THAT. I THINK THAT THERE IS A--THERE ARE CHANGES AT THE LEVEL OF THE WHITE MATTER ALSO HAPPENING AND THE BIG BUNKEDS THAT CONNECT MAY BE CHANGING IN TERMS OF CONDUCTION FILLS ONITY, AND MILIZATION LEVEL SO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO EXPLORE THAT YET BUT THAT'S THE HYPOTHESIS THAT IS DRIVING US NOW IS MORE THAN JUST GRAY MATTER PLASTICITY. I THINK WELL IS A COMPONENT OF MIGHT WHEART AND FUNNY ENOUGH I COULDN'T SHOW YOU, YOU BUT I HAVE MRIs OF THESE PATIENTSA THE END OF THE TRAINING AND I WAS COMPARING TO A CONTROL GROUP HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, HEALTHY SUBJECTS THAT PEOPLE DID METRIC ANALYSIS. WE HAVE ANOTHER INTERNATIONAL SPINAL CORD DATABASE THAT ARE NOT TRAINED. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PARALYZED FOR A LONG TIME AND WHAT WE SEE NOW WITH PATIENTS AND A SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT OF VOLUME AND THICKNESS OF GREAT MATTER IN THE FRONTAL PARIETAL PART OF THE BRAIN. IN A REDUCTION IN THE SAME PARAMETERS IN THE OCEPIGENETICITTAL POLL, IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'S ENERGETIC PARIETAL TO GET SOMETHING TO WORK AND FUNNY ENOUGH, THE PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX AND PRIMARY SENSORY CORTEX HAD SUFFERED SO MUCH ATROPHY, THAT YOU DON'T SEE MUCH CHANGE AT THEIR LEVEL BUT YOU SEE IN THE TISSUE AROUND IT IN THE COTTER TELEAREAS AROUND IT, MAYBE TRY TO COMPENSATE AND FIND A WAY TO SEND SIGNALS TO THE SPINAL CORD.  CONGRATULATIONS FOR FINE WORK.  THANK YOU. THANK YOU.  THERE'S BEEN A FEW PAPERS OR AT LEAST 1 PAPER RECENTLY, SEVERED PIG BRAINS FROM A STOCK YARD AND THEY WERE INFUSED AND THEY MAINTAINED NEURAL ACTIVITY AS MEASURED HAVE YOU ARE EVER THOUGHT OF GETTING AND CONNECT THOAG AND GETTING A VISUAL PROSTHESIS IN SEEING IF YOU KACCT TRAIN THEM TO DO SOMETHING? TRAIN IN WHAT. I DIDN'T HEAR YOU THE FIRST PART OFIOURE QUESTION GOT MUFFLED BY THE MICROPHONE, COULD YOU REPEAT? THERE RECENTLY WERE--  YOU CAN SPEAK FASTER.  SEVERED PIG BRAINS.  THEY'RE PIG BRAINS, FROM A STOCK YARD AND THEY INFUSED THEM AND THEY KEPT NEURAL ACTIVITY GOING AS MEASURED BY ELECTROINSEVERE MITRALLA LO GRAMS IS THIS ETHICAL OR NOT ETHICAL, YOU WOULD SUSPECT BUT THE THOUGHT WOULD BE WOULD YOU CONNECT THEM TO SOME TYPE OF A VISUAL PROSTHESES LIKE YOU HAVE ARTIFICIAL RETINAS AND SOME TYPE OF A MECHANICAL STRUCTURE, ROBOTIC AND PERHAPS YOU COULD CREATE CYBORGs.  I'M ACTUAL LOAMACYY WRITING A SCIFY BOOK AND NOW YOU HAVE GAVE ME AN IDEA BUT FROM AN EXPERIMENTAL POINT OF VIEW, MAYBE NOT, BUT DOCTOR [INDISCERNIBLE] WAY BACK HAD DONE A PROFUSION OF GINNY PIGS BRAINS. HE WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN GINNY PIG BRAIN ACTIVITY AND OF COURSE PEOPLE HAVE DONE NAIN TURTLES FOREVER BECAUSE YOU CAN PUT A TURTLE BRAIN IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND COME BACK THE NEXT DAY AND IT'S WORKING. THE CLOSEST WE DID TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE GOT WHAT WE CALL A BRAIN TO BRAIN INTERFACE. SO YOU GO THE A RAT IN BRAZIL DOING A SENSORY MOTOR TASK, AND WE SEND THE BRAIN ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE BAR PRESSING ON THE RAT TO GET THE ANSWER TO THE SENSORY CORTEX OF THE RAT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, THEY NEVER SAW THE TASK, AND WE SHOW INDEED 75% OF THE CASE, THIS GUY COULD GET [INDISCERNIBLE] TO HHS, OR M1 CORTEX VIA THIS DIRECT LINK& BRAIN TO BRAIN LINK AND PEOPLE HAVE IN SEATTLE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, THEY HAVE DONE HA IN HUGH MANS USING NONINVASIVE TECHNIQUE, USING EEG AND TMS, SO THEY GOT AN E, G PATTERN AND DELIVERED EMS POST TO A SECOND SUBJECT THAT HAS NOT SEEN THE TASK AND THE SECOND SUBJECT, YOU KNOW IN A VERY SIMILAR PERCENTAGE, I THINK 80% OF THE TRIALS, CAN GET IT RIGHT. THAT'S THE CLOSEST TO THE SCENARIO, SO CAN YOU HAVE A BRAIN THAT IS A DISTANCE CONTROLLING DEVICE OR CONTROL EVEN SENDING INFORMATION TO ANOTHER BRAIN THAT IS NOT RELATED TO THE BODY OF THE SUBJECT. THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS BUT I WILL THINK ABOUT A PIG THING. IT'S TOO FAR FOR ME AT THIS POINT.  OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU. ARE.  IT'S PROBABLY GOOD I'M FOLLOWING THE REANIMATION QUESTION BECAUSE I HAVE A SPECULATIVE QUESTION, TOO. THANK YOU FOR THIS INCREDIBLE PRESENTATION I'M JAHAN, [INDISCERNIBLE] [INDISCERNIBLE] 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND MY QUESTION IS PROBABLY 1 YOU FREQUENTLY GET FROM THE CASUAL OBSERVER WHEN IS THEY'RE TALKING AND FIND OUT THAT YOU'RE A BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE AND RESEARCHER, IT'S ABOUT THE PRESENTATION FROM ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO FROM THE MUSK ORGANIZATION, THE NEUROLINK PRESENTATION, GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S A COMPUTER SCIENCE RESEARCHER WHO HAS MORE INSIGHTS INTO DIRECT RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD THAN I DO, HE BELIEVES THAT THIS EXCITEMENT ABOUT NEUROLINK IS A BIT BASED ON SMOKE AND MIRRORS SO FAR AS NORMALLY ABLE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED HE THINKS THAT FOR OTHER PEOPLE, PEOPLE ARE LOCKED IN, AND SO FORTH, THIS WILL PROVIDE SOME BENEFITS BUT I'M A COCK-EYED OPTIMIST. I'M EXCITED ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE AN IQ OPTIMIZER OR WORK PRODUCT OPTIMIZER OR SOME KIND OF LAWN MOWER MAN EFFECTS, WHO'S RIGHT, SHOULD I CONTINUE TO BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS PROSPECT?  I WOULDN'T PUT THAT IN YOUR CAMPAIGN PROGRAM? I THINK YOUR FRIEND AND MUCH MORE REALLYISTIC, YOU KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE 3 FORMER STUDENTS OF MINE--IT'S ALL BASED ON HYPE AND CRAZINESS AND HE HAS NO IDEA ABOUT THE BRAIN AND MY ADVICE TO HIM WOULD BE TRY TO SELL SOME CARS BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A TOUGH TIME DOING THAT SO EVERYTHING THAT HE SAYS, FOR ME IS CLOSE TO SCIFY OR BEYOND IS BAD SCI FY, AND WE DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD THINK THAT TECHNOLOGY WILL SOLVE HUMAN PROBLEMS. HUMAN PROBLEMS ARE GOING TO BE SOLVED BY HUMANS AND I JUST FINISHED A BOOK THAT IS COMING OUT ON [INDISCERNIBLE] IN A MONTH WHERE I HAVE A WHOLE CHAPTER ON THAT SUBJECT AND WE SHOULD CONSIDER THE BRAIN, THE CENTER OF THE HUMAN UNIVERSE BECAUSE THE BRAIN HAS CREATED EVERYTHING THAT HUMAN CIVILIZATION HAS DONE IS THE KIND OF BIOLOGY WE HAVE UP HERE THAT CREATED HUMAN HISTORY AND EVERYTHING ELSE, SO, I--EVEN THOUGH I SPEND MY ENTIRE LIFE WORK AND TECHNOLOGY AS YOU SAW, I DON'T SEE OUR BLAMING THE TECHNOLOGY AS THE KIND OF FUTURE I WANT TO LEAVE TO MY KIDS AND GRANDCHILDREN, I BELIEVE WE NEED TO BECOME AWARE OF THE POWER OF OUR HUMAN CONDITION AND JUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROMOTE IT, NOT TO DEMISE IT OR--SO, NOTHING THE MUSK SAYS EVERY GETS IN MY BOOKS NOT EVEN SCIENCE FICTION BOOKS. DID I ANSWER CLEARLY?  YES, YES, THANK YOU. I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEW BOOK, THANK YOU SO MUCH.  I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SAY WE HAVE A RECEPTION IN THE LIBRARY, AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR SPEAKER IN THE LIBRARY. SO PLEASE, GO AHEAD AND--  THANK YOU. AND I'D LIKE TO THANK OUR SPEAKER 1 MORE TIME.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [APPLAUSE ]
