 you [Music] so uh as many of you are familiar with we're starting this brain computer interfaces effort inside Microsoft Research it's a cross collaboration across a couple of teams here and in looking at the related work we came across a Natalia cuz Mina's a recent journal paper was a great overview of the various efforts in this space yeah you did your PhD in Kelowna and then in yeah it in RIA and your postdoc with patty maze yes and you have a couple overview slides on what the groups doing yeah well that don't know the Patty's group in media that so looking forward to seeing that and then afterwards we have like a roundtable discussion thank you so much for this one welcome so first as Christian said he actually asked me to do some kind of internal very fast overview about the group so we will have a quick grasp but I'm gonna talk about and then I will actually move to besides so oh yeah my name is not patty miles but she's a principal investigator at MIT Media Lab and our group is called fluid interfaces so nothing to do with physics news fluids it's about technology so we have a grown in number of devices on us and they're getting with each month closer and closer to our bodies but they take our attention our memory our cognitive resources and we just start to understand what effect they're actually making on us and the interest of the group is can we create systems that can sense a user's internal and external state and intervene to seamlessly enhance our cognitive abilities what I mean by that is that right now if I take my phone which is obvious a very very useful device it makes my life easier I don't need to remember a lot of sins but I'm spending my life like this and can you do something with it because we're still gonna have those and we have will have more of those actually but can we somehow help the user to be on task on hand to be with others and not be dividing his attention memory etc there's really more than 20 projects going on in the group and we are focusing on decisions attention well-being memory dreams and learning I'm not gonna go through all of them because that's not the focus of the group but I'm gonna show you couple of ones so first one of the projects for decision-making and this is a project as it is called ultra eager and there's a project of now a PhD student Arnav Kapoor and he I'm gonna show you Vida so it's a variable system as it allows using EMG muscle activity to pick up the civilization of the roads so as you can see he's not pronouncing any single word but he is subclass on them and this can let the system pick it up and through the bone production provide him with the feedback in real-time there is two electrodes there is also a bone conduction microphone and obviously a bluetooth to the Ranger so this is one of the projects this is actually a very good example of what we are doing in the team and with my project on BCI when I see it the systems are variable they are seamless obviously you can see it on the user but now we have her actually Russian that is much less visible they don't require any external device to function and they're not invasive this is another example this is a project called by essence so it's an open source of factory display that monitors cordero spiritual information to support mental well-being so the device can be worn in different form factors we have once again even smaller ones right now and once again it doesn't require it's wireless and it can release different types of smell why doing so because a lot of research points out that when we smell coffee or peppermint we are getting like more awake we are getting more attention if like right now I would spread some along Keylong for example or Peppa means you would pay more attention to me hopefully still do I'm going to show you some other kids how to do that as this is an example of actually how the system works it's a hardware and in the software user can control all the components the time of the release of the smell etcetera finally this is going to be presented at chi in one months from now in Glogau so this is a nasa variable system so as you can see all of the projects are variable devices it's a variable vegetable assimilation device that stimulates the vestibular system to use sensations of motion so as you can imagine the system this paper was actually tested in VR condition with like Russian mountains but could be used for an almost driving in any situations of motion sickness so it's electrical stimulation and also right now a bee he's a master student in the group he's testing it in the projects with NASA in zero-gravity because MIT has a lot of open space initiative so they're from poles they want to bring this to the International Space Station actually this is this is just three and I'm obviously gonna talk about some of my projects in actual talk but we are interfacing with sleep for example masca it's a sleep mask that can detect the REM States and as a project its EDA it's called Urmia I detect Ram as well and wakes person up and Prime's the person to talk about something he or she wants to dream about there is fast shares that could be it's an Opel modular system which can be sticked in any VR or AR headset to collect eg e OG so brain activity eye movements skin conductance and so much more so actually if you do want to talk about those we can definitely also talk about those a bit later so it's a very very short of a brief so while I'm switching to presentations if you have some urgent questions please don't hesitate sorry what it's AC no it's only so I tried it out it's actually just here on the one point on the right and on one point on the left is kind of next to the ear so two points and for that zero gravity project I haven't actually tried it but I have seen I think I even have the images it goes so two points next to the ears and the third one goes here in between the eyes so it's basically like three point mini head cap those three points on him so now up to brain computer interfaces I call this community augmentation 1-0 and I'm going to explain why is this name so as Christian mentioned already I did my master in Grenoble in France and artificial intelligence and then actually I'm doing BCI since 2010 when they were absolutely not popular no one was actually doing them that much especially not HCI people I did my PhD I got my PhD in 2015 then I moved to another city in France called ran to do some ARV on with busy eyes and since 2017 I am at Media Lab and I'm continuing doing brain computer interfaces so why actually brain computer interfaces why should we even care everything started with Big Bang and obviously has evolution continued we appeared and though dimensioned without creating a lot of tools and these tools are making our life easier simpler but the problem is that they're not perfect we actually lose each single tool we are having here the cognitive demand is increasing but actually is very limited our country resources are not getting any better and they're not going to get any better but vc I might be a solution and I'm gonna in this talk on top of giving you state-of-the-art showing you what should be done what should not be done I'll argue about this point as well so when some people hear about this guy's they usually and most of people think about this I am pretty sure any of you at least think maybe one of those alters carbon matrix you name it and they all look very interesting they look like implants points in the neck something else well unfortunately reality or fortunately still very basic you need to have it on your head right now or inside of your head we don't have any other options right now there is like one Russian it could be even embedded in your bed so I'm not covering this presentation a lot of details on signal processing but we can definitely talk in offline but for those who might be beginners be shy usually works as falling we will put a headset on in the case of the non-invasive systems on the head of a person we will do the acquisition explicit implicit it means that we'll ask a person to do something for our so maybe we will not ask a person to do anything we will need to go through signal processing I will explain why it's obligatory step we will need to do some classification and then obviously we can do something interesting with the signals member to assign them to some interesting applications that are of the paramount importance for the user so what do we usually use for brain computer interfaces we usually use several different modalities visual modalities visual techniques for example and non-invasive engine caps they are very popular but it's a nightmare a lot of people say oh when you get 128 electrode setup as you can see here on my head you will get the best signal possible they are good for selfies like this and I would say that's kind of eat why because on the right that's what you need to do to put this headset on me you need to literally put it in water and fool in the solid solution and then put obviously some car on me and then trust me to wear it on top of this this huge white wire it is actual wired part of the headset it's connected it's violet literally through the machine and you're actually not getting better signal because imagine you have 128 electrodes dimensionality reduction issues and all other problems and just the fact of installing is it will take at least 40 minutes does not rust in 99% of cases you will go and opt for the solution in one single case if you're looking for something for a phenomenon the brain that you don't know yet where it is situated why would you go for this because what usually happens even if you have 128 electrodes all 256 you will still end up analyzing some local sources so I would say go for this one only if you really want to investigate in neuro phenomena that you don't know yet where it is exactly or you try to reimplementation from Meg or from ephemera I'm going to mention those and you really don't know exactly where to put your electrodes that might be a version also everything that is for source localization that would be also a go-to solution don't go and don't touch your user it will not reverse it you will not obtain a better signal or a better classification output no way they you will gain 5-7 percentage which is not significant no that's even worse so a lot of people think oh if you are bold is gonna work what happens is that when you are bold your skin actually grows thicker so it's actually much worse their boldness is worse than hair the worse that can be it's like this kind of dreads like traces like that's we will need dropped four completely different types of electrode I'm gonna talk about this so what you have right now is actually a huge amount of different EEG headsets and headbands and they are much better you will lose sometimes in quality but there might be an option to go depending on the application and I'm gonna talk about this another version and this is I would say the one that is running right now in there demoing stuff of applications that you can do with busy eyes and I'm gonna if you have time I'm gonna show you actual videos this is fMRI as you can see here it was taken when I was still in France so it's in French but I guess you can still guess what it means with this system I needed to do to make sure that I don't have any metal in my body pregnancy test just in case to make sure even if I'm sure and then you need to obviously be ridiculously lying down for like two hours it's very noisy setup in this particular case in my head I also also have an EEG compatible cap which is not easy and the references in this case for those who know where how Eugene usually works actually on my neck all night back so on top of all of this it's actually very uncomfortable to lay it down you should not be close to phobic it should be pretty healthy this should be only particular sizes in the sense that fMRI and even the cap if you want to do two modalities why it is good why still people still go for this one obviously if you either you have one in the lab and means that you're on really serious brain research or you really want to do some are hardcore visual decoding I'm gonna show some meters if you do have time it's amazing what you can do with it temporal specialization it's another story and finally that's not the final ones there are more but this is one that I can see the interest in example this is Meg so the idea here is that on the left here you can see the scanners it is based most of them are based on squid sensors on the right these are optical sensors so why it is so interesting and because you see like I showed it to some of my interns to say it looks even creepier it's not about creepiness here it's about the fact that this version is portable it's considered to be portable this is a nice example how technology moves forward result of startups freaking Silicon Valley open-water and some houses that drew claims is that developing something that will break fMRI in cost by 6 to 100 times and in quality of the signal but this is where we are right now so there where the most improvement is made is still in these versions why are you trying to go into mobile version or we are still into a gym I want to finish this very quick overview of technologies with this image because I think it's very interesting here so you can see temporal and spacial resolution up to actually local brain imaging and what is interesting here maybe you can read it out it's like a raspberry color was there ultra-fast ultrasound imaging I don't know if you know it's pretty novel it is research in ultra-fast ultrasound scanners is not normal at all but I assisted April 2018 to the talk of one of the co-authors of this technology and it's possible right now to do it on the neonatal so on the babies and he's trying to do it this summer he invited me to come over to do some engine with it to do it on their adult human why it is interesting because as you can see special and temporally we approach dramatically the implanted ages and this is non-invasive not gonna go into details about this one I can give you the reference but this is something that you should consider still things that are interesting that I'm moving forward right now that we are six years ago when I just came first time to the lab it's in Paris actually I was like well yeah it's interesting but nothing really six years later they're really about to do it on actual adults and the number of frames per second is like 60 or 70 it's like amazing good resolution but if you got it I did all my 10 years of BCI right now in eg and I still consider that it is still the place to be in near future at least for these guys but you just need to have several things in one where you try to design for and user first of all what do we used to measure and this is very important usually what happens is that people who opt for 128 the most expensive is the best one or we only have $200 for a muse headband nothing against miss heaven but this is kind of extreme situations you really need to understand what are you actually doing with your application here on the top left it's hybrid electrodes released in September 2018 by GTECH as they're based in Austria why they're hybrid because they take both gel and dry at the same time here and I work with them since 6 months already it's on the hand but actually I'm using them for eg its griffin based electrodes you might have heard about those the problem is that the extremely sensitive to noise there but you can see why they're so good I don't actually need so I wanted to put one on me and it will show you how it looks but you would not barely see it on me it's 80% transparent and you can do it fully transparent and on top of this this is an Alec chart imagine if you if you have the whole PCB so if the whole amplifiers the whole module is gonna be in these lines this is actually brought several with me ours are somewhere in my bag somewhere these are hydrogel electrodes also pretty normal pretty recent I know only for now one band that is having them very good quality as well some things to keep in mind it is a pretty classic ones gold plated pins and once again I just put one image I'm using natural a ninety two point five percent silver this is also gonna improve the signal quality dramatically and drastically so this is just a very quick overview that think what you gonna use if your task is person who has an LS you need to think will the hair be cleaned each on our thirty because I was doing this for five years it's very annoying and when you cannot tell that it is very annoying that your hair is dried there with the scream you're gonna destroy even 100 percent accuracy this iconic can not deliver you 100 they are happy to take 60 and 70% but if they don't feel comfortable they're gonna tell you right away they're not gonna use or opt for your application for your system for what in the world even if you pay them for to do so if you are trying to do something that is more than style something that is about applications that will monitor cognitive states and I'm gonna show those you don't actually need to opt out for anything of this quality you might think about something of this type or hydrogel why actually should you care about what you are using here it's just one example I didn't include all of them but you just to show you that there is comfort there is a signal gain and there is a shelf line so it's different for different applications they also have different price manufacturing of graphene and a fraction of hydrogel is 300 times more cheap as an AG agcl so this is very important on the other hand for hydrogel you need to moisturize them at least 40 minutes before you use them that's another thing it doesn't sound very okay 40 minutes as okay but if you forgot your basically you're not going to be able to execute it because I need to delay it for 40 minutes just an example of these little details thinking without them beforehand think is the person gonna move because they will move in most of the cases if it's not six months before in the ALS or like some Mir parties they will move they will create some noise they will move the hair someone will move their hair and they don't know all these details but you can think for them graphene tattoos can stay on touch for 24 hours and up to five days with the deterioration of the signal only by 19% you don't maybe need someone to wear it for five days for other reasons but what if you would like to monitor something 34-7 the could be another option so what do we actually measure a lot of sense really a lot I'm not gonna go through once again all of those but I'm gonna show ones the most promising one the most I would say discussed once and then how's that we can actually work towards application so why is the actually user opt for those so one I would say number one sighted because they are kind of the easiest from the signal processing perspective our earpiece so earpiece look usually let's say right now I have a coffee with milk if I'm gonna tell you I want a coffee with a cat 400 milliseconds later approximately in your brain that will be a peak of activity that will appear because the phrase that I just constructed semantically is incorrect if I'm gonna tell you oh I'm right now in Google and then just relized know I was at Google yesterday right now I'm at Microsoft I just realized that I have made a mistake and before I even corrected myself there is another pic of activity that will appear the fact of me realizing that I just pronounced something that is not correct error related potential requite a few of those usually the name stands for and of P it means when it will occur is it positive or negative and then the timing so the name usually 2 or 200 for 400 it's approximate timing so is it a quite a few of those we published last year for example it and we see a paper about cedar Birds Eye versus natural roots and this is one more thing when you pronounce the word and a person doesn't know what the word is you can pick this activity up and using and 400 on fp1 our electrode for example what it is interesting because right now for these earpiece you don't sometimes need to do any training for the user you already have databases that are good enough to be initialized fresh initialize at least and then you can either do a calibration instead of training or you can give like several trials to the system and that would be enough to have a reasonable classification accuracy so a lot of research right now and a particularly work on motor earpiece you can see several papers I think it's C as this year's even presented I don't remember what car was it was Honduras someone else who was actually trying to show this off here Peter can be seen before you do the actual movement so before you turn left or right we can say I gonna turn Lou after right between 40 to 400 milliseconds before you were actually performs a movement this was proven with fMRI was the past planning seven minutes before we can traced with 90% accuracy what passed you're gonna check I will ask you question can you tell me how you go from your from your home to your work hopefully each day it's kind of the same way you do it so we can trace this in the frame around and we can use the model to actually predict seven minutes before how you're going to actually execute it for example if there is I cannot some cleaning machines that when I did there you'll usually turn that little Street left because you know that you should they do Queen the throat because you do this for years and years another very interesting the next four slides it has a small logo of Albany and Neuroscience Institute so I shall borrowed them when I was given talks there because they are specifically specializing in p300 why it's interesting because it is one of the most famous accessibility tools in this child so they just recently and I'm gonna go into the idea of p300 is very similar to what I just described in the case of earpiece you will provide target and non target and to help you use it you will flash the target and they usually need to focus on target and ignore the non target activity so why it's interested in this particular one because in July 2018 if they finished four or five years study of this system in the wild with ALS patients there wasn't a total 118 people who opted for the study unfortunately 48 died within two years that's one again LS this all they say all these issues it's extremely interesting paper I talked to them it's extremely interesting the whole effort specialized it seems this right now just pretty powerful by actually prove this like someone asked me why do you put this so on the side I think it's very instant because it's a person who typed the whole email using the system using p300 so insides are not mind but I think it's very interesting here to see how people actually use it for example that sorry for they call it's in black I'm gonna go like this in white so you can actually fall for example it's actually simple phrases for example to say in for the caregiver don't let the dog be don't speak louder when a husband messaging her eyes she does not to rob them so it's simple phrases but they make a huge difference to the user so the paper does state the interest is they talking like trying to address all the issues how patients and therapists talk about BCI's and the trying the third column just says it actually we have solutions for all of those problems comfortable not practical breakfast practical not comfortable how to use it without a specialist so yeah it's actually very interesting the caregiver was trained one since three six months the person was coming over for checkup if something is lost in connection you will still be able to see this online everything is actually reported online it's a huge huge world cuz the amount of users might not be particularly impressive especially for us used to massive amounts of data but this is all Els people from the Secession of veterans of Sears and I obviously could be gone much further in the condition this was their trying to get I'm going to let you check the paper and I can give you the actual reference another one it's called steady suitable potentials this is um here I keep Reese it stands for visual so once again just before I play the video because I will not play it in case it's the problem doesn't even have any epilepsy any risks for epilepsy in the room if not I'm gonna play the video very it's a great fun one okay that's exactly immediately I have shown you the problem of this system you need to ask this before you're gonna place this video so here what happens you choose it one of my experiments some time ago so here you can see what actually happens to stimulus flickering on different frequencies you can plays it was the size so what am i was trying to do here is like to see how can we reduce the size can we keep it to a small dot somewhere on the screen to pick up and hear that specification I carry Silver's in real time so this is for ample not train system at all so you have two classes the binary problem and to decide where a person is looking on the magenta on the yellow one so the idea here is that user will look at something that is flickering particular frequency could be on the screen it could be a physical object and you can pick up this activity there are some rules you can adjust put it in each single screen from here you can see that's using the first version of Holland's and using the same paradigm so there are some rules too big the cuted for example you can see you can only take multiples of the flesh and rate of the screens that you are using as if first that you go they're more visible and becomes so you really need to think about the refresh rate of the screen etc but in the very end right away with no training at all it can give you 75 percent doesn't sound a lot it's a lot for classic design another example which is much less relevant but it is an interesting example this system was used to control particular in this example a tail of the rat so a person was looking at as flashing frequency and the tail of the of the red over there was moving so any personal translator to tell was moving on a person was looking at the rides that L was looking as a ride or I put it here is because actually I found at least 20 different papers who do this kind of application controlling someone's else part of the body there's also papers with cockroaches I didn't put them here red still looks a bit better energy or motor imagery so I guess you might know that when you do perform a movement there is obviously some activity some activations the promoter and motor cortex s and this is extremely variable started so it's called the synchronization and I would say motor imagery is one of the modalities ism studied the best especially in particularly in the imagination class of this Yaris here's something I have done okay some years ago even four years ago or something so if your person is imagining two hands to tip of the drone imagine a left hand movement to turn the drawer left and I can you write the woman to turn the drum right and then both feet to landed and as you can see here on the video so it's in real time which is sold and the person is not moving and a person is varying and and here we can see it very well but the elephant's only position on the motor cortex so is it's just one more example of showing that when you know where you look for a signal you don't need to go with 128 electrodes or 64 electrodes or even thirty two electrons you might be very precise if you know where you go this is another example of the system this is where emotional imagery BCI was used to produce binary words and which was then transmitted to a receiver in the form of the protein 3 HTM s so it took like this one person is looking and imagine in a movement and another person is decoded in words or in letters and as a person who actually see them it's just a two different example just to show how applications could be twisted because people think oh what the imager is only for movements you can actually use it just as the control signal for whatever you want to be just like a brain switch you think about this and this will happen let's say it's like a shortcut obvious the motor imagery is actually very well studied if you really want to try it out tons of papers all it is there but it's pretty limited a lot of participants are considered to be actually BC illiterate they don't even know how to train themselves to use it we don't know how to train them what is the problem maybe because we don't have a lot of options as well and particularly there are a lot of other cortexes there that also can use imagery and we might be interested in decoding source so this was an inspiration for other of my works but actually initially was published in fMRI domain mostly so it is imagination of objects particularly this one it's not nature scientific reports in last year think we were interested in seeing if you can detect when a person is looking at one of those objects versus when he or she is imagining them this is pretty simple because as you can see the objects are having very different visual properties but still can they actually pick this up and here's just an example one of the user so is a spectral abated common special part into depth here but on the top row you can see the activation for the hammer on the low one for the dasyam and literally yesterday in the Narron journal there was a release of a new paper from MIT about the specification of the TI part intro temporal cortex within visual cortex that actually corresponds to your possibility or your ability to imagine objects and to detect them and to crucify them what they did first was with the rats as they were using some kind of drug I don't remember exact name misalign I think which would block the firing of the neurons and when that happened neither the mice know the markets were not able to cognize the object they were trained to recognize so it's like very interesting paper and i really suggest you to check out if you're interested in this one so yes no here yeah here it's only on the visual cortex so once again it's just here sixteen across as well here's another example it's also from one so this was like more and stand media for it's actually did this experiment effect once they feel about Stephen Hawking was out I was very inspired by this you so we did this study I think it's frontiers what happens here is that a person so it's the fully controlled smart house it's a bit nothing's about starting but a person here imagines a door a microwave a TV and the teakettle five objects in total it's only on and off objects or open clothes on on earth but we obtain 78% of classification accuracy it does require training so it says here on the visual cortex but it's not application where if you want to control an object you don't want to go into imagination of a movement you just want here it is you're gay physiology a working on it you want to pick a time but you maybe want to turn it on to turn it off etc so it's another example of applications that should be true what the user and we compared versus monitoring imagery and the pacification our output was 60% flow for the motor image it was the same types of our comments yes so it's this system will require 25 to 45 minutes of training but all the participants that were disabled they actually perform at at least one BCI study in the past not was also but the olden knew about the head said the cap that they need to use it etc etc so this one this study was within one day only so they were training one day and then we had obviously break they always need a break and then we were doing there's experiment I'm gonna come I have the slides for this so it's completely different activity in alpha and I'm gonna I have a couple of slides but actual described in the paper but I was chose us off so actually this initial work that I have done was inspired by the work from MSR as it was done almost well it's actually 10 years ago now and this is a very nice one because it's the same idea basically it doesn't use any visualization and imagination it's really observe ation so looking at the objects and trying to identify them and to classify them and you can imagine a lot of different applications particularly particularly one that is not very well studied yet but there are already some papers of collaborative disguise there is a huge amount of papers particular this one by Wang several years ago where they actually proposed I think the first cooperative framework that at least I have seen where the and simple classifier was used to have the outputs of the single mr. user and then of a group of 20 and the crucification output of a group improved by 25% so bid from 60% for the detection task because they move to 99% and this is very powerful if you can improve their classification by this rate by having a group of users performing the task and not by having one user perform in several sessions this is a really interesting thing I really surprised actually people don't do more of this work but it's really very interesting one this is a comment a minute of all these interesting things is that it all requires training more less and obviously was it effective the training of the user you do need to pay a price not only of the fact that it is not a proper classification but also of the fact that it could be charged hideous and even if the end user like in the case of Alice will see the benefit they will opt out and they will not come to the session two and three and I have seen those a lot and it will be no matter if you're gonna pay them call them stand in front of their house on to the rain it will be yes I did this do you like all of it then it would be the same so but you can actually alleviate this and you can actually design something that will help you here's an example you might know the word prime and it's AB Sekulow djegal phenomenon when you present a user was something like a stamina is a prime to modify his or her response to a latest timeless this is a problem and we have a lot of those semantic visual subliminal for example I'm gonna tell all Christian you look amazingly good today yeah you could like in 10 hours of sleep I'm gonna like praise you for like 10 minutes I'm gonna tell you how awesome you are I love all your 3000 papers from Kai I follow all of them and then all of a sudden time years later ask you occasion can you just drop me off for about a hotel place and the probability that you'll say yes even if you cannot it will be around 99 percent because I just used something that's called semantic priming I was praising you positively you we use this in our social interactions as negative we said someone oh you're not capable or sometimes that used a lot in schools we currently work with some classrooms and questions use a lot oh Jessica you're not good in math this is the strongest in the person you can actually tell to the kid we're gonna talk about this a bit late and how this I can also leverage this but primarily the extreme was extremely helpful wine because particular example of visual primary when you see something it works usually in the cinema but it could be in the publicity anywhere you will see some sense and you will from a bottle of coke you will get thirsty and you will end up getting this bottle of cough of course I'm oversimplifying here there should be particular timing when you present it but this is how it works in general terms why it's interesting because imagine if you can do Prime in using BCI so let's say I'm not gonna tell my user anything about the system not at all I'm gonna just say hey I want to do some brain activity recordings can you come over to the lab and I got 24 users like this and there are all gamers and I said do you know Dhoom 3 it's the first-person shooter game endodermis I think I am it was my first game doom it was doing I guess you all know what it is for those who don't tell me who don't know what Doom is okay there are no people exist that's amazing exactly what I'm talking about it's a dark game and for any level even if you have never seen doom 2 3 4 etc you need for the initial level two things a flashlight because it's very dark and you need kind of a weapon at least something at least to survive the first level and so I'm putting the headset on the users and I'm gonna tell them hey just play the game I'm gonna record how Roseau what is happening in your brain when you see this was its inner but I'm not actually telling them anything about the game itself and they start moving and all of a sudden they find themselves in the dark corridor where it's very dark and I will give them a flashlight they don't have any activation button to get it just when I give it it to them and I'm gonna record all this as their brain Singh was doing this moment and exactly one minute later they will find themselves again in the dark corridor they can still continue the interaction and not breaking they use experience just pretty dark but because to move forward but what will you think about if just one minute ago it was the same corridor it was a flashlight what do you think about flashlight how do I get it like what to do if you do this if the single match I'm gonna give you a flashlight this system is trained you didn't do anything I didn't drop a word of how to do it and you got it this second trial 100% of users understood what they need to do without explicitly meet challenge and what they need to do and these were users who were novice and besides they knew nothing about motor image or visual image or any imagery whatsoever it's like this yeah because the game is the first level so obviously we it was the Takei paper we obviously compared with explicit setup and actually with implicit training within the game when actually developed explicitly one level of the game but this immersion flow and VCI performance were significantly better was this one but I have shown you quite a few applications like communication type in human area computing but from now on for the rest of this talk I'm going to focus on two on health related applications and in cognitive state monitor ones why I guess I already made my case about why but it's where we are right now our devices I liked this interesting mentioned from the paper of 1957 by client who seven years later suggested the first term cyborg that robots will be our mechanical slaves well I would say right now in our argue it's an opposite and we pay the price and the price is suicide rates all over the world schizophrenia mental into says ADHD anxiety only growing exponentially all around the countries not only in the one that we consider to be those who are having issues so the idea would be sorry yes this was four papers about frontiers in 2015-2016 the amount of how many mentions of ample mental health was a yeah what's happening like in the frontiers in human error science so can even give the control to the user finally so he or she can still look and leave with a mechanical players around but actually be using them as a continuous part because this is so I don't have any single implant in my body comes it is I'm a cyborg and we are all actually Cypress to some extent this is an extension of me and I'm not gonna drop it for any current reason right now I'm gonna drop some applications but I'm not gonna drop the device and they will only go like just closer definitely but can it be more seamless can it be better can be more productive can I get most of it right now I would argue other papers claim we're using 3 percent of the brain this are very very questionable a citation I would argue that we are using 3 percent of these and 97 are still awaiting we just cannot leverage it what can we do and an idea would be can him maybe somehow measure let's say attention or the cognitive load of the person and maybe in real time without adding additional burden and then provide some kind of feedback to him or her telling hey you're not on task ahead come back but not using applications then don't check them they don't care about the order don't load them it's fancy for two weeks and that's it we actually did a study about those so just to make sure that we are on the same page about attention it's their holy war out there in psychology literature when you talk about the tensions very important to remediate leave any of your presentations mention what it is because you can get in trouble very fast so I'm using this definition by allah jensen is a very famous researcher works a large on attention it recently on besides as well so we can definitely measure attention in different ways we can use heart rate we can use galvanic skin response but if you can also use EEG and EG was proven to be the most reliable of all of them you can talk actually about heart rate if you want like wiser or not their most reliable and EDA so how can you measure this and this kind of gonna go into line of your question how can we decide if a person is observing something versus when he or she's imagining something so we can measure it in the same way I was talking previously by looking at the ALF activity so spontaneous so just having something on the head of the user had set a headband or by a bulk in it as I will be presented with some kind of different stimulus so while fictive ET why not something else there are several bands as you might know which I teach are gamma but alpha is known to be once again it says kind of as motor imagery in paradigms from this guy but it all started and actually is known to be inhibited in the task in relevant regions let's say if I need right now to present to you my talk I'm gonna definitely try not to listen to some kind of music if it will try and debate it will be hard but I will do my best the different types of attention really a lot of them it's important always to explain and to know what you are measuring could be special temporal selective and the most important for us internal and external so there's another terminology trick that people need to know when they do these guys and they want to measure cognitive state it's vocabulary it's pretty pretty unreliable out there you might think no one did this but actually when you start googling it that's exactly the term so by internal attention what is hidden it's actually imagination processes so internal image internal tension is ever since it is imagination mental imagery includes visual motor tactile auditory etc external attention everything that is observation it means that you are looking in it but you're not really engaging with it so we did our paper and this is still under you for Nature Neuroscience at this time the system is pretty simple you have stimulus that lasts so first you have a cue then you will have our initial you will have some kind of time of the video seven seconds and it has three modalities epic auditory and visual and then you will have a cue it will be a word one of those modalities and then you will have a break where you would need to imagine them and you don't know beforehand which one you need to attend to so you would look at the video get turnt all of them because you don't know which one will be the one that will be asked and then we will ask you to imagine one of those so the idea here I can show you in quick rediem mmm so person is varying haptic gloves they're custom made as you can see lot of cables out there wearing a 32a jig headset and he just had piano sequence so the sound is artificial it's an oval and each finger is stimulated by a motor and then he was asked to imagine one of the modalities as a haptic or visual or tactile studies a lot of different setups a lot of trials so why to do this why for example we didn't use something like jingle bells or some that is ecologically much more valid because if you would use jingle bells you would not understand what's happening for one single reason let's say I'm gonna tell you jingle bells can you sing in your head jingle bells right now oh I'm pretty sure all of you can the prongs it because it is work in memory because it is long-term memory because on when you verse last time singing jingle bells it was with all your kids and the year before one of the kids couldn't make it from MIT on time to Seattle so one was me so you was actually you actually said you have a lot of different activations when you're trying to revoke something that you already learnt and you know let's say I'm gonna tell you blood the same history oh they all agree how it looks like definitely when I'm gonna ask you to imagine it we will he'll like 135 different representations right now and I'm not sure that we will be able to build something like reliable as a classifier on 35 trials to be very hard because for each of you you're gonna add layers and layers of something because most excuses just don't know how they need to imagine something they just it's just hard it's good for people who do it for years I know it's precise it's very sensitive it's very noisy it's very hard to give instructions it's very easy to give instructions very hard to make sure that people understand them because we cannot get into their head so it's very very good in these setups when you want to once again maybe test for something like the question is not directly application wise it's just can we understand when person is looking at something and imagining it while we are having all the mortality so kind of as it is in real life in YouTube you have three modalities you usually don't have one and the set-top and here's this just an example I'm going on I can share a part of the paper if you want it's not published yet but I'm actually giving you the example of the ones that is published but it's actually the same result for both of them it's the first of so it is immediate respectable perturbation so it's kind of like how can experience so it's kind of like a orgy but much more generalizable because you can see all of the bands and everything that has happen in at once you don't need to check that prevent and what happens here is that in the left column in blue this is observationally person is just attending to the video and on the right that's what happens with the person is imagining any of modalities and is assert its significance and I can tell you if you cannot just see how significant it is it is 90% so I can say with 90% accuracy your person is looking at something or thinking about it like actively engaging think you know maybe I need to have this fan to cope with me because it looks so nice Jensen particularly did also election years ago very famous paper tried even to go further and I see the rental papers try to replicate this in locating the attention so left-right up-down this is also done with EEG and they tried to do this with near Swiss videos it provided worse results here's an example of activations so and I'm gonna finally show you a system which usually for some reason uses all these setups that I just shown you but uses a very small comfortable foam factor and on top of this is doing something that usually BCI is not doing its iterative product design so the project is designed worst year at food interfaces and this is me wearing the first version so it's called at interview and it's a band as you can see and also wear a scarf and it's very simple it is that cuz I explained we will measure if you engage disengage with the task on hand and we will give you a haptic feedback if you are not there are several reasons why it's haptic feedback and get into there is also reason in white collar and not for example a band which is a brain you have emotional attachment that is negative through arts particularly this guy and you actually start ignoring any kind of vibrations within one hour search after being using them if you do have this device so we can get into these like details later if you're interested the result of reason why it was a disgusting and it has soaked eg sensing component feedback in this case of haptic obviously we have some software and we actually have an application we've had 24 bands and we did a multiple session experiment with multiple users were in the system at the same time and we had actual students from MIT coming over to the actual lecture with the lecturers it was the same they were getting different types of feedback some people will get an actual feedback about their brain activity hot some people go get in random because maybe random rocks as long as random it tells you hey wake up and some of course when getting no feedback and so obviously need to calibrate for this you don't need to train as I said this is not that sensitive that is not such a complicated phenomena but you need to do the calibration in this case we do calibrations at last 5 minutes tops it's actually kind of priming as well I will I was asking them to do some arithmetic tasks some and back visual tasks and back is when I show you an image I'm gonna show you the second one and will not show you the third one and then I asked what is the same or not and in this case is the number of the image that is appearing so for example and one will be very simple and five will be very hard it will be maybe potentially impossible for you to actually recover it here's an example how it looks like the calibration session so this is the same application we have for miners who have a ddddd that's why you have some trees here ignore the trees no you can still look at them it's a nice animation so just follow the number on top of this it is zero and listen to my voice it is in real time I'm asking a user to actually do mental calculus so there is no sheets of papers he or she does not see any phrases so it's a mental calculus purely just look at the value how it changes and listen to what I'm giving as instructions so it's a scale of 0 to 100 100 being extremely engaged zero being actually no connection not engaged in the case of we would say dead person no signal seventy-eight 71 34 23 and 45 123 and 8 forty five and eight 345 and 78 as you can see I'm gonna stop on this one once the numbers had just start sounding more complicated like three hundred two hundred the tension goes immediately higher without even proceeding what was the second number maybe I'm gonna say three hundred and zero which is going to be very easy maybe I'm gonna send three hundred in 100 or 300 and 500 etc so you can see this are really a difference it's pretty sensitive so the person stays engaged person reported that mental calculus is not the easiest task for him it's very important also to know because our assumptions of what is easy for example for me to test in the range of 19 and never goes up and usually on test on myself I think okay not working whatever when I did the first pilot with 17 users oh and then I just think maybe I will ask them is it actually okay for them to do this task and then you're like oh actually not it's not as easy even if people have like PhD in computer science it has nothing to do is it easy or hard task to them you always need to make sure that they understand it they're capable to perform it and actually then you can set up the baseline correctly it's very important it's very important because if a person this is an easy task but you consider that having something like 300 and 400 is not easy you really need to do it correctly that's why individual training or calibration is paramount in most besides right now so I mentioned that you can still do some databases and instantiation in the case of like p300 in the case of these kind of systems you need to go for calibration it's like you cannot not do it it cannot be generalizable at least in the beginning like Norway why it happens as well it's also because right now as I had a coffee which is a stimulator my activity will be very different from when I don't have it it depends how many hours I have Sept it depends if I'm sleep-deprived it depends if I've been driving for six hours or not etc etc so maybe I go into details of results there are papers published but in yellow you can see the biofeedback in green and red you can see the random and no feedback and it was significantly better and obviously we have casted slides and different types like a cabe or an interesting cannot be always the interesting can be always boring but for example for the boring ones we actually instructed the lecturer not to just explain at all so it doesn't mean that it would be like formulas only but just like don't explain them at all so even if you're engaged in the lecture you like it you want to follow it you admire your professor here she's amazing you will just if he or she is not explaining anything he's just not gonna follow so we really wanted to tell the system so it's another example think about how you can test it if the conditions are realistic because we went for realistic application they actually done three different experiments with more than 100 unique subjects in this case I've even tried this at the workplace with the programming tasks it's very hard actually to do kind of realistic setups but we try to do something where we can control for the output of the user so in this case it was like someone like there are from their superiors who can set if the task was actually executed or not and this is the interaction I was talking about this is usually you don't see this in BC eyes and says really the direction to to do and to goal with we had the system that was functioning it's used something that is said inside we didn't even try to we have our own ideas for the algorithm obvious is it be tested but we really try to replicate what was in the state of that with the off shelf device it provided good promising results people stopped here most 99.9 percent of the CI research in the labs stops there they don't try to do something that could be released make available or made better in this case batch amines live again not 100% classification accuracy system but it is good enough to be tried out he may be in NASA from fector this is an example of the form factor its glasses in this case the first prototype we have a better version now since the paper accepted for hydropower be ascend this year it has actually gonna play as vedyam and you will see it has two modalities so it's another example of how you can compensate for improve faction of this guy you don't design for user who lives in ur in Mars he or she is still here has all the other disease modalities objects devices leverage them in this particular case the home factor was glasses you can have two positions of the glasses that are not used I would say they're really not used on the temple here no one is usually putting anything on the temple here and here you have Bluetooth speakers bone conduction whatever you want to have here you can have different lenses with different infrared cameras etc whatever but you really have two points that are not used like we reviewed like 20 of different pairs of glasses they're not used but you can put electrodes on them and on top of this II would have two modalities you will have ng and in your dream I movements and you can compensate for the imperfection of both of them because there is not a single physiological modalities that is perfect you name it I'm gonna tell you when it's gonna fail and why and also if you name a product is it I might work with for example I'm gonna even tell why it's gonna sell whatever it is right now is a market it is not providing you with 100% pacification courtesy but you can try to get one potential by combining it early fusion late fusion I will let you watch the video before I go further section almonds and anyway [Music] you're laughing but I had three users who literally have fallen asleep like you laughing about that careful generally for surprising me and yeah and don't forget you user will try to always see that it's not rock not working and he will always or she will always try to catch this so it's actually good feedback [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this was just to show that one improved design can cover not only imperfections by having another modality but can cover several scenarios it doesn't have anything else as information and you can still have several options for example we just submitted the paper but you can see that there is still another device that goes with it potential it's a haptic feedback why it is still there we actually did the study 36 users 30 preferred auditory to haptic 6 who had EDD EDG preferred haptic strongly to auditory you need to have options for the user it might be a minority but they will not use it at all if they consider that it was distracting for them auditory feedback was distracting for the rest of people uses a reporter that it was amazing they liked it so do a lot of iterations it works it's not gonna work 100% we're trying to put it on one whole person we are doing like this I could feel from but right now the third version that I'm working in is actually fully graphene-based for example so it's another fun factor it's gonna be like it's a tool it's fully transparent it cannot read visual imagination but that's not what the aim is we have a set up we have a set of users who want the system who want to try it out for hours and if it's what it does and if it's already validated it does where's invested it does worse a try don't forget that you have several categories you cannot maybe cover all of them but you can have different sub versions that can cover a lot of them depending what you are aiming for this is something that is usually not done in BC I like I cannot name a single product right now that is actually doing something in this direction I have one more just to actually show off once again in this Wayne and I'm gonna do this very fast but you actually we can also like finish because it's exactly one hour so yeah it's just like just to show something else it can go in this direction but it's really good for now yeah no I think it's actually one hour so I think we're gonna move on yeah I mean we can move on with the questions yeah if there's for example you want to see some like ours applicators definitely I can show you of some other system it's it's again in the same vein of it's completely different application in that case it uses actually multiple electrodes so it's nothing of the form factors that is like flexible section completely opposite but it's an example of how it can work also very well even if it's evil hook like octopus after you put it on we provoke the actual ruling and making lines to try it out just because you make something on top of it so yeah but we can already take if you like want your questions it is like urgent we can do that just like one iteration of completely opposite system yeah yeah so what happened actually on my desk right now in the lab and I think body also should once everyone right now in tulip wants it I have a lamp it's a lamp just was like bulb and it's red when I'm engaged into something it means do not try to approach me I'm gonna be like very angry crocodile if you have tried to it means I'm in the flow of the task the thing is that this flow state it's really very short it will never exceed one hour except if you're a trained sportsman like Olympic sports man I have worked with this category refuses like Formula One etc you if you are not and you're just in civic space it's never gonna exceed one hour one hour 15 tops if I go on yellow blue eventually or green and the pallone you but in the case of like if you're gonna be bothered it will actually because you are trying to internally rehearse for example presentation and someone will come over like your internal combo and say oh could you please sign this document for me and I'm like I have this ledge to rehear saying you I don't have time oh just one second he or she doesn't understand the effect but you can actually visually show them the effort with the lamp yeah it will buzz because you basically broke it down but then it will stop because actually there is obvious a point I mean we have tried different vibrations different iterations it's not going to bars non-stop but we can definitely see that you are not engaged with the task on hand that you were doing so there's a huge change between what you have been doing at literally time - one is a time T and if the change is big and it's going to be big if it's a switch between atomic strands that's what I show you on with those like studied through electrons we're gonna bars because it's not gradient as I have shown you with computations with mental calculus it was switch and it was but it never dropped for that particular user from 68 to 1 never ever that means is there's a huge switch and a huge change and this is if it was not classified as a movement because in real time obviously we check out these ones and because the top we have ERG that canal should provide us a lot of other information we can definitely make know for sure what is happening around you yeah indeed very real so you really need to do each user and even if for example for returning users because there was over three weeks I'm gonna do because every even assigns their own headsets and their own likes cars and grasses etc I'm gonna do it even if they take it off I'll front paisa jetsam take them off during lunch you don't need to be attentive during launch you want to be a creative to talk some nonsense with your colleagues with your like loved ones take them off you don't need them you don't want to maybe be attentive at all times but do the calibration once you get back because it's different it's completely different stage and actually where helps a lot when you show the images for example how your brain was at time one how your brain actually changes but of activity in this case changes at time t plus 1 because you usually don't know that you don't understand at all I didn't learn this and I just looked just checked very quickly my 3,000 if occasion so I was there but I was there but when you show the cost of switching in the points of how long will it take you to get back on your task in the same state of fools you have been that makes a huge difference for the user because then he is like oh oh wow I didn't know that I said it's good to be interrupted not always actually not at all so what of things that you can leverage is showing our users what is to be done and what is not to be done and usually we do not do that I just shown a couple of size definitely helps in the end of the day and they're like oh that's what happened that's what I did but you do need to calibrate if you want really good results I find it I have like real a lot of data generalization model is not like it especially the intention it's special with attention so there are two references here they just close to each other so you don't see them in the design of the glasses one for ERG one for eg then we calculate the difference obviously you do need this and then on the size of the notes you have EOG as you know maybe for eg usually most of the research has done around the eyes for horizontal vertical movements you don't need to do this you just need to do obviously very heavy signal processing but you can get if you have three electrodes here the beauty is that I don't know if you know from actual and this image is it's not our prototype I should have cited this one it's debonair 20 no it's mirror week 2016 frontiers in human neuroscience so this is around is a full set around eh 10 electrodes but actually two electrodes at exactly where my electrode goes for the temples here in the temple point are actually exactly for horizontal and vertical eye movements as well let's again I didn't include any of the same process and I know it's kind of technical just because then we will never end up here and it will be not to talk about their three-day seminar but this is exactly these little details once you have one modality can you leverage something to get a better classification output for another modality and the answer is usually yes you can definitely we have tried to do this with IDI with heart rate with some relatives it works better with someone else it works worse but that the magic of it usually with a special with light fusion you get a better signal so yeah this is one this is patented so I cannot really tell you how ya do it but in the papers that are in BS now in BSN Pepitone says this hopefully if the papers accepted we will provide it's very transform and common filter so we will provide a version of how you can do this it is I can say right away it's going to be worse but it is still comparable our accuracy to the one that is you are getting when you place them around the eye so yeah yeah yeah yeah I have calibrated so I have several users who are coming back users are humble those who have a dddg they found the system useful so they actually contact me to get back on the task some of them I just have like my Internet's and some other people in the lab that I need to try it out urgently and so yeah I actually knows the values and the actual knows the system variable which helps a lot and the thing is that you always need to calibrate it and the values are usually for example I know that let's say for user 1 whoever it is or he's I know that this is the actual range I just used to because I worked with him a lot I interviewed him a lot I observed him a lot and actually it's not gonna really ever change dramatically but once it happened he actually got in term some issues was his supervisor and he was very distracted and I saw this I was like okay we didnt calibrate okay so it's like well some kind of something is happening I don't understand why then I'm like hey talker or something is there some fine I think I mean let's drop those sorry I think it's not working but then it's like ever sounds good impedance check everything like since okay and then we just actually talked huh and then I yeah I found this out so it's interesting that you can see the patterns obviously in for this case he would need to wait four days or four weeks but actually I had on my cell phone through other people use it for 14 days in a row they're trying to have it like for an hour for one month in a row to see the difference and there it'll be something interesting because then you have a potential enough of data for one user at least for prediction what is going on because we definitely see the difference when a person is having a deadline for the paper and when there is no deadline for the paper the actual average range for the whole week is gonna be higher number of hours of sleep shorter number of steps shorter like we got it's like in the paper and I see you know you have this additional values your system bust one or two times in a greatly no-one will actually pay attention in this case because you have actual predictions and is based not only on one modality but in that case on three four or five but yet you would need to calibrate foolish of them but you actually see interesting trends and we try to see out on the longer period if actually we can confirm what we observe in drift over time yes so gel based you know the story there gel it's gonna be really like stoning your hair in within one hour thirty two hours you need to reapply it I have heard recently that they're trying on there is in conference they're trying to have some like interesting like not washable like a drive shampoo style so you just do these and you're fine to go the problems it it really starts like two each so present starts more and so this moves that it moves a beach their headset you are done with the signal you really need to reapply everything do the impedance check again especially if you have multiple eyebrows there's the case I had had caps for the hydrogen for example for the glasses I do use silver I found it's much better than stainless steel but actually like even little details like say the screws the material was this crews I'm making them in brass I am making them some cells will change the signal it's so so so obvious but not with this yet for example so silver obviously are only if you have makeup obviously it will not provide you good signal all the other cases if the hair here is looking like my case as it's like not covered on pretty short it will be all good and obviously I would say no drift except excessive excessive it but in heat I haven't seen yet a single physiological sensors that can survive hit let's be very honest then the problem with hydrogel should be hydrated once you do it beforehand it will last for one hour then need to reapply moisture all right usually it's actually they do it like this little like wipe so it's actually very easy and they're pretty comfy the wrongs that once i smoosh it it slides a bit so this is immediate drift in your signaling you to make sure that it is actually really staying in place so I would say is there is nothing perfect I personally do believe a lot in Gurfein I have tested a lot we haven't published yet the problem is noise it picks up single noise it is around here like environmental noise like you name it it's gonna be there the problem is that or like actually the amazingness of my penis that this stays in put in da heat now extinct it may be but if you don't like literally take it out it's gonna stay put and there is no drift significant drift over five to eight hours of what I have been wearing big shower so basically it went off there's no it's like disposable so this is also good they claim in there all the initial papers where they have tested that it can go up to five days haven't tested it I can say that I would believe it because the pressure at work was text University of Texas and was investor of morale where they actually print them out and then I must interesting packages of those so actually I do believe that it might be interesting because I didn't see any drift was in five to eight hours was this one whatever is actually happening around once again no makeup for me mine on those heat it was hot it was summer it was winter everything obviously much Robert all like I know wash your face the problem with those obviously it should be skin contact she cannot put it somewhere in the hair does the same using straight silver or solution chloride it's straight silver natural silver so I tested was versus silver silver chloride versus stainless steel versus like copper like I will answer everything a natural silver is the best but is the highest connectivity 92.5 is natural sewer and when it's polished it gives you three extra percent of conductivity funny but once again small detail that can change in your case when the contact might be less so it's like once again just example of how you can really think about it and the design can improve it you also do need obviously the compliant design in this case because it's glasses so all this this is electrodes this is silver we tried there like this is silver like pure silver when it's like silver coated it da you do lose in connectivity you do isn't the quality of signal but you do need to obviously or equilibria for there are the electrons that you have because if then it will be too heavy your users not going to wear it so it's again once of the details you need to think about but it was a good little I was actually thinking through brain stem the problems that they have a little battery inside of them and when the plane I really didn't want to obviously get a case and I was actually wanted to bring them it's just normal glasses yeah and in the current version this is the published in BSN and the current version it's actually even slimmer you can it I mean we want to try to really get it slim as we can it will depend on the size of the components battery capacity of the battery so actually planning some trips to career into China to mitigate those because they can also do a lot for you and this is something something that BCI community is not looking at all like at all there are some companies that do produce amplifiers 3040 km if I does not cause 30 or 40 K let's be very honest this PCB oh it has two electrons okay nos okay in total of six electrons actually is to be very honest well it stays likes to PCBs on true size that's enough once again it's not gonna be visual imagery is not gonna be motor images nothing fancy fancy but for one applications that might be enough say
