 hi everyone thank you for joining the talk today this event is in collaboration with the happiness festival organised by the happiness Institute the festival supports the WHL Kovach Relief Fund you can see the donation details we are you to be giving all donations can be matched double by Google we're honored today to have professor Anderson Berg joining us to discuss mind uploading and future of happiness professor Anderson Berg is a neuroscientist science debater philosopher futurist transhumanist and author Anders is currently based at the University of Oxford's future of humanity Institute where his research centers on societal and ethical issues surrounding human enhancement and new technology and there is an advisory boards of a number of organisations and often debates science and ethics in international media let's welcome Anders on stage thank you so much for having me so this has certainly already made my day in terms of happiness so without further ado I want to talk a bit about mind uploading and happiness which is of course my excuse to actually get into my kind of research which is about the large-scale future of not just human but all for so internet life in the universe and what we can say about its limits now my current research project I call it grand futures suppose we survive and we get their act together I know that might sound very much like a tall order right now but so far we have survived and we certainly are aware that we have problems and even are trying to deal with it if we manage to overcome them then what how big and good could the future be so my research is looking into not just the ways the inner things could be a turn into a disaster but also if we survive what can we do with it so you could say that I'm looking a bit at the physical limits of utopias and besides all the niceness for deeply explain from a positive future there of course these cliche ideas that well it should have material post-scarcity we should have overcome all the limits for matter and energy in a sustainable way so we can get whatever we want that's the most old-fashioned idea about a really good future and we can get that arbitrary amount of foods we have with nice shelter we have Pleasant music indeed we are already real already living in a post-scarcity society by the view of medieval people they could probably hardly imagine that there was anything that could become better and what we can't get got except of course that we might aspire to a little bit more and we also can notice that it's not just stuff that you care about there is only so much chocolate you can eat per day and once you have one goal than the palace well ten more is not going to actually help there much but we might want other services indeed the medieval person might not envision that possibility of being able to talk to people or away have automatic translation translate things or have the people or software do things for them but they themselves couldn't do you could also envision a form of service post-scarcity a future where we have machine learning and automation that actually means that most work can be done there of course interesting questions already here about unemployment and what do you feel your life with when the most things can be done really really well another form of post scarcity might be infrastructure we're all dependent on a good vast global infrastructure many of which part we don't understand at all the different levels underlying the internet protocols make it possible for you to hear me or bewildering and many of the pieces of software are very very complex and that has a tiny part of a bigger system and of course even the material infrastructure of electricity and heating and food and fuel is very complex it's too fragile and we sometimes get fluctuations but we don't understand definite don't--what even worse in many developing countries the infrastructure is really bad and the main thing holding them back is that it's very hard to build that infrastructure now if we had really good robotics and automation we could imagine that building more robotics and automation to build that infrastructure we could imagine the robots in the using solar power to build more solar panels to power even more robots to build even more solar panels but actually braid sustainably a new source on a very large scale there are many forms of infrastructure we care about computing of course we health infrastructure again we could totally imagine that in the future we might be able to automate parts of medicine though we might have as much medical care we could wish for but that's setting our sights too low I think because we might also want to actually modify ourselves so we're truly healthy there are many things that are underlying the illnesses that we currently can't do they're much about like aging now if we can fix aging or if we can fix the molecular causes so many diseases that would really improve things however there is one form of post-scarcity I seen the practically never mentioned and that this happens what if we could have a future where we also have no scarcity of happiness so right now we might actually be living in a dark age of happiness scarcity it's pretty clear but many places and many people could be happier so if you ask people you generally find that the image right a lot of developed countries people are fairly happy but even in developed countries you find out a great deal of areas between different countries and if you go to developing countries and especially places that are serious trouble so that they're torn by famine and war or bad governor's you find that their people are not very happy we could get off into an interest in tangent here about how much we believe these kind of big happiness studies but it's pretty clear that things can change both the better or the worse overall when you do the same measures over time you find that the country's general attempt to become happier but not always for example we can see that in Greece in Greece people were pretty happy upon till the crisis hit in 2007 and then unhappiness estate Eastern Europe still bears the imprint of the years of the communist rule which has generated a robber gloomy outlook which seems to be fairly persistent and of course this is also true for many smaller groups you have communities that both because of external factors or internal factors are not as happy as we could be some good news is that we generally tend to underestimate how happy other people are if you ask a member of a society how happy the rest of the members of a society are they generally tend to underestimate is quite strong it we tend to think that we are doing pretty well and all the others are really sad and gloomy but it's not true they're about as happy as we are but still even individually there are enormous differences some people are naturally dark and gloomy others are very cheap and cheerful this is called the head-on accept point it seems that just like if we have a weight set point a part of hypothalamus that estimates roughly how much fatty tissue we have and tries to make you more so you get up to that setpoint if you have too little and the loose appetite if you eat if you had too much and unfortunately in most of us we set point a certain width and higher than it's healthy for us on a modern diet we seem to have a head-on except when we return to again this seems to be an internal feedback system when external events happen we get happy or sad and then they overtime to him to return it's not a complete return when there are famous studies showing that when people win the lottery or or in an accident and become a paraplegic of course initially they become much happier much more sad and then they return to the baseline they don't return completely but the most intensive it's actually about we adapt to anything the sad part is of course we can adapt even to bad circumstances and they say oh it's not so bad we might want to sometimes be able to notice when we're actually in a bad circumstance and say no I actually need to struggle get angry and get out of this one of the other hand quite a lot of human unhappiness is because we're in the problematic situation we can't do anything about and then we just feel that misery this is of course as endless source of inspiration for poets and philosophers thinking about the human condition moaning about our mortality or all the other things that make life not quite as good but there is another thing the well worth moaning about but that's the hedonic spread thread mill it turns out that well when I get something pleasant over time if I get more of it I even get saturated like eating a lot of chocolate or I just habit rate it if I'm everyday greeted by somebody singing a beautiful song for me after a while I will want different songs and different styles and I'm not going to be said that satisfied and I buy the same thing unfortunately this of course leads to us becoming unhappy but it has an interesting side effect it makes a seek out new stimuli and that gets us over here any interesting question why do we have happy what is it really good for and I think the honest answer is it's evolutions fault evolution is not so much survival of the fittest as survival of the least inadequate as long as you do something's right and get offspring that can send your genes forward those genes are going to survive it so organisms that did the right thing often enough they tended to survive how do you then show her that the right thing happens well a very simple thing is to have a simple sensor for example for neutrons and if that cells are accidentally get connected to something that makes water and swim in the direction of nutrients you're going to have a fairly successful organism but that's very simple-minded the reality of the world is a bit more like a maze you need to have better plans so what happens is that you get intervening layers in this neural network we start getting things that very very roughly approximate the value of actions or situations so bacteria would find themselves in a low nutrient sea in the situation they detect that and then start swimming in some random direction they don't know where nutrients are but anywhere is better than this place other systems notice that this seems to be good enough and let's stop doing anything let's stop moving and gradually you can of course build out to make this Network more and more complicated and this leads to what we in vertebrates called reinforcement learning which started out as a theory in psychology but well rewarding stimuli lead to animals doing more of actions but led to those rewarding stimuli well I learned is rewarding or painful stimuli makes the animals avoid that that gradually turned into a computational theory it was an ax modeled mathematically and then including the computer software and this now of course amazingly successful in the world of machine learning because now we can get deep neural networks that try to estimate the value of actions and situations and without human intervention other than defining where the rewards are coming in trying to optimize behavior and this of course leads to all sorts of creative and unexpected that sometimes very very useful the results google deepmind has of course made that big name for itself by working on that but the general theory is interesting because it actually seems to suggest that the things that are closely related to happiness in aussie you must but also because they're related the things that we actually are doing a fair bit of machine learning and neuroscience about indeed when you start looking into the brains of mammals you find the different systems in motivation in to be responsible for slightly different things there are the one thing systems as some people call them that creates desires for doing certain things there you see an opportunity for getting food or in a gifting amazing or avoiding something and then there seem to be liking systems the what systems when actually when they're activated correspond to pleasure and these ones are intended to substitute the third part learning so normally what happens is that when you encounter something pleasant that was better than you expected then you get the likely reaction and also you learn to want to be in that situation next time the conflict say and this is very successful except of course when you encounter something like an addictive drug about short circuits this old system or where you encounter situations where you actually can't learn the right thing and instead you learn random responses so skinner the behaviorist psychologist famously had these pigeons in cages but he could use operant conditioning to train indeed during the second world war he actually trained them to pick the pictures of enemy airships and he was suggested to the US military that they could be used to correct the missiles and images as my psychology textbook and Riley wrote unfortunately the brass didn't think didn't trust the weapons of his patriotic vigil so they never got a chance to show their math which was probably had the safest thing to do if we think we have a bit of problem about ensuring verification of validation for our software just about Egypt but that aside one thing Skinner noticed was when you reward a pigeon just randomly it will quite often continent associate that with what you did just before and do that so if a pigeon happened to have been the twirling around just before you gave it so seed it will try it whirling around much more yet see it's the very end result is a lot of pigeon superstitions and while we might laugh at that well look at gamblers indeed look at most of us when reducing software we do all sort of weird little rituals which actually don't have anything to do with reality but just was because the rewards and Punishment we get from the software accidentally after all and a slow loading webpage is also a form of punishment why is that a punishment well it's a neutral stimuli but we expected something better and we get something slightly worse those improv differences is really what we care about this is a reason we have such a problem with our only threatening similarly if things are happening randomly that's usually a stronger learning signal which is again why people get the big gambling another interesting thing is of course but it's not obvious why this fields good we could imagine that this is just neutral signals yet happiness a pleasure feels happy unpleasant and it's deep philosophical and perhaps psychological or even physical question why there is a feeling linked to that and all super self of course talked about happiness for thousands of years literally and quite early on there was an important realization but yeah there is the kind of happiness you get when you get a piece of chocolate or hear a beautiful piece of music for the first time or if your mouse get a piece of cheese it's the hedonic happiness it's the pure pleasure but many people do other things that the clay make them happy and typical of your complex projects their meaningful things it might be doing things for parity it might be teaching people it might be climbing mountains when you climb a mountain it seems that most steps are actually fairly unpleasant you're cold you're wet you're in danger you to exert yourself and probably when you reach the peak of a mountain you're probably not feeling that great order yet they kick off getting up there and especially afterwards when you say oh yes I climbed that mountain makes it very very meaningful indeed when where it does didn't deeply into a happy in the form of work or activity as we it can be we tend to forget about ourselves behind Csikszentmihalyi one of the leading your positive psychologist he's been working with the condition he calls flow when we're totally engrossed at work and he noticed that when you do that you're not thinking about you and indeed we can see this in brain scans when people are in a flow state those neural networks that are normally involved in thinking about who we are where we are and the things like that they did get deactivated it looks very suggestive like the self actually dissolves when we're really happy with this form of thermal it happens now living a life of just pure evil demonic happiness might be a struggling life you're doing meaningful things but you're not getting that much pleasure living the through the hedonic life well lots of pleasure but you might not have much meaning the really flourishing you my life presumably is a combination you do get your chocolate but you also get to savor their people and inspire people and the reason this happens is probably that we are hijacking their mechanism evolution built into us evolution just wanted us to do the right thing often enough and learn that and one useful thing is to learn particular paths if you're solving a maze if you learn a good trick you want to reuse that it becomes a little goal on its own you might know what you need to get to a particular crossing if you think the cheese is in a particular corner and then that's some go becomes something that is rewarding on its own because you know once you get to that crossing the cheese is not far away if I'm doing math and my parents or teacher pet me on my head when I'm doing here and I saw math as a good boy I might learn how to associate that math is nice and gradually I internalize that the valorn a pleasure I get from doing math no longer is dependent on people as a man Patti mama help them tell me I'm doing fine I'm generating myself and before I know it I'm going to be majoring in mathematics at university we create our own sources of happiness which is an astonishing fact and I think it's a deep question for us in computational neuroscience and machine learning to try to figure out how does this balance itself because it seems like we should get addicted to this and although of course the critical spouses and the outsiders might say that we are a bit too addicted to our books or computers or projects it seems like we're not spiraling into something useless it's not like a drug addiction that takes over everything mathematics might certainly make you have been boring at the cocktail party at least if non mathematicians around but it seems to actually function well why this system is stable is a really important question and I don't think we actually understand that general it seems like building smart sustainable pleasures that tend to be open-ended that's the trick to get around the satiation and the habituation sure I learned and solve that mathematics problem but another mathematical problem towers behind that I might realize that oh I knew so little there are more domains of knowledge and that's an ever ending growth which also is useful maybe for writing papers maybe for so the important problems out in the real life finally of course many philosopher point out that the reason we are happy might actually be for other things evolution certainly don't care about our happiness or pain there are just tools for getting more fit offspring in the long run and similarly you might argue that many forms of happiness or just we feel happy in order to make us pursue things like justice or excellence more about that later but I think it's an important realization that happiness itself might not be the endpoint it's a signpost but that if something is going well but we might want to know that this the direction we're going in actually is a good direction rather than a pleasant one I spent far too much time yesterday when I should have been preparing for his talk playing a computer game because it was rewarding me so much it was difficult enough to give me a challenge and I was forgetting myself that was forget in time but after doing the best for two hours I realized what have I been doing I've been fighting a fictional enemy in a little fictional world and although there are some interesting feelings about strategy I might pretend to have learned from it in the end it didn't matter that maybe I should have been reading a good book or taking a walk or talk to some friends so can we become happier well the first way of doing back - supposed to fix needless suffering there is an important question about whether any suffering is valuable maybe we could just be moving around on gradients of bliss as Dave Peirce put it in his amazing the hedonistic imparative which is a philosophical work where he is arguing that we should remove all pain and suffering we can from ourselves but all animals and the rest of the universe and try to read the sign ourselves completely that is my second approach let's increase positive feelings in a sustainable way but already fixing the needless suffering it seems to be quite unimportant their way of starting so mental illnesses or sadly very very coma a lot of people have depression and anxiety that prevents them from enjoying life and obviously we have a lot of people in the world who are suffering from material scarcity that causes the deprivation and stress that then causes suffering so these things are worth fixing to become happier there is this general find them at becoming richer eventually levels off to a fair degree it's not that it ever stops you can actually become happy by getting ever more wealth it's just that you need ridiculous amount of wealth to improve happiness when it's really really high on the other hand helping people who have very little help you know the wealth is actually in there quite efficient so there are interesting things here where were many and neglected questions about suffering we might want to work on and of course if you're more of a universalist like some of my colleagues at the center of effective altruism they point out that a lot of animals are suffering not just an elaborate amounts or animals and in the factory for me but even while that mouse heart do not have life sir that or a bad nice evolution doesn't care about their suffering we might want to do something about but another interesting question is are we very good at being happy and it turns out that the results from cognitive science is that you must are surprisingly bad at recognizing things that they enjoy you can do all sorts of psychological experiments where you can see that people don't excuse the things that would make them happy sometimes because we don't recognize that it does make them happy but quite often even when they know it would make them happy they still don't do that sometimes that is because we mix up in the medium for the thing that they are trying to get the world the classic example is money though it turns out that a lot of people are trying to acquire a lot of money because that allows you to buy things that could make you happy but many people get very obsessed about getting the money rather than and this happens if it's a plastic tokens and chimpanzees - you know experiments have demonstrated that you can get chimpanzees to work very hard to get plastic tokens that allow them to buy bananas and now we start hoarding the plastic tokens we stop treating the plastic tokens as if they were the valuable thing instead of a bananas and I think this is a fairly common problem we do measure the wrong thing and then they pursue that you could say this is a formal counterfeiter utility but could we actually make yourself happy directly but to the left in this slide I have a picture of one of the rolls rats in the old classic paper about sending signals into the pleasure centers of the brain although that paper never called them pleasure centers it was written back in the 1950s when behaviorist psychology was ruling the world and you don't talk about mental states you can only look at behavior according to behaviorism so this paper described how he put electrodes into the rats and the electrode stimulated the rats when they pressed a button in the cage and they started pressing the bottom like mad and nowhere is there any mention about happiness or pleasure it took several years off the disk before olds in a scientific American article actually started calling it a pleasure sir and they admit that it was obvious that the rats were enjoying it because you could see it in their faces if you're around lab rats and all enough he will start recognizing their facial dynamics now the interesting thing about this stimulation which is going into this wanting a liking system is that it doesn't have a tray basically the rats kept on pressing as much as we could there are these stories that they would starve themselves to death in the robber and stop the press in the bottle they're a bit exaggerated and mixing up the difference emulating a different part of the brain but it is a very special form of fair stimulation the fact that it doesn't habit rate is both very positive in one sense but also seems to suggest that this is something that could lock you into an endless feedback indeed a lot of people and to think about why you're heading this way they see this as the epitome of a modern overstimulated world where we're all making super delicious food with maximum amount of sugar and taste and the saturator media in all sorts of ways in order to induce us to consume more and we end up a bit like the rats literally in the rat race trying to get tokens like money and buy more sit stimuli and do more that's not just problematic from the sense of doing something useful it might also be a bad feedback now it turns out that humans and rats are not quite a single mind alike that indeed it turns out that if you just stimulate the liking system you don't get one thing which sounds really weird because normally we're always getting together if I find something enjoyable I will want it but it might be possible to actually make things that are totally enjoyable without creating that acquisitive desire indeed the amount uncountable philosopher or give this is what underlying proper aesthetic enjoyment you watch a beautiful painting but it's not like you need to have affecting it's that you enjoy the beauty itself for what it is and this is how we ideally of course should enjoy each other we should enjoy each other's presence not just because we're useful to each other or sexy but because each of us is a wonderful person in themselves it also turns out that there might be possible to biologically modify these set points so I think to genetically have gotten a pretty good lottery the win I'm a very chipper and cheerful person other members of my family are either very chipper or very gloomy it seems like we tend to get stuck in one setting exactly what genes are responsible is a bit unclear in some cases we know what genes are involved that there are some genes module set time to affect personality a little bit and there is at least one interesting case about painting sensitivity combined with a very natural high mood where the lady who got it she had been suffering for a lot of bad things for her life she's still cheaper and cheerful and she's functioning it's not like she's sitting at a corner drooling no he's happy grandmother it yes but he needs to be a bit careful when he she burns herself because she doesn't feel that now could we create this mmm gonna have a sustainable happiness but we improve our set points I think it's doable I think that's definitely what biology allows us to do excuse me one moment biology of course has all sorts of other annoyances let's there like caffeine so it might not be possible to get rid of all the problems indeed we don't want to get rid of all four so because we need to function in the world but certainly we can do much better this but what about software could we have had a software and not just software but her smile is on it well when I pet a cat I'm happy and the cat seems to be happy how do I know that well it's purring and it's not running away and probably I can use at the infer that the cat likes it because sometimes the cat even comes over and say sits in my lap in order to be petted that behavior reveals something even though we're somewhat different in theory it might be that cats absolutely hate to be petted but they're all making this mistake before putting put them as even in two laps to the so they get at them and they really hate that and that forced them to return to laps but that's a crazy model of how pets or you must work in practice we know the cat brains and human brains worked around the same way and is pretty unlikely that we would consistently do things that we hate but what about a piece of software if a little robot in curl up in my lap and look like I should be petting it do I know it's enjoying the petting it could of course you have to be that somebody has programmed it so it's an empty gesture it could also be that it's a reinforcement learning agent and somebody programmed it but it gets reinforcement signals from being petted that doesn't necessarily mean that it's experiencing pleasure when I pet it it could just be that it's updating a number but this of course gets to the problem that what do I know that the cat is actually experiencing pleasure it's a your thrall updating euros indeed when I'm enjoying things I'm updating yours I happen to know this is linked to actually being happy but if I can accept that neurons in my brain updating in the right way produced pleasure why not cats in that case why not robots you could say well we know how that works look the program is rather simple but then again biological neural network for what the gory biological complexity might also be fairly simple it might just be that it's the function the way they try to give a perception perception to behavior that matters this is of course an endless source of debated glossop of mind now one way of exploring this would be of course to simulate things so I've been working on the brain emulation so what's sometimes called mind uploading I don't quite like the word mind uploading because it's already suggests that we know how to move a mind up into the cloud and first of all we don't know whether this would actually be a way of moving mind because we don't answer what minds or I know what brains are I know I got one in my head I attached a few in there in the lab and we roughly know how they work we can also slice them up and scan them and reconstruct a neural network we can run simulations or small neural networks on big computers we can connect the simulation to virtual worlds and get work virtual behavior we still haven't succeeded in emulating an entire animal if I've been working for a long while over C elegans nematode which has free hundred free neurons but unfortunately it's rather hard to get exact spraying for the connections right to make a model that works really well but we get in there it might be that the fruit fly actually is going to be the first animal where we have a one-to-one model of every neuron modeled by one or a computation on Europe and then me of course we can start your on the experiment once we get to the virtual Mouse now we can start doing experience like old stimulating year the pleasure centers and presumably if everything works out we should see the same behavior does that tell us that the mouse software actually is now experience Marcus not necessarily it might just be that it's behaving like an animation a very complicated animation screen with no content but it might also be that it's experience something indeed we get two interesting ethical problems at this point because I'm certainly not around to pinch a mouse in the lab in the tail for no good reason that would be animal cruelty and I might lose my license to do animal experimentation if I were to do something like that but what about using a virtual reality glove and the grab the virtual tail of the virtual mouse virtual the signals get sent to the brain emulation and the result is that the mouse runs away from my hand and hides in a corner have I caused some virtual pain here or some real pain this is something that we don't really know we can't but it seems like the best safe approach would be to say yeah this is close enough to what we might expect real animals to behave like and it's based on the real animal we actually do know we need to care a little bit about morally we should not do this now if we could get brain emulation or even normal software that could have feelings we would also have a kind of ethical plutonium on one hand this is brilliant we can produce a lot of happiness in the world on the other hand we have a terrible terrible responsibility to not bring in unhappiness if you could have robots but suffer or feel pain you probably shouldn't marry get very kick them so Boston Dynamics might actually have a problem here since make them to kick the robots quite a lot to demonstrate the balance but if they feel pain that's a bad thing to do indeed but we might want to think very carefully about making very powerful software and if it can feel because it could actually produce tremendous amount of suffering or for that matter tremendous amount of happiness and at least if your head honest you might now say yeah we should be feeling all our and a data service with that software which would be running at the screensaver we should span the world with that software because it's just going to make the world so much of a better place that's going to be an interesting situation if we have not been it so if it turns out that the good thing in the world is happiness like the hedonist say then we should obviously just make more brains how many more brains could make well it turns out that on earth of course you have a lot more people in principle if we decided to just ignore natural ecosystems we could have a few trillion people in the inverse tie our colleges they're surrounded by soybean fields or if you really use nanotechnology and the fusion reactors you could have something like 10 to the 16 people living in a worldwide the super building this is very much 1960 science fiction if you do something milder and you're saying yeah we might expand out in space building space habitats eventually go to other stores then it turns out that inside the reachable universe there is about room for something like between 10 to refer to 8 to 10 to the 47 human lives across the future assuming that we stay as biological creatures and they use carbonate water most numbers don't mean anything to you they don't mean anything to me because it's very just ridiculously large numbers right now we're almost tempted to tell people on earth but that's nothing compared to 10 to the 38th we can't imagine that not a large number of might and that's of course just brains living normal lives what if we could exist a software brains they could be a lot more effective so it turns out that one of my sub tightest was how much happiness can you beget by water and kilogram and probably the optimum is going to be something like quantum dot Zillah automata they're very very energy efficient ways of using non adults that can flip between different states and they can do this very fast and if you use the for future of the universe and all the mass energy we can get our hands on before it expands away we can get up on the order of 10 to the 100 lifetimes of human equivalent brains if they are happy and that aggregates that's an amazing amount of happiness but for Google and their lifetimes of happiness but of course it might be that there are other architectures that can just be much much happier and there are reasons to think that after all stones don't tend to have much happiness it seems like the introduction of life and this to the conscious life added something to the universe that wasn't press present before and that boosted the total amount of le quite a bit it might very well be that there could be other levels about that may be various happiness Prime that's way better than mere happens and we have to discover that in the future super civilizations it looks like there is potential for way more it could of course also be that just having bigger brains allows you to be happy through it turns out that mice have about 25,000 euros in the ventral tegmental area one of the ports of liking search you must have 18 times more important therefore 450,000 years can you must be 18 times happier the mice maybe maybe not I don't think we have any good idea about whether that thing even make sense which we can sort of be happy in more complex ways Minds can be happier about gzip and the other things we can be happy about cheese and companionship to but we also can be happy about science happy about oh I built a cathedral but future generations might like oh I'm understanding Sofia about the nature of happiness I think we actually have extra kinds of happiness that are way more valuable and that Shane might continue to the future so the lowest of physics limited amount of computations we can do maybe experience that happiness is not computational per se but it certainly requires you to remember things about what you're happy about and you continue your mental state from moment to moment so we can use the computations to bound the total amount of kind of happiness computation that can be and that's a very large number on board of a Google we simply can't imagine how much more it is and we have only just talked of course we might discuss whether we should aim at stoop rabbit generally for humans right now happiness is a good thing it's not just about the life that is going well makes you happy if you're a happy person your life tends to go better because you're nicer to be around you're more likely to get know you're more I'd like you to work on that task that needs to be done so there seem to be a pretty strong feedback you're going now this is another reason to work against unhappiness if you're gonna make sure we actually get that helpful well-being but there's an attractive point we don't know where there is a preparedness totally stories about why you're heading and drug abuse shows you don't want the wrong kind of habits you can be state of total bliss that is not sustainable eventually the heroin runs out eventually you have to get a job but there are other forms of happiness that seems to be sustainable and if some people who learn how to master very impulsive and go around in the state of this and most importantly what we want to avoid is false happiness signals counterfeit utility but this is what happens in the case of the wire heading here my Surat whenever they press the button their brain gets told about what they did was right the good it actually doesn't matter it doesn't help your life go better except getting into a paper in a journal for another species but in this case what we would like to have is of course whether happiness is linked to things that are actually valuable many philosophers so well be or given actually our happiness is a tool to aim at doing meaningful things in life and we should try to figure out ways of meeting these false signals this is a little bit like good hearts law in the economics and social planning but when you have an index or something good once you try to optimize for that it stops being a good index and similarly many of our happiness signals behave like that so back to the present when we're right now if they are alone before we have any brain emulations and really good ways of fixing your brains but we can still do quite a lot of important things first of all if the future is as grand as it looks like it could be then we better ensure that it happens we better make sure we survive and fried because we are here at the start of history we actually do get the chance to set some imagined and react to it and if we could solve happiness as early as possible then there is going to be more second the nature of happiness itself is really under study this might sound weird because we've been talking about it there for thousands of years but positive psychology is a fairly jarnia domain using neuroscience to figure out what parts of the brain are involved in motivation and happiness and linking that to practical information isn't really under study there is so much more we can do there is way more papers about depression and the negative states which we really want to fix then there is about the positive states that we want to amplify but probably figuring out the positive states might actually be quite helpful for fixing the negative ones and finally there is a lot of small sources of unhappiness the false utility signals everywhere both in the impertinent personal life or as a civilization we might want to figure out how to solve that when the signals going into government makes the government to do stupid things because it's wire heading on the GDP for example it thinks that is some index of how well it's doing then that produces unhappiness of the civilization scale when I'm organizing about which is me to choose well for good I'm wasting my time I should just flip a coin or go evening meenie miney moe learning these patterns are very simple figuring out ways around some rules or some happen that we should spread to each other and then use to reduce unhappiness locally and globally that we can really really enjoy this wonderful universe we're living thank you thank you very much Anders for a fascinating talk I think give us extremely motive in the review on happiness we have we are taking a few questions let's take one question from the floor thank you for insightful talk and there's a is paying suffering universally bad campaign have positive effects anybody who enjoys biting into a whole chili knows what pain can sometimes be absolutely delicious but what's going on there is of course very no c-section the pain signals from your mouth because of the caps I see in their release is substance P and you know this is safe you know that you have not harmed yourself even though some nerves are screaming though that form of pain is controlled it doesn't turn into suffer the pain signal is quite important because you need to avoid harming yourself especially as a kid when you don't know what's safe and what's dangerous so I think there are good forms of pain there are harmless conservation there also unnecessary force a pain like it once you know you're harmed yourself and you know that you think you don't really need to be reminded about that all the time suffering is a bit more tricky or reforms of suffering that you know actually benefit from nothing also we say yes I'm so ashamed of that that suffering is hopefully a learning signal that makes me a behavior that's great up to a point but many of us go on in a teen night we'll wake up and I remember something bad I did a kid in school decades ago yeah probably the kid has hopefully forgotten about that but I'm on a wake up and suffering about stopping him maybe it's still adjusting my eye severity but most like it's just great let's take another question from audience isn't it possible that evolving to create our own reward introduced a long-term factoring our reinforcement learning gain function a factor that benefits the species rather than the individual some yeah this is a fascinating issue so evolutionary Biola has been having long-running argument about group selection or variable evolution happens that benefits the species or at least some a family or larger group rather than individuals or individual genes and the general consensus is something like it can happen but it's so fragile that it very rarely happens in general but we are a weird species we have a name for our own species we have several names we pray at institutions like the United Nations we've quite often lie awake at night thinking oh our species is doing stupid things we should stop doing that how can we set up institutions and incentives of the parameters reduced and this is of course a civilizational cognitive system in a sense in many ways a society and a civilization can be viewed very much like the mouse brain you have in the perception from the outside world you have barry schools of reinforcement signals generated inside and coming from outside and you have behavior we can actually construct our own reinforcement just the problem is sometimes we do this must be between and then they get eat but I think this is evolution we are going to be aiming at awesome so given our current global crisis that everybody is experiencing do you have any practical advice you can give to the global audience from your field of work I think generally having hope is quite useful because one of the big problems is in the modern media saturated world we always get to the most salient signals the signals that seem to be low probability or high amplitude something really horrible happened a foreigner in a faraway country we get to hear about it and we can imagine ourselves being suffering from that we hear about really uncannily unlikely a bad events or bad people this creates a weird probability distribution because we're building a probability distribution of what the world is like and the more of you watch the more afraid you're of being a right and the same thing is true also for all the other meet we need to find a way of adjusting them my personal pick when I'm noticing but I'm start to get riled up by the meet I go to our world in date and look at statistics it quite this thing stuff you actually can see what is the actual state here whatever trend and many of the trends were actually fairly okay there are still a lot of things to fight again there is a lot of poverty there is a lot of malaria there a lot lot of really crappy politicians and bad governance and Wars out there but actually we are doing a lot of things right and having that hope gives you the optimism know that things can get better and who I should be trying to help things up the pessimist might say yeah yeah that's not never gonna work and besides things are getting bad but when they're right well that's all fulfilling prophecy doesn't make them happy but optimist would say okay that didn't work let's try something else awesome I think that's a very wise advice to everyone experiencing Kovach right now so last question before we close the talk I think that the top cover is extremely wide disciplines and different views about happiness from meeting needs remove a suffering to a key component of human flourishing and especially there is a big element from the futuristic perspective which is mind blowing to spur eyes the talk what does happiness mean to you and how would you like the society is to think about happiness I think happiness is a form of learning as I explained earlier it's certainly a product of learning how to do things better but I also think the best force of happiness or those open-ended sustainable ones which means that you found something that is worthwhile to pursue in all sorts of directions no I think this wonderful thing about the universe which is really weird the laws of physics or really all the in that they seem to allow is open-ended exploration which is not easy any of these things are going to be required Mendes intelligence energy and the sacrifice to achieve but yet it looks like we're living our universe where we can grow and flourish that is wonderful and that makes me very very happy amazing thank you very much for the optimism and all the happiness that you bring to the audience today thank you again a professor Anderson Berg thank you everyone for watching a talk well please tune in for future talks at Google sessions thank you [Music] you [Music]
