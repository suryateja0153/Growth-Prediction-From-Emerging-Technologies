 Today we are going to talk on a very interesting topic which is a smart human i.e. a human brain with a microchip in it Friends welcome to my You tube channel “The Contentjunction” please subscribe to my channel and also press the bell icon to see all of my videos regularly Till now, you must have heard or read about Smartphone, Smart TV Smart Watch, Smart Car and even on Smart City you might have seen something but in this video we will talk about Smart Human Mind or you can say Super Human mind which might turn in reality soon in sometime from now You may not believe it it will probably sound like a science fiction movie to you right now but trust this it probably might not take a lot of time for all this to come true and all this might happen from the Project of world visionary Elon Musk i.e. Neuralink Yes, this is the same world famous Elon Musk who has earlier also completed the projects that seemed impossible earlier, , but he brought them to reality for example his company Space X which is a private company which sends rockets into space like NASA and ISRO not only this, the future goal of this company is to send humans to mars planet and also make human settlements over there Similarly, he has another company Tesla which made the dream of electric cars for the world, come true. So their Neuralink project is a very ambitious project which is in a very advanced stage on which they have already done on animals their experiment and analysis and after the approval of the American agency FDA, they are also going to start human trials on it, soon Lets discuss in details with you about this Word goes around that the reason this interesting project was started by Elon Musk primarily for 2 major reasons the first is at the speed with which artificial intelligence is taking control of our lives and the world and way it is developing then it is highly feasible that In the long run the biggest threat to the human race will come from AI i.e. Artificial Intelligence in such circumstances NeuraLink's implant in this human mind , this microchip might make our brain and the ability to think through at par with Artificial Intelligence or equal to any super computer and we will be able to do all that comfortably which seems impossible to imagine right now Another reason is that this micro-chip of the brain can cure many neurologically related diseases of humans to a great extent such as Alzheimer's, depression insomnia, coma, brain stroke paralytic spinal cord injury, etc. Now let's try to find out how it works People in their initial research found that human mind is like a device that first takes a lot of information captured as input and then by processing it gives Output here we can consider as the input device our eyes which is a very good high speed visual interface and for us it delivers directly to our brain all the captured information but our brain absorbs it very slowly and processes only little information comparatively at a slow pace thus gives less output against it but if somehow we can increase, the captured or stored information analysis and processing speed well enough then the output of the brain will also increase and therefore in the information input and output from our brain there will not be much of difference Keeping this in mind, Neuralink has created for the human brain a microchip whose latest prototype was shared by Elon Musk with people just a short time ago in which this brain micro chip looks like a small implant in the brain, which is almost as small in size as a small coin as seen by people and is only a few mm in size it also has many threads that are much thinner than our hair and there are many electrodes on each thread that will activate or stimulate all the neurons in our brain So that our brain can become very active and will probably work much faster because the neurons in our brain send to each other i.e from one neuron to another send chemical signals to each other which causes action potential which then causes an electric field to be generated and it will be caught by the electrodes attached to this micro chip and they will forward it to the microchip then this microchip will convert these signals into digital information and will further send them to the external device in the outside environment it is not only that we will be able to read these signals but we will also be able to write it and in the times ahead there are unlimited possibilities For the example, just imagine that you have to go to Russia for some work or you are traveling there for a few days during the holidays but you are not Russian and that is why you do not know the language there, the Russian language in the present time to learn a new language well i.e. reading, writing and speaking might take years However with this Neuralink's brain micro chip it might be possible in the coming time for you to get any new language in just a few moments downloaded in your brain and start using it or just think if Google Maps or any other map map is directly saved in your mind and gets updated on its own then how convenient it would be Right now we spend a large part of our life in school or college only in learning knowledge or information are spent and due to this we get many years of our life consumed in which we might do something even better but just picture this that you do not have to remember all this rather you can directly download all this information in your brain just like google or internet which might now be possible due to the Neuralink soon in the future roughly within 5 to 10 years from now or even earlier Elon Musk recently shared Neuralink latest prototype details and he also showcased a live demonstration on it in which NeuraLink from their experiment introduced to people their 3 pigs the first of which was Joyce was a normal pig in which they never put a chip and it behaved just like a normal pig then people were also introduced to second pig Dorothy who earlier in its brain had a microchip but has been taken out now and Dorothy also behaved like a normal pig then the third pig named Gertrude which in its brain since two months had microchip so when she ate food the signals associated with it were captured in that microchip and they were also sent to the external device which were analysed by Neuralink after this when the pig was made to walk with the help of this microchip they did analysis of this pig's brain development to make prediction of its limb movement which was an accurate forecast to quite an extent means they were able to tell in advance that how the pig will walk This can't be considered as a small achievement rather its a very big thing because due to this microchip implant we were able to read the mind of the pig a similar successful experiment Neuralink has done in past on mice Elon Musk thinks that with this microchip artificial intelligence can be combined with human brain to make super intelligence in the coming days That is, our human brain, which we can also call biological intelligence and the artificial intelligence symbiotic relationship means on the vision of both working together is said to be the basis of Neuralink project and its Brain Machine interface is in its microchip only which will not be implanted by any Doctor in human brain instead with great precision and accuracy through a robotic surgery it will be done by a surgical robot and the remote of it will also be with Doctor Well in Neuralink microchip's Brain machine interface is so powerful which we can estimate by realizing this fact that in today's era in one of the best BMI Utah array which is used to study epilepsy has just 100 electrodes channels whereas NeuraLink brain microchip currently has more than 1000 electrodes channels and it will become more advanced in the future It seems to be an expensive procedure at the moment, but Elon Musk believes that in the time to come the use of this technology will increase day by day and then it will also become cheaper NeuraLink says that this microchip will be easily implanted in the human brain and it will not be visible to anyone from outside Through its wireless charging technique it will also be able to recharge itself at night In fact, after considering these details it seems to be a revolutionary technology But in view of this, some people have also raised privacy and safety issues and expressed their apprehension on it that if this technology can transfer information from the human brain and also there might be possibility of some memories be erased at a later stage then Who and how will someone see that all this is happening in the right and reliable way at the same time, no one should use this technology wrongly, how will we ensure it Neuralink has shared that currently this research is still going on and they are trying to keep all factors in mind while working on it but this is certainly a huge silver lining for a lot of humans who are currently suffering from neurological diseases Alzheimer spinal chord injury People suffering from paralysis, depression, etc. Just think if in future if no person becomes brain dead due to this technology then how amazing this can be NeuraLink is trying to start human trials probably from the end of 2020 or 2021 So this was our video today , if you liked it, please subscribe to my YouTube channel "The ContentJunction" and like and share this video Thanks
