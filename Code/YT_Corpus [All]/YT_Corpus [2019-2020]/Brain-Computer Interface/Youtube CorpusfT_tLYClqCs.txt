 [Music] hi everyone welcome to infinity insights story this is Justin and in today's video we bring you the infinity insight story of the latest technology for today's topic we will tell you about what Elon Musk said about neural link and it's brain implants before we begin we publish new content every day so be sure to subscribe to our Channel and ring the bell to get notified about our latest videos as we are already a cyber to some degree let's begin this insight story of the latest technology in the upcoming years for the second time in two years entrepreneur and billion ariel and musk sat down with podcaster Joe Rogan to chat about the future of artificial intelligence AI and its role in the symbiosis of man and machine in their conversation musk revealed that the secret of brain stimulation linked start-up neural link which he co-founded is close to starting testing in actual humans but I I think it won't be too long I think we may be able to implant in your link in less than a year in a person I think the news comes after musk teased in February that the brain computer interface startup was working on an awesome new version back in july 2019 the company showed off plans to shoot holes in subject skulls with lasers and feed flexible threads of electrodes into their brains in July of last year neural Inc showed off plans to connect the human brain to machines by shooting holes in the skull with lasers and feeding flexible threads of electrodes into the brain in his most recent chat with Rogen musk revealed that the company's the implant is about one inch in diameter and has to be implanted by removing a small section of the skull musk downplayed the risks involved in such a procedure claiming that there is a very low for potential risk for rejection of the body it's a very low potential for rejection you can think of it like people put in you know heart monitors and you know things for epileptic seizures and deep brain stimulation obviously like you know hips and rent knees and that kind of thing so the probability of I mean like it so it's well known like what will cost rejection what what will not mosque like in the process of his neural stimulation device zapping the brain to kicking a TV it's kind of like zaps your brain um it's like kicking the TV type of thing yeah and you think like when kicking the TV shouldn't work it does sometimes yeah yeah the old old TVs it did my grandpa used to slap the top for sure yeah it would work sometimes yeah so this D price simulation area while that sounds violent the goal is to restore brain functionality for instance those with Alzheimer's could have their memories restored on a recent podcast appearance neural Inc CEO Elon Musk claimed that the company's experimental brain computer interface technology would be able to solve neurological diseases it's like a bunch of circuits and those circuits are broken musk explained but the technology is still in its early stages there's still a lot of work to do musk said referring back to his timeline of testing within a year he noted that we have a chance of putting a link in someone and having them be healthy and restoring some functionality that they've lost eventually as Rogan mused about becoming one with machines in the distant future must countered that we have to keep up even in a benign AI scenario we are being left behind musk said so how do you go along for the ride if you can't beat them join them we are already a cyber to some degree must told Rogen you got your phone you got your laptop if you're missing your phone it feels like missing limb syndrome sounds pretty much good to me what you people say has this technology in its early stage what is the future of artificial intelligence does neural Inc will do human brain implant if it is will it do in less than a year also watch our previous pioneer episode how do robots teach themselves by neural networks the link is in the description tell us your reviews in the comment section and don't forget to subscribe our channel for new videos every day and also ring the bell icon to get notified about our latest videos thanks for watching infinity [Music]
