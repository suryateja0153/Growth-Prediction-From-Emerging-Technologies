 I think the two types of scientists here perhaps you know one that does the really interesting things and under Streit understand the brain and manipulate brain and the second one is creates technologies that enables this now I'm on the second set of scientists that are basically engineers that develops technology to enable the scientists to do their their work so we got into brain computer interfaces about five years ago with a grant from National Science Foundation teamed up with the University of Washington and MIT to develop a technology for wireless implantable be directional brain computer interfaces so we did not start with you know with the directional break in between interfaces or spinal cord stimulation or cortical stimulation but eventually be morphed into into this area so the idea is whether as our keynote speaker that's whether we can have devices outside the body extended you know and the functionality of the of the brain to use the devices that are external you know that's a car example is one of them it could be a prosthetic limb it could be other devices we can go for one step further and perhaps use the enable the extremities that we lost control of the two stroke or some other disease by stimulating the brain and use either the cortical plasticity or spinal cord Plus this team so this is this is what we started with who basically are looking at a system which can record the signals from the brain I was ok I record the signals from the brain you know I camp liffe eyes it does some detection and then apply some treatment ultimately this could be an autonomous system that basically makes certain decisions based on the recordings that that takes place the generic system view would be electrodes that are implanted in the brain whether these are outside the brain using EEG they are on the brain on the epidural service you know using ACOG or they could be intracortical electrodes that are recording deep into the brain and that the data that is recorded would be I would be analyzed for certain features whatever the features that we're looking at an eventually could be turned into commands that controls external devices these external devices could be wheelchairs computer games this would be an interesting area limb controls and other things so the question here is could the control brain learn to produce control signals for controlling something that is not part of the body or we can make it a bit more interesting could the brain relearn to control the parts of the body that it did lose the control for one reason or another so we wanted to develop technologies that enables basically this vision that's what we came up with originally they we decided to develop a set of sensors and actuators that are wirelessly connected and that can record from the muscles or from the brain and turn this into command and control for external voices so we came up with the fairly small devices actually these devices are this is a 16-channel EEG device that we are still using for certain tests this is an eight channel differential EMG device that is for recording from the muscles as a 32-channel implantable BCI with the ultrasonic power harvesting that we developed and we we bundled all of them around a wireless body area networks so we can basically generate signals that are correlated from different parts of the body and eventually turn this into into some command and control for an external device now this is when we designed this system we decided that we want to develop a system which will basically be extendable to other sensors and actuators so that we can easily re produce the or reuse the components that we do this is as an engineer this would be you know something that I would want eventually the system that we came up words this little system which basically is less than a centimeter zwei then it was two centimeters I think in size that had the 16 channels of EGA channels of EMG wireless to communicate with external external devices now but nevertheless this system did not have any stimulation capability or did not have the ultrasonic charger our capability so when our research shift a little bit and we decided that okay you know account now we have a system which can basically record from the muscles which can record the EEG signals the intention the concentration levels and we can control simple things by designing by basically measuring the level of concentration design games around it and our students are hacking these systems to basically do such things can we do something a bit further can be actually design a system which will allow us to regenerate the broken links in the brain and stimulate the brain based on spikes or activity that we detected in other parts of the brain and that's what we started to shift our research into so in our current system we basically record the brain signals again you know this is no different decode the brain state in code and decide about the stimulation and stimulate the electronics to generate signals for the for the brain or for the as final code now this is basically look at the whole idea is to do direct measurements from the brain and we want to generate signals for intentional control rather than random control whether you concentrated or not how much you concentrated we should be able to generate intentional control and real-time processing that is is a critical factor so that is where the system is basically morphing in a locker we have the same system one more time except with added the wireless connectivity so we can stimulate the brain record from the brain and get the data out to control external devices that is our current system architecture where we can record the sister the recordings of we get recordings from the rain we can do local processing for a number of things we can generate the stimulation signal based on the decision that we make at the local recording this would be detecting a spike you know to create basically external and external link between one part of the brain or another part of the Ray brain or create a link that never existed before by basically generating stimulation in a part of the brain based on spikes that you detected in another another pot and this is a the current system you know just to compare basically what we're doing with what other people are doing this is neurochip to that's used by fat slab and a chat Morrison University of Washington they use it for recording from the primates and for stimulation with primates and we're working with both of these gentlemen we're now working which at the ad vets for the next generation of this unit to basically couple our devices with the neurochip 3 to generate stimulation to the spine based on recordings that the cortical level at at the brain the second unit that you are seeing is bright from Brown University that is basically a hundred channel are recording it it doesn't have stimulation it's wireless it can transmit a hundred channels of ACOG data the we imagine is a system that's very similar in in capacity or in features to what we're doing except that they have multiple units that they implanted as part of the skull and the size of these units are slightly larger than ours there are five centimeters long and a little bit of a wider and they also have different units for generating stimulation and the recording that's basically adds a wireless link between them in a sense it's a good thing you can record and stimulate from different sites in another unit adding a wireless link basically adds unreliability to the system for some in some purposes and then we have this is a pen BBM these systems all came out in 2015 all recently announced systems this is basically very similar again in capacity to what we're doing it's a lot larger it does not have wireless charging and it is at can record and stimulate the brain again you know can it's wireless the pen BBM uses a wireless channel that's similar to what we are using we imagine uses a wireless channel that is designed explicitly for implantable systems we're relying on a 2.4 gigahertz channel with with a proprietary algorithm so we look at basically our system compared to other things in a locker this is where we are that's not very clear from the writing but we can record 32 channels of unipolar 16 channel of bipolar signals from the brain we can the analog-to-digital commercial resolution is 16 bits we can do up to 30 kilo samples per channel were limited by the bandwidth so we cannot do this on 32 channels we can do this on a single channel or we can basically reduce the sampling rate and increase the number of channels to to provide it you know this the most important we have a battery that's produced for us by your JD our partner in Korea too and we have a rechargeable system the doctor moon is going to talk about our recharging system which ultrasonic recharging systems I will just skip that the size wise we're a lot smaller and we are off more integrated where a lot smaller we have a 3 centimeter diameter about 37 millimeter thickness for our implantable device and according to our partners who works on primates we have a lot more space to grow so it looks like there is a lot more space in the brain where we can or in the skull where we can basically grow our circuit we don't need to grow and we have well integrated peripheral sensors for measuring EMG or external signal other external signals so they are all connected around the same wireless architecture there to enable researchers to do creative thinking this is a view of our system so this is basically the system the implantable device you know connected to a cog electrodes there's two sides on this side we have four channels of stimulation on this side we have 32 channels of recording electrodes this was the system that we tested in june with recording and stimulation electrodes on different sides now you know like a with some feedback from our partners that are actually implanting these in in primates we are combining the stimulation and recording electrodes so that we can choose basically any electrode for stimulation or recording this should come out soon this is the view of the system basically in a in a titanium case look at the system that we deployed or tested i would say in like we did not really implant it to anybody yet but it is tested basically by connecting two electrodes that are implanted already to the two primates so we have four channels of stimulation on this device which we can control very very closely and then we have 32 channels of recording this is again another view of the system which basically shows where our intention is our intention is to implant it to the skull and push our electrodes to the to the epidermal surface of the brain or you know they can be connected to basically youth electrodes or retirees or whatever the clinicians decides to do with this the size of the device is small enough to be placed on the skull and be part of this call basically by that titanium casing we're using an enhanced short bursts we modified the 2.4 gigahertz channel to communicate it as I said we are basically multiple sensors are currently shipping these sensors to other research institutions for various purposes were giving them out for rehabilitation people that are studying rehabilitation we're giving them out for people studying brain recordings and these devices are this is one of the students in my in my lab never implanted anything yet but all external tests that basically are very successful the last thing that I want to mention is since our channel is limited and the benefit is the sensitive and it is limited what we're doing is we're basically i will have quite a bit of onboard processing to do certain things and one of these is basically compressive sensing to detect the spikes and transmit only the spikes out rather than to transmit everything that is basically one of the you know unique improvements that we have over the other researchers that are that are working with this so we you know like we have a spike detection algorithm that detects the spikes and considers the rest of it has noise and transmit only the spikes to add noise to it to be used later this is a stimulation channel we can basic generator right now four channels of stimulation 20 volts we can is what we are applying we can generate depending on the electrode impedance we can generate eight to twenty two hundred million micro amps or amp one micro second minimum and we can generate basically a pulse train frequency of 200 Hertz now this is some recordings that we get from our June test with with an animal in University of Washington the circuits were connected to the Utah array that is already implanted in the animal and the recordings are coming from basically from this study the circuit our circuit was external to the animal did not go in there and you can see basically this is that the signals that we generated by or recorded with the stimulation there's stimulation is on stimulation is off and then this is shows basically the stimulation signals a pulse train and the stimulation signal stimulation is applied really when we basically detect a spike we can apply a stimulation or we can apply stimulation on a regular basis and monitor the impact of this but one of the things that we are doing is we're basically in a locker we need to eliminate the impact of stimulation because stimulation creates a considerable amount of disturbance on the channels that we are looking at here I will hand it to my colleague dr. moon talk about thank you so as you see I use of his electrical engineer and I'm mechanical engineer land that you might wonder why you guys doing in neuroscience or you know the we are not heroes you know the scientist we are engineers so we basically talked about the device and the device I'd like to talk about is while it's charging and we have now a beautiful you know brain computer interface that we can implant and in the inside of the brain now the there are many ways to provide the power one is using the outlet that you don't want it right and or have a huge battery or in Aisle backpack and I put the wire and put into the brain that will create it huge and other the power source but it will be not good because there'll be the source of infection all the time that many of the current animal studies doing that actually so other way is that we have a rechargeable battery inside of the brain and to charge it and externally wirelessly of course one of the technique you can think of is that induction technique electromechanical magnetic induction technique that you use on every day for your cordless in a toothbrush or some of the cell phone and like samsung galaxy has now an induction in a type of the charging and in fact there are quite many implantable devices that use this type of technique to you know the charge the device but it has pros and cons and the one of the problem will be the heat and but brain is very sensitive to the heat and you know they don't allow more than two degree over Celsius of in temperature increase because it will damage you know the very sensitive in the neuron so this is not that good technique and there are other technique that you can think of is that kind of a new technology excuse me magnetic resonance and it gives that a lot of advantage but one of the disadvantage will be that in fact that gives a huge interference on this you know this signal so while you charge the device and you will see the huge amount of the artifact or the noise on the brain signal and as the complexity and the sensitivity of the reading the brain signal to control for example human body or to stimulate in the neural a neuron of other body and any chance of having interference or having the full signal would be detrimental so we've thought about it a lot and is there any way to generate electricity or wirelessly somewhat safe but also somewhat efficient that we chose the ultrasound or sorry about that will transcend as you see it is pre old technology and but when you provide the you know the briskly the vibration and meaning using the ultrasound energy and when you vibrate in the piezoelectric membrane it generates electricity so we are decided to use the technique because it is somewhat safe and you know that we trust sound has been used for the moms right so seems like it's a safe and there is not much lawsuit you know the about that and also it may not increase the temperature much so that was our intention then the other one is how to miniaturize the device to put into a about you know the three centimeter diameter and the seven millimeter thick titanium can not only just this you know that you know goodra sound the charging device but also with all the circuit that use phasers to mentioned including the battery so that was the the tremendous in a task for us to mini urge we are miniaturized and are the older devices and that this is the the design that we have chosen and using the the titanium case are like a coin style that put a very thin battery and i'll talk about the story then the generator circuit that has the the BCI function as well as the charging control and then ultrasound or the piezoelectric and the transducer matching layer and the cap all together in a around in at the three millimeter and the seven millimeter thick the titanium we can so let me talk about the piezoelectric membrane and we had a the collaborative work with the ETR I in South Korea that is one of the largest into the lab and in South Korea they're doing a lot of a nice work and we worked together to fabricate are the piezoelectric membrane and the using you know the PGT composite and as you see it Adi that's the actually the shape of it and we tested that and the PGT one 3d composite element package it as you see the bottom of it and turned out to be the heat generated the good efficiency and also fit into the size of you know the hour the device and we tested that on the animal skin and you see that the default of the inner doing the test and so we checked that the the all kinds of the you know metrics that we needed to evaluate the performance of the charging device and we found that it is pretty much the within other our target specification and I'll talk about this some of the target specification one is the the temperature and we found that while we are charging it the we found that the you know the temperature increase is about under 1.4 degree that is the under the threshold of the two degree and also the other one was that we need have a special battery that provided enough the you know the storage capability and the ampere as well as very thin you know the efficient you know the battery so we worked with the one of the the battery company who invented up not invented but you know they pioneered are the coin style in the rechargeable battery and the company name is root jade and they had a very nice Adi patented technology that has the spatial encapsulation of the cathode that we would need to increase the safety of the you know the rechargeable battery because we cannot you know they allow any leakage of that contents and inside of the body so they had the extras in the secure encapsulation technology as well as the did a nice the patterning of you know the battery for us so we finally was able to come up with the very thin battery for us and they also we checked add what is the actually temperature increase of the battery while the discharging and then through the many tests and we found that is under 1.3 degree that is under the our target so this is the example of the titanium an RDD casing that how's the old e battery and piezoelectric membrane as well as the circuit and that this is the picture and the shows that the case and the transducer with a matching layer and the circuit and the battery and all together and the shape as the about another coin size at the module that we can ready to implant and to the human body but we couldn't do it yet so we used you know on the primates alright so the the test is going on with the ffs lab and the University of Washington but I'd like to turn to the the the owl intention to the little bit of you know the aware of a side of it because implantable is the technology that we can use it but it is very tough to commercialize it as you suggest that you know the communicating with the machine or actually use for the human it's tough to do it even getting a data is not easy because we cannot make a hole so the human brain in the edges experiments it doesn't work so we cannot wait in another generation to do it so we decided to use the available happen to be the device we have made it so efficient and are so small and portable it gave us a very good way to use it the brain signal to communicate with the one of the neurological rehab the the study so I'd like to talk about that a little bit and I'd read conclude enter the hour the presentation darren gives that the GTECH commercial the six channel the wallace rd e easy and we use that the device to measure the concentration level so the as you see it you see that two images and the one is that kind of a busy one right the other one is a nice sunset and that you can see in the Otori point beach right so basically do what we wanted to have is that can we control instant hill in stainless level of the concentration and using the just looking at the image so so we did from the training and the from fresh brain meaning that the you know this subject which didn't ever exposed to that you know the test but she did once a week so she conducted in a day the every week for 50 weeks and that we collected in a day each data and it found that it actually yes I did there is a clear distinction of the d concentration with the image and the oyster will find that the training actually enhance you know the difference between the you know the concentration and relaxation just by looking at the image so what we are using is that also we went to some signal processing and using that you know alpha event and the better band and then we found that you know the alphabet at the better band and related to the relaxation and the concentration so we made the signal processing and then also we made it concentration and the index and the device that we have is that it's very small devised and that's wearable and our students is wearing it and it gives that instantaneous of the level of the concentration so and it is all wireless and it is a portable and that communicates with the cell phone and other computer and other and the robot so currently what we are using the device is that we are being the using and with the physical therapy lab in this end they were State University we provide the technology and to the clinical site and then the clinical site they use it for the the the rehab it shows that our ongoing problem of our generation of having aging and through the aging we have a lot of the you know diseases one of them is a Parkinson as you see it and or stroke and you can see the many other the diseases and we can do the rehab so the rehab device that we have is that the approach is that why not we have a brain computer interface controlled adi in a rehab robot and that that use it for the the neurological the disorder rehab so this one gives that idea of the walking and the device and also the you know the arm the rehab the device and then also it shows that the the one of the hour the faculty dr. Sims left and gives that the again the the arm rehab debase device for the stroke patients so what we do basically is that we have assumption or hypothesis that and when we do the rehab and the human in a therapist just use the arm or leg repeat motion somehow the you know the expect the plasticity of the brain so that we can have that we have and the robotic we have created that able to move it and arm without the aid of the inhuman physical therapist the BCI based one is that actually bc i control the robot and the meaning that we add the human intention of the d patients in the rehab process so we see that it it will but the ice energy the speed of the rehab and the this work has been in a dis supported by the many grants and one of them is the NSF derc and the ETR I and the key at the Korean government and also many other are the teams of the students and the thank you
