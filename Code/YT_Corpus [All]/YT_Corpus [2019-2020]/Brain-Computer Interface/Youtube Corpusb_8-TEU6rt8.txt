 brain machine interface using brain on a chip in order to understand how the brain function was to put the electrode in her brain so today I will tell you about my group's research effort on brain machine interface using brain on a chip as a title so my group specializes on nano science nanoscience and technology we make very very teeny things and we make tools for studying them then once we actually make those tiny nano scale structures and then actually tools for studying them then we applied those nano scale materials to a bright different problems spanning say quantum information processing and quantum computing sensing as well as nano bio interfaces and today what I'm going to talk about is our effort on nano bio interfaces focusing on brain machine interface now at this point you might actually ask so what does eight nano scientists know about brain science I can tell you authoritative ly that not much well I know the following brain is important without them we do not function that well and it is complicated so it is composed of hundreds of billions of neurons making hundreds of trillions of connections and those are without doubt large numbers so in fact the brain is the most complicated organ in your body spending say thirty percent of energy whether you think very hard or not so it is an important organ that is very very complicated and we do not know much about the brain microscopically we do not know how the brain function so where do we start if you want to understand the governing principles about brain most people think that it should start with a map map of the brain what I mean by the map of the brain is the following we need to know what kind of neurons there are in the bring we need to know where they are in the brain and we need to know what kind of connections that they are making in the brain and that's what I mean by math more technically people call it connect home having the map of the brain is not enough it is a starting point then we actually have to need to put the contents into that particular map in order to understand how the brain function and that's where we are trying to contribute now this sounds like a daunting problem after all 100 billion and hundred trillion are not small numbers but if you think about it in different ways they are not that a daunting number what I mean is the following first note that neurons brain cells the computer themselves that compose the brain talk to each other electrochemically they transmit electrical signal in simple terms and if you think of it as an electrical signal transmitter and if you look at these numbers like hundred billion you now realize that you actually have seen those numbers before where in computer chips when we say 100 Giga Byte Giga means billions 100 gigabyte is hundred billion so computer chips actually has hundreds of billions of components in them and we actually carry them every day and they work based upon electricity now you might say well oh that's great so we now actually 100 billions of elements which work on electricity so all we have to do is to put the brain oil chip then we are done we can actually use a computer chip to learn about the brain right again no it turns out that although numbers work roughly right this thing is very hard thing to do the reason why is the following brain and computer chip are very different things brain is composed of living cells as far as we know computer chip is most of dead things right there dead one is the light that resembles this particular situation let's say that you hear that Boston Red Sox the baseball team is doing very very well they are indeed red-hot they are doing very very well so you decide to visit Boston and then actually you know go watch the ballgame and you find out that the ticket is completely sold out so what you do is sit outside the ballpark here the cross war and then if you listen them carefully then you can actually figure out how the game is going obviously home team you know Boston Red Sox is a home team so if say they hit the home run then crowds will make a really really loud sound and then if the you know opposing team is actually in take me you know making home run that you they will make a different sounds right so by sitting outside you can kind of figure out how the ballgame is going and then so far what computer chips have done in terms of interfacing with the brain was that listening from outside but of course if you actually want to really look at the ballgame that you actually have to go inside and see the game in action and that's what we actually have been trying to do so what we are doing is the following we are leveraging our nanoscience expertise to interface the brain and a computer chip in a better high fidelity high precision way and then we actually have been making strides toward that direction making a computer chip that can interface with the brain cells in a much more precise way and this is so-called scanning electron microscope image of brain cells those cool things sitting on top of our computer chip so what do we do with them well one of the low-hanging fruits that we are now trying to tackle together with the Broad Institute as well as Mass General Hospital is to use this particular computer chips to this cover some new pharmaceutical candidates and then drugs for particular patients in particular disease so this work was inspired by one of my friends and colleague at the Brown University John downer his work was to put the electrode in her brain and it's wired to the computer as of now it's not Wireless it's wired it's really bulky and then use that in order to read her what she thinking so that she can move the you know robotic arms and in this particular movie you will see that she is now trying to move the robotic arms and grab that bottle so that she can drink it takes some time this was one of the first experiment but she could finally after some struggle drink and what struck me most was how happy she is it can really make a difference so there are lots of people who are trying to do that but if you think about it the fact that we are now thinking about doing it and talking about doing it and even possibly start to do it actually raises an interesting question what do you think it will happen if somebody hacks computer chips in your brain not only good thing can happen but bad things can also happen and then you actually have to think about exactly what that means if you are starting to do that and that's you know oftentimes what scientists think that is not in our domain but at least I think that acknowledging it and then thinking about it certainly helps in terms of designing the chips and then doing things better that's what I want to end this particular talk with you
