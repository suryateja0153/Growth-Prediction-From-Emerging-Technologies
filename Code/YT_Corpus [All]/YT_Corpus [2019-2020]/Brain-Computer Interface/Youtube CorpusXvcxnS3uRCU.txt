 once again I'm Amanda postal Nick I'm a professor of law and neuroscience and I'm based at the Center for law brain and behavior at Mass General Hospital and also at the University of Maryland law and neuroscience intersect in a variety of ways three key ways that are relevant for our purposes our laws about neuroscience and neuro technology such as device regulation legal importation of neuroscience concepts and direct legal uses of devices for example lawmaking that incorporates ideas around juvenile development or addiction or chronic pain or legal uses of neuro technologies directly like technologies for lie detection pain detection or risk prediction particularly in the criminal law setting and then a third form of intersection between law and neuroscience has to do with how legal and social structures reflect the kinds of brains and selves that we have and are and reciprocally create us in some sense create our brains because law and legal structures do actually influence our brains and the kinds of brains we have from the amount of nurturance that infants are provided by different countries parental leave policies to the amount and type of neurotoxic ants that lawmakers allow into our food supply so there really is this pervasive dynamic interrelationship between brain science and law and also our actual brains and law all of these three types of interactions are pretty squarely presented by issues with neuro technologies and brain devices particularly brain computer interfaces until now we've had mental privacy by obscurity we've been able largely to determine what we want to share about ourselves through communication because our brains are wrapped in these wonderful protective devices our cranium but as we have more and more pervasive brain computer interfaces brain monitoring devices and also effect recognition technologies we're moving toward what I'd call what I think of as the open-minded society being open-minded sounds and can be wonderful but it raises questions about how we allow access and whether we can exclude how can we use neuro technologies in ways that our autonomy promoting and person-centered rather than autonomy constraining or that cause the person to wind up as a product when I use the word autonomy I mean freedom of thought freedom of action but also freedom of self creation to become different than we are rather than to become reified in some deterministic way so to make this concrete I want to use an example of an individual typical individual I'll call him guy and let's imagine that guy is a high functioning individual with bipolar disorder and he uses brain computer interface devices for gaming sleep tracking and meditation these devices are picking up information about guy all the time or as he uses them as to both his state and as to trait I can imagine that a positive use of these devices is that they might be able to pick up information that could point toward the fact that guy is headed toward a manic episode this information could be used to alert guy himself so that he or other trusted people in his network to whom he's granted access can help head this off at the pass or at least intervene early to mitigate the effects of the episode maybe some communication also directly with his healthcare providers I can also imagine negative uses of this information if the information is being sold on to data brokers for example and then the data brokers make that data available as a product or as a service to other companies maybe guy is getting ads for online gambling and expensive luxury goods and risky financial products the kinds of things you might be so much more prone to as he's heading toward a manic episode and that could in fact precipitate or exacerbate the episode if the data is available for use as the rest of our for example social media data is - data brokers this is a foreseeable misuse additionally data collection could be used by from these systems could be used by employers to make hiring and promotion decisions screening decisions could be used by law enforcement for risk prediction this raises the specter of both misuse and mal use by misuse I mean taking data and information and using it in ways that aren't actually particularly rigorous but that are attractive as a shortcut for somebody who's a decision maker and by mal use I mean use of information that could be scientifically legitimate but that we think of as normatively and socially objectionable as harmful to the other goals of society that we value so the conventional legal responses might be privacy law consent and anti-discrimination law privacy is a little problematic because first of all nobody's really sure what it means or what it protects secondly it can be overly constraining if our answer is this data has to be in a closed loop system and it has to be purged every night that limits the opportunity for guy himself to engage in these potentially productive uses of the data with his provider or for his healthcare and it limits future development of other technologies consent is inadequate as a model legally because we usually don't know what we're consenting to yes I consent to have my brain data monitored by this game that I want to play now I'm not thinking that five years from now there could be a warrant for that data from a law enforcement agency and anti-discrimination law has never covered anything like neurological profile or neuro end of phenotype at least United States entity criminais ssin law applies to fixed characteristics or qualities that are said to be independent of one's performance like a person's religion or ethnicity it might be that this information is more relevant in authentic ways but that we want to have some kinds of protections against discrimination and against tracking from education through to employment through to criminal justice consequences so we're left in a moment right now where we don't have any really good legal models for dealing with this which means that I think there are really three levels at which we need to think about and talk about this problem the first is individual we should be aware of the positive and negative uses of brain data and make choices as consumers or informed consumers to the best extent that we can which will then shape the market the second level is as technologists designers and investors in technology to agree to principles that our autonomy promoting and person-centered I know there's an effort right now to develop Asilomar principles for neuro technology and the third level is legal and regulatory to try to determine what kinds of anti-discrimination paradigms we might want for this type of data so that we don't wind up recapitulating with brain data the forms of discrimination and determinism that we've tried to prevent in other realms but none of these three levels are yet formalized in any way and I think that our work as a group and as a society is to figure out and establish these principles for the good open-minded society Thanks
