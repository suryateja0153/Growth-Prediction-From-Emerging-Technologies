 Arthur C Clarke wrote that, "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." I love that quote I think a lot of sci-fi nerds love that quote because science fiction is filled with things like advanced prosthetics and robotic implants and cybernetic enhancements and brain computer interfaces you know like Luke's arm in Star Wars which they could just tap and it would it would twitch it could feel The Borg and Star Trek they just had all sorts of things going on the matrix being able to just jack-in Altered Carbon sleeves black mirror having tapped into your own thoughts and all sorts of crazy stuff but the same magic it's advanced science for centuries we knew that something important was up here in our skulls we knew it was there then finally in the 1950s a Canadian neuroscientist named Wilder Penfield tapped into it for the first time. Penfield: now when we stimulated at 3 you had a tingling in your thumb. To my astonishment you said I hear music! Tell us what you heard… D.F. : Well, I heard what sounded like an orchestra playing. Penfield: Could you hum it now, do you remember?  Penfield: Yes, rolling along together D.F. : Yes, that's what it is! Penny stimulated with bit of electricity and it just seems like magic right? She was able to hear music but they didn't play any music it was her brain playing it to herself but it was prompted by him again not magic just physical science so can we upgrade our brains oh yeah and over the next five episodes we're gonna dive deep into the pool of biology and engineering psychology a little bit of ethics some physics some neuroscience of course and I am gonna talk all about taking a human brain and making it better come try out humans let's kick into it hihihihihi hide their noodle lures I am trace and thank you so much for tuning in to my channel every few weeks I create a series of videos all about one topic and I break it down so that everybody understands it including myself this series is about upgrading our brains so make sure you subscribe for all of the episodes there are five of them they will also be in a playlist after the series has aired and they are every other week day almost every other human being comes with a standard set of hardware and software there are some variations but when you get a fresh human like out of the box yeah that fresh human smell actually fresh human smells really nice there is no manual there's no operating instructions it's run by this secretive mass of tissue hidden inside a rigid bone box that you can't get to but let's say that you wanted to get in there you want to upgrade that wetware flash a new BIOS add a few i/o systems upgrade the whole thing you know first step cracking that skull open tap the source this is rat probably knew that this is a human also probably knew that and that is a human wagging the tail of a rat yeah that really happened that really happened humans do not have tails I mean furries yes but you know not all humans have tails but with brain computer interfaces brains can actually speak directly to a computer and then that computer can speak to maybe another computer and then that computer can speak to a rat's brain causing the tail to wag doing something like this requires a BCI or BMI a brain computer interface or brain machine interface the brain is an extremely sensitive organ you can mess it up pretty easily it's it's in there and it's hidden away from the world for a reason so you have to figure out how to get in there safely tap into what's going on and understand the chatter this is what a brain computer interface or brain machine interface does the Internet is a network so think of it this way you got a computer on one end and then a computer on the and the internet is in the middle in this case you have a brain on one end and you have a brain on the other end let's do some brain basics we'll review brains contain lots of different cells that we call brain cells cuz we're not that original they're also called neurons 100 billion neurons exist in the human brain and they have 100 trillion connections to other neurons also within the brain are 300 billion glial cells lille is greek for glue so it's like a sober friend at the bar the glial support the neurons physically chemically emotionally yes if you want to crack the puzzle you need to get an engineer in here so I called one Lietsel Richardson that's my name I am a PhD student at the University of Central Florida I study newer mechanics and biomechanics in my lab and I absolutely love our brain I mean I'm sure you've seen stranger things if anyone has seen stranger things we remember 11 wearing this like really bulky EEG system and all the spikes happening on a piece of paper that's that's like the crudest form of EEG that existed but it started there because we wanted to kind of understand how our brain works and what the language was as you know our brain is it's separated into different lobes and cortices that are responsible for different things and processing different kinds of information so this has to do with motor control this has to do with processing and planning this is sensory input that sort of thing in the 19th century Italian Luigi Galvani realized that bodies bodies like ours run on electricity muscles twitch brains think hearts beat and all of that is powered by power he touched the muscle of one frog to another and the second one twitched he realized bioelectricity was really the basis of everything that we do and that is so convenient because computers great also run on electricity but in the brain we discovered that it all comes down to this one little cell the neurons the neuron is the basic component of the brain and it's what's responsible for knowing when something is activated or not hello my name is Dr. Jessica Chen I am neuroscientist and I'm studying regenerative therapies for spinal cord injury the neuron itself doesn't do anything in isolation and needs to be able to talk to other neurons and to think with other neurons and so when a neuron it talks another neuron it uses what's called a synapse so the body of the neuron would send information through the axon of the neuron which would then go to the dendrites which are basically the outputs that then go and talk to another neuron and so when you have all these different neurons that are next to each other and they're creating synapses or points of contact between each other you have a network the brain is like this huge complex network of neurons and synapses with all these different areas talking to each other we need to hack into that network and then we use that information to upgrade the brain to hack into a network like this we need to be monitoring the traffic on the network that means we need to be monitoring what's happening in the network of neurons running through our brains and bodies and there are six different tools to do that there's EEG zemi jeez II cogs F MRIs and IR SS and intra cortical neuron recording that is six different types two of those are invasive four are non-invasive two are indirect four are direct all have the same goal though and that is to understand the three-pound one-and-a-half kilogram mass of tofu like tissue inside of our skull boxes so let's break them down they measure on a few different dimensions and it's about how they suck up the info and the resolution that they can produce over a period of time so first the two indirect ones there's the fMRI which is a functional magnetic resonance imager you hear this all the time in brain studies we talk about it all the time in science communication fm our eyes measure metabolic interactions that is blood flow it's an indirect access because it's not actually seeing what the neurons are saying it's seeing where the brain is sending resources and it can see it down to about a one millimeter resolution and it can see activity over about one second it measures electromagnetic fields produced by blood inside of your brain and it has some problems that even though it has a low time resolution of only one second it has very high space resolution of down to a millimeter now we can't use fMRI to control a computer it's a little too slow we have to use a really big machine in order to make it work but it's a really good study tool there's near-infrared spectroscopy or nirs and that's again metabolic it's an indirect measure and it has a five millimeter resolution over about one second five millimeter a little wider but it is more portable it doesn't require us huge machine like fMRI does and what it does is it uses IR light to detect blood moving through your brain box the infrared light can only penetrate about one to three centimeters into the head but it does do a good job so you can you know do some things with this it's a little slow and hair can cause issues as can movement but that's not unusual let's move on to the direct methods the main one that you're gonna hear about is the EEG electroencephalography it's electrical it's non-invasive it is direct and it is a ten millimeter resolution of 0.5 seconds so really wide view and really quick the cap that you see in the movies that you know that measures brainwaves it's general activity outside the skull and it sits on the scalp so it's not very precise it can be messed up by blinks by muscle contractions any movement the wires themselves hitting things or jaws being clenched literally eye twitches can mess up an EEG a lot of these things get picked up by EEG it's very hard to find the signal but the really good thing is in the past like two decades researchers have gotten really good about the algorithms that they use to isolate what they want to find in one particular brain area but we'll come back to that later the next one on the list is magneto encephalopathy that is magnetic version of electroencephalography it's non-invasive it's direct it has a five millimeter resolution down to 0.5 seconds as well it's very similar to EEG it senses the same patterns and it's a little more precise it senses the magnetic fields of e/m activity in your brain but you need Meg medically sheild rooms super cooling and a very expensive equipment to make this work so there's also electro cortical a graffiti cock this one is really cool it's electrical it is invasive which means you have to implant it into your body it is directly measuring at one millimeter of resolution in 0.3 seconds really really fast you have to put electrodes literally on the brain they have great resolution inside of the brain but they're more risky because you have to let somebody inject a giant sensor into your brain box directly it's literally stuck on there so if Criers opening the skull and it's usually what you see in freaky sci-fi movies when they got wires coming out of it exposed brain you have to stick an array in or on the brain there's also inter cortical neuron recording it doesn't have a fancy name like the other one so ICN our neuro capture what do you think you can call it that anyway neuro capture or into cortical neuron recording is direct it's invasive which means you have to get inside the head and it has a resolution of 0.5 millimeters 2.05 millimeters and point zero zero three seconds it is so fast and can see such a small area it's obviously the best in terms of resolution and timing but it's literally touching the brain there are a bunch of different ways to do that there are multi electrode arrays Michigan probes Utah intra cortical electrode arrays which are very popular and they can measure individual groups of neurons which is excellent for BCI's but like yikes a rule for people who do not want to have their skull opened up Oh wild penny may have learned a lot cracking skulls open in poking brains with electrified sticks but the brain is a living piece of a human body which means it's constantly moving constantly reacting to what's going on inside the person's literal head and it also has a major issue the signal-to-noise ratio the noise could be a hum in the background and if it's low than it's fine you can probably still hear what I'm saying but if the noise gets to be a little too much it can actually overwhelm the signal then the thing that you're looking for will get lost and it's crazy that's a thing that it's a thing in the brain - yeah there's there's a lot of noise there's a lot of noise from other areas of the brain because our brain is constantly processing from different inputs an example is if I am a participant in an experiment and there's some kind of visual and auditory cue that I need to look out for and I have to walk at the same time those are three different senses that our brain is processing at the same time so that means there are three areas of the brain that are being loud in that moment I know I'm going on and on about it but there's like so much to just reading EEG data it's crazy right now one of the best ways to tap into a human brain is with an electrode called a Utah array it looks like this and it's got the least noise and the cleanest signal but it does require cutting open the scalp getting into the skull and implanting it directly on the surface of your brain organ that's some serious brain surgery and it cannot stay in there forever your body will still develop scar tissue around it the brain can move and it's very plastic so cells might move around but if you want to upgrade you know like my girl Beyonce says right now you're gonna need something like this for example let's say we wanted a robot arm that I could control that could catch a ball there's a lot that goes into that you got to see the ball you got a calculator trajectory you have to move your arm in front of the ball you got to anticipate where the ball is gonna be you got to move your fingers around it and since we're talking about a robot arm I can't crush it with my robot arm but for that we need to know not just that the brain is talking and what the brain is saying we need to speak brain and I need to know if I've cocked the ball which means we need to write back to the brain so for that you're gonna have to come back on Wednesday Congrats to dr. Chen by the way she just defended her thesis at the University of Michigan she became a doctor for the first time so exciting that's gonna be weird this is the first time I'm gonna refer to myself as doctor but anyway thanks again for tuning in to this episode of gunner dose of tres now you know how the brain is read from next time how the brain is written too so I'll see you in the future
