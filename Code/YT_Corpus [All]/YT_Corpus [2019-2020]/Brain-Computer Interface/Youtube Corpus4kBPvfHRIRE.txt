 brain sourcing is a novel technique that unifies the fields of crowdsourcing and brain computer interfacing it allows people to collaborate on recognition tasks using only their brain signals evoked in response to a given information stimulus brain sourcing builds upon the concept of crowdsourcing but instead of manual labor it relies on contributions of individual people by implicitly monitoring their brain activity while they encounter information intensive tasks crowdsourcing more generally is a paradigm in which ideas data products and intellectual work are produced by a large group of individuals unbounded by time or space in crowdsourcing tasks are divided among individuals to achieve a collective result crowdsourcing is a broad field and tasks can be roughly divided into two categories macro work and microwork macro work often requires special skills and quite a bit of time to complete examples of macro work include open source software development and editing wikipedia articles microwork does not require specialized training or skills and most tasks can be completed in a short amount of time featurizing images and transcribing scanned text as with google's recaptcha service are examples of microwork for our experiment we focus on microwork in the form of recognition tasks where users look for images matching a certain description brain computer interfacing is an interaction paradigm driven by real-time neural activity collected from a user this brain activity can be recorded using a variety of methods one of the most popular and the one used in this experiment is electroencephalography also known as eeg eeg is a technique to record electrical activity of the brain typically done by measuring changes in voltage at the surface of the scalp this electrical activity is related to neural processes occurring in the brain eeg data has a high temporal resolution however its spatial resolution is quite poor so while eeg data can be used with a high degree of accuracy to detect when a neural event has occurred it cannot be as easily used to determine where it occurred event related potentials commonly referred to as erps are a key feature of eeg data erps are time-locked voltage fluctuations produced by the brain in response to some event such as viewing a face or moving a muscle erps consist of positive and negative components characterized by a variety of amplitudes and latencies to automatically interpret erps machine learning models can be trained to distinguish between erps produced by different events in fact brain computer interfaces that use eeg often follow an erp-based approach to facilitate user interaction such as with bci spelling programs statistical techniques are then used to distinguish between the types of responses in this experiment we make use of the p300 an erp component associated with attention and memory let's say we have a test subject who will let us record some eeg we ask the subject to look for faces of smiling people and then show them faces of people smiling target class and not smiling non-target class now the erps produced by smiling faces are distinguishable from the erps produced by faces that were not smiling this is indicated by the larger positive peak visible at around 300 milliseconds post stimulus the p300 stimuli of the target class that is with the feature of interest will produce erps that contain a p300 component stimuli not containing a feature of interest part of the class non-target will typically produce erps without a noticeable p300 this effect is reliable enough where we can train a classifier such that given an erp we can determine the class of stimuli that produced it with a reasonable level of accuracy brain sourcing takes this classification approach a step further the classification accuracy of a single brain based model while better than random is still not high enough to compete with more conventional approaches rather than simply relying upon the brain responses of a single individual to determine classes of stimuli it's possible to combine predictions derived from many individuals brains using this approach brainsourcing achieves results that are significantly better than any individual model we will now provide a brief overview of how the brain sourcing pipeline is constructed full details can be found within the paper first we need a brain sourcing worker okay the worker is placed in front of a computer screen and fitted with an eeg cap and electrodes they are then asked to complete a recognition task where they look for faces that match a certain description such as having dark hair or a smile the worker does not need to provide any explicit feedback they simply sit back and observe as faces are presented to them on screen while their scalp voltages are recorded in practice it looks something like this after collecting enough training data from the worker a classifier model is trained using the erps produced by each stimulus when a worker is then presented with a new stimulus the erp it produces is fed into the classifier model which uses features present in the erp to determine the class of the stimulus but remember we're conducting brain sourcing here so we need to repeat this procedure for multiple individuals by training models for other brain sourcing workers and combining many predictions for the same stimulus we can classify images with higher accuracy than any individual model to ensure the brain sourcing model performs better than individual models the results are analyzed in three ways first by showing that the brain responses are reliable second by measuring the performance of correctly classified tasks third by investigating the changes in what the classifier learns when a crowd is used instead of individuals to show the brain responses are reliable we can plot the erps produced by the two classes of stimuli across all tasks and visually compare them as we can see there is a distinct difference between erps produced by target and non-target images and this difference is present for all tasks measure the performance of correctly classified tasks we compare classification results as data from more participants are used in the brain sourcing estimations in this case we take a representative sample of blonde vases and dark haired faces for task blonde and visualize whether these stimuli were correctly classified by the brain sourcing model using their associated erps as the data from a greater number of participants is used in the brainsourcing model performance improves and the number of misclassified stimuli appears to decrease analyzing this more empirically across a larger sample size using f1 score we find the same phenomenon holds true further analysis of the brain-sourced estimations reveals a clear bimodal distribution as data from more participants are added to the models this reflects the nature of the stimuli data and further suggests that the brain sourcing model is indeed learning something meaningful in this research we showed that human brain responses can be effectively utilized in a crowdsourcing setting combining predictions from just two participants already yields an f1 score of 0.77 across all tasks combining predictions from 12 participants achieves an f1 score of 0.94 across all tasks this performance is high enough that it could be used in real-world situations due to the sensitive nature of brain-based data it's important to recognize potential ethical and privacy issues that may arise from brain sourcing widespread adoption of brain computer interfaces is not yet a reality however with continued improvements to existing technologies it could be in the near future when brain computer interfaces are as common as the mouse keyboard or touch screen anyone could become a brainsourcing worker this may lead to unethical labor or revenue models like replacing conventional advertisements with brainsource microtasks eeg data can serve as a biometric identifier brainsourcing data that is improperly handled could reveal the identity of a worker meanwhile governments corporations and criminal organizations might use these systems in ways that violate an individual's right to privacy and autonomy new forms of malware could also emerge where brain computer interfaces are hacked to conduct subliminal probing for private information with widespread adoption of ethical design practices and privacy preserving techniques within the brain computer interfacing community we may be able to reduce the risks associated with this technology you
