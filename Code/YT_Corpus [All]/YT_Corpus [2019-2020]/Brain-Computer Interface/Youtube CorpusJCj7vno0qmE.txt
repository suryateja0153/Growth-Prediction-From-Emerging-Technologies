 LAST DOC I WENT TO TOLD ME THAT IF I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY OF USING MY HAND BACK AFTER SIX MONTHS, IT'S NOT COMING BACK. IT'S GOING ON THREE YEARS FOR ME. THEN, HE GIVES ME A SQUEEZE-Y BALL, AND HE SAYS, "GOOD LUCK." AND OH, BOY, DID KATE GIVE IT TO HIM. I WAS MAD. REALLY, IS THE SQUEEZE-Y BALL THE BEST THERAPY OUT THERE FOR A STROKE VICTIM? JUST TO BE CLEAR: NO SQUEEZE-Y BALL.    DR. KIM: ALZHEIMER'S. DR. LEUTHARDT: MEMORY. DR. KIM: DR. LEUTHARDT: STROKE. DR. KIM: PARALYSIS. DR. LEUTHARDT: BRAIN TUMOR. DR. KIM: SURGERY. DR. LEUTHARDT: EPILEPSY. DR. KIM: SEIZURES. IT'S NATURAL TO SIMPLIFY THESE COMPLEX, AND LET'S BE HONEST, SCARY CONDITIONS DOWN TO THE MOST IDENTIFIABLE SYMPTOMS OR OUTCOMES. BUT MANY TIMES, THESE GENERALIZATIONS CAN MAKE THINGS EVEN MORE FRIGHTENING. WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE WORKED FOR YEARS TO HELP OUR PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS MORE FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING AND WHY. AND WITH SO MANY EXCITING ADVANCES HAPPENING IN THE FIELDS OF NEUROSURGERY AND NEUROSCIENCE, WE CAN OFFER MORE THAN JUST INFORMATION. WE CAN OFFER HOPE. BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL PEOPLE BECAME OUR PATIENTS TO SHARE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IN OUR YEARS OF SURGERY AND RESEARCH. WE WANTED TO BRING THEM INTO THE CONVERSATION NOW. WE WANTED TO BRING THEM SOMETHING INTIMATE AND PERSONAL. SOMETHING THAT BRINGS OUR FASCINATION AND AWE OF THE BRAIN INTO THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES. WE LEAD A CREATIVE TEAM TO TURN SOME OF OUR MOST COMPELLING AND MEMORABLE CASES DEALING WITH STROKE, EPILEPSY, BRAIN TUMORS, AND ALZHEIMER'S INTO A FOUR-ACT PLAY CALLED, "BRAINWORKS: THE THEATRE OF NEUROSCIENCE". MIXING NEUROSCIENCE WITH LIVE THEATRE ALLOWS YOU TO NOT ONLY EXPLORE THE WONDERS OF THE BRAIN, BUT ALSO TO EMPATHIZE WITH THE CHARACTERS ON THE STAGE. IT PROVIDES A VERY HUMAN PERSPECTIVE OF HOW THE BRAIN WORKS, AND WHAT THE EMOTIONAL TOLL IS WHEN IT DOESN'T. THIS EPISODE WE'LL EXPERIENCE WHAT LOVE, DETERMINATION, AND A MIND-CONTROLLED GLOVE CAN ACHIEVE WHEN A FORMER PARAMEDIC SUFFERS A DEBILITATING STROKE. WELCOME TO THE THEATRE OF NEUROSCIENCE.    [RAINING] AH, SHOOT, THEY DIDN'T SAY NOTHING ABOUT RAIN. I'VE GOT AN UMBRELLA. ALWAYS PREPARED. SOMEONE'S IN A MOOD TODAY. NOTHING FEELS RIGHT ABOUT THIS. LAST DOC I WENT TO SAID IT WAS A LOST CAUSE, WAY TOO MUCH TIME HAS PASSED. THIS DOCTOR THINKS DIFFERENTLY, AND WE'VE GOTTA KEEP TRYING, JACK. YOU GOING TO OPEN THAT? OR ARE WE GOING TO STAND IN THE RAIN? YOU TRY. COME ON. KATE. THAT'S OKAY. I'M SORRY. MIGHT AS WELL CUT THE DANG THING OFF. I HATE THIS, KATE. I KNOW, SWEETHEART, BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO GET INTO THIS CLINICAL TRIAL. SAYS HE'S GOING TO HOOK ME UP TO A COMPUTER, READ MY MIND? REWIRE MY BRAIN? WE'LL FIND OUT, NOW COME ON, DON'T WANT TO BE LATE. DR. LEUTHARDT: THIS WAS JACK AND KATE ON THEIR WAY TO SEE ME FOR THE FIRST TIME. THEY CAME IN FROM THE RAIN SOAKING WET AND FIGHTING MAD. HOW LONG AGO WAS HIS STROKE? THREE YEARS, AND OF COURSE, HE WAS TOLD THAT RESTORING USE OF HIS LEFT HAND WAS A LOST CAUSE BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN THE COMMON ASSUMPTION. THAT'S HOW STROKE IS, AND YOU COULD FEEL THE FRUSTRATION SPILLING INTO THEIR RELATIONSHIP. THAT'S WHY A STROKE IS THE ENEMY. IT SEVERS OUR CONNECTION FROM THE WORLD AND THE PEOPLE AROUND US. THAT'S WHY WE REALLY SET OUT TO CHALLENGE THAT "BUSINESS AS USUAL" MINDSET WHEN IT CAME TO THINKING ABOUT FIXING A PART OF THE BRAIN WHEN IT BECOMES BROKEN. FOR MY LOVE, A CINNAMON TIE. [LAUGHS] LOVE, KATE. OOH, SILK. CINNAMON. ALL RIGHT. THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. COME ON, CINNAMON. LET'S GET SOME DOUBLE-WINDSOR RESPECT GOING HERE. KATIE: JACK, DO YOU NEED HELP WITH THE TIE? NO, I GOT THIS. ALL RIGHT. OK. BUT WE GOT TO GO IN 15 MINUTES, SO... I'LL BE READY. BRAIN'S STILL GOT PARAMEDIC IN IT, KATE, YOU KNOW I'LL ANSWER THE CALL. BUT IF YOU NEED HELP... I'LL ANSWER THE CALL! LOVE YOU AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING THIS WHOLE RECOMMITMENT DEALIO, TO SHOW EVERYBODY. ONLY PEOPLE WE HAVE TO SHOW IS EACH OTHER, ALL THAT MATTERS... I KNOW. AND IT'S ALL I WANTED, TO SQUEEZE -- TO HOLD YOUR HAND AGAIN. YOU KNOW, TO MARK THAT MOMENT, MAKE IT OFFICIAL, LET DR. ERIC AND ALL THE OTHERS THAT HELPED US GET HERE CELEBRATE WITH US. ALL RIGHT. I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT. I LOVE YOU. SEE YOU DOWNSTAIRS IN TEN. I'LL ANSWER THE CALL. COME ON, THINK LEFT. THINK LEFT. ANSWER THE CALL. DR. KIM: ANSWER THE CALL? WHO'S CALLING HIM? THAT'S WHAT JACK WOULD SAY TO ME AND TO HIMSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BEFORE THE STROKE HE WAS A PARAMEDIC. [SIREN] FOR 30 YEARS, I'VE ANSWERED THE CALL! RAIN OR SHINE, ALWAYS ANSWER THE CALL. LET'S GO, LET'S GO! DO NOT TAKE THESE FOR GRANTED. YOUR HANDS ARE QUITE SIMPLY A MIRACLE OF EVOLUTION. THEIR DESCRIBED IN ENGINEERING TERMS AS HAVING "27 DEGREES OF FREEDOM", THE ABILITY TO INDEPENDENTLY MOVE IN 27 DIFFERENT WAYS SIMULTANEOUSLY TO MANIPULATE THE WORLD AROUND YOU. THOSE 27 DEGREES OF FREEDOM ARE OUR BRAIN'S VITAL LINK TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD. FOR US AS NEUROSURGEONS, WE USE THEM TO OPERATE ON THE BRAIN. BUT THAT SAME LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY IS REQUIRED IN EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE. LIKE FEEDING A BABY, TAKING THE CAP OFF THE KETCHUP, PUTTING IN A CONTACT LENS, OR PLAYING A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT. IS THERE ANYTHING WE VALUE OR TREASURE MORE THAN OUR FREEDOM? AND JACK WAS FIGHTING FOR IT ON A PERSONAL LEVEL. AS A PARAMEDIC, HE USED HIS HANDS IN COMPLEX WAYS TO SUSTAIN LIFE. FEELING FOR A PULSE. NO PULSE! I DON'T HAVE A PULSE! CHARGE THE PADDLES! SO, HE WAS SAVING LIVES, DOING WHATEVER IT TOOK. BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENED? [THUNDER] A SMALL CLOT OBSTRUCTED ONE OF THE ARTERIES TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS BRAIN. AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME, THAT REGION OF THE BRAIN BECAME STARVED OF OXYGEN AND DIED. DR. KIM: WOW, THAT CLOT WAS LIKE A LIGHTNING BOLT THEN. NORMAL ONE MOMENT; LIFE-ALTERING DISABILITY THE NEXT. DR. LEUTHARDT: A LIGHTNING BOLT THAT OBLITERATED HIS RIGHT MOTOR CORTEX AND SHUT OFF THE WAY HE CONNECTED TO THE WORLD. KATE: I'M TELLING YOU, THE THINGS THAT DEFINED HIM, WHO HE WAS, HIS SENSE OF HIMSELF IS TOTALLY GONE. YOUR HAND IS NOT SIMPLY SOMETHING THAT OPENS YOUR WALLET OR LIGHTS A MATCH. IT'S MORE THAN A MECHANICAL DEVICE. AND THE LOSS OF ITS FUNCTION AFFECTS NOT ONLY YOUR PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS, IT STRIKES DEEPLY INTO YOUR RELATIONSHIPS. NOW, I NEED HELP WITH EVERY STUPID LITTLE THING, LIKE A BABY. I'LL HELP, AS MUCH AS YOU'LL LET ME. I JUST WANT TO DO IT MYSELF, NOT TO HAVE TO ASK FOR EVERYTHING. SETTLE DOWN, DON'T BE SO ANGRY. I'M YOUR WIFE, I'M HERE FOR YOU. MY WIFE. WHAT I -- WHAT REALLY WANT, WHAT I WANT IS -- MAIN THING, I WANT, MAIN THING, IS TO HOLD YOUR HAND. TO TAKE YOUR HAND IN MINE, MY WIFE. YOU CAN ALWAYS HOLD MY OTHER HAND, WITH YOUR GOOD HAND, SEE? NOT THE SAME. FEELS THE SAME. IT'S NOT WHAT -- A HUSBAND WALKS ON HIS WIFE'S RIGHT SIDE, HOLDING HET RIGHT WITH HIS LEFT. IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THAT WAY. IT'S WHAT-- IT'S THE WAY MY DAD TAUGHT ME. HE TOLD ME, A HUSBAND HOLDS HIS WIFE'S HAND WITH HIS NON-DOMINANT HAND SO SHE KNOWS SHE ALWAYS RULES. [LAUGHTER] DAD TAUGHT ME A LOT ABOUT HOW TO BE A MAN, HE TAUGHT ME TO TIE A TIE, A DOUBLE-WINDSOR, NEVER DO THAT AGAIN. I FEEL USELESS, KATE, YOU KNOW, I'M NO LONGER A MAN. HEY, HEY, HEY. OK. I WAS RESEARCHING AND I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS CLINICAL TRIAL. HAND'S DEAD, KATE, THREE DOCTORS ALL TOLD ME. [GROWLS] YOU PLAYING THE DOG? WE'RE FIGHTERS, RIGHT? [GROWLS] SO, LET'S FIGHT. AND THIS IS HOW THEY CAME TO ME. FIGHTING MAD. SO, WHAT DID YOU DO, GIVE HIM A SQUEEZE-Y BALL? JUST DON'T GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE OF THEM SQUEEZE-Y BALLS, DOC. DR. LEUTHARDT: I PROMISE, I WON'T. LAST DOC I WENT TO TOLD ME THAT IF I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY OF USING MY HAND BACK AFTER SIX MONTHS, IT'S NOT COMING BACK. IT'S GOING ON THREE YEARS FOR ME. THEN HE GIVES ME A SQUEEZE-Y BALL AND HE SAYS, GOOD LUCK. AND OH, BOY, DID KATE GIVE IT TO HIM. I WAS MAD. REALLY, IS THE SQUEEZE-Y BALL THE BEST THERAPY OUT THERE FOR A STROKE VICTIM? JUST TO BE CLEAR, NO SQUEEZE-Y BALL. BUT I AM GOING TO HAVE YOU PICK UP THIS MARBLE AND PUT IT IN THAT CUP. SEEMS LIKE A SQUEEZE-Y BALL TO ME, DOC. THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO IS TO ASSESS YOUR HAND FUNCTION, AND TO DO THAT, WE HAVE TO HAVE YOU PICK UP DIFFERENT OBJECTS AND PUT THEM IN THAT CUP. WANNA GIVE IT A TRY? SURE. I KNOW I CAN DO IT, JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE. DR. LEUTHARDT: WE'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF TIME, DON'T WORRY. DR. LEUTHARDT: LOOK AT HIS FOCUS, I SO ADMIRED HIS GRIT AND DETERMINATION. DR. KIM: BUT WE KNOW IT TAKES MORE THAN DETERMINATION TO PICK UP THAT MARBLE. SO, WHAT DID YOU DO DIFFERENTLY? DR. LEUTHARDT: WELL, IT STARTED WITH THE CLASSIC ASSUMPTION ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN CONTROLS THE BODY. DR. KIM: YOU MEAN, CONTRALATERAL CONTROL; WHERE ONE SIDE OF THE BRAIN CONTROLS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BODY. COME ON, THIS IS FIRST YEAR MED SCHOOL STUFF -- MOTOR CONTROL. YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT? DR. LEUTHARDT: WHILE YES, ONE SIDE OF THE BRAIN PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CONTROLLING THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BODY -- CONTRALATERAL MOVEMENTS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT ONE SIDE OF THE BRAIN ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN CONTROLLING THE SAME SIDE OF THE BODY OR IPSILATERAL MOVEMENTS. DR. KIM: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO USE THOSE SAME SIDE BRAIN SIGNALS? DR. LEUTHARDT: WELL, THE BIG IDEA WAS THIS: WHAT IF WE USE A BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE TO CAPTURE THOSE SIGNALS? WHAT IF WE CREATE A SYSTEM THAT LINKS MINDS TO MACHINES? A BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE HAS THREE PARTS. SENSORS THAT RECORD SOME TYPE OF SIGNAL FROM THE BRAIN SUCH AS ELECTRODES ON THE SCALP. A COMPUTER THAT DECODES THOSE SIGNALS AND CONVERTS THOSE INTENTIONS, YOUR THOUGHTS, TO THE THIRD PART -- A MACHINE THAT CONVERTS THOSE THOUGHTS INTO REAL WORLD ACTIONS? I TRY TO MOVE IT, BUT NOTHING HAPPENS, DOCTOR. I TRY TO MOVE IT, AND I CAN SEE IT MOVING IN MY MIND BUT STILL NOTHING. THE INTENTIONS ARE THERE, THE WILL TO MOVE IS THERE, JUST THE OUTPUT IS GONE. THOSE SIGNALS ARE STILL PRESENT IN THE UNINJURED SIDE OF THE BRAIN. I SEE, SO BY HAVING THE BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE TAP INTO SIGNALS FROM THE UNINJURED SIDE OF THE BRAIN, MAYBE YOU COULD USE THOSE SIGNALS TO IMPROVE FUNCTION OF THE PARALYZED HAND. THERE IS EVEN MORE TO IT THAN THAT. THINK ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN HEALS ITSELF. IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE BONES, FOR INSTANCE. WHEN YOU BREAK A BONE, YOU REALIGN IN SPACE. YOU PUT THE BROKEN BONES TOGETHER IN A CAST AND EVENTUALLY IT'LL GROW BACK TOGETHER. FOR A BROKEN BRAIN, YOU CAN'T PUT IT IN A CAST, YOU HAVE TO REALIGN IN TIME! SURE, YOU MEAN: "THINGS THAT FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER." IT'S CLASSIC HEBBIAN LEARNING! [SIREN] ON NO, YOU TRIGGERED IT, THE NERD ALERT. THAT'S THE BELL, WHICH MEANS CLASS HAS STARTED, AND SILENCE! I AM DR. DONALD HEBB, AND THIS IS MY BOOK, "THE ORGANIZATION OF BEHAVIOR", FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1949, WELL BEFORE ALL THESE MODERN DEVICES LIKE THE HI-FI OR THE WIFI AND ALL YOUR FANCY ANIMATED SLIDE SHOWS. WE TAUGHT WITH CHALK, AND THAT WAS ENOUGH. NOW LOOKING AT NEURONS, WHEN NEURON A IS NEAR ENOUGH TO EXCITE NEURON B AND THIS HAPPENS AGAIN AND AGAIN, THE EFFICIENCY OF NEURON A TO COMMUNICATE WITH NEURON B IS INCREASED. THIS HAS BECOME KNOWN AS: HEBBIAN LEARNING. YOU'RE WELCOME. [LAUGHTER] DR. LEUTHARDT: SORRY, DR. HEBB, WE THOUGHT THESE ANIMATIONS REALLY SHOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. DR. KIM: IT'S KIND OF LIKE TWO PEOPLE TALKING. THE MORE THEY TALK, THE CLOSER THEY BECOME. I'LL STICK WITH MY CHALK, THANK YOU. AND REMEMBER, LIKE THOSE NEURONS FIRING TOGETHER, THEATRICAL EXITS ARE ALSO ALL ABOUT TIMING. [CHALK DROPS] [LAUGHTER] DR. LEUTHARDT: HEBB'S RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO GET THE TIMING JUST RIGHT IF WE'RE GOING TO GET THOSE NEURONS TO WIRE TOGETHER, WE GOTTA GET THE TIMING JUST RIGHT, FOR THAT LINKAGE TO HAPPEN. MY TEAM CREATED A BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE THAT PICKS UP SIGNALS FROM THE UNINJURED SIDE OF JACK'S BRAIN AND CONTROLS A ROBOTIC EXOSKELETON THAT MOVES HIS HAND PRECISELY WHEN HE THINKS ABOUT IT. SO, YOU'RE TELLING ME, YOU'RE GOING TO LISTEN TO SIGNALS COMING FROM THE GOOD SIDE OF MY BRAIN THAT TELLS MY BAD HAND TO MOVE, AND THEN ROUTE THEM TO A COMPUTER, WHICH WILL ROUTE THEM TO A ROBOTIC, UH, GLOVE WHICH I'LL BE WEARING THAT'LL HELP ME MOVE MY DEAD HAND? EXACTLY. SIMPLE! WELL, IT'S NO SQUEEZE-Y BALL, THAT'S FOR SURE. DOES IT REQUIRE SURGERY? DR. LEUTHARDT: NO, THAT'S THE BEST PART, THE SYSTEM IS NON-INVASIVE. ESSENTIALLY, THE ELECTRODES RECORD THE SIGNALS FROM HIS BRAIN ON THE SCALP, LIKE A HAT. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IS WEARABLE, AN INTELLIGENT CAP AND GLOVE. HAVE A LOOK. I GOT TO WEAR ALL THAT THE REST OF MY LIFE? DR. LEUTHARDT: NO, NO, NOM JUST FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY. WE BELIEVE OVER TIME THE BRAIN WILL HEAL ITSELF. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID ABOUT TIMING? CELLS THAT FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER. DR. LEUTHARDT: RIGHT, AS THE BRAIN FIRES, IT'LL STRENGTHEN AND FORM NEW CONNECTIONS FROM THE UNINJURED SIDE OF THE BRAIN TO THE PARALYZED HAND. AND WITH TIME, THE BRAIN WILL RELEARN HOW TO CONTROL THE BAD HAND WITHOUT THE GLOVE. AND YOU THINK THIS'LL WORK? THIS IS WHY WE DO CLINICAL TRIALS, THIS IS HOW WE LEARN, HOW WE GET PAST THAT SQUEEZE-Y BALL. WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY? I'LL ANSWER THE CALL. LET'S GET YOU FITTED YOU WITH THE CAP. I GET THE CONCEPT HERE, BUT HOW IS THE COMPUTER READING THOSE IMPULSES? HOW EXACTLY IS THAT CAP PICKING UP INFORMATION FROM HIS THOUGHTS? AGAIN, IT'S ALL ABOUT TIMING. WHEN A NEURON ENCODES INFORMATION, IT DOES IT IN THE RATE AND FREQUENCY WITH WHICH IT FIRES. LIKE MORSE CODE. [MORSE CODE] AND THE CAP CAN HEAR ALL THOSE NEURONS? IN A WAY. WHEN YOU LISTEN TO LARGER AND LARGER CELL POPULATIONS, IT SOUNDS LESS LIKE RAIN ON A TIN ROOF, AND MORE LIKE A BUNCH OF STATIC-LIKE NOISE. [STATIC] AGAIN, HOW IS THE COMPUTER ABLE TO PULL ANYTHING MEANINGFUL OUT OF THAT? WEN MIXED TOGETHER, IT'S CONFUSING, BUT WHEN YOU FOCUS IN ON THESE DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES YOU HEAR THE DIFFERENT PIECES EMERGE. SIMILARLY, WITH THE BRAIN, WHEN YOU FOCUS ON DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES, YOU CAN SEE HOW DIFFERENT CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN ARE BEHAVING. I SEE, LIKE TUNING INTO A SPECIFIC RADIO STATION. EXACTLY! HOW LONG I GOT TO DO THIS? THREE MONTHS. MAYBE LONGER IF YOU SEEM TO BE GETTING BETTER. YOU STAY IN THE ROOM WITH ME? OH, YOU NEED TRAINED PHYSICAL THERAPISTS, DOCTORS... YOU. I NEED YOU TO SHOW ME THAT I CAN DO THIS. ALL RIGHT, I'LL TALK TO DR. ERIC. THEY GOTTA PUT MORE MEDICINES IN ME TO HEAR THE SIGNALS? NO MEDICATION. JUST THE HEAD CAP, PRACTICE AND MAYBE SOME CINNAMON. SMELL. WHAT IS IT? ESSENTIAL OIL, CINNAMON. I GOT IT FROM KALEIDOSCOPE EYES. THE HIPPIE SHOP? ESSENTIAL OIL? YOU TURNING HIPPIE ON ME? I'LL TURN WALRUS OR TIGER IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THAT HAND OF YOURS WORKING AGAIN. SMELL, GO ON. SMELL. HUH MAMA USED TO BAKE CINNAMON ROLLS. "WORLD'S BEST" IS WHAT DAD ALWAYS SAID. AND HE WAS RIGHT, HE WAS RIGHT. SO, ALL I GOT TO DO IS THINK ABOUT MOVING MY HAND? WHAT'S WITH THE CINNAMON? SOMETHING KATE READ ABOUT. NOT PART OF THE STUDY PROTOCOL FOR SURE, BUT INTERESTING, NONETHELESS. SMELL DEVELOPED EARLIER IN OUR ANIMAL EVOLUTION. IT'S MEDIATED BY A VERY PRIMITIVE PARTS OF OUR BRAIN. THAT'S TRUE, AND BECAUSE OF THAT OUR SMELL RECEPTORS HAVE DIRECT CONNECTIONS TO OUR MEMORY AND EMOTIONAL CENTERS, LIKE OUR HIPPOCAMPUS AND OUR AMYGDALA. WE ALL HAVE THOSE MOMENTS WHEN THEY SMELL SOMETHING AND IT BRINGS US BACK TO A DIFFERENT TIME IN OUR LIFE. AT THE VERY LEAST, THE CINNAMON MIGHT BE CONNECTING HIM TO OTHER MEMORIES AND FEELINGS THAT CAN HELP TO MOTIVATE HIM. CERTAINLY POSSIBLE, AND IT GOT KATE MORE INVOLVED. AND CAREGIVERS NEED AS MUCH MOTIVATION AS THE PATIENTS. I'M THINKING, BUT IT'S JUST NOT... LET'S TRY SOMETHING PRACTICAL. REMEMBER THAT FIRST DAY WE CAME HERE? CAUGHT IN THAT DAMNED STORM. AND I TRIED TO GIVE YOU MY UMBRELLA. LET'S TRY IT AGAIN. HERE'S THE SEQUENCE. GRASP. PASS. UNTETHER. EXTEND. PUSH. CLIP. OPEN UMBRELLA. GOT THAT? YEAH BUT... NO BUTS. YOU TRY WITH THE NEURO HAND. GRASP. GRASP. GRASP. NOPE, NO GOOD. KEEP TRYING, GRASP. THE HUMAN BRAIN IS EXTRAORDINARY AT LEARNING. YEAH, BUT JACK'S BRAIN NEEDED HELP DEVELOPING A NEW ROUTE. BOTH THE COMPUTER AND JACK NEED TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER. THE COMPUTER IS LOOKING FOR SPECIFIC SIGNALS FROM JACK'S BRAIN, WHILE HIS BRAIN IS THINKING ABOUT SPECIFIC MOVEMENTS THAT BEST CREATES THOSE SIGNALS. YEAH, BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW HARD IT IS. YES! NOW, PASS IT TO THE GOOD HAND. PASS. YEAH, I'M TRYING, BUT I JUST CAN'T. [GROWLS] PASS. GOOD, UNTETHER! UNTETHER. DR. LEUTHARDT: GESTURE BY GESTURE, THEY WORKED TOGETHER TO RETRAIN THE HAND. FIGHTING FOR AS MANY DEGREES OF FREEDOM FOR... TWO HOURS A DAY. FOR 36 WEEKS. 56 WEEKS. 76 WEEKS. 96 WEEKS WE GROWLED AND USED THE NEURO HAND. UNTIL, FINALLY, WE REMOVED THE NEURO HAND. YOU READY? I'LL ANSWER THE CALL. GRASP. PASS. UNTETHER. EXTENDED. PUSH. PUSH. PUSH. PUSH. PUSH. PUSH! CLIP. OPEN UMBRELLA! YES! THE BAD HAND LEARNED! [APPLAUSE] YES! YOUR BRAIN REWIRED ITSELF! YOU DID IT! WE DID IT. KATE AND ME. YOU GUYS SHOULD GIVE HER A GOLD GLOVE OR SOMETHING FOR ALL SHE DID. DR. LEUTHARDT: YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE SUCH A WONDERFUL COACH. THANK YOU, DR. ERIC. WHAT DO WE DO FROM HERE? THERE'S STILL A LOT I CAN'T DO WITH IT. HOPEFULLY THE MORE YOU USE IT, THE MORE MOVEMENT YOU'LL REGAIN. THE BRAIN IS MUCH MORE MALLEABLE THAN WE GIVE IT CREDIT FOR. HOPEFULLY, YOUR BRAIN WILL LEARN NEW WAYS OF DOING OLD THINGS. LIKE TYING A DOUBLE-WINDSOR KNOT? I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT DAY, JACK. IT'LL BE A SPECIAL DAY FOR SURE, AND WHEN IT COMES AROUND, YOU BETTER ANSWER THE CALL, DR. ERIC. I WILL MOST CERTAINLY ANSWER THE CALL, JACK. KATE: JACK, IT'S ALMOST TIME. I CAN HELP YOU WITH THE TIE. ANSWER THE CALL. [GROWLS] YOU GOT THIS. YOU GOT TWO MORE MINUTES, THEN I'M COMING IN, OK? [GROWLS] REMEMBER, JUST LIKE DAD TAUGHT YOU. START WITH THE RIGHT OR LEFT? START WITH THE RIGHT... I CAN'T, CAN'T DO THIS DAD! NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU SHOW ME, I'LL NEVER LEARN. YOU CAN, YOU'LL LEARN, JACK. NOW START WITH THE RIGHT, GRAB THE LONG END. WATCH. TAKE THE SHORT END IN YOUR LEFT HAND, UNDERSTAND? WHAT I DON'T GET IS WHY WE EVEN GOT TO DO THIS? A MAN NEEDS TO WEAR A TIE SOMETIMES. IT'S A WEDDING, SHOW DOUBLE-WINDSOR RESPECT. DOUBLE-WINDSOR RESPECT? THE KNOT I'M TEACHING YOU. DOUBLE-WINDSOR. CLASSY. SHOWS YOU CARE. DOUBLE-WINDSOR RESPECT. BUT AUNT BECCA'S BEEN MARRIED ONCE BEFORE, WHY WE GOT TO SHOW DOUBLE-WINDSOR RESPECT? SEEMS LIKE A HALF-WINDSOR WOULD DO. 'CAUSE SHE'S YOUR MAMA'S SISTER. NOW COME ON, JACK, THIS IS THE KNOT OF ALL KNOTS. STILL NOT INTERESTED. JUST LIKE YOUR MAMA, FULL OF VINEGAR. BUT I'M GONNA TEACH YOU. CROSS THE LONG END OVER THE SHORT, PINCH WITH YOUR RIGHT, TAKE THE LONG END NOW IN YOUR LEFT HAND. YOUR LEFT HAND. GOOD. NOW POKE IT UP THROUGH THE HOLE AND PULL IT DOWN. NEXT STEP. THIS TIME, WE GO AROUND BACK, NOT UP THROUGH. THEN SWITCH HANDS, POKE IT THROUGH THE HOLE AND PULL IT DOWN. AND THERE WE HAVE OUR INSIDE KNOT, OUR FIRST KNOT. LIKE THIS? LOOKING GOOD. NOW WE'RE ONTO THE SECOND KNOT, THE OUTSIDE KNOT. TAKE IN LONG END WITH THE RIGHT. PASS IT OVER THE TOP TO THE LEFT. USE THE LEFT, USE THE LEFT. AND PUSH THAT UP THROUGH THE HOLE. FIND THE TUNNEL BETWEEN THE TWO KNOTS. AND PULL IT DOWN THROUGH THE TUNNEL. AND CINCH IT UP TIGHT. I DID IT! YOU DID! IT NEEDS A LITTLE SHAPING UP WHICH IS EASY ENOUGH. HOW'S THAT? NOW TUCK IN THE LOOSE ENDS. WHO'S MY LITTLE MAN? I AM. KATE: JACK? YOU NEED ME? YOU READY? I ANSWERED THE CALL. ALL FINISHED! IT LOOKS PERFECT. [LAUGHTER] ALL READY TO GO GET HITCHED, OR REHITCHED, OR WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE CALLING IT. RECOMMITMENT CEREMONY. [LAUGHTER] TURNED HIPPIE ON ME, THEN TURNED ME HIPPIE, HUH? I GUESS IF MY AUNT BECCA COULD BE MARRIED TWICE TO TWO DIFFERENT BOBS; I SURE AS HECK COULD BE MARRIED TWICE TO THE SAME KATE! [LAUGHTER] WOW, YOU LOOK, WOW! HOW LUCKY AM I? IT IS A BEAUTIFUL KNOT YOU MADE, JACK. A BEAUTIFUL KNOT WE MADE, KATE. LET'S GO MAKE IT AGAIN. [LAUGHS] I AM SO HAPPY FOR JACK AND KATE... DR. LEUTHARDT: SSHHH! SERIOUSLY, ALBERT, WE'RE AT A WEDDING. DR. KIM: COME ON, IT HASN'T EVEN STARTED YET AND YOU'RE NOT OFFICIATING THIS WEDDING. DR. LEUTHARDT: OKAY, BUT IT'S COOL HOW THIS ALL CAME TOGETHER. DR. KIM: YEAH, THEY REALLY CONFRONTED THEIR "DOUBLE-WINDSOR" MOMENT. DR. LEUTHARDT: OVER TIME, WE ALL FACE OUR CHALLENGES, OUR OWN "DOUBLE-WINDSORS." BUT WITH A PATIENT'S PERSISTENCE, DR. KIM: A CAREGIVER'S LOVING SUPPORT... DR. LEUTHARDT: AND A DOCTOR'S DETERMINATION WE CAN OPEN LARGER AND LARGER UMBRELLAS TO HELP MORE PEOPLE WEATHER THE STORMS. DR. KIM: ALBERT, SSHHH. I THINK IT'S REALLY STARTING NOW....    [APPLAUSE]    ANNOUNCER: FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE BRAINWORKS: THE THEATRE OF NEUROSCIENCE, VISITING BRAINWORKSTHEATRE.ORG.
