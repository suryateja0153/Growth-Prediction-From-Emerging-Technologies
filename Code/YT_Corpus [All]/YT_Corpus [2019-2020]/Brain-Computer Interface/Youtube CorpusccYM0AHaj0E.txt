 Introducing Ena, a novel system that affords rider-eBike integration via the rider's neural activity. Via an EEG cap Ena monitors if the user's neural activity is between 0.76 and 1.19 microvolts within the high alpha range of 10 to 12Hz. These correspond to the rider's field of view being peripherally open to afford higher awareness of the environment and it activates Ena's engine support. Instinctively, the rider's field of view narrows as a response to a threat, such as a car veering. In this case, Ena instantly stops engine support, allowing the rider more time to respond to the situation. With this work we imagine a future where interactive systems are integrated with our neural activity to support enjoyable and safer experiences.
