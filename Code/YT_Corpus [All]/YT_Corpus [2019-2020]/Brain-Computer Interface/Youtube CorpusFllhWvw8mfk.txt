 When someone suffers damage to their pons due to trauma, stroke, or a neurodegenerative disease, they may be left in a state of paralysis known as locked-in syndrome. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, which gained fame during 2014's ice bucket challenge, is one of the most common causes of locked-in syndrome. Patients in the late stages of ALS lose their ability to move and speak. In the past, patients have defaulted to using blinks to indicate "yes" or "no." Spelling out words to indicate unprompted needs would require a much slower more complicated system. However, advances in the field of Brain-Computer Interface spellers, otherwise known as BCI spellers, have allowed locked-in patients to use their brainwaves to spell out their thoughts. The BCI speller shown here works by having patients count the number of times that a face flashes in front of a letter. A letter can be computed after about eight flashes and appears at the top of the screen Then the patient will move on to count the next letter that they want to spell. By matching up the timing of the wave with the timing of each letter flash, the computer can then decode which letter the patient is focusing on. This allows patients to communicate by spelling out any word with their brain waves. The participant here is diagnosed with advanced ALS. He wears an 8-electrode EEG net which captures the electric signals of his brain. The computer decodes the participant's intention by processing his brainwaves, in particular, the P300 A P300 is elicited by a rare event. For example, as seen here, there are many X's and a few O's. The infrequent O's embedded in the stream of X's elicits the P300. Emanuel Donchin published  research on P300 waves in 1981 that indicated that the rarer an event was, the larger its peak. These P300s are the neural mechanisms that tell the BCI which letter the patient is trying to spell. Enabling people with ALS to communicate freely greatly improves their quality of life.
