 nanobiotechnology bionanotechnology and nanobiology are terms that refer to the intersection of nanotechnology and biology given that the subject is one that has only emerged very recently via nanotechnology and nano biotechnology serve as blanket terms for various related technologies this discipline helps to indicate the merger of biological research with various fields of nanotechnology concepts that are enhanced through nanobiology include nano devices such as biological machines nanoparticles and nano scale phenomena that occurs within the discipline of nanotechnology this technical approach to biology allows scientists to imagine and create systems that can be used for biological research biologically inspired nanotechnology uses biological systems as the inspirations for technologies not yet created however as with nanotechnology and biotechnology bionanotechnology does have many potential ethical issues associated with it the most important objectives that are frequently found in nanobiology involve applying nano tools to relevant medical biological problems and refining these applications developing new tools such as peptide nana sheets for medical and biological purposes as another primary objective in nano technology new nano tools are often made by refining the applications of the nano tools that are already being used the imaging of native biomolecules biological membranes and tissues is also a major topic for the nano biology researchers other topics concerning nanobiology include the use of cantilever array sensors and the application of nanophotonics for manipulating molecular processes in living cells recently the use of microorganisms to synthesize functional nanoparticles has been of great interest microorganisms can change the oxidation state of metals these microbial processes have opened up new opportunities for us to explore novel applications for example the biosynthesis of metal nanomaterials in contrast to chemical and physical methods microbial processes for synthesizing nanomaterials can be achieved in aqueous phase under gentle and environmentally benign conditions this approach has become an attractive focus in current green bionanotechnology research towards sustainable development topic terminology the terms are often used interchangeably when a distinction is intended though it is based on whether the focus is on applying biological ideas or on studying biology with nanotechnology bionanotechnology generally refers to the study of how the goals of nanotechnology can be guided by studying how biological machines work and adapting these biological motifs into improving existing nanotechnologies or creating new ones nanobiotechnology on the other hand refers to the waste that nanotechnology is used to create devices to study biological systems in other words nanobiotechnology is essentially miniaturized biotechnology whereas bionanotechnology is a specific application of nanotechnology for example DNA nanotechnology or cellular engineering would be classified as bionanotechnology because they involve working with biomolecules on the nanoscale conversely many new medical technologies involving nanoparticles as delivery systems or as sensors would be examples of nanobiotechnology since they involve using nanotechnology to advance the goals of biology the definitions enumerated above will be utilized whenever a distinction between nano Bo and bi enano is made in this article however given the overlapping usage of the terms in modern parlance individual technologies may need to be evaluated to determine which term is more fitting as such they are best discussed in parallel topic concepts most of the scientific concepts in bionanotechnology are derived from other fields biochemical principles that are used to understand the material properties of biological systems are central in bionanotechnology because those same principles are to be used to create new technologies material properties and applications studied in Baia nanoscience include mechanical properties eg deformation adhesion failure electrical electronic eg electro mechanical stimulation capacitors energy storage batteries optical eg absorption luminescence photo chemistry thermal eg thermo mutability thermal management biological eg how cells interact with nanomaterials molecular flaws defects biosensing biological mechanisms s a Meccano sensing nanoscience of disease eg genetic disease cancer organ tissue failure as well as computing eg DNA computing an agriculture target delivery of pesticides hormones and fertilizers the impact of bian NO science achieved through structural and mechanistic analyses of biological processes at nano scale is their translation into synthetic and technological applications through nanotechnology nanobiotechnology takes most of its fundamentals from nanotechnology most of the devices designed for nano biotechnological use are directly based on other existing nano technologies nano biotechnology is often used to describe the overlapping multidisciplinary activities associated with biosensors particularly where photonics chemistry biology biophysics nano medicine and engineering converge measurement in biology using waveguide techniques such as dual polarisation interferometry are another example you topic applications applications of bionanotechnology are extremely widespread insofar as the distinction holds nanobiotechnology is much more commonplace in that it simply provides more tools for the study of biology by a nanotechnology on the other hand promises to recreate biological mechanisms and pathways in a form that is useful in other ways topic nanomedicine nanomedicine is a field of medical science whose applications are increasing more and more thanks to nano robots and biological machines which constitute a very useful tool to develop this area of knowledge in the past years researchers have made many improvements in the different devices and systems required to develop nano robots this supposes a new way of treating and dealing with diseases such as cancer thanks to nano robots side-effects of chemotherapy have been controlled reduced and even eliminated so some years from now cancer patients will be offered an alternative to treat this disease instead of chemotherapy which causes secondary effects such as hair loss fatigue or nausea killing not only cancerous cells but also the healthy ones at a clinical level cancer treatment with nano medicine will consist of the supply of nano robots to the patient through an injection that will search for cancerous cells while leaving untouched the healthy ones patients that will be treated through nano medicine will not notice the presence of these nano machines inside them the only thing that is going to be noticeable as the progressive improvement of their health topic nanobiotechnology nanobiotechnology sometimes referred to as nanobiology is best described as helping modern medicine progress from treating symptoms to generating cures and regenerating biological tissues three American patients have received whole cultured bladders with the help of doctors who use nano biology techniques in their practice also it has been demonstrated in animal studies that a uterus can be grown outside the body and then placed in the body in order to produce a baby stem cell treatments have been used to fix diseases that are found in the human heart and are in clinical trials in the United States there is also funding for research into allowing people to have new limbs without having to resort to prosthesis artificial proteins might also become available to manufacture without the need for harsh chemicals and expensive machines it has even been surmised that by the year 2050 five computers may be made out of bio chemicals and organic salts another example of current nano biotechnological research involves nanospheres coated with fluorescent polymers researchers are seeking to design polymers whose fluorescence is quenched when they encounter specific molecules different polymers would detect different metabolites the polymer coated spheres could become part of new biological assays and the technology might someday lead to particles which could be introduced into the human body to track down metabolites associated with tumors and other health problems another example from a different perspective would be evaluation and therapy at the nanoscopic level ie the treatment of nano bacteria 25 to 200 nanometers sized as is done by nana biotech firm ax while nano biology is in its infancy there are a lot of promising methods that will rely on nano biology in the future biological systems are inherently nano in scale nanoscience must merge with biology in order to deliver bio macromolecules and moe alekhya ler machines that are similar to nature controlling and mimicking the devices and processes that are constructed from molecules as a tremendous challenge to face the converging disciplines of nanotechnology all living things including humans can be considered to be nano foundries natural evolution has optimized the natural form of nano biology over millions of years in the 21st century humans have developed the technology to artificially tap into nanobiology this process is best described as organic merging with synthetic colonies of live neurons can live together on a biochip device according to research from dr. gunther gross at the University of North Texas self-assembling nanotubes have the ability to be used as a structural system they would be composed together with rhodopsins which would facilitate the optical computing process and help with the storage of biological materials DNA as the software for all living things can be used as a structural proteomic system a logical component for molecular computing Ned Seeman a researcher at New York University along with other researchers are currently researching concepts that are similar to each other topic bionanotechnology DNA nanotechnology is one important example of bionanotechnology the utilization of the inherent properties of nucleic acids like DNA to create useful materials as a promising area of modern research another important area of research involves taking advantage of membrane properties to generate synthetic membranes proteins that self-assembled to generate functional materials could be used as a novel approach for the large-scale production of programmable nanomaterials one example as the development of amyloids found in bacterial biofilms as engineered nanomaterials that can be programmed genetically to have different properties protein folding studies provide a third important Avenue of research but one that has been largely inhibited by our inability to predict protein folding with a sufficiently high degree of accuracy given the myriad uses that biological systems have for proteins though research into understanding protein folding is of high importance and could prove fruitful for bionanotechnology in the future lipid nanotechnology as another major area of research in bionanotechnology where physical chemical properties of lipids such as their antifouling and self-assembly is exploited to build nano devices with applications in medicine and engineering topic agriculture nanotechnology application to biotechnology leaves no field untouched by its groundbreaking scientific innovations for human wellness the agricultural industry is no exception basically nanomaterials are distinguished depending on the origin natural incidental and engineered nanoparticles among these engineered nanoparticles have received wide attention in all fields of science including medical materials and agriculture technology with significant socio-economical growth in the agriculture industry engineered nanoparticles have been serving as nano carriers containing herbicides chemicals or genes which target particular plant parts to release their content previously nano capsules containing herbicides have been reported to effectively penetrate through cuticles and tissues allowing the slow and constant release of the active substances likewise other literature describes that nano encapsulated slow release of fertilisers has also become a trend to save fertiliser consumption and to minimize environmental pollution through precision farming these are only a few examples from numerous research works which might open up exciting opportunities for nanobiotechnology application in agriculture also application of this kind of engineered nanoparticles to plants should be considered the level of amicability before it is employed in agriculture practices based on a thorough literature survey it was understood that there is only limited authentic information available to explain the biological consequence of engineered nanoparticles on treated plants certain reports underlined the phyto toxicity of various origin of engineered nanoparticles to the plant caused by the subject of concentrations and sizes at the same time however an equal number of studies were reported with a positive outcome of nanoparticles which facilitate growth promoting nature to treat plant in particular compared two other nanoparticles silver and gold nanoparticles based applications elicited beneficial results on various plant species with less and or no toxicity silver nanoparticles a GN piece treated leaves of asparagus showed the increased content of ascorbate in chlorophyll similarly 8g NPS treated common bean and corn has increased shoot and root length leaf surface area chlorophyll carbohydrate and protein contents reported earlier the gold nanoparticle has been used to induce growth and seed yield in Brassica Yukiya topic tools this field relies on a variety of research methods including
