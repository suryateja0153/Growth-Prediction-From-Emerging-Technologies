 [Music] hi this is your lap class number ten and in this lab class we'll be looking at PDMS molding now what is that lipid events molding is if you if you remember in our Theory class what we have shown is that you have a microphone a chip right so in the microfluidic chip you should have a silicone mold right on which you will pour the PDMS and when you cure it you can peel off the PDMS so this process from using a silicone mold and pouring the PDMS right and then curing it and peeling it off this entire process will be shown to you in this particular lab class allah kiya will be taking this particular lab class which i have designed for this course and you will be looking at very important you know experiment and if you know this process your life will become very easy when you are working on microphone a platform because in a way it's very easy to replicate the same kind of channels use if you have a silicon mold with you right so it's only one one time you had to prepare a mold and you can use it for n number of times if you are careful alright so we'll be teaching this particular you know technology where we below you will be showing it to you how can you create a how can you use PDMS to to create channels if you have a silicon mold so focus on this particular lab class and I'll see you in the necklace next lab class till then you take care hello everyone welcome to the course on sensors and actuators in this module we'll study what is PDMS molding and how does it become important when you're trying to understand how to fabricate biosensors so like we've seen how sensors can be fabricated using silicon wafers the process the fabrication process how lithography the choice of wafer and the different process steps to Shivam space device another part of sensors are at a microscale level our PDMS based microfluidic devices again when we talk in terms of making biosensors it could be as small as the dimensions could be as small as a micro nano scale so how do we replicate this unlike the standard optical lithography process where we have the photoresist and we follow the standard procedures there is another alternative in order to fabricate very quickly a bio chip so an important part of bio chip fabrication is PDMS a lot of chips have been fabricated using this polymer so PDMS stands for poly dimethyl siloxane so it's a polymer of carbon and silicon let's see how we can fabricate a bio MEMS device using this polymer so why do we have to fabricate using this elastomer so the all in all the over a wide aspect of making microfluidic microfluidic devices or bio MEMS devices the option the choice most commonly after choice is PDMS based polymer so why is this most opted one one when you see our fabrication point of view it is very easy and rapidly it can be prototyped and when we talk on dock in terms of cost so they're reasonably very low when you when you relatively compare it with the standard fabrication procedures of MEMS based devices so when they are when they're available with you you can rapidly design and then fabricate your bio MEMS device using the polymer now let's see how step-by-step we can achieve a microfluidic or a bio MEMS device moreover another major advantage of using this polymer is it can once we molded into a device the chip would mimic the environment of a biology like it can easily mimic the physics the physiological chemical and the biological environment of for example the human so then the the entire mechanism of the blood flow through the veins all of this can be scaled down and replicated like you would have heard of terminologies like lab-on-a-chip so all of that is based on this means of fabrication so we would fabricate the entire organ week there are experiments where which is again called as organ on a chip where the functionality of an organ has been mimicked on to these bio chips and that's why they are called bio chip and another different application is widely studied is if you want to study the antigen antibody susceptibility the microbial test all of this again they you could fabricate a bio chip and then study the antigen antibody susceptibility antimicrobial test or you could even do the impedance test impedance analysis on the microorganisms so all of this protein protein interaction so the list goes on the applications are vast so when we want to start making a bio chip let's try to understand how do you the basic steps which are to be followed in order to make these devices so initially let's see what are the requirements so here what I have is as you can see this is a silicone elastomer silk at one eight four so this here is what with this is what I'm going to make the PDMS molding so this silicone elastomer along with curing agent so if you want to make a world using PDMS then you might consider buying this elastomer and a curing agent so elastomer and curing agent are mixed in certain ratio so this is 10 is to 1 ratio in this ratio when these two are combined it forms a polymer which can be cured molded easily you can replicate micro to nano level features in just few hours so now that we've seen how the curing agent as you see it's more transparent and this you would see is more viscous so once I pour it into a container you'll see how the two are immiscible initially and then after a lot of stirring then it becomes a uniform mixture now let me take the 2 in 10 is to 1 ratio so you could use a container in order to quantify the the amount of elastomer that you are taking here I have this handy so I would take 5 ml of silicone elastomer into this container as you see this is a highly viscous polymer the the silicone elastomer now that I have taken some amount of elastomer now I take the touring agent so I need to take point five ml of curing agent yeah now that we have if you see they are viscous as you see the curing agent would be floating on top and then at the bottom I have the PDMS the the silicone elastomer now what we have to do this is we have to stir this well so you could take a stirrer and then stir them thoroughly and what happens while I do the stirring is there are a lot of bubbles which get formed so this process would go on in order to make the two immiscible polymers in combine them into a single liquid so you need to stir it for around five to ten minutes thoroughly so that the churning agent and the silicone elastomer are mixed what happens if you do not stir them well and you just use it onto your mold and then cure it if you see later you see cracks which are they they become more brittle so it's not a flexible elastomer when you cure it when you remove it from your mold you'll see that they are more brittle and they tend to break even before you dice them in order to get your device so as you can see I've stirred it for around ten minutes and there are lot of bubbles which got formed while I do the stirring action again a precautionary and important thing is when you are doing the stirring make sure you don't inhale them don't keep them very close to your face so that values too are there a lot of chemicals there are a lot of chemicals which are which which which are exam which comes out through them once you do the stirring and so you need to keep them at a lower level do the stirring and then ensure you have a mask because it is not recommended to do it with just having this in your hands and then inhaling this could be harmful once we have the curing agent and the elastomer mix thoroughly let's see what to do with this mixture here what I have is a desiccator so for if you have not heard of what a desiccated is so this is a a chamber which can which will provide vacuum as you can see this is the top lid which is transparent and here this is the bottom casing and here there is an elastic rubber so that the lid sits tightly and then the vacuum does not so this mostly is a vacuum chamber a small chamber and if you would like to know what are the applications of desiccator they have asked the the I mean the Lord of purpose Pavel this provides a clear need vacuum environment inside the chamber how do we generate this vacuum so here you can see the chamber is connected to a pipe which goes to a pump here the pump here is having a dial gauge so all the air that is inside will be pulled by the pump here and a vacuum will be created inside this chamber another important application of using desiccators here is say you have fabricated your device and you would like to characterize it in a facility which is farther from where you're staying so all these devices in order to protect them from contamination or even to prevent the like when you say silicon wafers they are hydrophilic they they are hydrophilic in nature and I always tend to absorb the moisture in the environment so in order to prevent what happens when the silicon wafers assume you have a clean wafer and you have to carry to your office or your department and what happens is when you carry to the environment it is it is always advise to not use them handle the wafers with bare hands because it can cause contamination and another thing they are not exposed they should not be exposed to moisture or air because they absorb the air and the moisture which is there in the environment and there is oxide layer which gets formed so the silicon oxide which is formed the native oxide is a few nanometers however it can hamper the device functionality assume you want to the deposit metal which is like 1 micrometer and then you just get your wafer and there is already oxide which is formed on your wafer and not taking any precautionary measures so there is some 2 or 3 nanometer of oxide which is there on your wafer and then you deposit metal if you desire to have a 1 micrometer metal deposition that is not what you are going to get because in between there is contamination the oxide and that could hamper your device functionality so in order to avoid all such scenarios you have to use the desiccator in our case when we are talking about the bio MEMS or the MEMS based sensors so this becomes important so that the wafers are not exposed to any sort of contamination now that we have the desiccator here and the vacuum pump what I am going to do with this PDMS mixture is D gasps so degassing is done using the desiccator to remove all the air bubbles if you see there are lot of air bubbles now which got formed while I was mixing the two polymers so in order to remove these bubbles we don't want these bubbles directly you cannot use this mixture for curing because we are talking about making bio MEMS device which have channels of a few micron length and the dimensions are so small that even a droplet or even a bubble here can block your channel and that is not what is desired so even tiniest of the bubble has to be removed from this mixture so we follow this procedure called degassing where the mixture will be put into the desiccator for around 5 to 10 minutes dessicated so that all the air bubbles will be pulled out and inside the vacuum chamber it would ensure that there is no more air left and this you will see it would turn to be a clear mixture transparent clear fluid so now I am going to put this into the desiccator I have my lid properly closed and then I turn on the vacuum the pump so you could see the dial gauge if there is any leak then the pressure would not increase so now I have the tube the container where I had the Nostromo is placed inside the chamber and then the vacuum process is going on as you can see the same amount of pressure that is the vacuum is being created inside this desiccator there I'm not sure if you can see inside how the bubbles are coming towards the top of the surface so there are lot of bubbles in the beginning so after you have properly whisked the elastomer and the churning agent there were a lot of bubbles which got formed and then that removal can happen using the process of desiccation and now it would this process would take around 10 minutes and then you will see all the bubbles gone out and then you have a clear liquid so this was nearly after ten minutes of waiting the now this is what you can see there are there were a lot of small tiny bubbles which were there inside the mixture but now there are very few bubbles so we will wait for another for a couple of minutes a five minutes and then you will be able to see all the bubbles flown out and then inside the vacuum chamber we would get this clear polymer mixture having given around 15 minutes of time for desiccation now that there are no more air bubbles what I'm going to do is here I switch off the pump and then you have to slowly release this valve here because if you do this in a very fast very quickly if this knob is turned what happens is there is a lot of air which gushes inside the chamber and that can again form air bubbles into the mixture so that is not what we want so what we will do is slowly D gas so there is a slight noise if you can see and that is nothing but the air which will be going inside the chamber now after degassing you can remove the lid and then here is the clear liquid as you can see there are no more bubbles into this polymer mixture so now that we have a clear mixture like let me just repeat the process we take in tennis to one ratio the elastomer and the curing agent mix it thoroughly and then once we have the mixture ready we put them into the desiccator and wait desiccated the gas for 10 to 15 minutes until you see a clear mixture like this now what do we do with this mixture so here I have a silicon wafer so here this is the wafer that I am having if you if you are able to see the fine lines here so this is embossed on the surface so this wafer has structure like this a pyramid like if you see this the the rhombus structure here this is an imposing so now what we do is have this mixture and then here on the wafer we see an imposing like this but you could have many different forms of this structure so if you want micro channels in your MEMS base device the bio MEMS device then you could just have the micro channels engraved on this and what would happen is once I have this PDMS layer I would pour it on to this mixture and then I am having it very close to the surface because even if it is poured at you know distance when you pour it from it from a very far distance then it would tend to create bubbles on top of it so there's a very small amount of polymer mixture what I have taken depending on the dimensions depending on your device so you could choose what is the quantity which would be more appropriate to get the device there are absolutely no air bubbles as you can see and if by chance there are any air bubbles then what you could do is you could remove the air bubbles using a small needle as you can see the slight mixture the polymer mixture which I have poured onto the embossed surface on the silicon substrate another thing what you have to take care of is while you do this process make sure the substrate what you have is thoroughly cleaned so you can follow this procedure like clean it with acetone followed by IPA and then some DI water so any bit the silicon substrate or any other substrate on which you want to fabricate the device so follow the cleaning procedure and then have the PDMS liquid poured onto the device now that we've seen how the liquid goes into this we have to cure this so the setting what we have to follow is put it in an oven at 70 degree Celsius for two hours so what happens if you set it at higher temperature the coring at higher temperature makes the mixture brittle and it tends to break the device and to break hence optimum temperature is 70 degree Celsius for two hours so what you have to do is set the oven temperature to around 70 degree Celsius so take some time to increase the temperature now that we have the oven at 70 when you can place your mold for two hours and leave it here at 70 degree Celsius so after curing a mixture 70 degree Celsius for two hours you get back your mold and then you could cut it during using a surgical blade and this is what you get so this is the flexible PDMS substrate on which this structure was embossed now if you see this you can observe how you can easily replicate the sir the structure on your mold on to PDMS devices and the you could even mold channels of a few micrometers and nanometers in dimensions using this polymer and another thing what you can see here is there are tiny bubbles at the end here as you can see this is a device structure what we desired but then there are few bubbles at the end so always make sure you remove those bubbles what happens so here it is still okay to have the bubbles at the end because it's not hampering the within that device dimension but if that bubble so what happens is when you do this sort of molding and then curing bubble tends to retain inside the mold so that rupture would if that comes from the bubble is somewhere here and between your device structure it could block your channels ideally we are trying to make devices with micro channels and then flow fluid at some rate so that we are able to get droplet formation or we are able to send bacteria and then see its susceptibility so for all of these tests mostly their liquid based and then they are flow through these channels they could create some sort of blockage and that is why you always have to make sure that you don't have any sort of bubbles while you do the entire process from being mixed to being cured and all of the other did the degassing becomes an important process so now that we've seen how you can replicate your structures or features very easily in just a few hours using PDMS this can be a base with which you can take help and then start making BioMEMS devices so when you make these biochip once you have your chip you can do the desired study this was an introduction about how to do PDMS molding and how you can how this can be integrated into making a MEMS based bio chip that's it thank you
