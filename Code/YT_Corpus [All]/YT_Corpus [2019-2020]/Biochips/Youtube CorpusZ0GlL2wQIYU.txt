 well good morning everyone welcome to Christ Community Church online services my name is Marc I serve here as the lead pastor and we are in prayer for you today but this is going to be an experience that will help you to grow in your faith to meet God and to experience him in a whole new way now some of you are experts in the online community some of you are people who have been starting this for the very first time there's your first time joining us online I want to say welcome to everybody there but if you're new to this we just have to admit this is a little bit weird isn't it I mean you get what it's like to worship in a group when there actually is a group but when there's not much of a group singing out loud might seem kind of weird and if I can just make a little confession right here it's a little bit weird for me to talk to an empty room as well but I want to encourage you that just like in church on Sunday morning you can engage fully in what's happening at this place I'm going to encourage you to sing out loud and to talk out loud and to respond like you would if you were in the room so if I say something like Jesus is stronger than Korona you would say Jesus is stronger than man that was good that was good let's do that one more time just to practice Jesus is stronger than Korona you say it because he is and when there's opportunities to pray I'd encourage you to bow your head when there's opportunities to repeat after me just go ahead and say those things out loud when there's a chance to sing take a risk and maybe sing out loud if you feel led if you say I'm a bad singer what should I do well the answer might be just sing loud and bad and there's not as many people to hear your bad voice this time or turn up the TV and just sing along with what's happening at that place but friends we want to encourage you to encounter the Living God today because God is bigger than all of our fears and God is the strongest in the universe so we're gonna engage with our very first song this morning it's a phase for all of us it's actually a tune that was developed in the beer halls of Germany in the 16th century and Martin Luther hijacked that tune in order to put words to it that comfort the soul the words are a mighty fortress is our God would you join in with our team on this one the flood of mortal is revealing for still our ancient for the seek to work us war his craft and power are great andand with cruel heat on earth is not easy Oh God don't you see just a smooth baby Christ Jesus Lord above his name flog hu H Mulsanne I need more Oh fish is ha Oh miss Mars all they may bye-bye this game is and all God's people said amen amen well across the centuries great comfort has been found in the Word of God and the picture of God that we find in psalm 46 where he is a fortress and he's a refuge a place of safety to which we can run when we need protection in difficult times so the opening verses of Psalm 46 to read a line of that and then have you respond right where you are this morning God is our refuge and strength God is our refuge and strength an ever-present help in trouble and ever-present help in trouble therefore we will not fear therefore we will not fear the Lord Almighty is with us the Lord Almighty is the God of Jacob is our fortress is our fortress amen may God's Word bring us great comfort and hope and encouragement this morning well now we're gonna look at Matthew chapter 6 verses 25 through 33 if you have your Bibles I'd encourage you to open them to the Gospel of Matthew I've asked sue to read these words this morning again my prayer is that they would bring us hope today for this reason I say to you do not be anxious for your life as to what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor for your body as to what you shall put on it's not life more than food and the body than clothing look at the birds of the air that they do not sow neither do they reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly Father feeds them are you not worth much more than they and which of you by being anxious can add a single cubit to his lifespan and why are you anxious about clothing observe how the lilies of the field grow they do not toil nor do they spin yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory did not clothe himself like one of these but if God so arrays the grass of the field which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace will he not much more do so for you o man of little faith do not be anxious then saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we call ourselves for all these things the Gentiles eagerly seek for your heavenly Father knows that you need these things but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things shall be added to you why do I feel discouraged why do the shadows come and why does my heart feel lonely and long for heaven and home when Jesus is my portion a constant friend is he his eye is on the snare and I know he watches me his eye is on the sparrow and I know he wants Jews me so I sing because I'm happy and I sing because our tree year here's a the sparrow and I know he watches me so I see because I'm happy and I seen because I'm free year here's is on the sparrow and I know he watches and I know he watches and I know let's join our voices together with the wonderful Gospel message in that song that we sing as a rally cry many times in Christ alone my hope is found let's all sing together in Christ alone my hope is found he is my light my strength my song this cornerstone this solid ground firm through the fiercest drought and storm what heights of beat when tears are stilled when strivings cease my comforter my little here in the love of Christ I stand in Christ alone who took on flesh holders of God in helpless babe this gift of love and righteousness scorned by the ones he came to speak till on that ball says Jesus died the wrath of God was satisfied for every scene on he was laid here in the death of Christ in the ground is my deal a light of the world by darkness a Morning Glory from a baby roll g-star for and here's my but with the precious day this is the power of cry Jesus gonna dance fine dad till he returns or calls me home here in the power of Christ Tildy returns or calls me home here in the power of dice of stand here in the power of 5 stars a man well we need to pray we need to pray so let's bow our heads before our Lord and Savior Almighty God we praise you for being our fortress our refuge our helper in times of trouble and we are weak but we recognize and worship you you're strong you're greater you go before us you go behind us you go beside us as the only one with the power to overcome Satan we pray that you will help us trust you more trust you always as we run to you as our fortress for strength during these uncertain days I pray a hedge of protection around everyone in regards to this this virus but I think even more importantly as Christ's followers give us even greater gospel impact during these times of trouble and fear give us opportunity to be the hands and the feet of Jesus we're thankful for the great hope of the gospel message grateful for the Holy Spirit and the peace we can know that passes all understanding now let us pray the prayer our Lord taught us our Father thy kingdom come give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us amen isn't it awesome to know that God is seated high on the throne and that we don't have to fear we can live with confidence knowing that Jesus is at the right hand of the Father and he's interceding on our behalf and it's just awesome to be able to worship together even in this online format we want to welcome you to Christ Community Church my name's Jed I'm on staff here at Christ community and I want to say again if you didn't catch what Mark said at the beginning of service if this is new to you if you're joining us maybe for the very first time in one of our online engagement opportunities we want to say welcome and we want to just encourage you to continue to press in and engage in the times where we invite you to sing when we invite you to respond just like you would if you were normally gathered here and maybe there's somebody from the Omaha area and you're connecting in your tuning we want to welcome you if you're outside of the Omaha area we want to welcome you as well there are some ways for you to engage online we've got some teams working with some you know comments and some chats available and we want you to press into those things as we kind of kind of walk forward into some uncharted territory for us well I do have a few things to share with you one is last week we were celebrating all the great missions work that the Christian of Missionary Alliance and our church as we partnered together with them are doing we heard about hands of honor in particular at the close of that service time we encourage you to to give $1 offering some of you gave physically some of you gave online we were hoping for $7,500 and I just want to say because of your generosity we blew that number out of the water we raised almost $17,000 so we met our goal to fund hands of honor and God has given us through your generosity an additional $10,000 to be able to invest into missions work and we have some opportunities we're looking ahead maybe helping to support our Hospital in gold Kingdom and just thank you so much for that many of you are also probably thinking in this time of uncertainty what can we do as the church and in just a moment we're gonna hear a great message from Mark that talks about 10 biblical responses to the coronavirus as how we can mobilize as a church how we can respond but I want to give you a couple practical ways that we're doing that already one is you know schools are closed down and we know that many students many children rely on schools for for lunches and breakfasts and we have a partner mission church down in North Omaha who has already got a team of people putting lunch and food packs together for food insecure families some of you have been bringing food this morning and we want to thank you for that I don't want you to feel like you have to rush out today and bring something right away we're gonna be collecting those donations throughout the week there's a full list online that you can find so that we can be really specific about what those needs are so if you're a healthy and able to get out and you'd like to contribute in that way go online to find out that list another thing is we know that you know one of the primary needs of the church is to care for one another and for those around us in our neighborhoods in our city if you happen to be somebody who is feeling like you know I need to stay home for a few days or a few weeks or I can't get out you need some basic supplies you have needs for that we want you to know that we're here to help you maybe you're on the other side of that you're like I'm fully capable and able to get out and I would love to help in that way we would love to coordinated an effort to help you get the supplies you need and mobilize our church in ways that you can help get those supplies together what we're gonna do right now is just send an email to our Executive Assistant Joshua Lillie his email is right on the screen so you can reach out to him say either I need help and the specifics of what it is that you're needing and or you could say I'd be willing to be a helper in that and he will be in touch with you there well like I mentioned our lead pastor Mark Ashton is going to be giving us a great message about how do we in these times and I think this is gonna be a good message for you I would say to you right now get a notebook out grab something to write with and let's pray together that as God leads our church in this new place that he would speak directly to our hearts and mobilize the church in ways we've never seen before let me pray for us and then we'll hear from mark Jesus once again we thank you we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your faithfulness we thank you that you are a God who never changes you've gone before the situation already before we even were able to see it unfold and we fully trust you Lord that you are moving and working even now so we pray God that you would open the hearts of every single one of us whether we're viewing it in a living room by ourselves with headphones in in a watch party on Facebook whatever the case may be Lord your spirit is present in all those places and we trust you in the name of Jesus amen amen amen thank you so much Jed I you know Co vid 19 is out and it's changing everything if you would have told me the stuff that changed this last week was going to change this week I would have never believed you last Sunday but at this point we are seeing unprecedented things happening the NBA canceled the NHL canceled n-c-double-a tournament March Madness my favorite sporting event of the year has been canceled it makes me wonder what is ESPN going to do for the next couple of months I mean I don't know neighborhood kickball tournaments gonna be on they're not exactly sure Broadway's been shut down Disney's been shut down no Mickey for you so now it's interesting to look at the social dynamic the emergencies that happen but the truth is this is hitting home hard for a lot of people personally and people are asking what about my reality will my business tanked will I lose hours at work will my finances go down is school really going online does my teacher even know how to teach online we've had our first case of community spread and the government the governor said we get our second case of community spread of the coronavirus schools will be shut down for six to eight weeks it's important for us to ask the question how do we respond are we ready for this to happen will I be ready with 14 days of groceries if I get quarantined will I this is the most important question of all will I run out of toilet paper in 14 days or not and then even more seriously you've got vulnerable people many are gonna get sick some of them will die at this point we don't know how many it's been called a pandemic but in a world of hand sanitizers tests and medicines it's just not clear how big and how broad the impact is going to be still it's scary not only has corona virus hit the streets for us but fear has hit the streets for us and I want to remind you as followers of Jesus God did not give us a spirit of fear but he gave us one of power and love and self-discipline so in that nature in the idea that God has not given us a spirit of fear we have asked the big question as followers of Jesus how do you follow Jesus in the midst of coronavirus how do you follow Jesus in the midst of a fear filled environment and so with just about 36 hours notice because our normal speaker cancelled on Friday we've put together 10 key reasons 10 key biblical responses to the coronavirus there are 10 key commands really and this is kinda raw Marc Ashton stuff but we're gonna get through 10 points in the next 30 minutes and if you're ready say I'm ready to roll all right so get out of pen and paper you're gonna wanna write a few things down that we're talking about at this time 10 biblical responses to coronavirus the first one is the longest and the first one is this trust the Lord touch the Lord where you're at say trust the Lord trust the Lord because he is not nervous he's in control he has watched many things like the Black Plague tornadoes h1n1 Wars Ebola AIDS and famines God has lived through all of this and it is nothing new in the human experience in fact we don't know how hard this virus is going to hit but I can guarantee it's not going to be as bad as some of the ones that we've seen in the past remember 2009 when influenza killed five hundred and seventy five thousand people in a single year or hiv/aids that's killed 32 million people in the last 50 years in 1918 the Spanish flu hit killing a hundred million people in the 1300s the Black Death was the worst of all it killed 200 million people at the same time it's amazing how a microscopic tiny virus can disrupt major social and economic systems coronavirus can shatter the body but even more so it shatters our illusion of control you are not in charge you realize that you're not in charge now the good side of this is you can take trust in the fact that God is in charge the world is tenuous but God is reliable I think CS Lewis said it really well he was an Oxford professor and in his book present concerns he answered the question in the 1950s how are we to live with the coronavirus okay he didn't actually say coronavirus in the 1950s he said how are we to live with the Atomic Age but some smart person inserted the word coronavirus for atomic age and I think it's a prophetic word for us today it's an extended quote but let me read this to you how are we to live with the coronavirus I'm tempted to reply why as you would have lived in the sixteenth century when the plague visited in almost every year or as you would have lived in the Viking Age when Raiders from Scandinavia might land and cut your throat any night or indeed as you are already living in an age of cancer an age of syphilis an age of paralysis an age of air raids an age of railway accidents an age of motor accidents in other words do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation believe me dear sir or madam you and all whom you loved were already sentenced to death before the coronavirus occurred and quite a high percentage of us we're going to die in unpleasant ways we had indeed one very great advantage over our ancestors and aesthetics but we have that still it is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the current crisis has added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances and in which death itself was not a chance at all but a certainty this is the first point to be made and the first action to be taken to pull ourselves together if we are all going to be destroyed by the coronavirus let that virus when it comes find us doing sensible and human things praying working teaching reading listening to music bathing the children playing tennis chatting to our friends over a pint in a game of darts not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about a virus it may break our bodies a microbe can do that but it need not dominate our minds that's from the mind of CS Lewis Oxford professor so you ask yourself the question in the midst of an uncertain world what does a follower of Jesus do well the first answer is trust the Lord here's what it says in Psalm chapter 46 God is our refuge and strength an ever-present help in trouble therefore we will not fear though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging friends God is not surprised by the coronavirus he's not worried about the coronavirus he's not up in heaven wringing his hand saying Oh what should we do what should we do because the idea of getting sick the idea of dying is not new the idea that some will die younger than others is not new in fact it's been true since the fall of humanity that everybody has died from sickness from age from war from murder from viruses God is aware of it all and friends this is why he sent Jesus into a sin-stained world because he knew that we needed a rescue mission because he knew that we were infected by sin because he knew that the darkness was thick because he knew that death was certain to come and he wanted to beat death not only did he want to beat death but he wanted to give us hope in a brand new life where there would be no more death no more sickness no more crying no more pain no more coronavirus and don't you yearn for that God gives us a certainty of that in Jesus coming Jesus summarized it this way when he said in this world you will have tribulation but take heart because I have overcome the world somebody say I have overcome the world and this is good news amen now God causes the rising and falling of kings he's the one who measured the seas in the palm of his hand he's the one who knows the hairs on the top of your head he was here before all things and he will continue on long after planet Earth is done and not only that but he loves you and he has your best interests in mind you can trust him in good times man I want to take a break at this point and give you a little bit of an opportunity to pause and reflect on your trust in God this is the foundation of everything and just for your comfort this is by far the longest point in my message but I thought at this point it would be helpful to reflect and pray on the bigness and might and power of our God and on his deep care for you so I'm going to invite Janet to play a little bit of the piano behind us and I'm just gonna pause for 30 seconds and where you're at I want you to close your eyes and bow your head I want to invite you to take a deep breath and relax your shoulders and take a moment simply to reflect on the bigness and the goodness and the power of God let's take 30 seconds now to reflect reflect and pray about God's bigness and His goodness let's pray god I just want to say thank you so much that you're so big and so powerful you're so mighty and you're so strong and that you hold our lives in the palm of our hand of your hand God we understand that our lives are but a mist in this world that they are going to come and they are going to go and in the meantime we trust in you not only for this little window of time that's our lifetime but we trust in you for all eternity being confident that our hope is not that this world is going to be kind to us but instead in the hope that you will walk with us through the midst of the pain that you'll be here you'll be caring for us and you'll accompany us both now and for all eternity we invite your presence and your strength and we ask you to help us to walk through this crisis fear free and we invite it in the mighty name of Jesus and all God's people said amen amen well that's point number one trust the Lord the rest of our points are going to go a lot more quick so be ready to write them down point number two is take the detour take the detour I was glad one of our elders Scott Kuby shot me this idea in an email earlier this week he said you know God took people on detours all the time Abraham for example was taken on a detour from his comfortable life with a lot of wealth in the city of Ur in order to go to Israel and then there was Moses who was comfortably tending sheep in Midian and was called to Egypt to be on a detour to free the Israelites and it was a detour that lasted 40 years in the desert nehemiah was comfortably sitting in the Citadel of souza being the cup bearer to the king when God said I want you to go and rebuild the wall in Jerusalem Paul was going all around the Mediterranean Basin planting churches when he went to Jerusalem and was arrested and thrown in jail for years on end but that deeds were eventually led to a series of Appeals that brought him into the courts of Caesar himself for what was the most powerful City and the most powerful person in the world you see God's been taking people on detours for thousands of years and the detours that he takes people on are very very good they result in nations being established slaves being freed and the good news getting all the way to Caesar and walls being rebuilt and I can't help but wonder what plans God has for you as he has you on a detour the kids are gonna be at home you're gonna have a different work schedule you may be quarantined for 14 days and I want to encourage you not to see this as an inconvenience but to see this as an opportunity God has so many fun things that could be in store for this as he directs you down a new path and I want you to ask the question just like Abraham said I will trust you Lord and so did Moses and Nehemiah and Paul can you say the same thing God I will trust you as you take me on the neat new detour our schedules are all of a sudden more free and more flexible and opportunities are going to await us in the midst of this this week we'll be meeting in our journey groups we're not canceling our journey groups this week those will still meet in homes all over Omaha and I want to encourage you to meet together and talk about this detour idea in fact we've got a little Bible study that has been written around that idea that your journey group leader will take you through so take the detour point number three use this the brain somebody say use this the brain use it I thought Yusuf had more Shakespearean power behind it so the idea behind this is just guys while we go through this let's exercise some common sense here Exodus chapter 20 verse 20 says whenever they entered the tent of meeting they shall wash with water so they shall not die now I think it's important for us to take our cues from the Bible and from Exodus and wash our hands kids this is a biblical principle maybe a little bit miss applied from Exodus I will admit but the idea behind it is the same wash your hands you've heard it on the news you've heard it from Exodus 20 seconds do it with soap use hand sanitizer sneeze into your sleeve try to not touch your face have you guys tried to not touch your face for the last few days I have tried that I'm failing miserably but at least I'm conscious of it now and not try to do that a little bit more use common sense guys and follow the guidelines that have been put before us also if you're somebody who is a vulnerable person if you're 70-plus if you've got respiratory issues heart issues immune system issues if you have family members who have these things and you share a household with them it's just smart for you to avoid crowds to stay home more maybe entirely if you have family members who are at risk be careful yourself that you don't bring it home to them for our older generation for our seniors if you have kids who are telling you moms stay home you don't need to take that trip you don't need to go out at this point listen to your kids and allow them to serve you in these moments it's hard for us to grasp the exponential realities that are possible with the coronavirus we don't experience much exponential growth in this world but this virus is doubling every 3 days they say that the United States is about 11 days behind the curve in Italy we're on track if this is unchecked if nothing changes if it still doubles every three days we're on track to 100 million cases by May unless we do our part to flatten the curve so let's be wise in the way that we manage our bodies let's be wise in the way we manage our time let's be wise in the way we manage our public appearances so that we can flatten that curve and see minimal damage that happens in this world that's one way to be loving your neighbor so there you have it use this thy brain number four number four anticipate the quarantine anticipate the quarantine did you know that quarantines actually have their origins in the Bible it was not the CDC or the HHS it was the le V that started this off the laviticus that started this off and Leviticus records a quarantine that was required for people who have skin disease check this out this is Leviticus chapter 13 I'm sure you were reading Leviticus chapter 13 just yesterday uh-huh but here's what it says verse 4 if the shiny spot on the skin is white but does not appear to be more than skin deep and the hair in it has not turned white the priest is to isolate the affected person for seven days and then on the seventh day the priest is to examine them and if he sees that the sore is unchanged and has not spread to the skin he is to isolate them for another seven days 14 days isn't that interesting and then on the seventh day the priest is to examine them again and if the sore has faded and has not spread to the skin the priest shall pronounce them clean so the priest doubled as a doctor in those days he was an infectious disease inspector and can I say I'm glad that rule does not apply for pastors anymore these days I do not want to be coming into your house to inspect the shiny spots on your skin I'm just saying but you should be watching yourself for symptoms a fever or a productive cough or respiratory issues they say are the key symptoms these are things that are sure signs and if you show symptoms for goodness stakes say huh stay home you may say well what if it's just the normal flu friends if you just have the normal flu you should be staying home for that as well out of respect for your peers and your friends it's just a common courtesy but even more so this year and stay home 14 days so that you can be sure it is gone it's not only smart but it's loving to the other people in our community number five serve the city someone say serve the city serve the city in moments like these we have the opportunity to not just protect ourselves but to do what God said in serving the weak protecting the vulnerable and loving the people who are in need I think that is isn't it is in the times of darkness that the light of God shines the brightest and we have the opportunity to be that light in these upcoming weeks Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 7 says seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have called you into exile pray to the Lord for it because if it prospers you too will prosper now the context of this is that the people of Israel had been called for 70 years into exile in Babylon and God said don't fight the city that you're a part of instead do everything that you can to be a blessing in this city because if your city prospers you too will prosper and friends I want to encourage you to be lovers of our city there's an awful lot of ways to do this but one of those ways Jed mentioned a little bit earlier food insecurity is going to be on the rise kids that were dependent on school breakfast and school lunches are not going to have school there at all anymore so our partnership with Franklin Elementary kicks into high gear this week as we have the opportunity to partner with our friends at Mission Church to provide food for kids that would otherwise go hungry you want to check out the list of food at CCC Omaha org slash Franklin you'll find those lists of food needs you can drop it off today by 12:30 or any day this week between 8:00 and 5:00 we'll be receiving those donations and we will be sure to get it to the right place because running to the problem is the way Christians have get engaged since the beginning of time that Christians were encountering problems and not only have they been doing this but this has been the primary way that the church has grown is when they act in love towards other people Rodney stark some of you may know is a sociologist who wrote a great book called the rise of gianna tea it was a watershed book that helped to describe a paradigm shift in how people thought the Christian the early Christian movement grew because it didn't grow through power it didn't go grow through the sword it didn't grow through the mandate of people who were the political leaders it didn't grow by converting the masses of the uneducated but it grew by rescuing abandoned baby girls off of garbage heaps by choosing not to have abortion or engage in infanticide and when disease ravaged the people the Christians were the one who chose not to run to the hills but instead to engage with right where the people were at they ran to the problem not running to the hills because they believed in Jesus the ultimate giver of compassion who modeled it inspired it and commissioned it in us Rodney stark writes this in his book the rise of Christianity two cities filled with the homeless and the impoverished Christianity offered charity as well as hope to cities filled with newcomers and strangers Christianity offered an immediate basis for attachments to cities filled with orphans and widows Christianity provided a new and expanded sense of family and two cities torn by violent ethnic strife Christianity offered a new basis for social solidarity and two cities forced with faced with epidemics fires and earthquakes Christianity offered effective nursing services friends the church is at its best when it's in the midst of tragedy and pandemic and this is the way of Christians because it was the way of Jesus I mean think about what Jesus did he did not stay isolated from the problem but instead he engaged with the problem he left the throne room of heaven in order to come to the mess of earth because he was not afraid to come face-to-face with sickness or beating or death he engaged so when we come to him we encounter someone who is not moat or aloof but somebody who has been there before when we imitate Jesus we run to the problem not away from the problem when we pray to Jesus we pray to somebody who has been through this cycle before even to the point of death and this is good news amen this is what reminds us of the power of God and this is why the Christian faith is different than any other faith in the world because we serve a suffering servant who's been through our trials who's been through our crisis and enables us by his power to do the very same number six number six engaged the CCC family engage with the CCC family I want to encourage you at least for the time being until things change to keep on meeting in your journey groups homes are good smaller groups are totally okay as long as nobody in your group is sick or in a vulnerable class if you're sick or you're in a vulnerable class you should not be headed to your journey groups but if you are not then those groups are on also I want to let you know that the church building is going to be open for prayer for benevolence for meaning a few friends in the atrium for talking to a pastor staff are still coming in to run ministries this week they'll be running their ministries remotely and we'll be discovering some brand-new ways to make that happen but the building will be open only through the main doors in the front we also are planning to launch some online groups in a matter of weeks for those who want to connect in a Google hangout or another forum watch for more news on that one and by the way sign up for our email list on the front page of our website so that you can have all of the latest discoveries and updates of what's happening here and while you're online consider changing your giving to online giving you can find a place to give on our app the CCC Omaha app or online at CCC Omaha org it works just the same as you pay online for anything else it's safe it's free and there is no kovat 19 transmission when you give online is a germ free baby so I want to encourage everybody to say hey we're gonna be supportive of the church by giving online during this tough time and will continue to have services online every single week we'll get creative on how we use them and we're gonna invite you to get creative on how you use them to get together with another family and do church invite your journey group to meet Sunday morning around services or invite your neighbors who may never drive to the location on a hundred and eighth Street your neighbors who may never darken the door of a real church maybe in this moment they are struck by the same kind of anxiety and fear that most of our culture is maybe they need a touch of Jesus as well and might engage with you in your living room in ways that they might not in a normal week I'm so proud of cat Hope Jones I don't know if you guys saw on Facebook but she put out a big invitation to anybody who was out there and her friend group that they could come over to her house for waffles and worship our worship and waffles this morning isn't that a fun idea worship and waffles and her open heart her open home I'm gonna give a shout out right now to the cat hope Hope Jones group I hope you guys are cheering right there at this point because that's a brilliant idea I didn't encourage everybody to engage with that as well all right that's number six number seven number seven is this love the neighbor love the neighbor we've got a cool opportunity to be people who love our neighbors at this point neighbors who may be quarantined neighbors who may be in a risky situation I want to encourage you if you've got neighbors who are seniors to check in on them on a regular basis find out how they're doing if you're somebody is Jed mentioned who would love to serve the seniors in our church I'd encourage you to just send an email to my assistant Joshua Lily Joshua L at CCC Omaha org and say hey I would love to be able to be a delivery person for those who are homebound the seniors in our church and if you're a senior and you say hey I'm somebody who's gonna be homebound for a while I would encourage you to shamelessly also email my assistant Joshua L and say here's my name here's the list of things that I'm gonna need someone to shop for me for and we'll do our best to serve you well as the church working together you also might want to post you on your next door about being willing to help get groceries or watch kids you might want to create kid watching coops for parents that are suddenly at home with their kids and you say to your neighbor hey I'll take your kids in the morning if you take my kids in the afternoon and kids are doing school online so they can do their school together or maybe you just go around and exchange cell phone numbers with your neighbors I don't know if you have your neighbors cell phone numbers but in the coming weeks you may not be meeting them out in the driveway somebody may be under quarantine and it might be smart to text each other with your needs tell people that you are praying for them one of the most powerful things that we can do is we love our neighbors is to be praying for people and to tell them that we're praying for them it's an amazing thing when the power of God enters into a fear filled equation so friends love your neighbors number seven number eight disciple the mind disciple the mind you may have more free time this week than any other week I want to encourage you not to fritter your time away on trivia but instead to invest it in your spiritual growth first Corinthians chapter 1 verse 5 says we demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ use this time to guide your mind ask yourself the question what are those things that I've been putting on hold that I've always wanted to do that I've always said if I had enough time I would invest in myself spiritually this way this way and before you do a binge on Amazon Prime ask yourself the question what kind of a person will I become will four hours of Star Wars or another series get me closer to becoming that person or will something else I think when you ask yourself that question you will binge on Deuteronomy instead of Disney plus on numbers instead of Netflix now maybe you've got a stack of books on your nightstand like I do I got a stack of books that are on the boy if I had time I would love to read these books pile if you got extra time at home maybe you could get into reading one of those books and if you're somebody who says I really love video learning more than any other I'd recommend to you a website called the Bible project they've got some of the very best videos that will help you to understand the Bible better than anything else I've seen out on the market today the Bible project go ahead and do a Bible project binge this week and you can learn the Bible inside and out and I'd encourage you as well to watch for ccconline resources I think our people our ministry teams will be creating some very powerful resources in the coming weeks that should bless you and bless your families so watch for that as well that's number eight disciple of mine number nine lead the kids lead the kids says this lead the kids have overt conversations with your kids friends if you're somebody who's a parent talk with them through what's happening because they're gonna be getting information from all different locations and you'll want to have conversations with them in overt ways in age-appropriate ways for your kids and you're gonna need to train your kids in straightforward ways like kids wash your hands every time you walk in the house Kelly is great at this reminding the kids and the husband to wash their hands every time they come in the house talk to your kids about that pray with your kids show them that you're living in the balance between being a person of faith and a person of wisdom and when all of the things around us are getting cancelled and you are stuck at home with your family remember what's not getting cancelled getting outdoors is not canceled music is not canceled family is not canceled board games are not canceled laughing is not canceled and hope is not cancelled so let's embrace the good things that we have amen alright number 10 finally here we go last one is to live the joy live the joy we are on an adventure with God and we need to live this adventure with optimism with innovation as people who are lights in the darkness sickness is going to happen because it's a broken world death is going to happen because it is a broken world but we need not be afraid of either of those because Jesus has already beaten death Jesus has turned back death and he has given us life to the full in fact the establishment of Jesus kingdom is all about turning back those things that were problematic in the curse when people lined up all day long to be healed Jesus touched them and healed them Jesus turned sickness into healing he turned darkness into light he turned back the night his goal was to mobilize a group of people who would infect this world not with coronavirus but would infect the world with the goodness of the kingdom of God and Friends in this time your life is going to be infectious and if you attack this problem in this timeframe with joy and with power and with discipline and with confidence in our God it may be the most impactful chapter in your life so trust the Lord my friends and live your lives in such a way that the world would see and know that Jesus is alive because he said in this world you will have tribulation but take heart because I have overcome the world amen amen let's close in prayer together father thank you so much that you have given us your word that you have given us life that you have given us hope in Jesus name I pray God that you

power father help us to trust the Lord to use our brains to take the detour to be ready for the Quarantine to lead our families well to disciple our minds and to live the joy God we need you to be
