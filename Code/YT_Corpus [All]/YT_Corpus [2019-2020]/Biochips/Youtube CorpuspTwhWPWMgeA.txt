 so welcome to this is getting old I'm your host Melissa B PhD and today I'm joined by dr. Lisa O'Neill so welcome Lisa how are you doing I'm wonderful thank you for having me today good and so you are the associate director of research and education at the University of Arizona and you have your doctorate in behavioral health and you're also a current health and aging policy fellow I am I am it's been a wonderful experience good so you and I connected a couple weeks ago and we're talking about all different types of topics but the one that you sent me you sent me email about some of this information around kovat and some of the scams that are happening now for older adults and so while this is always like typically a problem maybe you can just explain kind of how people are you know what types of scams are we seeing you know and or and we can just kind of go from there okay so what's what's happening today with the köppen 19 situation is you're right we always have scams that are going around forever in always grandparent scam a lottery scam the bank scams those are always happening and always changing and people are always trying to keep up with the new wave of those but in this current situation with koban 19 and the resulting self-isolation that's happening we find that many older adults are more isolated than normal which puts them at higher risk so they're also struggling with being more isolated and increased levels of loneliness fear depression anxiety and all of that puts them at a higher risk than normal so I think and then in particular we're gonna talk a little bit more about financial exploitation abuse so how big of a problem is it because I think this is something a lot of people don't know so in general this national statistics say that financial exploitation affects older adults on our economy anywhere from 3 billion to 36 billion dollars a year and that the range is so wide is because it's largely underreported and if the estimates right now that financial exploitation cases are only our one case for every 44 instances of financial abuse are reported so that's why we have a large range it goes it's not reported and the issue just keeps growing right so I saw somewhere that at least 20% of older adults have been the victim of some type of fraudulent scheme of some sort so but yes it embarrassing when you get taken I was actually happy to see Frankie and Grace actually had like an episode where Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin late did you see that one I did it basically Jane Fonda hire someone to come in and do some repairs and they sew like all the copper pipes out of her walls and I was like well there's one I've never heard of before one that actually is part of the general scans that normally happen there's yard repair scans and home repairs it's very very common they can show up and ask to do work and then do the work and charge you three or four times what they said they were going to charge or worse they'll show up do the work and then force you to pay make it seem in a very fearful aggressive style and they'll force you to pay right more than what you were supposed to pay right yeah so so let's talk about during koba's like what are some of the things that we're seeing that are that might be a little bit more specific to this particular pandemic so some of the things that we're seeing now related to Cove 8:19 are there the scam artists are going around door-to-door or they're calling offering to do grocery shopping for self isolating older adults and what happens is they're taking the money and never returning there are also individuals going door-to-door or calling saying that they can sanitize homes to help keep you safe from the virus there have been reports of people going door to door claiming they're from the Census Bureau asking for financial information um because the census is going on right now to you this is going on right now but of course the Census Bureau would never ask for money or financial donations you know for that cause con artists are also calling an email emailing consumers saying that they have back a cure or a vaccination and asking for money to be put on a list so you can receive the vaccine there's also a lot of miracle cures out there hand soap sanitizers to toothpastes essential oils that can help keep you safe from the virus there's also some instances where they're trying to war people to invest in companies that can detect or cure the virus and there's instances where people are going around claiming to be from other government agencies such as Social Security Administration the CDC or health department's and trying to obtain personal or financial information as well so there's just a lot more they're really focusing on older adults who are a home alone and who might be feeling very lonely and they're at higher risk because of that and what's what's really important to remember is that these scam artists are very good at what they do they are experts they practice they perfect their skills and right now they're feeding off of our fear of the unknown and our uncertainty about what's going on and what's going to happen and it's really you cannot underestimate the power of loneliness trust relationships with all of that going on and you're lonely and you're afraid trust relationships can develop very very quickly so them as an example let's say someone calls you and they're asking for money for some charity and you say no I don't know you I don't know the charity but you don't hang up and you just keep talking to them and they talk to you about the charity and you get to know them and you get to know the charity a little bit better and you hanging up and still no money has has changed hands well maybe they'll call you back the next day just to talk and to chat they talk to you yet about the charity by the third time they call you they're no longer a stranger talking about a strange unknown charity it's Bob asking for help because the person's going to call you back and that trust relationship is developed very quickly and that's that's how easy it happens just like that yeah so so what are some red flags I I hear the red flags and in each of the examples that you gave but how could someone like what is something that should raise a red flag so that you can recognize she's right so what can you do to protect yourself so the first thing that I would always say is trust your instincts if something doesn't seem right it's probably not right so go with your instincts first and foremost second don't trust anyone or give pay attention to anyone that you haven't met in person and most especially if you haven't initiated the contact if you initiate the contact more than likely you're dealing with the very reputable person and agency if they reach out to you asking for money or personal information be suspicious never make a payment of any type with a gift card but should also be a number one flag we all know to be cautious about giving out personal information your name your date of birth they can bank information your social security card but this also includes your Medicare number you should guard your Medicare card and your Medicare number just like you would a credit card so that's very important when you receive emails look for things like misspellings some typos weird fonts and remember that it's okay not to answer your door and not to answer the phone if you don't know who is on the other side of the door oh who is calling you is perfectly acceptable not to answer not to enter and not to talk to them remember that there are no miracle cures right now to be suspicious of anyone offering things like that anything related to coronavirus testing or supplies or treatment and really a common phrase that is used in to protect people against financial exploitation is just simply tell a friend before you spend don't do anything on taneous Lee just slow down think about it a little bit more and if you're not sure talk to somebody about it yeah like a shag now hashtag to a friend before you spend right and really all that does is just it slows the process down and gives you that opportunity to really think it through which is the exact opposite of what a con artist wants you to do they might pressure you using some aggressive tactics to make a decision on the spot and that's what we want to avoid right one of the other things she says you know if you actually do because you said if you haven't met the person face to face but if they're knocking on your door then what you need to wait until they performed the splake helps if somebody knocked on your door because I mean I see this a lot and I don't really know if they're legitimate companies or not but you certainly don't want to pay before they do what they say they're gonna do but you know part of what you the flip side is you said that people will do part of the work or all the work and then change the rate on you so right now what I want to do that's number one if someone knocks on your door and you don't know who it is don't answer the door if you need a service done to your home you initiate call and you call a local company out to you now you're expecting somebody so number one if you don't know don't talk to now if you do talk to them if their card and their information and say I'll call you back don't agree to anything on-site at the moment it's got to happen right now and they may say well we're here right now we'll give you a break in price if you let us do it right now but don't fall victim to that kind of pressure just take their card and say well think about it and we'll call you back that gives you the opportunity to maybe do some investigation and some research on your own to see if they are a reputable company and you really decide do I really need this service done on my home right now so again it's just slowing down the process so nothing has to happen right away so some of the other things that I saw so the late different resources that we could direct people to you know the u.s. the United States Senate Special Committee for aging puts out an annual frog book every year and you can just google this and I'll put it on my website at the top 10 scams which you know when we first saw this conversation you're kind of listing those but that's an important resource to to read and they have a hotline number because you can call eight five five three oh three nine four seven zero what other resources are calling according the general's office has recently put out a a phone number that they want people to call and report scams specifically related to copan 19 and that number is 186 672 0 5 7 to 1 or by emailing the National Center for disaster fraud at disaster at Leo elio gov I would also say if someone is feeling that they are in immediate danger say someone is at your door and they're being very aggressive I would call I would call 9-1-1 I wouldn't be I wouldn't hesitate to do that you can also call your local Adult Protective Services to see what advice they may give and always don't forget that your Area Agency on Aging will be it's such a valuable resource area Agencies on Aging are in all regions across the country so you have one you just have to google it find the phone number give them a call and they will know what's going on in your area what kind of current scams are happening what to look out for if they if you're looking for a specific resource if they don't know if they aren't doing it they'll know who is and so they're really a great place to start if you're not quite sure who I think a lot of the only other thing I found was the Department of Justice has a website and they had a resource roadmap and so even at any point in time it's even if it's not daring Cove at 19 that was like the little roadmap that would ask for your series of questions and then it takes you to the link for where to actually report whether it's the Federal Trade Commission or you know there were other federal agencies depending on who's if they took your money or if you gave your money you know was a family member professional so just kinda helps you navigate who to contact it definitely can help you with the reporting process for sure and if you can't remember again like who to call I really recommend the area Agencies on Aging as well because they can help you remember oh the Department of Justice has this great website you know and they can direct you there so because sometimes when this has happened to you you just can't think really of who to call and so sometimes just focusing on an aging agency is really your best bet and I have a go-to source that I think go to source now but this is so like criticals because older adults like their this is a time of life where they don't have time to recuperate the money that's taken from them and then they're embarrassed these things but this has happened so you know part of why I want to talk about a days to let people know that you know this is a you know an additional time that people are vulnerable and that this does and you do need to report it and we do need to know so that we can help you and then how do you recognize these things before they're happening to you right and really what I would stress is um it is important to know that this can happen to anyone anywhere in any setting you know this this specific situation that we're dealing with raises some of the risks but this can happen anywhere at any time any in the best of circumstances so it is important to know and to be aware and really don't I know that older adults can often feel embarrassed oh my gosh I can't believe I fell for that but you really have to understand how these con artists are this is their job and they have perfected it over and over and over again there's no shame in falling victim to it because it simply happens to so many people you are not alone you are not the only one and reporting it is really the best thing we can do to educate the public so we can get a handle on these and stop these scams before they get going yeah the key though is trying to educate people to prevent it but if it has happened to you to go ahead and report it because I would think even and koubek 19 didn't really matter how old you are if someone comes by and says hey I've got you know a warehouse full of masks and gloves and I'll bring them to use to help protect your family you're doing fine or we're going around and selling home base like COBIT 19 testing kits so you don't have to go to the hospital and you know I think that the public needs to know that those should be red flags anybody promising you you know something like that come to your door anyone coming to your door and making promises and wanting money in exchange right now for whatever they're we're offering should instantly sort of raise your suspicion and make you just think twice about their credibility right and get some time to do some research and and make a good decision right and they don't have to on the spot true and also knowing that they can come they can come to your email inbox they can call you on the telephone all right you know just kind of be aware of all the different tactics that they could potentially try be in the guard and give yourself some time to make the right decision all right well thank you so
