 [DR SARAH WALDEN]: The project we’re putting forward for Giving Day this year is ‘How low can we go? Nanoscale 3D Printing’. And the idea is to try and push the boundaries of current 3d printing technologies. To do this we look at molecules that can be turned on with one colour of light and turned off with another. Then by overlaying 2 laser beams we can fine tune the exact area where this 3d printing takes place. In doing that, we can narrow down that printing regions and make the smallest structures in the world. So these structures will be so small that you can’t even see them, but that doesn’t mean they’re not important. If we achieve what we want to and print the smallest structures in the world, we can make them conductive and therefore we can have the smallest fastest electronics in the world. Which means all our devices – our smart phones, our tablets our VR goggles can all get smaller and lighter and integrated into our everyday lives. To anyone thinking about investing in our project I would say thank you. You’re not just investing in science and innovation, but you’re investing in all of our futures, our future as a community where we improve our technologies and in doing so we enhance our lives.
