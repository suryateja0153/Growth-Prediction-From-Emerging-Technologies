 [Music] hi welcome to this module and in this module what we will look at we look at how can we create or fabricate su-8 pillars on the gold pad that we have seen the process flow of fabrication in the last module and then we will also see how to create a diaphragm so there are two process and once we finished that two process you will see how can you have a chip indicated with lot of sensors okay so if you see the slide in the last module we have seen how can we create the gold pad on the PISA resistive sensors right and we have seen how can you do that we have to deposit an insulating material oh and then we dope on the contact and then we can deposit gold and pattern the gold such that we have a gold pad and the coal context would be on each contact pad this contact pads as you can see if you see this piece of resistive material or sensor there are four of those each sensor you will have two pads so it for that to four-hitter will be ten and one for the gold will be 11 so one if I say from here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and for a gold 11 okay 11 pets we have open after we have in deposited insulator on the PISA resistive sensor and then open the contact area for oppositing gold and in the center there is an insulating material on that we have a gold bed so let us see how can we deposit or fabricate or draw the process flow for fabricating the su-8 pillars now we have to have su 8 pillars right so for I straight pillars let us see how can we further process so if I draw the wafer it's an oxidized silicon wafer it we all know on oxygen silicon wafer we have a heater right on heater we have insulating layer except on the heater contact on that we have inter digitated electrodes right on this we will we have fizzy resistive material and on that we have the gold pad so let me use different pen color of this pen is okay that's fine so here is our PECVD silicon dioxide let me write it down silicon dioxide with thermal your pressure and a thermal oxidation silicon wafer silicon dioxide silicon dioxide using pecvd right we have nichrome heater then we have inter digitated electrodes on that we have p 0 resistive sensor on this we have gold pen ok now what we want we want su 8 pillars we want this structure right these pillars are su 8s u 8 okay so let us see the process of how can we fabricate this s 8 pillars or pattern su 8 pillars on this particular chip so for that what we have to do so I'll just like remove this thing for a while so that we can understand it properly hmm you paired you just delete it now we know okay so if I want to fabricate or pattern su-8 on this chip on this chip then I will spin code I will spin code this su-8 material spin code etc there are several kind of su-8 and depending on the viscosity we can have different thickness of a suet material right so right now we are interested in having su eight pillars with 50 microns thickness 50 micron thickness hmm so we will deposit a su 8 which can give us 50 micron thickness by controlling the rotations on the spin coater so once I spin coat su 8 on the chip what is the next step next step is three big or soft wake soft make now in this case soft bake is done at 65 degree centigrade and the time depends on time for baking depends on su 8 thickness time for baking depends on su 8 thickness all right so after spin coating on the chip this su 8 material we will do this of baking after soft baking the next step is mask right so let us see and understand this thing su 8 is a negative photo resist it will behave as a negative photoresist all right so if I want to have a mask on this right my I want su 8 pillars only on two places and remaining places I don't want as your pillars so what kind of mask I can use if su 8 is a negative photoresist that means area which is not exposed right area which is not exposed will be we right here a which is not exposed will be weaker so I will have a wafer a mask which is my dark film ask dark film ask so in that film ask as you can see the most of the area in the mask is dark and the area which one we want to expose does not have any chrome material it is a chrome mask there's a chrome mask so you can see here here and here you we can go and even in area you will not go so from here and here the you can pass through the remaining area you it cannot pass through okay so this after loading this is a dark field mask will go for UV exposure UV exposure so when we do the UV exposure what happens the area which is not exposed the area which is not exposed will become weaker because this is negative photoresist and the area which is exposed will become stronger right so if you see the slide after UV exposure the next step will be the next step in reality should be so if I draw the photolithography process then it is spin coating spin coat photoresist next step is soft baked soft baked right next step is UV exposure next step is photoresist developer next step is Harbach right this is in case of photoresist positive and negative photoresist in case of SU eight which behaves as negative photoresist the process is like this spin coat spin coat su 8 next step is soft bake like I said 65 degree time depends on the thickness UV exposure next step is hard bake this is done around 90 95 degree centigrade again time depends on the thickness now when I say time depend on thickness how you will know using the datasheet data sheet for su 8 okay after Harbach here you go for PR develop PR developing okay so in positive negative photoresist these are the steps in su 8 these are the steps so so what is the change in the process flow if you can see the slide the change in the process flow is that after UV exposure instead of going for photoresist developer we have to go for hard baking so when I say that you exposure we have done the next step is hard baked and hard waking for su 8 is around 95 degrees centigrade again for how much time depends on the thickness of su 8 material after hard baked photoresist developer right so when you develop your photoresist after hard making what you will find is what you will find is that the su8 will only be in this region and remaining region su it will be will get developed in even in region the photoresistor is a su it will get developed so this R y su eight pillars all right these are my su eight pillars now I will place this wafer so now what you understand that this is a wafer for example and I have su eight pillars on the wafer right vertical pillars on the wafer if you understand the physical body position there is a shearing effect so because of that if I have a pillar let me explain a little bit if I can help you out hmm okay you understand don't consider this top surface like let me say like this okay now this is the wafer there is a wafer and this tip this tip that comes out here right this much this is this tip either su-8 pillar okay don't consider the top section of the pen now if I place the wafer like this I cannot quote on the side I cannot code on the side so but if I tilt the wafer then I can coat on the side right at least one side we can coat it right so if I if I till the wafer at 45 degree angle in there PVD which is physical vapor deposition then I would be able to coat this su 8 pillar with a metal that means sua pillar will have the conductive line because at least one side of the su 8 pillar will be coated with metal so su 8 metal coating will be the next step how can we do that we can place the wafer we can do the lithography so if you see again here I'll do the lithography and I'll only open I can do either lithography or I can just save the protect only half of this and remaining so once you if you tilt away for anyway even internally her if you till the refer then you will have su-8 only the material will be only deposited in this area in both the cases right so I will have a conductive one so this su pillar will have a metal contact metal contact all right so if I go back and you see what you see here you see that you have a chip you have a chip right with su 8 pillars coated with metal that means the last module we saw this gold pad on the piezo resistor sensor in this module we see the su 8 pillars right without coating and su 8 pillars with metal coating now what is the next step next step is we have to create a diaphragm on the backside of the silicon wafer this diaphragm will be exactly on the backside of this hmm so if I have a wafer by a wafer and these are my visualization sensor my diaphragm would be like this they divide we had to create this diaphragm try to create this diaphragm because these are piezo edges two sensors right these are PCO resistive sensors so if I apply a pressure or force then if I apply a force or pressure what will happen this diaphragm will Bend and depending on how much the diaphragm is bending this there will be change in the piezo resistivity that pressure resistance right then which is in the resistance so thinner derive from better the sensitivity but we have to optimize the diaphragm thickness because then the mechanical stability will reduce so in this case we are creating su-8 pillars and below the sq8 pillars there is an electrode which is gold pad below that there is insulating material below that there is a piece of resistive material below that there is a green insulating material below that there is a micro heater magnetar is on the oxford silicon substrate and the said we are to create a diaphragm so that when we apply pressure onto the Sui pillars the the applying pressure will change the pieces resistivity of the episode resistor depending how much the diaphragm will Bend so to create a diaphragm we are etching silicon from the backside of the wafer right that is the idea that's why we are creating the the diaphragm on the backside so if you go to the slide and if you see what I want I want to now so let me just stir up this down it becomes a little bit easier in that way the only thing tricky about su it is that after UV exposure to go for Hardwicke so if you remember that much then your life becomes easier okay so now if I want to create a diaphragm on the backside of this chip so that whenever I apply pressure the PISA resistor would change its resistance right what should I do I should I should do the lithography but on the backside of the reference so in that case I will deposit a photoresist this will be my positive photoresist right positive photoresist then I do positive after that I'll go for soft bake which is a 90 degree 1 minute hot plate after that I load the mask and I want to etch the region which is below this piece of register region 8 this is pre co-write so physics region so I want to etch my wafer like here and this area under protect this area and this area I want to protect this area 1/2 edge so I'll design my mask for positive photoresist so positive photoresist the unexposed region will be will be stronger right so I have a bright fill mask as you can see and in this we'll have we have unexposed region because this photo as this will be unexposed in this particular blocks while it will get exposed in this block right so if I go for UV exposure if I go for UV exposure what will happen the unexposed region will be stronger right so the after this off pic I load the mass can go for UV exposure when I do that followed by developing photoresist right in PR developer what will I have I'll have I'll have photoresist only in this area and the remaining area photoresist will be etched right now next step is Harbach next step is hardwick are big you all know positive photoresist 120 degree centigrade one minute or Glade after her baking we have to remove the silicon dioxide from this region so we have to go for buffer hydrofluoric acid or bhf right so what will happen silicon dioxide will get edge right because of the buffer hydrofluoric acid was a next step I will protect the front side right either mechanically or using the photoresist and back side of the wafer please look at this side the backside of the wafer I will etch using deep reactive and etching this is a dry etching when you go for silicon etching there are two types wet etching and dry etching in wet etching you can use two different chemicals TM a H and Koh dry etching is RIE or D RIE right there is an NS trafficking this isotropic etching reactive ion etching deep reactive ion etching potassium hydroxide tetra methyl ammonium hydroxide now there is advantage disadvantage in both the cases when when you see your different lecture in which somebody teaches you or maybe in my earlier lecture you will see how when you bein we were looking at the bulk micromachining probably at that time I have taught you that how can we use DRI or wet etching and what is the difference right so if not just go through a YouTube videos where you can see how driv works how RI works how Koh works and what is the what happens when we use TM h right TM is also neurotoxic it has to be used at 25 degree centigrade Koh way to use at 80 degree centigrade DRI will give us a vertical wall so if I use DRI and if I H the silicon wafer and what will I have I'll have a die diaphragm if I use DRI then I'll have diaphragm like this now I know the rate of etching of dr I suppose DRI H rate is 4 micrometer minute and if the thickness of this effort is 500 microns then I would know how many minutes I need to create a diaphragm of 100 microns correct simple so I had to H 400 microns if I want to create a diaphragm diaphragm it's this region and let us say that this region is about 100 micrometers you depends like I said thinner the diaphragm better the sensitivity thinner the diaphragm better the sensitivity now what you have definitely you can remove this what you have is a complete chip integrated it so the first the bottom layer okay bottom layer is heater heater over heater that is silicon dioxide insulator or insulator there are inter digitated electrodes made up of chrome gold over this there is a gainer in soot okay over this there is a PC register over this insulator over that gold bed right over gold bed we don't have lights and I doubt this is on the gold bed you have su-8 pillars and then we make this pillars we coat metal and below heater there is silicon dioxide on silicon wafer and this is my diaphragm as well right this is my chip this is much it this is what we have learned in all the modules together how to make this bio chip now you can see that you are learning so many things so many different sensors onto one chip but the idea is what to do with the sensors and how can we use these sensors for the given application that is to understand the properties of tissues hmm properties of riches suppose a dish from the biopsy is given to you what are the properties that we can understand so using this chip let us see how can we use different or how can understand different properties of tissue okay so let us keep this slide as a last layer for this module and let me teach you how can you use this slide or to use this chip which is a biochip MEMS based biochip for understanding the change in the tissue properties when I said change in tissue properties there are several changes right from electrical to mechanical to thermal to pH rates everything changes and that changes when d the tissue is diseased that is if we take the tissue from the breast cancer area depending on the stage or as the stage of the cancer progresses there is a change in the tissue properties so let me show you let me show you before we end this slide I have something for you in my hand and that is your bio chip okay these are the chips these are the chips in my hand right over here and this chips are the one that you have seen on the glass light on the indie in the modules right all the modules including today this is the chip that we want to design is it possible to zoom little bit so you can see here right you can see that I am holding several chips here in my hand if you can just focus on one which is right over here right and you can see that this chip has all the sensors that we are talking about in this particular module alright so this is these are the chips that we'll be using for understanding the tissue property these are oxidized silicon wafer on that like I said there is a heater insulator IDE is preservation material insulator gold pad su-8 pillar method on the gold pad on the back Taizo diaphragm alright so let us see how can we use this chip to understand the tissue properties in the next module alright so till then what you do you are to understand the this particular module in detail what I have taught particularly in this section we have seen su 8 su 8 has a little bit of trick like I said when you take a photo resist which is positive photoresist or negative photoresist the standard step of photolithography is spin coat the photoresist put a soft make it then load the mask you we expose photoresist development and Harvick in su 8 was a difference you spin coated then soft make it then expose it then Harbach it then you have to go for photoresist development right easy and if you want to make the photoresist even harder that the su it even harder after heartbreaking and and the photoresist developer are making exposure and the photoresist development of course after her so that is spring coat soft bake expose hard make then photo this developer in in case of su 8 and then after that you can bake this wafer with su 8 add little bit higher temperature let's say 130 or 140 degree centigrade to make the su 8 better stronger and then what we have seen that how can we deposit metal and how can we create a diaphragm for diaphragm we have used deep reactive add edge like I said there are several techniques to etch the diaphragm now since bulk of the material is etched in this particular step we will consider this as a bulk micromachining right I have taught you what exactly bulk micromachining is in my earlier modules right so let us see how can we use this chip that I have shown it to you in the next module for understanding the deeper body till then you take care I'll see you in the next class
