 who welcomed with this semester I will dub reggae sheehan is a before yeah well pre- compile it out that so small yeh cuz he skype ID aircraft for product six islands even much too exciting some I don't see a prospective me cannot figure this moment to check the process for credit ET spiritu blah blah too much acid well below yes okay well firstly let me introduce myself so my name is Nick meta that's t r+ is late samuel together as the slide there says my title is a senior technical marketing manager oh yeah Yello houston winter of my marketing I've been any company a little over 15 years and currently my responsibility is to bring our new products to market techno up technically oriented company is using another chick at the publishing your brother post which we need to you can and to train our sales force out technical sales calls and really write a lot of the initial collateral technical collateral and builds a lot of the early demos as well the second one key marketing worthiness to my son died she of the publishing your uncle clean especially Tiffany Kenney kseniya oh good the study about you Jenny brother things and she fish today ok so I'm going to talk for roughly two hours still could watch something about the ultra scale architecture or you wouldn't know what real risky you'll see a little bit of overlap between some of the slides that yen showed earlier but I'm going to talk about them in a slightly different context i will be doing you select the piggy wiggy skill which agrees that's three internal naturally oh gosh i was going with crystal boolean debacle okay so let's get started no commissioner so this is the slide against show just a moment ago it covers the history and the present date I'm orbitally that's like a reproduce you present that sir a little story of appropriate things where we broke out from traditional programmable logic only in form of fpgas are enormously she manages so just programmed in q3 into the three technologies that we see today as the future of the company so fpga system-on-a-chip and 3d ICS even this ignition engine moving quickly because we chillin wassup done little give up a posse to ski italy the system led to their customers alone so i'm going to focus on the middle section of the I'll do it this way i'm going to focus on the middle section of the graph today here the 20 and the 60 nanometers are years agree to order part a co- more associated expensive coats on CHS to the process will see me it's important to stress that we are very much committed to our relationship with our foundry partner TSMC oh yeaah fish store we mean the ridicule yet machine is probably good business year and you may have seen a press release at the back end of last year talking about our commitment into the future as well oh ye oh these national purpose on it technology property ownership let's not make it look listen to you later so we're skipping the next note from TSMC which is the 10 nanometer node and going straight to seven nanometers are you so good at all probably keep the walls also coolio design the door which I will give all your problems till you're finished article you see melody and given our understanding what the competition will be doing we believe that that continue our leadership that yet already showed you what some see more useful I think either special ed look like the revolution so again yet showed you the entire portfolio who talked a little bit about the Spartan seven and a few things that are happening here prison does the inside because i was on a schmuck folio donna for a response in for me i'm going to talk in in two halves of a presentation here so the first half i'm going to introduce the 20 nanometer architecture or nationally lots of woods they can we look like each statistic one specific smell give us dynamism and then in the second half of the presentation i'm going to show you how we build on that architecture with the 69 retail Tresckow class devices or curse of politics isn't that silly or each skill pedals on or associate nash technology you screw us an equal portion 13 national steel unprompted partition so it's important to understand that all four of the fpga families and the mpsoc family in this slide share the same fundamental building blocks that again restoring a couple of eng slides over the phone is dis Chile product but also in the program i luoghi ter systemic risk olle y me doc she still noisy okay so when we defined the ultra scale architecture when we moved from seven series interval true scale we had identified a few key design challenges that a lot of different designers in a lot of different markets for experiencing kodama completion which or non-commercial cause first or technology would conceal when I begins a sphere where should they call Lisa collect their numbers and variables so the first is that the routine delay can't a book takes up a fairly large portion of the overall timing budget in a design eat their ways medical star0 will train you put some easy boy cities idea open house look your insolence cuz it's a presence the second is that clock skew introduces similar timing margin problem so it also confused a fairly large proportion of the overall tiny budget when the coop spans from the center of the device although commercial was to probably and puttering where she opened up she needs to it as i discussed defending your tub though this includes like you built in you when you deal with new ways to those reasonable and the third really is about how well we can pack our logic together so a CL B is a configurable logic block which contains a number of different logic elements or physical world ways to learn a song we are booking so each skin walk America that's corporate the Peterborough and we want to be able to allow our software tools to pack as much of your design tightly together in those elements as possible unions in yamuna charitable bruna that was Russia polish support when you more cities Nagini reported so that logistically so the first element that we addressed was the routine so our devices are getting very large a bit of a problem across the probably wanna look here national postal always peekskill sketch in Queens but I'd switch to butcher and as we get too much larger devices you can see in the graph it becomes almost an exponential increase in the amount of logic so if we were to just scale the sort of previous method of increasing the interconnects you can see that the gap between the amount of interconnects and the amount of logic would end up getting very large easy sweet kiss please c'mon Bo will you be given system is a quester continue seeing a really mean to me finish though when you're sticking in the rubble New Guinea or you can create knowing each other gives will you pull your head still and of course this introduce problems if you have a large amount of logic in your device but you can't connect it together you get into a non-vertical situation which is not recoverable from es not special problem occurred a police to one skilled acoustic music needy newspapers a tomato explain your shoe designer so for this reason we change our routing structure via social patina which movies media someone for google result care see first of all there are actually two ways that we came to it the first is by modifying the mux structure that assigns different signals to different locations in the architecture wizard share with me some particular you see so this allows for more flexibility around connecting signals to where they need to be if the boogie twist explain you see me image but you still again and the second change was to and physically more routing tracks to the device oh we both thought I chests at the scene and this is obviously an investment on our side it's not free to put metal in a device you don't vote for watching this kid c ohkubo across fortunately she difference simplicity in the netip absorber but of course it is essential to the usability of these products oh yeah the potency much as always now exposing new world was not finished product okay so that's the routine the second aspect that we addressed was the blocking structure little share problem initially insisting petunia so I suspect many people in the room are familiar with the 7 Series and previous generations from xilinx in the competition he adorned store which will not review the corner personal met art or more pastoral ECMO tuxedo university-purdue she's nice though so first we've had in our older generations a central blocking spine with global clock buffers buff geez all located in the center of the device are you the history point of a particular blue Nevada current so sometimes ductility if they've spoken of Pakistan so most global clock signals will come into a clock capable I open in the IO bank and access those global buffers and then the clock signal will span out from the center what we're mission I was like you saw your support on tuxedo any events Pakistan so in ultra scale we changed the architecture completely overkill what you doin to ask you only these four fools on reproductive international press so we divided the architecture up into lots of much smaller clock regions each of which contains its own clock routing oh no particular reason why system ductility of components please do you know who your peaches this has been our money kina that Milwaukee or equal to none and importantly that's what rooting in both the horizontal and the vertical direction the ER polishes him of year that was a Houston with isn't a clinician holding him so instead of one large tract of vertical operating in the middle of the device you can see that you have these distributed vertical clock roots in every clock region you immediately put the magnet on school or what he taught to visit abroad expenditure shalini attack this stolen up again Danny cheeky that doesn't tend to get offended so you think as the devices get bigger the real benefit of having all of these extra routing tracks is very obvious it didn't exactly turn out well include whose gostoso go down a little to notes to worship worship English student a particular understand a standard said boolean so you've got a huge amount with programmability where your clock signals are presently or you can or respecting progetti wishing in question with the result articles so instead of spanning everything out from the center of the device like in the previous architectures from the buff geez in the middle or equal of progress w shì city but i was lucky to talk to opposition which is called reunion to dispel pobre mujer you've now got this ability to only drive a clock where it's needed within the device of North good rapport JT was molested as a lady doctor when you know foolish Edinson Cavani Okajima or rotational temple so there are quite a few benefits to this new structure the first is the ability to balance the skew around the logic that the clock is driving or equally as a good deed was the cherry most of the lenticular awesome leeches I just took a design magazine and also you only are toggling the clock tracks that you physically need to toggle thereby saving any unnecessary signal propagation and therefore pounds of equal memento story monsters on you to Tinian almost American booties because in the booty written sometime scetches a disconnect so in addition there are in the older architectures only 32 truly global clock buffers in the new architecture we can literally have thousands of clocks around the entire device Oh years ago to do is to support new show particular complicity book exclusion of 31 years it's just me now it isn't shown on here but of course we also include all of the necessary frequency synthesis and phase shifting capabilities in the form of mixed mode clock managers and museums and pls yoga the bond years are those students progress resource afford up for me so system or possibly just at least leave you faster belly is also done just follow the worshipper initiatives firstly the third element is the the fundamental building block of the fpga you we call it the clb the configurable logic block in DTV internal microtel last night's Republican where she at the problem i saw you tell me what you skin welcome or even already given me so the definition of what a CLP is has change over the years in the different architectures most recently in seven series the clb consisted of two slices each way for look-up tables and eight registers on the booklet were though in wlc or just moving its moisture into state there's a witch's t sliced my poison so the first thing we did with the ultra scalable architecture was merge those two slices into just one big clb he did was presumably the duty of the media the last way so i did my troops from slice so by doing this we taken away the boundary and enables one extra white marks and a longer carry chain are either results before to professional i was designing with a bow which are typically magnetic penal system ultimately but really the main area that we've improved I think is the connectivity within the lookup table of registers are not which insidious news media precisely with some of the blue oiled up your new home Oprah's new a funnier person the penis is the apartment so this scenario illustrated here with the yellow signals may be familiar to you well I'm not opposed to do let's go put them under most bhutan because of Tom's now call me if this is muy cydia Oh dick it'll be early near the consensus you might this also tired so we're showing a design that is trying to use both of the two registers that are available with associated with that lookup table but there is only one bypass input into the two flip-flops they share that input you could reach already sorts of possibilities to it does at least working with the sorcerer booster there's your panini on Ibaka Zbyszko Kutner will cut knee before any of you could watch your foot ye also he's from even the record years or so to get to the second register it's necessary to root through the lux which I consume some of the logic that you might otherwise want to use and me of course incurs a propagation delay and impacts your overall tiny budget you those are Church soars ideas that is the keynote room to play so look you more poachy to Oh example or build a nuclear resources bookmans cause allah salah a bit emotional design your particular so if you watch the screen carefully you can see the change that we've made is to have dedicated input bypass inputs into each of the registers re ortiz nene cotton always do a week or his montana station so idea partner resources are pretty low done in addition to that we've given the registers more capability around their control signals so we go we've doubled the number of block of april signals / register and we've given them some extra flexibility in the term of ignoring aversion local capability oh the Baltimore is the renewable tree near in love someone Sam you could you know this mobile video page to put a fool probably yeah I was a senior year at activity ok so the let's try those three elements the three routine clocking CL be packing elements together look at possible tomorrow hospital she'll be writing which before Cathy Lanier leadership so effectively probably one probably was the Union signal of a pony named Sylvia equipment oh so if we look at the very simple diagram that represents an fpga sort of the impact of those three items together enables the design to be packed much more tightly together oh the main economic took the Soviets ever progression than one day to PG bringing Yamaguchi distinguishes examine myself as a couple which results in shorter total wire length in the design which results in greater performance because there's less distance to travel and lower power consumption because fewer next to toggling EO movies identities of but because what you see Nene instead of the biochip lozada we sneeze your chin up debris inertial examples me as a teaspoon yoga struggle and of course you can see that the blue dots there that show the utilized selfies are all much closer together there are very few white dots show which indicate unused clps and therefore you're effectively being to use everything to you people are you disqus position on or Nene seal beach which store normal as we were nepali tcp piously designer on all night some more can someone we expose me to Poland watch these posters I struggle question ok so those are as I say the three sort of fundamental building blocks that we've changed in the architecture it could well really deep that you funding técnicas many a buckaroo on us so when you saw a student and of course we know that the hardware is nothing without the tools we need the tools to be able to support the changes in the architecture nor with meaning yell Pau to get near social despite is leah's communicability or cooking program latest achievement and that's what we refer to as being co-opted amaizing our dough the point of team is us through such a mechanism media programs between Iran so it really means that we've internally changed our processes so that the software development organization is very much in tune with our silicon development organization much more than it has been in the past ye does next dose for a national program that Miss Virginia or what they all committed i wanted to the story i'm not to be zero libido particularly moxie when our exports of the US or subsidies media cattle yes which neighbor so the divano tool engineers can get working on supporting the new features at the earliest possible opportunity ER went a year ago started supper was not a disaster tippers meanie eclectic buoys ipod Vicki's Mourinho program like speaking in a somewhat um kind of double okay so we're going to have a little quick look around the rest of the Opera scalable architecture are you a general provisions for luteum was medium what you do than five and the important question for pebble is what time is the break that we're aiming for a second to us kadala so you know what you screwballs is your thing okay perfect so I will go through the ultra scale architecture here then we'll take a break and then we'll go into the 16 bit more customers please it doesn't last and sustainable Justine whatever words I mention wakatipu ask you is even beautiful nature program so your attitude for skilled is perfect so let me talk a few about a few different blocks that we modified from seven series into the outer scale architecture ar e or pollute dishes I don't see to look at autumn with me here by you on as which knuckleball high school just kill so we start with the block rain the built-in block memory election was butchering permits yet so I think most people again who are familiar with the fpga architecture understand the idea of having a block of configurable memory in the device are the other must only use waspy miles each other knows each other but it does make cookies was it so for several generations at least at the high end reviewed 2 36 k block 36 kill a bit block a year during usually seems to me the sports employment problem like this mod can be split into two independent 18k blocks it book modular sported sure Oh Chester and much like all of the other resources within our common equity architecture they're built in columns oh yeah that was later understory a source of authority is Nate padrino video so we have the ability to cascade multiple blocks of memory together to get a bigger memory array yuppers onitsuka schedule I'm acutely are scheduled appointment no bikini obiora or suggested social people in design and in the auto scale architecture we've actually hardened some of the routing that connects those blocks together in order to not deplete any adjacent fabric of its routing when making those bigger memory arrays in which was medium for Google+ kabuto sperm whale is nearly apparently me the salsa vittorio pozzo lianca scheduler to pilot sure that i was the booze booza is purchased in your weekend the boy was an inch of prism so in addition to the routine changes we made some changes to the built-in fifo so there is FIFO logic around every block ram eat the job i'm in dollars women speak scheduling my studio is meaningful for those two British who gives a particular at least honor so in previous generations our soft or Corps Gen as it was then 50 and the built-in 50 they actually had different feature sets with different flag agencies and so on a log walls notes for yourself is medium voices oh that's been mastered were able to buy me two or more monkeys at least with victory feature do since I just came here with a minute so starting with ultra scale we actually modify the built in fifo to be a very similar feature set to the soft by foe and and the results of that is we allow the user to change between the two implementations when they need to re yo c'mon ova co most artistic exclaims and his team is producing for not breaking up over a mobile kitchen in addition we are always trying to reduce the power consumption of the devices you can just know this planning and putting in with the dancing music opinion of course toys for your cooking so we'll talk a little bit more about specific power consumption reductions at the 16 nanometer weight of the presentation but there are various user accessible power down and sleep mode configurations that we've introduced it to the block round our mobile recording or a spectacle you changing a linear voice leadership to prison tats along with this more about what we discussed oh no particular skill secret xscape water the biomaterial Turco with the hook just before you too so moving on to the DSP we change the DSP slice from the previous architecture Sumwalt oh yes collector would just be walkable for some years but do it on anjali skinnier flickers mean so the first one probably the primary challenges that we change the size of the multiplier up to 27 x 18 EPA's mean yells and with some caution of home using you because redness to magic today diggy speak so we've also added the ability to square the pre adder and we've added a wide x or block year Doug's real estate commission with the earlier but it's so hot that I wrote a book was in your quadrant II or something so so we were finding that so obviously a lot of wireless applications use the DSP slice but less in the wired communications market Oh conditional or the book was points which ragini occur is probable this case you mean spradling so we have the ability to use that wide x or without the rest of the DSP slice for common applications in wired communications such as cyclic redundancy checks and poured out aggression you've got well done their local trucking solo which is poison to me we also to create such a book desolate you can clean specialist person here with you so the final change that we made is not such a silicone changes an internal modeling challenge or eat the jealously the is mean Academy's deal with anomalous result so it's doubly near the hooker boys of today so in previous architectures we've treated the DSP slices a black box british chick google+ change the positivity more Kirby's be a local chubby ish Sodhi in college meaning you can probe the inputs you can probe the outputs but what happens in the middle is a bit of a mystery do stop the right now post brittany marie and i would okay so for the first time here we've got what we call white box modeling which means we have stages within the DSP slice that can be probed during simulation and debugging eco quiz me know district weakest edition witness I affiliation respect Amish just retain moisture it's nothing you took a look at how it goes quick believe that'll work so you can see that anything isn't performing as it should you can get a much more accurate idea of where the problem is happening you do solution seemed like what what's going almost to what the heels other books with extreme your bro's quick video the other day when you might get off the ship accessibility copia nation on the spear so looking at the serial i/o we are in the upper scale 20 nanometer parks we have two different types of GT transceivers oh yes we're classy before or since the first killing him what's he punch remarkable so in the context altro scale devices we have what we call GTH what was closed when i think you get the food rescue or so it's a GT each so these are the very mainstream transceivers that are capable up to 16 gigabit per second communication for protocols like Jess dto for or Cirie and summer for serial memory interfaces oh yes good job boys quizzing you done though I dipped I seal upon me the bunch of choices of them Mookie pushing a question thank you can scream the face of Jesus TV right yeah the about yes 5 m/s impossible so at this 20 nanometer know the gty transceivers the 30 gig and over capable transceivers other reserve of the vertex ultra scale client family only re is great or voice krasno cleansing people inside GTA GT ye AI yi yi speak a word doc Walker bats quick ask you and you'll see how we've changed that in the vertex alpha scale plus families of the break our eoh a buddy chill lmc sleepless he'll loosen hospital so we have a lot of people using transceiver stand alone as communication protocols but often people are wanting to couple them without an industry standard communication protocol as well by the way was meant for nokia she knows i watched his for super classy nice piece chicken piccata kyrenia tangela session oriental for Tacoma apparently bullied to give Virginia so we introduced the 100 gig Ethernet and a 150 gig interlachen hard or integrated IP blocks in the ultra scalable architecture eobert particular with rascal nope it's the lane 1 integral mistake it because of mud walk east except in token and you can see from the diet or from the from the numbers there in the chance obviously if we don't build them you build them out with fabric out of logic and if you do that you've used some of the FPGA that you pay for a couple doesn't promote obviously uh keep working on emotionally yummy zealand you were playing in annapolis video i KP walk before 1pm sukhoi cuts off a key its aim it was a key piece or service my associates near quite as much please so I was integrating these blocks firstly gives you a very good resource saving you could give up emotionally sporting take your clubs throwing a source of a long or can I mean the Bristol school but also because the circuitry that creates the integrated IP is much less programmable than aussi lbs the circuit is physically much smaller and therefore it's dramatically lower power consumption arias Leland quick tomorrow soft etiquette are we missing our crystal or so I'm in the crystal to Australia sheenia no Papa sneakers dimension history book which is sushi is no more or less question ravinia novel technology so these devices by can use both toward Easter IP block can use both of the types of transceivers the G th and the GT why with the line rates listed in the table evenly working on book was was it all booty for concealed pistol in a logical this one I give me tonight okay so a couple of diagrams of how they look not really a huge amount more to learn there look let em cook deleted so we'll give them so we talked about the clocking architecture with every within every clock region we have a coupling of a clock management tile with an IO bank and that every one of those high performance I owe banks has a memory Phi associated with it you could really always mean it's for top 20 years this moment was my pitch book discussion in Catalonia oh no Cena sealants punkin oh the field of four but it was not succeed initially packaging so unlike having a dedicated memory controller in the device somewhere that's associated with 100 bank we have the ability to configure any of our I owe banks as a memory controller you can approach machine for the proficient level controller by meteors or spring together was closed for inspection with a booty mister sister was mostly spin orbit or exported controller in domestic Iran you're crazy man so a lot of the market is reaching towards ddr4 we have the full support in the ultra scale devices up to 2,400 megabits per second we speak skiers of service eternity probability but the least-known killed on that moment the the GTE of course coterminous English this move in school but of course we recognize that a lot of people use ddr3 ddr3l RL deer and other interfaces so we maintain support for all of those using our memory interface generator you got grew up in one store once you're finished in this pursuit deployment of the depleted available per share or chair like a for years or more unknown yet in either way so we have for several generations integrated pci express box into the FPGAs you finish steel muscle in my body nice xmas walking here on my list starting with the vertex seven xt + HT families we have had a gen three pci express Loch Ness see more XD hto partner for us national person to group sex+ will kill camping and in the ultra scale devices we've increased the capability of that Jen free block a little bit over what we have in cemeteries er yes mr. wh 0 c.b.c missed oh she's going to ask you know who'd she leave done the book or submission system so again the big jump in pci express technology i think really comes from going from the 20 and venture into the 16 nanometer-scale plus families which i'll talk a little bit more about after the break yeouch we probably forgotten probably in your possession news p who just got stinger schnoz nanometer for this deposition over he sure that they look more like an opera hospira so some technology that yet talked about with respect to their competition a little bit earlier we refer to 3d ICS which are built using our stacked silicon interconnect technology you've got Williams propulsive isn't that circle which months ago her custom Leah's prism a novio spectacle interconnect at the conservative in class humor girls would be selfish so you ain't showed you the top view in his diagram oh yes because all you could see only that is much bigger thing but I think the really the more interesting view is how the thing looks from the side if you take a cross-section through the fpga yoga West explains book or modern eclectic she'll storm that will exist this your internet side so just so we're all familiar with the terminology the SLR is a super logic region yes the good to terminal you got this you eat sticky wicket SOR occurs so exactly a super logic region is a single piece of silicon and there are depending on which family we're in up to four of those in each device eco provides solid subway just lvg a useless chapter seedhi baat memory you can't wait which scription so those fpga died the super logic regions are attached to a passive 65 nanometer six metal layer interposer year let those obscene eardrums Brooklyn you mr. Alden us pretending otherwise iana spans all right square in proposal or jets ago just answer to release it on soil or channel each nothing major traces face are you working on stuff and one thing that's important to point out that again yen's alluded to is the notice the balls here so these balls are very regular very uniform that makes the manufacturing and the stress within the device extremely easy for us to analyze and regular he cook wise religious we missed it earlier but the couscous that's the deal mr. Yost manager and that's where we see the challenges with the alternate ability methodologies where they have different heights between the different die and the potential person are you oj and some baklava store or national coriander frizzies we just hopeless life technologies which oh yeah this ticket it's an ice creams so it's just a different way of manufacturing but it's something that we've been doing now so this is the second generation 16 nanometers is a third-generation year ago posted on drug or specific areas at select neiman-marcus Valley or digital pero poco de he just has to so essentially a Justin on meat omelet with it spreading and Alex know you so it's something about our tools of learns and that we have learned a lot about with TSMC as we've been developing the technology you've got sisters are able to keep its mobile game we're watching our walls none cept this I'm seek out the private yield so against the from a design perspective the important question for you guys is how we'll do the signal was held as data and popsicles get across these boundaries between the two diet Oh II Cockburn off the shingles are butchko Louis when you might have on caucus analysis about his fellow and the answer is very easily p.m. so first we have the in every clock region we have a number of these interconnect columns are equal good we asked about the develop of code number called universities like its owner so those interconnect columns are on the silicon die and have direct connections on to the interposer this typical do an agreement with skinny Oprah product or bottom cut her own collagen and within each cop region there are nearly 3,000 data connections between two adjacent orissa greater pasted automatically unified initiative and die is up to depending on the family member up to nine o'clock regions wide yes agree to all critical mass someone with metallic liquid up got a duty most rapid spin temptation to department so you can see that we can have nearly 30,000 data connections between two adjacent to Pilate regions are quite pleased to be seeing you when I see stop us seen yet the office hope everyone and that's quite a lot not so in addition to the data signals we need to get the clock signals over the interposer as well plugging your core fitness or signals Malkis vulnerable Madonna the Easter thought that was and all of that lasik light flocking structure that we saw in the earlier slides crosses the interposer on dedicated very low latency low resistance tracks yoga ball to reveal pieces per issue cookie dough in here this multiplied store and I should be most searches so was it was a pause but so no millennium was so nice convenient registry so in seven series the previous implementation we were seeing customers realistically achieving in the mid three hundreds of megahertz performance or use the glute or people can you not see that you know all your thoughts muy Serio pisanio pkc two signals just a bill please please check news and in this architecture here we're very much looking at over 500 megahertz data files you orthotropic alenia ardent i will give easy satirical presumable cheney video some when the cwe Lucas of Camille's course the ultimate goal for us really is to make this invisible to you and hence we use this term virtual monolithic we are done bush like year Paul change our keepers oilier plumbers oh I'm ready to speak crystal blue levis / but don't like a crystal chats ok so I think this is a good place to have a break mm zoom period or pick up our people need coffee piccoli coffee so we'll come back in 15 minutes we'll come back to
