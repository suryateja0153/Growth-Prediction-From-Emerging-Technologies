 sorry what I'm talking of menteng the human body I probably gone from doing one a month to almost one a day I do feel a little bit nervous about this I think it's good at something new I think you need or will be bigger than piercings I don't think about nice deep breath in for me just gonna bring the towel down to your waist I would say I'm a fairly alternative person after working with you I am actually off to get a microchip in my hands which is quite exciting there are many benefits to it that I feel like may help in my life now I'll be able to store business cards the contact information or be able to pull up my website really quickly if somebody asks again the phone over it so biohacking is a term used to explain augmenting the human body using technology that we implant under the skin to better interact with the world around us I think I've always been fascinated with tech and futurism and interesting ways that we can upgrade ourselves today we're gonna be implanting some microchips and looking at ways that we can program those so it's like a long grain of rice this is bio glass so it's very very tough material to be honest you'd be more likely to break several bones in your hand and break this chip I've probably gone from doing say one a month to almost one a day so it's a pretty big increase in the number of people that are interested in this now the youngest I do them is 18 the oldest I've done I think she was 62 and it was because her daughter had had one as well she was really excited about it and she got one done the same day I think in the future we'll see this being a core part of our day to day life similar to how quickly mobile phones were integrated into our society we don't really think too much about the invasiveness of that now a little bit scared about the pain this Nido is definitely bigger than than any of the pacing leaders I've had so far cool excellent come on through thank you fantastic yeah just take a seat if my skin was to reject it for whatever reason little B would be a bit crappy it doesn't need to travel too far just enough that it can't back out of the hole we're about to make so it's only gonna go it's the best centimeter and a half under your skin the needles quite big and scary but it's not going that far in so nice and loose you don't need to your focus on controlling your hand now so kind of let everything go a bit sloppy and just nice deep breath in for me thank you you are now officially a cyborg I think it's a very very small step on the way to becoming a cyborg cool approach NFC tag now you've got like that raised area you might have to gently give it a little bit of a push down into the skin as long as that's not too uncomfortable one of the other things you can put on is an excellent pornhub link of your choice and I think everyone goes on to it immediately loads up if they haven't turned their media volume down it auto plays it's fantastic this chip is bridging the gap between cyborg technology in everyday life technology take care guys bye the one thing that does concern me the future is people forcing other people to have a chip like for work for example people should always be able to have that choice if you don't want to get on that's absolutely fine but those of us that do let's have some fun with it and see what it can do being at the forefront of this is quite exciting you you
