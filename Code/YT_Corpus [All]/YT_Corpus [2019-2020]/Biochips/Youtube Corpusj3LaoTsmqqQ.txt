want to rank up so um hope you guys are enjoying if you guys want to tag along with me if you guys have cold war zombies you guys can just swing through uh the psn is too real unreal i'm looking to play with legitimate people and if you're just a big ass baby who doesn't know how to play and rage quits then this is not the game for you uh so let me yeah i love yo danny the shotgun is strong the shotgun runs deep with me um so let's go ahead and start this i need to moderate danny real quick uh what's up everybody we got sultan in here limit breaker joshua aj thank you all so much for being here all right so we started eight minutes ago i mean this this should have went smoothly for me but i have to make sure i check my uh i check my stuff next time all right so uh hopefully enough we don't get into a lobby full of babies because that's the last thing i wanna i wanna have to deal with here um you're an xbox no i mean but i have i have cross play enabled um i played with devil artemis several times and he has this game on the pc so we were able to uh to cross play ps5 and pc and whatnot i got the notice that i'm here for you bro my boy belmont back at it again got kendrick in here all right so um as we look oh crap am i to enter a game all right so we're about to enter a game yo i don't know why i'm getting i don't know why i'm getting nervous i don't i i think the reason why i'm getting a little nervous right now is because this is the first game of the night so um i don't know let's see we we might stream for uh we might stream for a little bit tonight so let's just see now some of y'all might be wondering like yo what's the deal with me and zombies on the ground me just playing this more often than i do any other game i love zombies i'm a huge fan of zombies um and great we just started the game and we're already [ __ ] migrating host this is why either either people got piss-poor connections or or people just quit before the game even starts i hate when that happens i've gotten into so many games oh god it's just me and one other guy all right cool so i'm gonna i'm gonna take some zombies down real quick uh uh in in in honor of my boy danny who um who clearly knows that i'm a huge fan of the humor shotgun uh so we're gonna be discussing a few things right because i weirdly enough we have a lot of subs on this channel but youtube as of late has been so crusty i have no idea what's been going on uh it's shut down and what just happened did wow okay disconnected from the servers this yo this is why man this is why playing with randos is like the worst uh youtube has been really really wonky as a way i'll get in a few weeks along with some live and play with you actually danny this might surprise you um but so i i got my hands on the xbox series x and i got my hands on the ps5 and i'm not gonna lie to you um i absolutely hate the xbox one the xbox one is trash um i would much rather choose the xbox 360 over the xbox one for personal reasons however the xbox series x so far won me over because i got the game pass and i'm able to like log on to the xbox series x and like play a little bit as a gamer and it brings me back to the 360 days the interface the you know the smoothness of like how it introduces you to like everything it's no longer about being this you know home system media digital like you know it's just [ __ ] it's it's actually feels like an actual gaming system so um the ps5 is beautiful the xbox series x is beautiful so i think on this channel i'm gonna swing through and i'm gonna play a lot i'm gonna play a lot of games from the game pass because i i got what i downloaded the other night was uh dante's inferno biohazard seven you know um resident evil four i i downloaded several i have mortal kombat i'm just like all right you know let like let's get it you feel me so um i don't know like to me the uh this is the way i structure my my consoles right from one of from what i can remember right i don't wanna i don't wanna count the the super nintendo or the ps1 whatever i wanna start from the ps2 the ps2 is better than the xbox that's just me right the xbox 360 is better than the ps3 the ps4 is better than the xbox one and so far i would say the ps5 and the xbox series x are even because they just came out so like nobody really gives a [ __ ] but that's just me if y'all want to disagree let me know um what is it with you and your next level uh ideas joshua what the hell is going on with joshua right now bro super saiyan god joshua um are you gonna live stream on other games yeah i am i'm just trying to figure out what i'm gonna do because this this channel i want to make it as diverse as i can with stuff that i really enjoy so uh i i i know listen for the most part i know a lot of people are fans of me for dragon ball and that are fans of me for other stuff which is cool like i appreciate that but on this channel i want to do some horror [ __ ] i want to play resident evil you guys don't understand i am a huge huge fan of resonating you guys have no idea like as big of a fan i am as for dragon ball i would say i'm almost as big of a fan get the [ __ ] out of my fence [ __ ] is my [ __ ] fence get out of here [ __ ] it's my [ __ ] face um i'm almost just as big of a fan don't be a [ __ ] green you better start playing bro you better start playing with me broski okay so this guy's pissing me off this guy's oh whoa zombie zombie zombies we got zombies right here i don't know why selling jason today all right yeah so my recommendation is this right i told you guys this on the previous stream if you guys have the um the that shitty ass quote-unquote combat knife it's not really all that shitty at all it's actually a god knife uh so save that um the the the howard 77 or the humor 77 however it is you want to pronounce it this gun that i have right here is really really really good like do not get rid of this gun if you pack a punch this gun to the third uh to the third pack of punch or to the third degree you will have a very very strong chance of surviving uh pretty far um guns that you don't pack a punch don't you ever pack a punch the ak-47 from what i've been seeing and from what i've heard and from experience the ak-47 pack-a-punch is trash after you get to like beyond wave 22 it's just the crappy ass [ __ ] gun so don't waste your time hope you're having a great day oh yeah i i've been having a pretty chill day am i accepting donations sure if you guys want to drop a super chat it's really up to you um i'm gonna put that money towards fan mangas anyway i have a whole lot of [ __ ] that i have to work on i've already started videos for next year isn't that crazy like aren't i a psychopath for like doing that i already have videos planned for next december next november next october on the [ __ ] psychopath yeah i need to go outside and touch some grass uh play with me but i don't have it well then how am i supposed to play this game with you joshua if you don't have it it makes no sense like what oh touch all right so is anyone going to open the door because i ain't opening the door first get out of here all right so these these little scrum these little scrub buckets are not going to open the door um open the door uh check the diffs oh we got we got torres in here i i love taurus you know what's interesting i met taurus a year ago for those that don't know and um i believe it was on new year's he came in and first thing i heard was a debate i think was buhan and kid who and i'm just like man did this really did this guy really just jump into my discord service like debate i don't mind it at all but it was just kind of like i was like oh man are you here to [ __ ] around bro are you just here to [ __ ] around and it turns out i befriended the guy and he's a really really cool ass dude um really smart too kind of clumsy he lost his phone for a week not knowing that he was in his car so like what kind of [ __ ] is that right so yeah so i wasn't able to contact anybody from like the real world because i lost my phone in my own car so it's like all right so he's a pretty cool dude yeah sometimes you meet people like in a very interesting way you know i hope everyone is having a great day or night um you know what's crazy too speaking of taurus because he lives overseas so uh i don't know i don't know if anybody here is also from you know the uk or from anywhere in europe but i've been hearing that they're gonna have uh the coven vaccine over there first listen if if some resident evil [ __ ] breaks out over there and y'all got some zombies and [ __ ] that y'all [ __ ] listen i've seen 28 days later right that's exactly how this [ __ ] [ __ ] starts i've seen 28 days later so but interestingly enough like they kind of gave like a little origin story behind like the the rage virus but i feel as though the rage virus is about to start being the coldest vaccine so if you guys are going to be getting that out there good luck to you if you grow another penis on your forehead let me know so that way i don't take it you know what i'm saying so um i'm in the uk yeah i don't know man i like i i i just hope that i'm kind of iffy on taking it all these these these scrub buckets finally did decide to open the door all right cool um i do want to take it but i want to make sure i'm safe i don't i don't want to kill off my uh my reproductive system and you know not be able to have kids and next thing you know i grow like a freaking third leg out of my ass or whatever so uh california gone have real zombies so yeah yeah cal california already have some i mean listen by default we as people are already zombies we're always looking at our phones our heads are always down might as well just you know just go along with it right yo can we get those likes up by the way jeez man we got a bunch of people in here uh what up alex been a fan for years bro keep up the good work thank you what's your name rahim i think i'm saying that right raheem williams thank you thank you for being here bro uh play dragon ball roblox no i'm not listen i don't know [ __ ] about roblox i don't know what roblox is i i always figured it was like some knockoff minecraft stuff i like to me i'm just like nah like i i see a whole bunch of kids playing it i'm not a kid i'm a whole grown ass man i'm into zombies i'm into first person shooters and rpgs and stuff you know um so uh what would you do if uh you were a zombie well i would eat people right uh let me see you know what i i think it's time for me to go i think i need to uh just start looking for the box or whatever are y'all good over here y'all have like a whole bunch of hoopla going on um all right so i think let's see do they have do we have all the doors open or no all right good they have all the doors open so um the thing is with me to always open this sector uh this section here and then just uh listen i i always tell you guys this right here come over here grab what is this levels damage all right so always get this shoddy uh pack a punch is always uh not pack a punch bomb juggernaut is always available listen y'all need to obstruction i need to open that right now um we have the box oh the box is here all right cool so let's see if we can get that knife if i can get that knife then i'm gonna i'm gonna prove to you guys um that is pretty strong why am i going to get the same gun twice i'm good bro someone put play grand theft five that that's that's the way i saw it either you don't know how to spell theft auto or you just decided just to like put it on the short term hey man you should play grand theft auto 5 sorry bro i'll play grand tf5 i want to play gta 5 with mods man i've been modding a lot of my games but the one the one game that always gives me a hard time is gta 5. i wanted to do some dragon ball [ __ ] on there i wanted to do some uh some zombie stuff that i did a few years ago but now the game is like so difficult to like patch up it's just annoying uh play call of duty modern warfare um i i had model warfare but i think uh i think for this we're just gonna stick with this uh for a little while let me see uh how hype are you for resident evil eight danny you should already know bro i'm i'm [ __ ] i'm mega hype ferrari i'm i'm really stoked for re-8 only because they're backtracking not well i wouldn't say backtracking but they're back sourcing their information to uh and their resources to provide a game that is legitimate with the narrative that being like uh the game is gonna oh oh oh the game is gonna follow through by actually being a horror game it's not gonna be like some you know first person you know just call of duty like ask a kind of game it's going to be a legitimate horror game um and i'm going to be streaming that probably on this channel and i'm going to be doing uh a game roulette series on it on my main channel so i'm very excited honestly um i think what i was thinking about doing was i was thinking about whatever money i could make off of doing these streams and videos off re8 i'll just buy a whole bunch of copies for people just because i feel like first of all if you're not into resident evil then i don't know what your i don't know what your problem is um resident evil again just like dragon ball has its own canon it has a whole bunch of like you know [ __ ] but i think um that's a crappy ass sniper uh we're on wave 10. is anyone did did we open up the doors yet or not all right cool so we need to go downstairs oh oh i'm don't kill him though he's the last zombie don't actually no don't kill him yo yo [ __ ] nuts don't kill him don't he's he's the last zombie don't do it [ __ ] take it everybody someone activated um i think we're about to go downstairs why am i getting the same guns bro i'm getting the same goddamn guns i got 8 000 points so i'm gonna pack a punch in a bit um what do i think of re7 danny you know i like rd7 re7 was really good um it took a little while to adjust to oh there we go the knife okay you see this knife listen listen listen to the sound of my voice you see this knife watch this watch this this is a one-shot knife i'm telling you all right now i used to be like the rest of you guys bitching and complaining about the knife one shot knife bam one shot knife one shot everything is a one shot so uh what's up the omnipotent one so okay so yeah this knife pack a punch this knife listen to the sound of my mother effing voice bro this one shot kill one shot killed one shot kill i am giving you grade a advice right now use this sniper this just easy kill easy guy i i i can i can help i have to get shields and i have to pack a punch both the uh the shoddy and the knife but listen to the sound of my voice oh crap oh crap oh damn it i bet where'd i back myself up i backed myself up into a tree that's just bad yo pick me up pick me up pick me up broski pick me up roll skill bro over here bro it's all good jonathan yo uh like i said just make sure you guys hit this video up with a big fat like oh that always helps us out with the engagements um yeah so if i'm not mistaken i think these dudes what i'm gonna do first is the knife i think the knife is a one shot until we get to like wave 20 right um give or take give give or take the um situation but this shot is gonna do me justice if i can just uh let me well do i want to pack a punch first damn it all right myrno arcs are really heating up yeah um so i might as well just tell you guys right now uh the myrno arc the final story uh i'm i'm planning on releasing it not not anytime soon as i have to tell the story of jiren i have to finish the the story of uh jiren and toppo versus myrna and stuff like that um after that i have a couple of side series specials with that story and then uh i have myrno versus universe 6 and then once once myrno versus universe 6 is over everything ties together into the original story and then i'm going to tell the final story once and for all and then be done with the myrnos stuff forever and then we're going to move on to other stuff so i'm just letting y'all know that right now um so oh wait he's on our side i'm about to say everyone hit that [ __ ] yo consultant bro like you've always i i always see you in my videos i appreciate that like i that that goes to like that really goes to tell me that you uh that you care about me as a creator and you're actually there to support the channel so thank you so much for that as well as danny and a few other people that i've noticed uh doing these things over the years i i always appreciate that so thank you um what do i have i need to get um do i want to hit that box again not really oh oh crap thank you so much for the one dollar donation mr limit breaker i'm gonna put that that dollar to good use my friend thank you uh nah bro thank you thank you man myrnos super saiyan blue nah i ain't never gonna do that that that that'll just that'll destroy the entire meaning and purpose behind what the heck is going on what are there's the oh crap there's still dogs here bro like how i thought these dudes got rid of all the dogs um everywhere um what i've noticed too is that there's a lot more dogs as as there are people like let's just say like the more people we have the more dogs there is i mean obviously right um what do you think about chapter 67 is going to be about i have no [ __ ] idea i just dropped the video on my management talking about what you guys had to say about it to be honest i have no idea it could it could be literally nothing or it could be something of significant importance i mean i don't i don't know i uh i i would like to assume that it's going to be something that's going to involve um beerus to some extent but uh fallen god damn it we're not going to do your your your crusty this cami but there has been one and when the next halo game comes out we're gonna be streaming it on the channel and uh we're gonna show the world live as to how much of an ass you are to me you butchered me over a sword bro uh someone just said xbox series x playstation 5. i have no opinion on that i have no opinion on that only because so far they're equal to me uh the xbox series x and the ps5 right now are equal to me the reason why they're equal is because both consoles have no games and both consoles just came out but you know what for the first time since the ps freaking 3 and the 360 the series x and the ps5 actually feel like gaming consoles the reason why they feel like gaming consoles is because they focus primarily on gaming and then all the other [ __ ] after that so by the way if you guys are new to this channel uh smash that subscribe button i mean that always helps me out a lot uh oh boy this is oh this is bad you see look at that knife or that knife one shot how much money am i making on this channel i swear to god i am making roughly around ten dollars or less on this channel every month so don't don't don't don't look at this and be like oh my god but like i said before going back to the whole resident evil 8 thing if i make enough oh there he is the big boss uh if i make enough money off of like certain streams i'm just going to get games for people like because i i there are times where i want to play with viewers i'm like yo do y'all have the game or not and people like know so i'm like you know what all right cool so if if we raise enough money on these channels i'll just go out and get you the game and i swear to god you better play the game with me instead of just like wasting it because i've done it before but my friends on discord can tell you all i i have purchased oh oh i have purchased um games for people and sometimes they don't even play with me i'm just like yo what the hell am i rich no but i am rich when it comes to life meaning like i'm happy with where i am uh what if galactus enters the dragon ball verse that that's a non-possibility or at least now we we had that with moro um on friday the 13th game commentaries legend oh oh yeah fright yeah friday the 13th i listen so okay that just tells me that you're you're an old viewer uh so thank you so much for being here but yeah friday the 13th was always fun that was always such a fun game i don't know what happened to friday the 13th to be honest with you um i don't know if like they get well i know the game is still around but like i don't i don't know if multiplayer is a thing anymore it sucks i used to love that game that was a really that was a really really splendid game oh crap all right we got a whole bunch i told you guys look this this shotgun is very very strong [Applause] uh use it for good big bro nah i mean like i said i if if i can make enough money to give back and buy some games for some peeps or for some friends i'll do it i mean why not i've done it before the only thing that sucks is i've gotten so many games for people before and they don't even play with me and i'm like all right okay okay just uh i'll i'll go [ __ ] myself okay uh let's see let me see someone said how is this compared to black ops 4 um multiplayer wise i don't really know zombies wise you can't compare because this is a brand new game it only has one map you know what i'm saying now there's something you don't see your average evil mountain thank you i appreciate i don't know how much your canadian money's worth maybe i can get some beef jerky i don't know but thank you like i i appreciate it like you're not into resident evil but omega group must have had a damn good reason to open it back if you're interested i i could try to copy the game when it comes out even though even though you're probably going to play it for like 10 minutes and just leave hey following so what'd you think about resident eight that was good it was just uh it was it like it didn't have jiren in it so i just put it down all right all right uh do you think cammy oren has male genitalia wait a minute so that's why you donated for me to read that out loud you son of a you know okay okay do i think cammy or no he doesn't or no it doesn't because uh crap uh because when cammy oren fought clearly cammie oren doesn't have pants so i don't know i i wanna i want to say cami orange identifies as non-binary right do you really want to get gender specific here fallen right do you want to say that cami oren is is non-binary you you [ __ ] it's just you know a neo machine god dammit kendrick am i i'm not i'm not rich you've asked me that same question i missed resident evil outbreak yeah um yo they should they should remake that game like how they did with like re2 and re3 it should we make outbreaks so many people have been calling for it a lot of people have been calling for it to be honest oh god we got we got to get oh we got c4s up in here all right cool so that means i get to i get to kill everybody with the damn c4s um someone just said pack a punch your knife not yet not yet not yet um i i don't want to pack a punch my knife only because i i still need this shotgun on deck oh no no hold on i need to reload i don't want that damn axe uh what are you going to do in the next vid what do you mean next to vid next vid for what what what are you referring to all right let me go downstairs what's your favorite game in 2020 um that's a really good question limit breaker uh what's my favorite game of 2020 um okay well i liked spider-man spider-man's pretty good uh i'm gonna catch some flack for this but i really don't care i i kind of enjoyed the last of us too only because of the gameplay i i think the gameplay was pretty fire i need fifteen thousand i forgot oh wait you know what all right i'll pack a punch the knife i'll pack the knife up real quick so yeah the last of us two gameplay was pretty cool the last of us two gameplay was like really really authentic so it felt really nice um among us was really great even though that game came out like two years ago right yeah oh look at this knife bro was that watch watch this watch this notice how there's no insta kill right let me see look at this look at this a one shot this knife is a one shot would i lie would i lie to you guys come on this knife is a one shot i'm gonna run around and just start stabbing everybody oh no now we have insta kill that sucks but yeah so pack a punch the knife and keep it around it's it's always useful tagged another dead uh hold on i think we just got another don't know hold on let me uh i have to focus i don't want to get down i don't want to get downed come on come on come on okay fancy duck debate me on incest right now okay incest is wrong but like don't tell me your stance is gonna you know i yo you you you make me question a lot of things about you fallen i swear to god you are such a fascinating person debate me on incest right now first of all stop wasting your money on questions like that what are you doing falling i'm not debating you on incest if anybody else wants to do it then they could do it but i ain't doing it because there's nothing to debate it's just it's objectively wrong it's biologically wrong you you make a baby with said family member it comes out with defects like what are you talking about like are you an in-cell bro stop it fallen uh would you fuse fusion primal vegeta with muy go right now you mean for the mono story i guess you're gonna have to find out i still have to complete um fallen's manga which is coming out in just about a few days damn damn damn yeah i i need a i need to upgrade my modifier real quick damn damn damn oh good damn look at this damn uh alex make goku vegeta broly fusion uh what in the myrno story you mean dragon ball chen kaichi tag team i've never played a tag team like that to be honest with you so i i wrong person to ask that one um what round are you in i'm on round 17 so that's the round that i'm at uh the last of us two game play is like the first game no it is but the narrative is [ __ ] i think the narrative is [ __ ] only because they're trying to force um different kinds of implications on you and i think that it's wrong um that's just me by the way my name is alex so that's pretty cool what up aaron uh thanks for the response that made my day i watch all your manga content thank you justin um i i i really appreciate those that watch my content hey like and here's the oh crap oh crap oh crap step it up step it up step it up okay oh yo these dudes are oh yeah i need to pack up this weapon you know what inbound oh you saw that look at that yo straight sauce straight sauce i got all the ducks on oh crap let me just take it out uh oh oh crap muskets there oh crap there's stop him shoot him shoot him shoot him in the face oh oh my god oh oh damn it so [ __ ] off come on yo help me out there we go did i lose anything oh crap i think i lost my oh that sucks ball sack i lost my quick reload damn it i hate when that happens uh play more xenoverse 2. okay so i i want to nip this in the butt real quick um so there are rumors of xenoverse 3 right uh these rumors are very vague and it's only implied because bandai had updated their universe 3 site okay right if i told myself this ironically just about a few days ago i said to myself that in 2021 i'm kind of gonna lay off the xenoverse two stuff only because only because the game is basically done for right there's not much to do uh the mods have basically stopped because every single mod has been done already um with the exception of what's gonna oh what the damn it dude yo pick me up i don't want to lose my [ __ ] um so if there is a pasta a possible chance that there's going to be a xenoverse 3 then i'm all for it but um for xenoverse 2 i'm gonna stop only because the game is done um the mods have run its course throughout four years um the maps the characters everything is done you feel me so it's like okay but xenoverse 3 if there ever is a xenoverse 3 then i am going to play that game like crack cocaine because listen you guys have seen me right i till this day i still play xenoverse 2 with mods and all that crazy stuff you guys have seen my channel blow up with mods just imagine what i'm gonna do when xenoverse 3 comes out just imagine all the mods and all the crazy all the crazy battles do you guys remember i used to stream the 3v3 fights yo oh my god with my oh oh [ __ ] you bro god damn it oh don't get me down can someone take care of the [ __ ] bosses does that [ __ ] have a wonder weapon all right you have a wonder weapon ass clown but you're not jesus man this is like the fourth time that i have to go get quick reload yeah i'm going to play xenoverse 3 like crazy i'm going to play xenoverse 3 like crazy and um i have a few friends that know how to mod so i'm going to commission some [Applause] i'm going to get myrno up in that [ __ ] i'm going to get ride on i'm going to get moral i'm going to get angel moral i'm going to get it all and but the thing is with xenoverse 3 if they do end up making it then they do they need to incorporate i think everything naturally i think that they should definitely add a horde mode can you imagine you and maybe two or three other friends in a tournament of power like setting can you imagine all of us grouped in together fighting off like either other ai or other players they should definitely do a tournament of power battle royale mode for xenoverse 3 and allow it to where it's team versus team versus team versus team versus team first team like you know what i'm saying some like some like fortnite [ __ ] some like war zone [ __ ] you know what i'm saying get all of us in the lobby and we all start fighting into oh my god can you imagine the beauty behind that you know what it's like the possibilities i think are endless and limitless all yo what is wrong with me today i keep running into these zombies come on come on come on zombie remove oh yo okay now y'all are done y'all are done oh why are they popping up behind me there's a all right i need to get my money up oh wait didn't work grab that granada was the grenade uh how strong would cauliflower cabba and kaleb if they train with bottles well i mean you've seen how strong um whis and whis had made goku and vegeta right that sounds like a wonderful chaos yeah yo think about it team versus team versus team versus team and then on top of that to have everything flow naturally like better graphics um you know better improved combat system like who doesn't want that yo can we get to one can we get to 40 likes let's go peeps like we're literally right there the higher the better so all it really takes is for you to click one button that's impenetrable but perhaps um that's because i don't think these dudes know how to you know do these directions oh we got pups all right this dude you will have to find some means all right um you get earth moral modded that's pretty hard i i i don't think so i don't think i don't i don't think modding earth is i don't think it's easy and to be honest i don't think it's possible because how how do you even how do you even play or function with a with a planet moral mod like you feel me on that doesn't seem to make any sense you play any sports games um i play ufc i play uh i used to play madden but that basically died out for me do i like oh that was nice do i like my black ops 4 um sure i mean black ops 4 was fun so dropping any videos later i

to you what's up trunks we got trunks in here son goku seth williams is in here i hope you reach 1 million before april that would be nice but the only way we can get to 1 million is you guys need to take my uh my channel link and just share it on facebook share it on instagram whatever mostly facebook like facebook go to like youtube groups and just like post them all in there you know i'm saying like that always helps i guess i don't know what happened with the vlogs what happened with the vlogs there's nothing to vlog during the pandemic like what am i possibly going to vlog during the pandemic bro like me being home like you know like that's strike team [Music] what i'm gonna continue though because i've been having a lot of fun with it i'm gonna continue the only fans review stuff that i've been doing on my vlog channel i mean because there's nothing to vlog because there's a stupid pandemic so i've spent 20 000 um chrono crystals on the ui banner no wow wow well i don't really blame you because check it out so i wasted maybe i'm just gonna lowball it i i wasted maybe 300 purchasing crystals and i got ui goku yesterday based off of luck it was the it was the most fascinating thing ever i got him on on the most unexpected pull as well i was like are you kidding me like i wasted so much money trying to get this dude and then finally last night i had i got jiren i got uh topo i got ui goku oh i gotta get the [ __ ] out of here so yeah i i got i got i got him yesterday so that's that's oh come on bro right next to oh thank god yes appreciate it yo again once again look look once again i gotta go i gotta go get another quick i didn't know that having an opinion is called bitching like maybe maybe maybe that's how small your dick is is like you perceive everything as being [ __ ] right like how sad must you be to to perceive something as being bitching when you're just voicing a concern right you must have a very small penis you must probably live in your family it's all right though i mean you're on my stream nobody here is watching you you're here watching me so that's a testament right that's a testament which ultimately means that you know my voice matters more than yours because you're here listening to what i'm saying and i'm not on your stream listening to what you're saying because you don't matter my viewers matter the people that are here matter you and your shitty you know comments don't matter nice try though nice try imagine telling another person you have an opinion stop bitching listen to me i'm telling you bro you probably you probably have a really small penis and that's okay like i sympathize for you but it must really suck living in your grandma's bathroom you know like do you sleep in the sink or in the tub i mean it's gotta be one or the other right it's gotta be one or the other brody i'm backed up right on the plane yo we're on wave 21 man yeah and then on top of that i gave him the band hammer bro so not only does he have a small winky and he lives in his grandma's bathroom but now he's also banned from the stream i can wish i wish i could teach that unreal a lesson whatever man you gotta have fun with these people sometimes i mean it's it's crazy right we're talking about chrono crystals and we're talking about ui goku and stuff and then you got this little penis bathroom dwelling you know magazine winking [ __ ] virgin coming in here like oh stop bitching i have an opinion no you should stop bitching but i have an opinion i have a concern no no stop bitching like all right bro you're a you're a i would i would smash your grandma oh do i like rap songs of course like what kind of question is that uh what about doing an omni goku and vegeta next year uh what do you mean omni goku and vegeta oh you mean like omni goku vs omni vegeta is that what you're saying [Music] you're really expressing how he has a small pp of course because that's that's what hurts a a man's ego the most that's what hurts a man's ego the most nothing will hurt a man more than than elaborating on the fact that they have a small penis your pride is gone you have no pride that's it it's over oh what it's done especially if if you know a female tells you that [ __ ] which i'm pretty sure he doesn't hear often because he probably gets no females but if he were to hack left and right they would be enough um i pulled together wait you pulled topo dyspo and jiren all at the same like in one poll is that what you're saying did you really pull all three of those like in one in one poll because that's that's like some fascinating [ __ ] all yo look notice notice how this freaking shotgun is not oh this shot he's not doing this is anything all right we have 15 000 points it's time for us to get the full cop out of here did you did you see what happened to markiplier um okay so not really i i heard that he was in the hospital but i hope he's okay like that [ __ ] is scary man like i don't i don't know like i like i just hope i mean i i heard he's okay but i never want to wish death on other people like that's just like you know i don't know what he was going through but whatever it is that he went through i hope he's okay uh markiplier has always been a you know a cool dude so i mean i of course i don't i've always i've always been a fan of markiplier uh since i think during the days of like 2015 um and he comes off genuine like i i he's introduced me to a lot of horror games that i [ __ ] had no clue about i was like wait what these exist yo we're almost at 50 likes peeps can we get the likes up i know we can i just know we can all it really takes is for you to slap at that thumbs up button and that's it uh so they had to stick to his noses wait wait uh oh they had a stick a tube uh down his nose to suck out the blockage oh wait he had blockage oh that's oh wait wait so it wasn't like a blood clog or something right or i don't know that that sucks the amount of pain i can just imagine the amount of pain he probably went through that poor guy i had a double chance on my last pull but i got another disc it um can someone tell me in chat is is this bull worth it like is dyspo legitimately worth it or i mean probably not compared to you know goku and jiren and stuff but is is dyspo better than toppo in legends or is dyspo just complete trash oh he had yeah he had nasal blockage oh that sucks damn poor guy well i mean i shouldn't you know i shouldn't be saying that he uh he's a poor guy uh danny you are now the moderator of this uh of this stream congratulations white knight i've hereby promoted you as king big dick toppo uh be blocking the scream yeah cause he's so [ __ ] big i apologize for the cursing this is just who i am um i curse like a sailor you know like for my main channel i try to keep it professional but i i guess when we're streaming it's like yo [ __ ] it [ __ ] [ __ ] piss it's like i'm sorry if there's kids watching i apologize it's just you know there you go yeah danny i'm sorry um i thought i was able to make you mod a different way but danny i haven't streamed in like i haven't streamed so oh speaking of uh can anyone tell me if the new assassin's creed valhalla game is good i i've spoken to a few people and one girl told me that you know it's about vikings so you know because it's a [ __ ] um i i just want to know because i really want to get back into assassin's creed uh black flag black flag left a sour taste in my mouth i'm sorry for those that are fans of black flag but black flag to me was trash so if valhalla is everything people are saying that it is then i'll play it you know um because i was big on brotherhood i was big on assassin's creed three assassins creed one you know okay all right you know what so danny um if i do if i do get it depending on the copyright i'll just stream it i'll stream it i'll have a good time um because the one thing that i decided to get last second because i had to look into it myself was um cyberpunk so i'm gonna get cyberpunk i'm gonna play it only because um artemis told me that it's basically like gta mixed with saints row mixed with like a whole other slew of [ __ ] so i'm like all right well if that's the case then sure i'm gonna play i'm gonna get cyberpunk i'm gonna try it out um and if valhalla is good too then from what you're saying all right i heard that the game is like pretty messed up too like you get to make all these crazy ass like decisions i will bust the fattest nut if you stream yeah like i said if if i can stream without there being any copyright for like music or or whatever i'll play it um only because i haven't touched an assassin's creed game on any of my channels since i think the first one that's a long time ago don't be smurf yeah don't be smurf black flagler i'm sorry bro i'm sorry i'm so sorry but black flag wasn't doing it for me i'm sorry it just wasn't there was something about black flag that just rubbed me the wrong way like the game was just doo-doo to me que pasa uh they lost the voice files for dyspo that's why he speaks japanese really really did they really joshua grant i'm a kid yes i'm a kid sorry bro if you hear me cursing a lot joshua i'm sorry joshua and john wait a minute if you guys are kids we could restore brain function now take my word for it don't cut me here know the difference between that subject you know the words but don't don't use accelerated it's uh oh there we go yes i need to get a quick reload god damn it quick reload i'm getting you know i'm getting sick and tired of coming

increase our damage there we go we just use the mui on these dudes so i have additional shields i have more damage um i'm 11 but i hear swearing all the time yeah i mean but it's just just don't swear um for educational purposes i'll say this there's a difference between saying [ __ ] and like out out of frustration and then saying [ __ ] you directly like don't don't don't say it i mean you shouldn't be saying it either way you're gonna hear cuss words regardless but just uh don't yeah just don't know this god knight bro we got double point guards time for me to level the hell up uh what other shows do you watch uh do you mean like tv shows i i watch the mandalorian i watch uh the walking dead i i need to catch up with both the mandalorian and the walking dead like for real um but
