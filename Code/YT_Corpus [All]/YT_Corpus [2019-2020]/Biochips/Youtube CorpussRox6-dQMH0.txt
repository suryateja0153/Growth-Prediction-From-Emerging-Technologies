 [Music] hi welcome to this model and in this module what we will look at we look at how to deposit a piece of resistive material on the inter digitated electrode and those individuals will toward as you remember from our last module were fabricated on a silicon dioxide material and that silicon dioxide acts as an insulator between a micro heater and interdigital electrode so just to help you out what we have studied we have studied how to fabricate a heater on oxidized silicon substrate how to deposit an insulating layer open the context of the heater then deposit metal which is for the individual inter digitated electrodes and then we have patterned IDs now we will see how can you deposit prison resistor material or IDs using two techniques one is the standard lithography technique and second one which I will teach you today which is called lift off okay so if you see the slide as you know our goal is to understand how can we fabricate this particular chip when you want to fabricate this chip like I said this chip is indicated with a micro heater the strip is indicated with inter digitated electrodes on inter digitated electrodes there are Pisa resistor materials and on that we have another insulator on that there is a gold pad which is over there there are su-8 pillars which are we made it conductive on the backside of chip there is a diaphragm and I'll tell you what's the role of the diaphragm when we understand the fabrication of the complete chip okay so this we have seen this we saw in the last module correct now we will continue from this process onwards to deposit a piezo resistive material in this region 1 2 3 & 4 ok so this is just a magnified view this is what I want to do today and to teach you fabrication of resistive sensors on the inter digitated alright let us see the process flow so let's see how can we fabricate the PISA resistive sensors over the inter digitated electrodes for that what we will do we will first take the oxidized silicon wafer and we have seen that our oxidized silicon wafer is integrated with micro heater right and then we have opened the contact correct this is our contact region which is open you can see right over here and this is my silicon dioxide which is grown using PECVD we all know right silicon dioxide on silicon dioxide - silicon dioxide 3 silicon and then we have over nichrome this is a heater material hey-oh or that what we are seeing yesterday or in the last lecture that we have a metal right so let me represent the matter by this design and this is our inter digitated electrodes inter digitated electrodes now over this I want to deposit a piezo resistive material so there are two ways now this inter digitated electrodes we have used chrome gold right but you can also use any other metal right in either middle all right the silicon dioxide let this one and this is grown using thermal oxidation while this silicon dioxide is deposited using PECVD so let me first explain you why we have not grown silicon dioxide using thermal oxidation like like this two thermal that like this oxidized or silicon dioxide layer that we used thermal oxidation why we have not used thermal oxidation for this the condi oxide why we have used pecvd okay let me first explain you that and then we move to the piece of resistance area you see pecvd we can vary the temperature from 100 degree centigrade to 400 degree centigrade for the chemical vapor deposition thermal oxidation the temperature temperature is 11 degree centigrade again you can vary from thousand to twelve hundred generally it is there under degree centigrade okay now you have nichrome so I'll just draw quickly a heater on oxidized silicon wafer right see please understand that term this is a silicon wafer when you grow silicon dioxide on silicon wafer it becomes oxidized silicon wafer oxidized oxidized silicon wafer alright so oxidized silicon wafer we are we are fabricating a micro heater right this is our structure on this what we said I want to deposit or I want to grow I want to grow my silicon dioxide or I deposit my silicon dioxide on the heater right so that I can further process my wafer to fabric interdigital electrodes and other materials now if I use thermal oxidation to grow this silicon dioxide the temperature that is used as Lebanon degrees centigrade while the material can be nichrome or it can be nickel for my micro heater or for my heater right so this material which is nichrome or nickel should withstand 1100 1100 degree centigrade right if it cannot withstand this high temperature then what will happen it will melt right it will melt and that's why we want to grow silicon dioxide or we want to deposit silicon dioxide at a lower temperature you got it because if I use thermal oxidation for growing this silicon dioxide then my temperature is around 11 1100 degree centigrade and that temperature the material below it that is the material below silicon dioxide which is mine I Chrome or nickel for my micro heater should withstand now if it cannot withstand then I will not get the heater it will melt and that that will create a problem so to avoid that I will deposit silicon dioxide using a technique called plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition right it stands for PE e C V D right and the advantage is that we can deposit at a lower temperature you got it that's why I say that for insulating layer or heater we will go for PECVD right so that is the reason of using pecvd instead of the thermal oxidation okay guys easy very easy right once you understand fabrication it becomes very easy to design the chip and once you design the chip then we will go for it system design system design all right now this is the material over that what we have to do so I again draw the schematic where we can see what silicon dioxide silicon heater insulator inter digitated electrodes right individual electrodes in a silicon dioxide on this I will deposit sorry on this I will deposit a piezo resistive material physio resistive material now there are visitors to materials which can be deposited using PVD PVD stands for physical vapor deposition physical vapor deposition three types thermal evaporation electron beam evaporation and sputtering all right physical vapor deposition thermal evaporation evaporation and sputtering so using EBM your patient or sputtering will deposit is a resistive material okay now there is an alternative material which is a conducting polymer now this can be zinc oxide right or any other piece of this material but if I want to use conducting polymer conducting generally polymers are on conducting but if I want to use conducting polymer I can use P dot P SS and for using period P SS I have to spin coated spin coat on in today's electrodes this is also visual resistive material okay so point is that we will deposit or we will spin coat P the resistive material right using either PVD or or using spin coating right once you do that what you do here to perform lithography and all of you know how to perform two tog rafi we will take we will spin coat positive photoresist right let me put checks for positive photoresist what after that what is the step after positive photoresist I will soft baked soft baked the wafer soft bake the wafer at 90 degree centigrade for one minute all right and after soft bake next step is to load the mask and we only want we only want the material which is a piezoresistive material to be on the inter digitated electrodes and not on the contact region right this is correct mask no I'll also show it to you two different ways if I use right field mask bright field mask like this one right this is my right field mask bright fill mask and if I expose the wafer with UV what would happen the unexposed region will be stronger the unexposed region will be stronger but if I don't have bright field mask and I have a dark field mask if I don't have a bright field mark mask and I have a dark film mask right in that case my dark film ask will look like this right so in this case if I use positive photoresist then the region which is unexposed will be stronger which we don't want we want our visual resistive material to be on this area right only on this area we don't want on the contact so if I use dark fill mask with positive photoresist my problem will not solve so what I will do if I have sorry let me just select the red color okay if I have dark film asked then I will change my positive photoresist instead of positive or resist I will spin coat negative photoresist you got it because if in negative photoresist the unexposed region will be weaker and the exposed region which is this region will be stronger so finally what we'll have we will we can save the PISA resistor material over this particular region which is our region of interest and there will be nothing over the contact you got it so very simple if I have dark film mask I'll go for negative photoresist in this case but if I have a bright film ask if I have a bright fill mask then I'll go for a positive photoresist so you have to select the recipe according to the design of your mask and the ability of a photoresist right so here I'll use positive or digest this is my bright film mask easy after exposing what will happen we have to we have to develop the photoresist PR development right if I dip the wafer in photoresist which is photoresist developer then what will I have I will have my oxidized silicon wafer on that there is a micro heater on that there is an insulating material which is my silicon dioxide on that I have inter digitated electrodes right on there there is a piezoresistive material visitors to material this is silicon dioxide using pecvd silicon dioxide using thermal oxidation silicon dioxide using thermal oxidation silicon wafer nichrome chrome cold right and business material over that I will have my photoresist only in this region only in this region okay why because I have used a bright field mask with positive photoresist and the unexposed region will be stronger and that's why I can see that the unexposed region is stronger hmm the next step is we'll go for a hard baked hard pig Harbach is done it 120 degree centigrade one minute on hot plate after this the next step would be next step would be to h pz resistive material so we have to dip this wafer in a piezo resistive material a chant write wet etching if I do that what will happen the material which is protected by the preservation material which is protected by the photoresist will not get edged by the visualized material which is not protected by photoresist will get edge so I will have P raised to material in this area all right you got it because there is no photoresist that can protect the preservation material in this region and this region hmm so once I deposit the wafer or once I dip the wafer in a physiologist - agent I'll add my visual resistive material which is not protected by photo resistor next step for this would be that I will dip this wafer in acetone if I dip the wafer in acetone what will happen we will strip off we will strip the photoresist if the dip if I dip the wafer in acetone will strip the photoresist if I strip the photoresist then what will I have I'll have a piece of resistive material or inter digitated electrodes right I will have a piece your edges to you like a PCO resistive material over inter digitated electrodes over sio2 over nichrome heater and then this will look like you got it easy so what is our next step our next step is to have a gold pad right which is in the center of this one gold pair and on that goal pad we require su-8 pillars on that gold pad we require su-8 pillars so can I deposit gold directly on pizzle resistive material this is pure resistive material right this for black squares in center or gray gray squares in the center are piezo resistive materials but can I deposit a gold which is a metal on PC resistant material it will get short right so what we have to do after this we had to grow a silicon dioxide layer right open the context in all the area except in this area right and then we will deposit metal will pattern it to form the gold pad so still now let us see in this particular model what we are done you learn how to deposit PC resistive material on inter digitated electrode but like I said I want to teach you in this module itself how what will happen if I if I want to use liftoff so what exactly liftoff means and why we had to use liftoff right so let us understand if you go back to the slide what you see here is that we have done a standard lithography technique where we have piezo resistive material so if I just continue from this section it will be easier for you to understand why we will go for liftoff okay so the point is that you know that we had a piece of resistive material all over the interdigitate electrodes and then we are protecting the visualization material in this area right this one see we all know this is positive photoresist this is pretty resistive material all right this is of course chrome gold and the main section you know so now if I dip this wafer in PC resistive material agent in Pisa resistive acient what will happen it will etch the phaser resistive material right it will HCP services to material suppose suppose the etchant of the piezoresistive material also affects the chrome and gold then what will happen once the piece of edge to material is etched from the area which is not protected by photoresist which is not protected by photoresist it will start etching chrome gold it will start etching chrome gold why because the piezoresistive material that we have used the etchant the chemicals that are used to hp's resistant material will start affecting chrome gold because the material or the chemicals are such that it can also edge chrome gold in this case what will what will happen the chrome gold here and here right will be H if there is a case we will lose the contact to the interdigital towards correct we lose the contact to the inter digitated electrodes and what's the purpose of fabricating individual letters no purpose it was gone there's no point of continuing with the fabrication right so if this case arises when you are fabricating a device what you have to do you have to think of an alternative technique to pattern pieces is to material this is called lift off so let me show you interesting if you see the slide I will show you how to do lift off okay very interesting technique very easy focus on the schematic that I am drawing right I always write down even you know that what are the patterns here what I am showing in the design is always a good practice to write down as many times as you can so that you remember okay this is using thermal oxidation over there what we have we have a heater order what we have we have a silicon dioxide grown using PECVD or that what we have we have inter digitated electrodes correct now over this we want to we want to pattern D we want to pattern the PISA resistive material hmm so for patterning the PISA resistive material what we will do we will use a technique called lift off what is this Technic lift off so we will first instead of depositing piezoresistive material we will spin coat we will spin coat positive photoresist all right in spin coat positive photoresist then we'll use a dark film mask and our film asked of course after after positive photoresist spin coating what is the next step next step is of course the soft bake right so spin coating soft bake at 90 degree 1-minute hot plate will lower the dark field mask and I have positive photoresist so if I expose dark field mask with UV what will happen the unexposed region will be stronger an exposed region would be weaker so what will I have I'll have an oxidized silicon wafer oxide silicon wafer with heater insulating material interdigital electrodes right and photoresist so let me draw photoresist like X so photoresist in this region right so if I use positive photoresist if I expose the wafer with UV and if I develop the wafer and if I develop the wafer what will I have I'll have photoresist in this region there is nothing you can see there is no photoresist right there is no photoresist but here there is photoresist and we know what is this one individual electrodes right inter digitated electrodes made from gold or you can say chrome gold nichrome silicon dioxide silicon silicon dioxide silicon dioxide right now I will go for Harbach hard-baked 121 minute hot plate hmm after Harvick after Hardwick next step is I will deposit I will deposit a piece of resistive material this material will be deposited like this right so let me just draw the bigger resistive material with a different color so you understand this is a piezoresistive material right what I have done on the positive photoresist which after the Harvick I have deposited a piece of resistive material right over the photoresist the next step is after this I will dip the wafer in acetone I did the wafer in acetone if you dip the efferent acid on what will happen the positive photoresist the positive photoresist will be stripped off its tips off right so if the positive photoresist steps off it will lift off the material over it it will lift off the material over it so what does that mean if I dip this wafer with a pitcher is to material deposited on positive photoresist and if I dip this fr in acetone then what will I have is or will I have is this structure you got it why because the positive photoresist will lift off the material when you strip off when you strip it in acetone you got it so why and now you have to do a liftoff because then this way you are not using an etchant for the PISA resistive material and that way if my acient is or the PISA resistive agender the material HN is affecting chrome gold which is right below it now in this case it will not be a problem because we are deep we are dipping the wafer in acetone which will strip of the photoresist and the fall the piezoelectric material will stick to the inter digitated electrodes right so this is the last slide for this particular module and what we have seen we have seen how can we deposit PC resistive material right on inter digitated electrodes which are on silicon dioxide which are on micro heater right so if you go from the bottom oxidized silicon substrate micro heater silicon dioxide in traditional Eckerd's piece of extra material preservation material either using the standard lithography or using lift-off technically right in the next slide the next module in fact what we will see we will see how can we deposit a gold pad on appeaser resistant material and like I said that if you want to deposit a gold on pieces of material you again had to form an insulating layer right till then just go through this particular module and I'll see you in next module take care bye
