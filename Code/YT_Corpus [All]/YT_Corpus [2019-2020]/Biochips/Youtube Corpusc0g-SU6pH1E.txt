 [Music] Mic Check 1 2 Mic Check 1 2 Mic Check 1 2 Thanks well good afternoon and thank you again for joining us today I'm joined by dr. Alexia Harris and Secretary of State Edie Buchanan I'm going to review new public health orders that will take effect day after tomorrow on Friday I also want to give the secretary an opportunity to speak about the 2020 election season and the opening this week of candidate filing it's an exciting thing to have an election year with all the other news going on and I'm looking forward to his comments today we have had 523 lab confirmed positive cases of kovat 19 in the state with an additional 165 probable cases there were 10 new lab confirmed cases reported today the number of current hospitalizations as reported by our hospitals remain stable at 10 today li-ming's positive case rate that's the percentage of tests that come back positive for kovat 19 has decreased slightly to three point nine percent this remains significantly below the national average which ranged from nine percent to 13 percent according to the most recent data from CDC our statewide kovat 19 dashboard is unchanged today showing that we are stabilizing in five of six metrics the category of new cases is the only one that continues to be rated as concerning you can see it there today I'm pleased to announce that given our health metrics we were able to further ease the restrictions that were put into place last month all three of our public health orders have been updated with the new expiration date of May 31st we will continue to focus on safety with these new orders these new orders contain detailed social distancing requirement that still allow businesses to operate as normally as possible and it is important to remember that even as we eased restrictions the virus is not gone it is still here it is still invisible and it is still capable of wreaking havoc and it's going to be with us for some time here in Wyoming just like the rest of the country I've said over and over again it's time we get our head in the game that means this isn't to be taken lightly but we are trying to work our way safely back to as normal condition as we can get order number one which covers operations of bars restaurants theaters gyms and childcare facilities has been modified significantly I am happy to announce that restaurants statewide may resume indoor and outdoor table service the operational guidelines are similar to those contained in county level variances we issued last week and I want to thank restaurants and bars for their patience as we've worked through this you know with the benefit of hindsight it's easy to say that we might have done too much I will say that we've done what we should do and we will be very careful as we go forward tables will be limited to six persons or fewer with six feet of separation between tables self-service and buffet output options will not be permitted staff will be required to wear face coverings social distancing will be required in waiting areas and service ways as well as increased sanitation measures restaurants will be required to stock appropriate protective equipment and employees will need to be screened for symptoms of kovat 19 movie theaters concert halls and music halls may open in a limited capacity providing a limit customer groups to six or fewer and maintain a six-foot distance between individual groups Jem's will now be allowed to offer personal training and group fitness classes for up to 20 participants again the six-foot rule must be observed for customers we have also adjusted the operational guidelines for childcare centers and home daycares the maximum group size is now 25 children and providers in each separate room there will be an increased emphasis on hand-washing and sanitation and we will continue to limit parents inside the facility order number 2 has been revised so that the maximum size of gatherings is now 25 people there is an exemption for retail or business establishments where more than 25 people may be present and can maintain a 6 foot distance of spacing theaters and performance spaces are exempt from this gathering limitation churches and Funeral Homes may allow gatherings of more than 25 people by implementing social distancing measures and specific sandwiches sanitization procedures these include maintaining six-foot distance between individual household groups and I want to thank our spiritual leaders or pastors and her ministers and others for taking the care of their their congregations so seriously and I hope that they will continue to encourage religious services to have the ability to watch on on TV from services from home whenever possible again this is an invisible virus that can affect in ways that nobody anticipate and so who wants to put a cared for loved one at risk but I will say that that kind of opportunity to be able to watch services at home will be particularly beneficial for our vulnerable populations who may not yet feel comfortable attending in-person services finally order number three has been revised to remove the provision allowing a maximum of nine people in a room or confined space these businesses nail salons hair salons barber shops tattoo shops and the like must maintain that six foot distance between stations however the state will continue to allow in excuse me the businesses and nail salons who must maintain that six foot distance between stations the state will continue to allow our employees to telework to an extent possible but we have begun our conversations about how to bring workers back in a again safe manner we want to continue to encourage private employers to accommodate teleworking whenever feasible it's been encouraging to hear that productivity is actually increased in some cases with teller working from home I also want to think about mitigation strategies to limit the spread of this virus in work settings and many of our businesses have already taken those issues up and done quite well with that as part of our efforts to further mitigate the spread and impacts of kovat 19 in the state I have allocated 15 million in cares Act funding to the Department of Health to increase our diagnostic testing and contact tracing capabilities these will be essential as we move forward this funding will allow us to test more Wyoming residents more quickly allowing us to identify those who might be ill with kovat 19 we will do this through increased staffing at our Public Health Laboratory obtaining more testing supplies for healthcare providers and our lab and hiring additional staff to supplement our epidemiological team that does the contact tracing the effect of this funding will be to allow us to more quickly identify where the disease is located prevent large clusters of case and avoid future shutdown and economic impacts I've also allocated two million to the Wyoming office of homeland security who will be working with the Wyoming Business Council to purchase personal protective equipment to distribute it to non healthcare related entities and with that I would like to bring dr. Harris to the podium for her comments thank you Thank You governor Gordon first before I discuss our revised public health orders I'd like to let people know that we received a limited supply of REM dessa beer yesterday from the Department of Health and Human Services from Desa beer is an intravenous drug that may help some patients with COBIT 19 at this time Renda severe is only authorized for use in patients who are seriously ill and in the hospital we have communicated with Wyoming's hospitals and providers about the supply and how to request it we've received notice that more shipments of REM Desa beer are planned for Wyoming but we do not yet know the details of when or how much we will receive we've taken some big steps forward in the last few weeks and with the new with the new orders that go into effect Friday and I'm very pleased that that's been possible but we must continue with our thoughtful and measured approach we need some time to see how the changes we've made in our orders affect our situation I believe our actions have helped Wyoming by preventing the disease from overwhelming us you just have to look at the news to see how this has happened in many other places around the country I know that this has been difficult and I hear from people every day about their frustrations more businesses and programs will be able to operate with these new orders of course because this disease is unfortunately still part of our reality the way we do things can't yet be the same as they were before this pandemic began social distancing remains critical for now and will for a while to come keeping our distance from each other helps us and limit the spread of this disease so businesses can remain open the restrictions spelled out within the new orders are meant to encourage safer operation screening of employees for potential illness is an example we advise employers at various types of businesses to do this by asking them about symptoms and contact with ill people with kovat 19 cloth face coverings can also help slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and don't know it from transmitting it to others the use of these coverings in certain business and community situations is clearly described within the revised orders for all of us it's good to know if you wear a face covering and you have the virus but no symptoms that face covering can help prevent you from giving the virus to somebody else face coverings aren't complicated and they aren't medical masks they can be any cloth item that covers your nose and mouth while still allowing you to breathe we recommend face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain using face coverings as recommended can help allow us to keep moving forward the order affecting gathering size has been changed to allow groups of 25 people rather than less than 10 there are also some specific guidelines that will allow higher numbers of people to participate in faith gatherings and funerals the size change for gatherings is significant but does not allow for large events there's a reason we have to be thoughtful and measured about gatherings and it's simple more people means a higher chance that someone is there who is infected and may not know it and more people around an infected person means a higher chance of more transmission among the people at the event and then through the community as has been the case all along county health officers have a role in applying Wyoming's Public Health orders and requesting exceptions exceptions may cover individual businesses and specific activities and county officials are aware of the process to follow I will continue to give every exception request a fair review but these orders make significant changes already to the restrictions that we've had in place so I don't want to create an expectation among people that everything they may request will be approved there should also not be an expectation that countywide variances that are significantly different from these new orders will be reasonable at this point again we have taken some big steps and need to see how things go before we take more remember pretty much anyone can get sick with kovat 19 anyone has a chance of serious illness and anyone who is infected can pass Kovac 19 on to others unfortunately we know that certain people have a higher risk of serious illness older people and people of any age with health conditions that mean they have a higher chance of getting seriously ill should still avoid close contact situations both those health conditions include chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma serious heart conditions compromised immune systems severe obesity diabetes chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis and liver disease people who live or work with persons who are more at risk for becoming seriously ill should also seriously consider whether they participate in any activity or event that involves close contact with others as we take steps ahead all of us must look at our own situations to see if we should take extra precautions and at times we must remember those who are more vulnerable and help protect them viruses don't play fair they are tricky and sneaky there are some things we can predict about them and some things we never know for sure that can be true of any virus but this virus is new we have no widespread readily available known effective treatment we have no vaccine we have no baseline immunity in the population we've seen healthcare systems overwhelmed and a disturbing number of deaths in other places in our country I've said it before that in public health when your actions help people question the need for those actions please know that we don't make these tough decisions without knowing that they have real consequences but our responsibilities involve trying to do the right thing for Wyoming and that's that our guiding principle Thank You governor Thank You dr. Harrison and I think your points are very well taken it is absolutely essential that every Wyoming citizen at this point recognize that it is their responsibility not only to execute their rights as they see them but also to take responsibility for those around them and that means that since we are loosening some of these things that responsibility becomes ever clearer every every day I would like to now introduce the secretary Buchanan who will discuss the election season and the opening of candidate filing Thank You governor Gordon citizens of Wyoming as most of you can imagine the elections environment is not immune to the complications and challenges that are posed by Cova 19 large gatherings of people create a challenge to the task of keeping our citizens safe when it comes to voting and I recognize that as we take steps to ensure that our citizens are safe we have to balance that with taking steps to ensure that our elections remain safe and secure my promise to the voters of Wyoming has always been informed by the election code which requires me to construe our laws to ensure that all legally qualified electors may register and vote those who are not qualified shall not vote and that fraud and corruption in elections shall be prevented so election security from both a health perspective and the security perspective are not mutually exclusive goals and to be sure a balance can be struck allowing us to achieve both so I'd like to take this opportunity today to update you on three main areas which my office has concentrated upon to ensure that we have safe elections both from a health perspective and from a security perspective this afternoon I will be speaking to you about absentee voting I will be speaking to you about some directives I have issued to county governments regarding elections and I will speak to you with regard to some health protection measures that we are undertaking first with regard to absentee voting in an effort to ensure the voting public is aware of its options when it comes to the primary and general elections of 2020 my office is sending out an educational pamphlet this pamphlet details the options that Wyoming voters have which include voting in person as well as voting by requesting an absentee ballot I want to make everyone aware that absentee voting is not new it has been allowed in Wyoming for decades this educational pamphlet this mailer is not part of sending everyone a ballot we are simply sending a reminder to everyone that if they so choose they may request an absentee ballot and we wanted to highlight its availability especially for those in the population that may find themselves susceptible to complications from Cova 19 or may not feel safe from a health perspective in going to the polls in person in 2020 and I want to stress that of course absentee balloting requires that somebody make the request to the County Clerk they send in the request or they could call for the request it involves the County Clerk sending them a ballot and it requires them to send the ballot back in so yes it necessarily involves mailing that ballot but it should not be confused with vote by mail or a mail-in election system that is found in many other or a handful of other states I should say in fact the overwhelming majority of Wyoming citizens prefer to vote in person and our Constitution only provides for two ways to vote and that's in person and that's by absentee voting furthermore the legislature last year appropriated significant resources for me to deploy new voting equipment and I'm proud to say that working closely with our election clerks and our county clerks all around the state of Wyoming all 23 counties have received their new voting equipment and so needless to say say after spending nearly 5 million dollars on election equipment we are invested for the long term in secure safe and efficient polling place voting the second area that I mentioned our directives directives are issued by me allowed under current Wyoming law and allowed under our current health situation to allow local governments some flexibility in how they conduct their elections the first directive was issued to municipalities around Wyoming who found themselves in the position of holding an election in May the flexibility of the direction allowed these particular municipalities to delay their elections to sometime later in the month of May or later sometime during the summer that gives them the flexibility to accommodate social distancing requirements and follow all the health protocols that have been recommended to all of us the second directive is more directed to county governments and county clerk's and that is with regard to absentee polling places and this directive really just gives the county clerks the flexibility they might need to vary the time under which people can show up for early voting or the absentee voting period this is something that's always been allowed in Wyoming we've had early voting for decades we've had t voting for decades but traditionally that period runs for 45 days but perhaps in a certain County they're not equipped logistically to run the early voting for 45 days because they have trouble with facilities and maintaining social distancing distancing and the other health protocols that have been recommended so we're giving them some flexibility when it comes to that early voting period as to how long they will be open prior to Election Day the third directive also concerns polling places and this also gives County Clerk's some flexibility in how they conduct their elections and specifically what this means is is they can go out and look for different facilities and kind of vary the number of polling places they had have once again to try and maintain social distancing and other safety protocols which have been recommended by state and federal authorities so this might for example entail going out and trying to find a larger facility to accommodate a more populous area wherein you can maintain your social distancing and provide safety for everybody in large gatherings and so they have great flexibility in how they will identify polling places for the primary and general elections of this year the final area is health protection measures my office is taking every effort in utilizing both federal funds and leveraging some of our partnerships at the state level and the federal level to ensure that we have signage that we have personal protective equipment hand sanitizer and those types of things for our election workers and for our voters our goal here is to have elections as normal as possible while maintaining the safety of our poll workers our county clerks their staff and of course our Wyoming citizens I would like to mention that the initial filing period for folks who would like to run for office in Wyoming opens May 14th and runs through May 29th this year and I know that apps in the challenging times we face with regard to kovat nineteen folks may be reluctant to be involved in public service or run for public office but I wouldn't encourage you to look into it you can sign up online on our Secretary of State's website and you can pay the fee online and so I encourage everybody to be involved and I want to close by just telling Wyoming citizens we have a great plan in place to allow you to continue to vote in the 2020 election in person or by absentee ballot it's the same as it's always been and we're taking extra precautions to make sure you can do so safely thank you very much Thank You secretary Buchanan I also want to thank you secretary for your leadership with the Cova interagency group for those of you who don't know the secretary has led a group which has really coordinated activities across the entire spectrum of government services from business support to yes emergency reaction to health services and other things and has really done a tremendous job in in making sure that our state was able to do some of the things that will become very important as we go forward dr. Harris spoke about the additional loosening x' that comes with additional risk and that risk is something that every Wyoming citizen is going to have to pay attention to and I think mr. secretary your work and others to make sure that we had Wyoming businesses that were producing not only some PPE but also hand sanitizers and other things oh really will come into into play as we go forward as was reported earlier today Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks will reopen to the public with a limited capacity on the 18th the only access to Yellowstone initially will be through the south and east entrances in Wyoming these parks have put mitigation plans in place and I support this slow approach which is being conducted in a safe and prudent manner the goal is not to have these destinations overwhelmed that has been a concern from the beginning and it is to make sure that we do not Bo and we are not overwhelmed with visitors and initially we do at the same time want to reawaken the tourism economy in park and Teton and the adjacent counties and so we're working very carefully with all those entities the parks and the counties to make sure that we have adequate resources this does mean there will be additional traffic in Wyoming this does mean that there will be more people coming that's what we want to see in terms of an economy awakening but we at the same time want to make sure that we are emphasizing safety and with all the things that we've talked about right from the start social distancing keeping our hands clean etc this is truly an exciting time for Wyoming but it's also one that is a cautionary time for Wyoming this is not a hold my beer moment this is a let's do this carefully and make sure we don't lose the ground we gained finally on Friday we open the first special session of the Wyoming legislature since 2004 the legislature is slated to consider four pieces of legislation including the appropriation of federal funds made available to Wyoming through the cares Act as I said in a couple of the prior press conferences I've looked forward to their assistance and directing where those funds go as I mentioned just a moment ago there is some additional risk but we have some resources to apply to that and I'm really looking forward to legislature being here and acting responsibly so that we can meet these challenges in a way that no other state in the country has been able to I want to be able to provide assistance to the businesses and to the counties and citizens who have been negatively impacted by kovat 19 and do do that in the most effective way possible it is my goal that this be a straightforward session one that allows us to help our state's healthcare industry establish a program to help ranchers and landlords avoid evictions and loss of income and to expand our workers compensation program to those who might contact Kove it'd 19 and in closing I want to remind each of you that it is through your actions the actions and behavior of Wyoming citizens that our economy can continue to function effectively in this new normal rights do imply responsibilities and Wyoming citizens know that in their core it is essential that we respect our fellow citizens particularly those who are vulnerable those who have a maybe are a little older than the national average which unfortunately Wyoming is a little older than the national average in our average age we are in an enviable position compared with many other states in this country and I want to say dr. Harris's comments about doing the right thing are absolutely on target we have done the right thing but there remains the possibility that our situation can change and we will track that as we have said consistently that we will do we retain the right and the ability to be able to roll back any of the advances that we have taken here so again it is only you who can prevent the kind of rollback that what we might require be vigilant be safe practice good hygiene maintain social distancing and above all think about all of Wyoming citizens in your behaviors so with with that I will open for some questions and I think I have I think the lines are open for calls thank you hi Andrew thank you you announced the distribution of 17 million of the cares Act today and just if for some reason the legislature failed to pass bills to distribute care exact money this weekend are you and the executive branch able to distribute the rest of that 1.25 billion yourself Andrew that's a very good question I have asked our Attorney General to opine on that her view with regard to whether these are subject to constitutional requirements under 16 6 etc and and then also applying an earlier memo of at that time Attorney General Pat crank we believe these are federal funds and can be distributed by the executive branch to existing programs with the flexibility that I have I don't really relish the thought of having to do that I that's why I wanted the legislature to be here to work together to address these problems I think the entire legislature has every absolute right and and properly so needs to be able to advise on those matters Thanks and follow-up is there anything you you hope lawmakers will stay away from it they do this I'm thinking of just like too many restrictions on the on the funding or things of that nature anything here you know you're I guess concerned about Andrew very good question thank you I you know as I said before one of my hopes has been it would be simple it would be efficient it would be able to respond I've said a couple of weeks ago when we were beginning to talk about this these are extraordinary times they call for an extraordinary relationship between the legislature and the executive branch I'm fully engaged with them in all in all respects and so I am hoping that we retain the flexibility to be to address issues as they arise and and we don't know really the full extent of these were as I said opening up the parks the parks won't be available for overnight stay in the parks so that means the adjacent communities are going to have additional needs as we see those needs emerge and evolve and we learn more about them we want to be able to respond quickly to those so that visitors coming to Wyoming remember it as a safe place to visit a place that was fun to go to and a place where they were able to enjoy their vacations thank you too much thank you hi mark thank you you bet thank you when the session begins on Friday how many of the legislators are going to be there virtually versus so sir mark let me just ask a question back-end kid could you hear Andrews question do I need to repeat this question of yours no okay I'm sorry so all right thanks I will I will repeat that the question that Mark asked was when they the legislature comes into session this Friday how many do we expect to be down here mark I really can't say I think they're probably going to be I know I know the speaker and the president both intend to be here there are probably some of the legislators from Cheyenne and others that may be here it may be as few as 10 it may be more than that but but I think with the protocol that's been put in place electronically and so on the advantage of being able to do that from home with social distancing is going to be essential and I have spoken with the legislative service office and leadership about making sure that whatever happens in the chambers here and observes the social distance requirements I apologize no no worries no you weren't you weren't duplicating I think Andrews question was that it was a different one so thank you next question yes sorry please go ahead Claire McFarland the Ranger in Riverton and we recently did a story our county attorney here in fremont county has expressed some reluctance to enforce a few elements of the public health orders currently in place and i was wondering since traffic ution then deferred to the Attorney General under what circumstances would the Attorney General exercised her statutory power to enforce those public health orders so Claire that was a question from Claire McFarland it was referencing I believe what might have been something of a misquote earlier about the the county attorney not wanting to prosecute on some of the health orders and so the question then came back to what degree would the Attorney General wanted want to enforce those orders I think you would probably need to you would probably need to speak to the Attorney General about that I don't want to speak for her but we believe the statewide health orders to be lawful and should be enforced and we want every county attorney to use their prosecutorial discretion as they would in every case that comes their way just a personal note on this I think it is incredibly selfish of individuals to place others at risk I think our efforts here have been continually to try to err on being thoughtful we haven't closed restrictions we've been much looser than any other state we've been very thoughtful in how we've applied these orders they've been intended to protect the health and safety of others and and so I think putting county attorneys in an awkward position when when really you you know we started with these are constitutional rights constitutional rights require responsibility and people should act responsibly that's where this discussion should revolve around not about enforcement or other things like that people should just do the right thing it's disappointing to me personally when when people when you give them those those choices to be able to make that they think that take that on themselves so selfishly and and don't regard the health and safety of others in the community Thanks hi this is Maggie Malone with Lyman Public Radio this question is actually for secretary Buchanan secretary you mentioned that Wyoming I prefer to vote in person and I was hoping you could expand on that a little bit especially in light of you know what we just saw with the Democratic presidential caucus where turnout doubled from previous years the question was I've made this statement that Wyoming I prefer to vote in in person and and I guess could I contrast that with I guess the Democratic caucus success using mail ballots first off I would say that perhaps any increase in the use of mail ballots and the Democrats caucus is is probably largely due to kovat number one and two historically in Wyoming and keep in mind absentee voting has been available for decades so this is nothing new that we're talking about the usage rate of that is around 20% so I would deduce that 80% of Wyoming Heights prefer to vote in person that's that's over the last those numbers are the average probably from 2016 2018 this is Mike Rowe at the Jackson Hole missing guy there was a Park Service call today and they explained camp shali at Yellowstone said that about 75% of the usual vehicle traffic going into Yellowstone is usually going through those montana gates that will remain closed until further notice and so I potentially a lot of people that would be otherwise go into Montana routing through Cody and Jackson Hole instead I was wondering if there's a governor's office has any concerns about kind of like a floodgate of fact you know Memorial Day weekend there's only about 10 days away that's usually when we start to get busy and we might have more people coming down this way because Montana entering this is key oh no they are not accessible so the question was since about 75 percent of the traffic coming into Yellowstone Park comes through Montana he would a my concerned for the communities that there be a floodgate effect was Memorial Day and and what that might that might bring and I would say absolutely but part of the reason why we were looking at opening the way we did is when is the right way to start would you open all five entrances at once or do we offer the opportunity for people to come enjoy Park County enjoy Teton he enjoyed Wyoming on the way there and Montana still has a travel restriction in place you still have to quarantine if you're if you're going into Montana and and so you know it was our belief in walking through this that this was a a good prudent first step emphasizing safety and traffic control I've just been on the phone with both chambers there's a little bit of trepidation I will say all the way through these communities some that are very excited business is opening again others are very concerned what does this mean hence my reason for saying you know we've got to be responsible and thoughtful about our fellow citizen but I do believe that this will allow for an initial restricted and thoughtful flow in talking with a wideout director director Reiner about ways to do signage and ways to articulate traffic flows through the communities we and then in addition to that using my executive discretion to be able to provide additional resources to the counties and and and and the ability to be able to meet both the testing PPE and contact tracing needs but through the Department of Health we believe we are as ready as we can be and and we're already seeing traffic coming into you you've probably seen it coming into Teton County seeing it coming into Park County we're seeing it generally around the state and and so this appears to be the right way to to open the park in a thoughtful way and that I think as part of the reason why we said we could roll it back if necessary was because if it does seem to be getting out of hand we will roll it back but we are trying to provide resources to the businesses to the counties and hopefully a slow trickle gives us the experience to know how to open the park in a greater fashion and if you've listened to what superintendent shali speaks about it's a very phased opening there aren't tour buses there aren't large groups going through there it's going to be much more carefully regulated access to places like Old Faithful will have spacing requirements and so on thank you next question hey governor this is will Thomas with Wyoming is now how you doing doing well will thanks for calling absolutely and with the relaxation of the gathering of groups how important was it for you to define the guidelines for churches and houses of worship will thank you very much our orders always really straight away from speaking specifically about churches and houses of worship we did generally try to offer the the recommendations around spacings in size just as good common sense Health Regulations I don't know dr. Harris anything you want to add to that okay I think that that would be the answer but I'm thrilled that we're gonna have the opportunity for church services to kind of go back in this is a conversation we've had periodically with members of the faith community ever since our initial in Asia all orders went in went into effect and I would say that I have been remarkable the cooperation and the leadership that that our faith communities have demonstrated through this entire process and and and so I want to thank them for for having the best interests of their congregations and the people of Wyoming at heart all the way through this Thank You governor thank you next question two more questions Hey the star tribune two related questions one can you talk a little bit about why the money allocated at a homeowner office of homeland security was for TV for businesses and not providers does that sort of indicate that you know the ppb such a PPE excuse me situation for providers is cleared up and relatedly are you concerned or is there any planning underway for setting aside supplies going into the fall when there may be a resurgence of device Thank You Seth thank you very much good questions the first part of that was if we're indicating that it's going for businesses does that mean that everything's cleared up on the healthcare side and South I would say this is an evolving situation we we feel reasonably good about where we are we do want to make sure that businesses as they open have the supplies and support that they need I'm happy to say that the Chamber's which have not been able to avail themselves of any of the PPP program funds or anything else are taking it amongst themselves and it's interesting to note the Chamber's don't have lots of extra reserves but the Chamber's are out there trying to secure their own supplies we're trying to assist with that so that so that yr me is open and an open safely absolutely essential that that were safe and in doing that the second the the second point you made was are we going to be setting aside supplies for the fall and I might give the secretary a chance because he's been really kind of heading up some of these and I'm putting him on the spot here so let me let me let him answer that question so the I believe the question was and you can restate it if I get this wrong was what's the current PPE situation and and how are we looking for what are we looking at for the fall as far as availability in case things are still going or was that is that accurate yeah yeah correct just just an you know there's there's some concern that the virus Waddell bounced back in the fall and you know whether there's any planning underway to make sure providers are stocked up should that happen sure sure and that's a that's a great question you know we get a briefing nearly every week from the winding Office of Homeland Security who has coordinated the receipt and the distribution of the PPE throughout this pandemic and I I would say that we have a good supply of PPE the the receipts of the PPE have been coming in more frequently we have been receiving more donations both from private companies the federal government we've been receiving some distributions from companies like Amazon for example so we've really done well as far as our PPE inventory and so I would say that it's it's looking good and stable at this point and that we we should have enough and of course that that assumes that things remain stable and status quo but we should have enough to address any recurrence of Cova 19 in in the future or later this year if it were to occur great thanks hey governor Jim O'Reilly from Big Foot 99 radio hi Jim thank you maybe take another swing you brushed on the subject earlier in the news conference I thought I'd let you take another swing at it and that is the the issue of doing too much going overboard with the public health orders versus doing just enough and looking at the latest information from the Wyoming Department of Health about over 60% of the known cases were the result of contact with a confirmed case or domestic travel or international travel community spread is is below 20 percent 15 16 percent of the last confirmed cases so I wondered if you address the concerns that a lot of citizens have had that the orders have gone too far and that continuing the orders through the Memorial Day weekend puts an additional burden on liberties and and businesses who are really struggling at this time so Jim thanks very much I think the point or the question that you asked was you know how much have we compromised civil liberties in in these orders and you know by carrying them forward with the to Memorial Day with with what we have is is you know is that actually warranted under the conditions and I'll let dr. Harris speak to some of that here in just a sec but but let me just put a couple of things in perspective here Wyoming never issued a shelter at home order we never closed our retail spaces we made sure that our orders were the least respected restrictive we could and still take care of things and in looking back and and for those who have an act background as I do I've been to brandings where before we didn't have enough people and things got crazy or shipping's where things got crazy cattle couldn't get brought in and and and then I've been to subsequent ones where we've had plenty of people and everything has gone fine in this particular case the orders that we put in place seem to have worked and I'm happy to to be criticized that we don't have excess deaths I'm happy to be criticized that we did things just about right I'm very sad that the country generally speaking has undergone the challenges it has economically because those have affected our AG industry they've affected our energy industry and they've affected our tourism industry we're hoping that we can start to reawaken the tourism industry and and be able to help bring this back in a way and I said I've wrote an editorial with with a number of other governors who took very similar approaches to ours which was no sheltered home order which was emphasizing personal responsibility over orders and and we spoke about why that process works and I'm happy to say that I'm very hopeful that is we encourage more visitation to Wyoming we start to see the tourism come back that people take this seriously for the threat that it truly poses and and and understand that people don't didn't stop dying from the other causes that they died from they you know the big problem here is the excess deaths that kovat brings and and you've seen that in places like New York Wyoming isn't New York but we've got to be mindful of what this can bring and when you have a population it's generally a little bit older I don't want to see any of our citizens put at risk and I think the people of Wyoming have responded well we're doing everything in our power to support businesses so that they don't have the additional challenges that come with a increased sanitation and other needs that come we don't want to see you know contact tracing suggest that restaurant a or Barbie was the the source of covent that is now decimated a senior care center these are the things that we need to bear in mind and when I look at our performance yeah maybe we could have done a little less and done just as well but that's total speculation what we did do is what we did and we only have a very few deaths and we're performing much better than than any of our peers so that would just be my my comment but dr. Harris if you'd if I haven't completely confused the question Thank You governor and of course I agree with everything that you said and it's as I said it you know the ending part of my prepared remarks was that in public health when you prevent something obviously we can never know what it would have looked like if we hadn't tried to prevent it or put measures in place to prevent it so I would say that the reason that the numbers look the way they do that you cited and the the reason we've been successful and not seen more adverse outcomes from this virus is because of the measures that we put in place and because of the actions that Wyoming residents have taken to follow those measures so I believe the answer is then not to just take these measures away but as we can and you know as we continue to perform as much testing as possible continuing to do complete contact tracing which we've been able to do up to this point that we can take steps forward to ease restrictions knowing that we are still C virus in the community but to prevent the you know excessive community transmission as you mentioned and to prevent overwhelming our health care systems thanks Jim and I think we're kind of close to the to the end I really want to thank all of you for tuning in I am anxious today I'm very anxious because we are loosening substantially many many of the requirements we had in place we're doing that in a way that we believe is safe and yet I stand before you today knowing that our citizens are at greater risk today because of what we're talking about with Yellowstone Park then they were that's not easy and and for those that you know are saying we should loosen everything and go away with it they don't have the responsibility that that I do to make sure that our citizens are well taken care of or that dr. Harris does I do want to thank the secretary for leading and really exceptional effort at coordinating our efforts making sure our counties are supported and that the people of Wyoming have the the best form of government one that will allow for the elections to occur in a most normal way possible and we are working very hard every single day to make sure that those industries that haven't been affected by kovat 19:6 in Wyoming I'm talking about our mining industries and I'm talking about our oil and gas industry they haven't been affected with sickness in their workforce because of the things we've done that hopefully positions us in a much better way when our economy starts to come back nationally and globally it is essential that we get this country back to work Wyoming's already ready we're ready to meet that challenge I'm anxious about that but I believe in the people of Wyoming as I've said over and over again and I know we will do the right thing we will do it right away and we will do it the right way thank you
