 [Music] hi welcome to this module this module is again continuation of your last module and last body we have seen how can you fabricate ETM biochip for measuring ATM properties in this model let us see that how we can create a micro actuator so microrobots not really better robots robotic arms with microchips alright for understanding the tissue properties before that we will see the how we can develop these sensors so if you see the slide in this slide we can see that there are three thermistors 1 2 & 3 thermistor 1 thermistor 2 thermistor 3 and in the center there is a heated alright so what happens is let me first let's end this let me let me tell you about this chip first now this design first this is a trench friends or pit right pit this one the thicker one are your inter digitated electrodes which one this line and this line right if you see this one it goes here here and here this line goes across it here and here right so and in the center there is a heater correct so now this is your chip design how to fabricate this chip hmm we will see in the next slide how to fabricate this chip the and what is why we have advocated how we are using it now we understand that there is a tissue in the center and this chip is on the both ends with chip this one so now if this this is magnified version of or this one single chip this is the enlarged figure of this particular single chip if I if I can attach this chip on one side of the tissue and another chip on the another side of the tissue right and I apply I heat it from one side with the help of heater I can measure the change in the temperature with the help of thermistor on other side of the tissue and that means that I have t1 here I have t2 here that means I can measure the thermal conductivity correct now I have inter digitated electrodes so as soon as this chip touch is the tissue I can measure the impedance of the tissue I can measure the surface impedance and I can measure the bulk impedance of additio right so this is how the simulation can be done for the heater at least and you can see it is almost a uniform in the center of the chip and that's a very good news because then we can use this chip for heating the tissue uniformly and you can also see that the this is without range but if I have a yeah this is with this particular part you see right and these are the individual electrodes and this is a heater in the center so there is a simulation for that which is a heat profile of the heater and this is the fabrication so we start with a wafer which is silicon wafer we clean it then we grow oxide which is a schematic b and after growing oxide we perform lithography and this is liftoff technique so first is your photoresist you have pattern your photo resist like this which is your positive photoresist on positive photoresist you have deposited platinum and then you have dipped this wafer in acetone when you dip this wafer in acetone what will happen you will have interred you have heaters you have the heated right then you can create a trench for creating fence you can again perform the lithography and open the window remove silicon dioxide similar silicon dioxide can be has to be the help of bhf buffer hydrofluoric acid once so the most of akan dioxide you can etch silicon using DRI right so your trench are created and then on that you can also create your inter digitated electrodes but here it's just showing the thermal sensors right so the let me let me go to the next section here you can see then optical image of the sensor which is right over here right again like I said thermistors thermistors thermistors and heater alright this is your inter digital records and if you if you see this particular chip then it can place within the like a sim holder SIM card holder because we don't want to do soldering or wire bonding and after one measurement you have to throw the chip because for biological samples you cannot use a chip same chip again and again so you have to fabricate a chip that is cheaper and cost as well as the holder should be easy you can just place the chip rather than doing bar bonding and shouldering so if you see further you can see here that the this is the actual photograph of the chip some catherization where we can see that the Alpha was calculated about two point through 2 into 10 to 10 to power minus 3 a particle in centigrade a square value was really good and as well as the we had run some hysteresis profile increasing temperature decreasing temperature now these are the actual system so again there are two three videos actually this is the first video in the video what you have seen you have seen that there are in dentists and in the in denters there are political our thing which are in debtors at the tip of the inductor we have attached the chip that we have I have just shown it to you and these chips are used for understanding the electrical and thermal properties while the top indenter it presses tissue from the top if you see the lender image on the right side of the screen then you can understand that there are the two actuators and here is the actual photograph where there is a arm one versus arm too and that the tip of this arm you can see here that we have the chip a taste for thee for measuring the [Music] all right so I will just sweet to the next section and that is on the heart we will talk about atrial fibrillation but let us talk about atrial fibrillation in the next module I just was wanted to give you a very quick updates about the newer design of the chip that we are fabricating as a part of the research and it is really important for you guys also to think a novel kind of sensor design that can be easier to fabricate and can be used for understanding the tissue properties now we are talking about breast cancer but we are not limited to breast cancer we can use different tissue related cancer it can be oral cancer it can be cervical cancer it can be posted cancer and wherever tissues are there we can understand how the tissue proper D changes right so once you understand the sensor fabrication and you can design in your novel sensors or new sensors you can measure different properties all right so in my next module I'll be talking more on the heart disease and how the atrial fibrillation which is one of the important disease which causes death in patient how it can be treated and why sensors are very important including actuators of eye very important because we have to design a novel characters with a maneuvering system to treat that particular thesis so till then I will take leave from you for now and I'll see you in the next class with a more interesting problem to identify and to fill the gap and a very interesting actuator and sensor system to to find a solution in terms of medical devices right then you take care by
