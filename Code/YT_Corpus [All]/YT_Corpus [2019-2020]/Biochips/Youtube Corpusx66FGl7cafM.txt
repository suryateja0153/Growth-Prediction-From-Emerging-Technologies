 here's an advantage of additive manufacturing we haven't talked about 3d printing is potentially a solution for super tiny parts we go really small on this episode of the cool parts show [Music] [Applause] season three of the cool part show is brought to you by carpenter additive the company's athens alabama emerging technology center is an end-to-end additive manufacturing production facility with everything from materials development through post-processing under one roof ready to help you with your next metal 3d printing job check them out at carpenteradditive.com now back to the show i'm pete i'm stephanie this is the cool parts show our show all about cool 3d printed parts made by manufacturers maybe manufacturers like you so three 3d printed parts um but i'm getting the sense this is another one of those surprise reveal episodes because there's no part in the table pete um i brought apart i brought you many parts here is an advantage of additive manufacturing i don't hear talked about much at all and you said parts not part and i still don't see them where are the parts take a look in your coffee cup where i have brought you 500 3d printed parts so this is not what i usually drink in the morning additive manufacturing is a potential solution for making tiny tiny tiny parts and possibly presents an easy way to do it okay so that's interesting because i feel like one of the one of the the challenges with 3d printing that people often point out is this issue of resolution right and how you know how small can you go how fine of features can you do but you're saying that 3d printing actually is the right solution for these tiny little parts potentially um these are tiny little electrical connectors um tiny little connectors for a very compact electronic assembly they were made by boston micro fabrication bmf and a part like this if not for 3d printing would otherwise be made by injection molding and the prospect of making a mold that tiny with features cavity core that tiny um that precise it can be done companies do it but it's challenging and a mold like that is expensive okay so i i see the appeal of getting away from tiny little molds for parts like these but the 3d printing method is not entirely obvious so boston microfabrication what's the technology that they're using right so bmf is doing dlp digital light processing uh so a bath of resin and optics uh cure an entire layer one layer at a time it's not a point by point process there are other 3d printing makers who use dlp but they use it for more macro size components what bmf brings is that they add a couple things to the machine one is there's really precise xy motion and in fact the the bed of resin is what is moving in x and y so the optics can stay stationary and that bed is descending minutely layer by layer other dlp systems kind of orient that so the part is suspended we'll talk more about that so precise x y motion combined with very precise optics to form the part this is john koala he is the ceo of bmf and he has a little more to say about that getting fine resolution uh is uh depending on the process right so if you're using a fdm process it's often about the nozzle size if you're using a laser-based process it's often about the the beam width to be able to get the the resolution that you're looking for in a dlp process it's really about the in the image resolution similar to when you're looking at your television you know the higher the resolution the sharper the image and so we're using a 1080p dlp projector but then we're also using a lens to really be able to focus that that resolution down even finer down to the the 10 micron optical resolution that we're really looking for so that's the the key to get the the pixels to be small and the resolution to be where where we have it for high performance okay so that kind of addresses my question about resolution it's a combination of that projector and then the lens that get lets you get that really fine detail yeah so that's what achieves what they call micro scale 3d printing okay micro scale what do you mean by that right so uh parts and part features that are really really tiny but still visible right so we're not talking about microscopic work necessarily we're not talking about nanoscale work but we're talking about features that fall in the realm where these parts would otherwise be produced through micro injection molding or micro machining and put a pin in that because we'll there's a there's a micro machining related solution we'll get to too but it's not just for tiny parts like this not just for that because um there are also features of larger parts where this could make sense too so here's a more macro scale part and at a glance you might think that like this makes sense for um a more macro scale 3d printer this is a chip socket but if you look closely you can see there's this array of tiny tiny holes and those tiny holes in this case are the feature that is produced through the micro scale 3d printing okay so this is a solution not just for these tiny little parts but also for larger parts that have fine features or things that would be maybe difficult or challenging to injection mold for instance yeah yeah applications um tiny electrical connectors um tiny little medical components microfluidics parts and also just prototypes for parts that are really really tiny if the process and the tooling is really hard for a part that's ultimately going to be made through a conventional process it still makes a lot of sense to use 3d printing to get that part design just right before you have to make that investment and prototyping is where bmf initially saw the promise of this technology and what they've addressed so far but they also recognized that on a cost comparison basis um for some production applications of really tiny parts or parts with really tiny features yeah maybe this 3d printing platform really is the way to go okay so you mentioned cost savings and sometimes we talk about additive as like reducing the amount of material that's used but there's so little material here to begin with i feel like the the cost savings is probably more from the process side right yeah so yeah good point in conventional manufacturing little creates big challenges the injection mold to make a part this tiny those tiny little features machined really precisely into the mold there are companies that know how to do that mold makers who know how to do that but not a large number of them and it's challenging work similarly for metal parts that are micro machined in some cases that micro machining is done with cutting tools so small so small in diameter you can barely see them and tools like that create processing challenges handle with care type challenges in the setup and the use of those tools again only so many providers out there suppliers able to do that kind of really fine tiny work but a 3d printing process that has the accuracy and the resolution and the fineness built in by comparison it's a relatively easy way to produce these tiny parts or parts with these tiny tiny features john koala actually has a little bit more to say about that let's listen to him yeah today for a lot of small parts for whether it's electrical connectors or whether it's other applications um you're the the traditional well the current methods for making that either are what's often called micro magic injection molding it's a subset of general injection molding uh or micro machining so it's a very very small parts uh this in a lot of ways the smaller the part the more expensive the process so that's the challenge is that the tooling that would be required for molding or the setup and the equipment that would be required for cnc machining or in some cases an order of magnitude more expensive than if you're just making a standard plastic part or metal part today so i think that the promise of 3d printing is it just makes that easier so parts that are complex to mold or difficult to mold or complex to machine are relatively easy to 3d print and so i think that the promise is that these this technology can can displace some of those traditional methods for manufacturing okay so the thing that's kind of striking about that is that a lot of 3d printing processes and dlp is one of them involve support structures and so once you finish the print you've got to somehow remove those support structures how do you do that with these tiny little parts i'm so glad you asked about that so um i mentioned how their system has the build platform descending minutely uh the part grows up from below in the resin bath the buoyancy of that resin because these parts are so tiny so fine just that buoyancy provides just enough support in many cases the float is enough to sustain the parts support them so no structures are needed okay so no support structures that is really cool yeah yeah let me show you another example of a part um here's a case where the micro scale 3d printing potentially can replace a metal part this is a glaucoma stent and conventionally right now it's made of titanium it is micro machined and uh the potential 3d printed replacement is made from a biocompatible polymer right now this stent requires two surgeries one to put it in and one to take it out the biocompatible alternative potentially dissolves in the body eliminating that second surgery wow so changing the process allows for this material change which completely changes the nature of this surgery makes it so much easier okay so you've shown me a couple of different applications now the glaucoma stent this connector the chip socket what other parts can this be used for um yeah so potentially different sectors different applications what bmf is really thinking about now is the next step i think is is moving into production um using this platform as a possibility for um repetitive manufacturing of these tiny tiny parts here's john kohler one more time the platform that we have today we think well serves prototyping needs we've got a range of materials that serve those needs uh well we think the speed uh and the productivity of the platform is is is quite good for prototyping needs but when you're really moving toward production applications you need to do two things you need to check two boxes and those boxes are one the part itself needs to match the requirements of the of the end part in terms of accuracy surface finish detail we think we've already checked that box the second is material properties so the material needs to if it doesn't match 100 it needs to be good enough or close enough so mechanical properties thermal properties perhaps dielectric properties depending on the application so that's the second box to check and we're working on that with both internally on the material side and with with partners to to develop materials to match those production materials and then the third one is speed so if you're trying to take a 3d printing application and use it to displace a current traditional manufacturing method the economics need to be there perhaps you can pay a little bit more for the convenience and not having tooling and inventory and and uh the promise of distributed manufacturing but it can't cost much more and so it needs to be able to to to meet the economic requirements of the customer and that in a lot of ways comes down to material cost it comes down to equipment cost and it comes down to speed and i often think that speed equals money i mean if you have a slow machine it just means you need a lot of machines which may not be economical so when we really think about what needs to happen to sort of move this this technology forward it's materials development and speed and those are both things that are on our product roadmap okay so one thing that john mentioned that we haven't talked about yet is is speed so you said there are 500 parts here how long did it take to print these sure um these were printed in batches of 150 about two hours build time per batch so do the math there 500 parts something like seven hours okay so 500 parts in less than an eight hour shift yeah pretty cool yeah okay so i think i got this these parts are connectors um they are in a range that we would call the micro scales they're not microscopic they're not nanoscale but they are very small very detailed they were made by a company called boston microfabrication which uses a very high resolution dlp process to print small parts like this and other parts with fine features this is a cost-effective solution to micro injection molding or micro machining and it has a lot of diverse applications everything from the medical industry to optics to electronics exactly right i think that'll do it thank you for watching the cool parts show if you want to tell us about a cool part that you're making
