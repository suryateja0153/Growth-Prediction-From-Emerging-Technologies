 [Music] hello everyone welcome to the next module on electronic system for cancer diagnosis today let us see how to drive fluids in micro channels like I've already mentioned previously when we are fabricating microfluidic chip or a bio chip we have channels who have cross section I mean the channel width is as small as 100 micron in length so how do we drive fluids in them and why should you even drive fluids into a channel which is that small so as I've already mentioned these bio chip also called as a microfluidic chip or it is even termed as lab-on-a-chip they mimic the biological environment they have multiple channels in them in order to replicate the biology the physiology of the organ the organ functionality so how do we control fluids in micro channels microfluidic flow control is one of the critical technology which has been widely used because of the need for precise control of fluids through these micro channels which are very low in quantity the liquid sample what you take to flow through the channels are very minimal which flows through your bio chip let us say you if you want to you know in practice how what would be the how do you quantify the amount the channel dimensions and how much is the fluid that flows through these channels let's quantify what is the amount of fluid which actually flows through these channels which will claim to be you know of millimeter micrometer length scale so it is say you have one centimeter cube how much of the fluid actually goes in one centimeter cube one centimeter cube is like you have a 15 London 15 centimeter scale and then you know how much is one centimeter and then one centimeter cube and when you put some liquid how much of it goes into this cube so it's one milliliter fluid which completely when you do the volumetric conveyor conversion it is one milliliter fluid into this one centimeter cube so you now that you know it's one milliliter fluid we are talking in terms of micro liters of fluid going into these channels so now you get the point this very minimal amount of fluid flow which goes through these channels and how can you precisely control their slow is very critical while we do analysis and while we work with these kind of biochip so when I mentioned about lab-on-a-chip so what is lab-on-a-chip it is nothing but a chip which integrates several laboratory requirements into one sim one single chip the multiple functionality has been integrated on just one chip so that's when you call lab on a chip and you analyze when we say making the entire environment so multiple the the multiple parts of your environment gets included gets integrated on one single chip so on a similar basis there there you even talk about organ on a chip this is an entire body we have multiple organs how could you actually mimic an organ on a chip so the end the functionality of an organ can be mimicked by including the various physiological biological chemical properties by having multiple channels and then you could actually integrate all of them into a chip more of this can be studied there are vast research which talks about lab on a chip and you could check more of this stuff online so now that we know what is lab on a chip and organ on a chip so you understand that we are driving liquids through these micro channels so the liquid driving mechanism becomes very important to us so how do you drive liquid I'm sure you've all heard of blood being pumped to various parts of the body so when you're talking about pumping pump mechanism is nothing but a driving force to push the fluids it could be liquid or gas to push fluids across that the channel so in our case we have these channels and we have fluids which have to be which has to be flown through these that can be attained using micro pump the pumping mechanism so that they currently we have very well known the driving horses of pumping mechanism are in microfluidic devices or biochips mostly used are the syringe pumps and the peristaltic pumps but today we would be studying more about peristaltic pumps and how it is used in driving fluids through your device that is the driving fluid through the channels which are engraved in your device so there are a number of on chip pumping mechanism for example in one of the modules I've spoken about PDMS molding so you could actually go on and check how a pump could be fabricated using a PDMS device so so it's an on-chip pump where the entire pumping mechanism will be taken care with your the design of your elastomer so more on this can be studied so you can go ahead and look online how a micro pump can be fabricated using PDMS so most important requirements for us while we have this micro Channel while we precise if you want to precisely control fluid flowing through micro channels are we require long term stability repeatability and we should have fine control over them so all of this could be achieved using peristaltic pumps so they're two variations in peristaltic pump one is the tube pump the other one is the hose the hose is mostly used with the they are mostly designed for high-pressure pumps the peristaltic pump what we would be using they are designed for no pressure operation so the peristaltic pump has rollers on them and then they are reinforced tubes which you could actually see and we will show you we will give you a demonstration and how are these pumps constructed and how do they work so they employ rollers which squeeze through the tubes and that's how the fluid could flow and you could actually fine get a fine control over the fluid flow the rate at which they flow and the volume of fluid which goes into your device could be controlled so as you increase so the number of rollers could range from two it could go on to two rollers say a 180 degree apart or it could go on to eight or even 12 rollers let us see how many rollers we have in our device which we would be demonstrating and when you what happens when you increase the number of rollers it is the pulse frequency the amount of fluid that is being pumped is what changes so let's get a hands-on on the peristaltic pump which could be used to pump fluid through multiple channels so like I spoke about the peristaltic pump this one in my hand is one such pump this could flow around 90 ml of fluid let me show you part by part so this forms the motor part of the pump which which is the driving force and here is the casing this is the tubing through which the fluid flows in then comes out let's say I remove the casing if you could see this if you could see this is where the motor drives in as it rotates there are three rollers in this case like I mentioned there could be two which are 180-degree apart and in this one there are three rollers this is one two and three so these rollers push they they compress the outer surface of this pump of this tube so here is the tube as you can see it's a relatively larger diameter than what we use for our bio chip or microfluidic devices these thing this cannot be used with this just for a demonstration how a peristaltic pump looks like and what goes into here what goes into the pump this is the tube through which fluid flows and while your motor drives each of this roller would compress the pump it would compress it and then there's this compression there is this pulsation and as it releases the you see there's an increase in volume and then the fluid tends to move forward let me put it back so this was a tubing and then goes the three rollers and then here is the outer casing so this forms your peristaltic pump now let us see what kind of pump is used in microfluidic devices or a biochip there you mimic the biological environment flow different chemicals or you could flow alike you you might flow a drug test the susceptibility of a particular kind of cells test different kinds you could load in cancer cells and test how the drug works on each of this so let's look at how the peristaltic pump can be used in case of flowing micro micro flowing fluid through micro channels like we said there were two variations of peristaltic pump which is the host pump which operate with higher operating pressures and the one what we have is the peristaltic pump as you can see so there are rollers inside let's see how the peristaltic pump functions we'll look into the different parts of the pump and see how we could operate them so these the peristaltic pumps what we have here is also called the roller pump because you can see there are there could be rollers which are inside which would put force on your tube and then the the driving mechanism happens so let's see how the tube has been placed inside so as you can see here there are four castles 1 2 3 & 4 so let's even before we turn on let us have a look as as to how the tubing's are placed inside each of these castles we have someone who would be helping us so this is one Cassatt in his hand you could see the tubing the the silicon tubing's and each of these gases will have the tubing which would be enforced into the channels the the one in his hand is the channel through which the fluid flows now let us see like can you point out to the rollers so as Suman is pointing out we have six the pointing out to the rollers so there are six rollers which triggers the entire pumping mechanism so it pumps it pumps the fluid through these silicon tubes the lets you counter the diameter as you can see the silicon tube it is 1mm outer diameter however the inner diameter is very small it is around 0.12 millimeter which is very small it is like a pin hole and then the fluid flows through this point 1/2 mm channel inner diameter channel so this tube is tensioned between the tubing bed and the rotor so this is the rotor this is the tubing bed and then we have the rotor which goes which actually drives this the rotor is this way and the rotor drives and then this this forms the tubing bed each of these rollers will compress the fluid as the road as as each of these rollers move they compress they form a compressing action on the tube the tube will be squeezed continuously through the roller and displaced the liquid in the direction in which the roller head is moving say this roller head moves in this direction clockwise direction so your fluid will be displaced in this direction say clockwise direction it also depends on which direction your motor is rotating and once you say this is the tube so let's say we put the tube into the Cassatt and then place it on the rollers so as it goes into the casing as you can see the tube which rests on these rollers and then between the two rollers there is a gap and as the roller resumes the the the part of the tube which is behind the roller this if this phases the compression force the one which is on the roller and the one which comes between the two rollers as it moves towards phase is compressed and there the and then it resumes the shape as it goes away from the roller so as it moves from this point to this point it relaxes it resumes its original shape comes back to the earner diameter and the compression is on the roller point so that this creates a vacuum and suction the liquid and then the entire process repeats so this is more like a positive displacement pump so it pumps the fluid you know in the in terms of fluid out in the direction in which the roller rotates the now you can see these they they don't have valve or seal so this is a very inexpensive you know pump and it permits easy flow of solids and viscous lick and viscous media so let us see how each of this functions so as we can see there is a digital display for us a user interface and let's see how to operate this pump so say we turn on the pump so now we know that there are four castes 1 2 3 & 4 here with 4 channels on one side they are parallel channels as you can see the digital display the first is the home and then the second talks about the the configuration of the Cassatt it tells how much microliter and the RPM in which it is running so this is telling say the symbol what is on the left side is rotating the clockwise so the first cast it would rotate in clockwise direction and what is the amount of volume the fluid it draws it is 100 micro liter and per second so 100 micro liter per second fluid will be drawn through this this tubing this is the configuration in the first Cassatt which is this one so what are the other options available and then we have the settings and this is a settings option and then when you is now as you can see he's moved to the second Cassatt so that is running at 4 micro liter per minute and at what direction you could see it is running in the clockwise direction and we will also show you how you could change the RPM the the rotations per minute and you could even control the amount of fluid which flows and even the time so let's say this is my second cassock and now currently this 4 micro liter per minute say I want to and this is running at 100 rpm say I'd like to change the RPM now now it is at 100 rpm and then I'll reduce so like I showed you could change the rotation that is rotating it anti-clockwise direction and now from 100 rpm say I'll reduce it to 50 rpm 50 revolutions per minute and the direction is in the anti-clockwise direction so let us see what is the fourth channel so the fourth is set at 100 rpm and it is set at clockwise direction now let us run and see how the rollers rotate so as you can see channel 3 the cassette 3 is rotating in the anti-clockwise and the fourth one in the clockwise direction and the relative change in speed can also be observed as you could observe the variations now let us see what are the other configurations we can do so let us stop and then do the other configurations now as you can see the castle for now we are in volume you can even change so let's say we do the volume per tap per time settings so let's say we will drive around 2 micro litre fluid so we set it to around 2 micro liter i-4 of 2 micro litre say for 5 seconds because the time is 2 micro liters very small amount of fluid so let's say we increase their time to around 5 seconds okay now let us see how is it this is the fourth castle configuration which is running at 2 micro liters but 5 seconds so say we have taken a petri dish with water and let's see how the fluid flow stresses is the clockwise direction we have some amount of fluid in the petri dish here and this is the fourth one so let's fix the fourth Cassatt and also let's fix the third Cassatt so this entire pumping mechanism you know the compression and the decompressing of the tubing it is to allow force to fluid to flow from one direction to the other as you can see this working is very much similar to how our body pumps blood nutrition and oxygen and this is why we are using this mechanism when we are making the entire bio environment the physiology the chemistry and the biology on to our bio chip and hence using these pumping mechanism becomes very important and controlling the amount of fluid which flows through them becomes vital for the accurate functioning of our device so let's say in castle 4 we are driving 40 micro liters of fluid and let's say said this time to around a minute say 60 seconds so will flow 50 micro liters per minute so that it becomes easy for us to visually see how the fluid flows think that's very much that's too high you can actually put only 20 micro liter for say 5 seconds he put 4 micro liter in 3 seconds okay we can change that change the time into three okay let's see now we are in castle three clockwise direction and the volume is set at five micro litre which will flow for 10 seconds 5 micro liter of fluid flows for 10 seconds so we use observe where is the source and then we have the sink so we've taken some DI water and let's see in 10 seconds 5 micro liter of fluid should be flown from the source into the sink in the clockwise direction let's see the other setting as you can see this droplets let's check what is the setting in the 4th Cassatt so this is 20 micro liters so this is a higher volume 20 micro liter of fluid should flow across the source to the sink in 12 seconds the one in someone's hand is he's holding the 4th channel and then the other one is the 3rd channel so let's see 12 seconds there should be 20 micro liter of fluid which has flown across the 4th channel so and now that you've seen we've done the setting so in the third Cassatt will have some five micro liter of fluid and the fourth one is 20 micro liter fluid as you can clearly observe the volume of fluid which is coming out of the channel here as you can see the this is for channel width with a higher volume and the time what you said is very small like we've just set it for 5 seconds and 12 seconds which is very small but but you could set the timing and you could relatively get your hands on the device so now that you've got the idea about the functioning of the paralytic pump have you can change the volume you can change the time you could change the direction of rotation and there's another feature you could actually flow the fluid pause it for some time and then again continue so we are on the fourth Cassatt and you could change nana we've said the volume and time so this is at the volume setting so let's see if we could change so this is the time and this is volume plus pause so when you get into this option you have you could control the rate at which it is rotating you could control the amount of volume you could pause it so so this 20 micro liter you could every time it flows through the times there's a pause of two seconds and and then you can set the number of cycles so like we said it repeats the flow repeats so you could set the repetition rate so this is your cycle which can be said so these are the features through which you can work on and then accurately control precisely control the amount of fluid flow through multiple channels across your device so this was the hands-on experience on the peristaltic pump that's it for today thank you
