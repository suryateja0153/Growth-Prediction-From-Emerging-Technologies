 [Music] hello welcome to this module this module is in continuation to our last module in the last module I have discussed the electrical and mechanical properties of tissue how can we fabricate a flexible sensor with P dot PSS as a strain gauge and then insulating material and gold electrode over with there were su-8 pillars in this particular module I want to emphasize and stress more on the chip for ATM properties easier for electrical T cells for thermal M sense for mechanical properties before we dive into this particular fabrication process you should have very clear idea about the breast anatomy and also the breast cancer stages alright so I have got you two quick videos to look at and then we continue the class so if you see the slide what the breast generally they are not generally the best anatomy is such that it consists of ducks right it consists of lobes you see lobes duct right and then there is a pictorial muscles and then there is fat all right so duct low fat and pectoral muscles now if the cancer occurs in duct is called ductal cancer it occurs in lobe no Buehler cancer right it is both doctor and lobe then mixed tumor cancer if there is an inflammation inflammatory cancer if there is a mucous mucinous cancer so several kinds of cancer are there and the very important is triple negative breast cancer where all the markers are absent so this particular chip would probably help the Anka pathologies to come up with a better diagnosis because we are adding three extra modalities or three additional modalities to the existing relativity's biomarker if you see the video I am playing the first breast and drama video breast cancer today knowing more about your own breast anatomy can help you an early cancer detection and Prevention your breasts are connected to small masses of tissue called lymph nodes by way of lymph vessels the lymph nodes are responsible for collecting bacteria cancer cells and other unhealthy material you have groups of these lymph nodes under your arms above your collarbones and behind your breastbone as well as in other parts of your body each breast is made up of lobes lobules and ducts the lobes consist of smaller lobules that contain groups of tiny milk producing glands when a breast is producing milk it passes through the ducts into the nipple where it exits the body breast cancer most commonly develops in the lobules glands and ducts of the breast okay so in this you have seen in detail what what i was talking on the slide about the anatomy of the breast now let us see how the breast cancers different stages are there and let me play it the staging of breast cancer refers to the extent of the disease the cancer stage is based on several factors including the size of the tumor if any lymph nodes are involved if the cancer is invasive or non-invasive and if the cancer has spread to areas beyond the breast stage zero is considered a non invasive breast cancer in this stage there is no evidence that the cancer cells have spread into neighboring breast tissue beyond the duct or lobule stage one is considered an early stage of invasive breast cancer when measured the tumor is no more than 2 centimeters in diameter and there is no evidence that the cancer cells have spread beyond the breast Stage two is divided into subcategories of 2a and 2b stage 2a is invasive breast cancer where the tumor is either a maximum of 2 centimeters in diameter and has spread to the lymph nodes under the arm or the tumor is between 2 and 5 centimeters in diameter but has not spread to any lymph nodes stage 2b is a little different and that the tumor is either between 2 and 5 centimeters and has spread to underarm lymph nodes or the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters but has not spread to the underarm lymph nodes stage 3 is considered a locally advanced cancer and it is also divided into subcategories of 3a 3b and 3c there are two main scenarios that can occur with stage 3a breast cancer one where the tumor is no larger than 5 centimeters in diameter but it has spread to underarm lymph nodes that are growing into each other forming clumps the cancer may also have spread to the lymph nodes near the breastbone the second scenario for stage 3a is very similar with the exception that the tower is larger than 5 centimeters in diameter and that the underarm lymph nodes are not adhered to one another or other tissues unlike the other stages in stage 3b the tumor may be any size and has spread into the skin of the breast or chest wall this stage may also include lumps on the skin of the breast or swelling of the breast in stage 3c the tumor may also be of any size but it is also spread to lymph node areas above or below the clavicle the chest wall and/or the skin of the breast Stage four is considered distant metastatic cancer meaning the cancer has spread to other organs and parts of the body so what you saw you saw that there are several stages of breast cancer stage 0 1 2 3 4 earlier you diagnose any you can have cure for the disease right so early diagnosis early screening is an important parameter in this field right earlier you screen better earlier diagonals better unfortunately because of the lack of awareness generally when the women knows that there is some problem and they go to the hospital it's already stage 3 or stage 2 all right the reason is like I said lack of awareness it's very important that we start awareness because we are now we are working on this research problem that a woman has to go for mammography which is a screening test for breast cancer age-wise there is a requirement if it is less than 40 once in a year about 40 twice in a year's or vice versa I can just quickly see it but the point is it's very important to go for mammography all right so let us see the statistics and then you'll understand why I'm saying it it is extremely important to screen and regularly test once in a year is not a big deal alright and lot of government facilities gives its for give this facility for free all right or very nominal price of like 80 rupees or 100 rupees so if it can save a life it's worth spending thousands but at the same time lot of people cannot afford so how about hundred right so if you see the government initiatives there are very good initiatives for healthcare in particular and if we are aware we can take help of those initiatives including I recently came to know that particularly in Karnataka state there is a government initiative where where the government will give about 1.2 leg or 1.3 like something around that value for heart operation it's really really important and good initiative all right so but the point is we should be aware right VRML we can use it so this is this I'm talking a little bit slightly deviating the topic of answer actuators because you had to learn sans actuators when you have a disease but why to have disease right why do not stop this thing so if you cannot stop at least why don't you screen it at early stage right so that's our reason of I was talking about so if you see the slide you will understand they they we are talking about phenotyping of breast cancer not genotyping of breast cancer and according to global coin the in September to 118 the cancer burden has risin to 18 point 1 million cases and close to nine point six million cancer deaths he's a huge value and you can see here the incidence versus mortality the lung cancer leads to quite an extent you can see here incidence of lung cancer right eleven point six percent of all new cases about two point zero nine four million cases where if you talk about breast cancer again close to two point zero eight nine million cases collateral colorectal colorectal I'm sorry the cancer which is about ten point two percent of 1.8 million cases followed by prostate cancer about 1.3 million cases and stomach cancer about 1 million cases when you look at the mortality ratio you will see that lung cancer eighteen point four percent mortality that means 1.8 million deaths when talk about colorectal you can see about eighty eight eight like eighty one thousand patients die stomach cancer about seven like eighty three thousand liver seven decades 2000 while breast six legs twenty seven thousand and this is for both sexes and all cancer for all ages worldwide but if you see the overall burden a huge alright so what we can see is that breast cancer is a leading site of cancer in women accounting women accounting for 27 percent of the cases and that's why a very important problem to address and to find a solution now the high rate of instability lower rate of mortality for a breast cancer suggested accurate and early diagnosis can go a long way in saving life you can see in in terms of incident these are number two but in terms of mortality it is a number five so if we cannot get a better diagnosis better screening better sensors right then we can still reduce this mortality factor okay so as you have seen in the video what we see is that the stages when you say state zero the tumor size is very small and inside the glands right in lymph nodes there is nothing spreading is not it's not spread and survival rate is about 500 is about hundred percent for five year survival rate for two centimeter stage one again lymph node there is nothing and confined to the breast area not outside which is a good point and 100% is a fire survival ratio so this two is where we should identify a patient all right however as you progress further where it is stage two and the tumor size is about 5 to 2 to 5 centimeter and now the lymph nodes are affected you can see here the representative image the lymph nodes are affected and then further this is confined to the press not outside so still it can be cured and you can see that survival rate is 87% but as you go to stage three and four the difficulty or complexity increases stage 3 is 5 centimeter and larger stage for any size stage 3 affected by cancer cancer has reached to the muscles and skin you can see here you can see the lymph nodes right but in this case is is can be anywhere including the tumor in brain confined to the breast area not outside but here it can be of any part of the body and this is about 20% only there's also 61% only what I prefer is how what we try to make a system that can have these things at least we can cover stage - all right so based on tumor size stage 0 to 4 based on the sites then you can say that it is a noble carcinoma in situ dr. carcinoma in situ invested over casino money invested carcinoma based on the receptor status you can divide into four states her2 plus - luminal a luminal B triple negative edge here - her2 - energy are two ND g thr - energy are - that's so these are based on the receptor status if I see the background or workflow of diagnosis and staging of breast cancer then you can see here that once it is diagnosed there can be many ways of diagnosing the can surf on his physical exam or history second is clinical breast exam which is called CBE third is mammography MRI ultrasound fourth one is genotyping which is blood chemistry studies we are talking about phenotyping so we continue with a biopsy even a biopsy is done then the cells are taken to study which is called psychology so psychology then core biopsy in sister bossy and exited biopsy if further divided then there is a histological analysis whether all the biomarkers that I was talking about er estrogen PR prostration her2 plus are straight and then based on that the staging and subtyping is there so this is the process or drug flow for diagnosing on staging of breast cancer so 73 percent of all breast cancer is H R plus 2h here - her2 - where thirteen percent which is also called triple negative breast cancer very very dangerous HR - and her2 - while 10% and 5% are for H R plus 2 h CR 2 plus n HR - her2 plus so now the point is we require an alternative modality n VT to study physical properties of tissues or what we study physical properties of tissue as an alternative morality so that's why we we're somewhere in this particular domain biopsy domain all right so now which physical properties of tissues we are to study we can study the electrical properties which is resistive and impedance measurements we can study the conductivity and diffusivity with the thermal conductivity we can also study the mechanical properties the ex elasticity and sickness if we cover all these parameter along with biomarkers can we bring the false positive false negative signals down and can we also have a novel or alternative or additional morality is to reduce the or to not only reduce the false positive or false negative but also to diagnose triple negative breast cancer so that is a bigger picture of this particular research if you again see the screen you will find that this is out the MRI is done right most of you have seen there is separate lecture is required for making understand how MRI operates for now you just understand that MRI and mammography both are used for screening the patient if there is a suspect a suspicion reach and then the patient is asked for biopsy breast biopsy is done with the help of needle and the tissue is taken out like you can see here and issue is sliced further when you size issue further with microtome then you can get different biomarkers so here you can CH any staining p63 Brown SMA red estrogen and prostration which is PR er as P 6 to the ma and H any okay now what we are planning is can we measure the electrical mechanical and thermal properties of this tissue and for that what we can do so now you you you take this particular example of it is very very important and then we will see that how can we fabricate this particular tissue right this particular chip and place it for fabricating for understanding that issue property so if you see this chip let me see the next slide yes now this is a chip that we have to fabricate all right what is this chip consists of this chip consists of a heater which you can see here right and then on that heater there is an insulating material now you all know how can you fabricate heater is very easy right you deposit a metal then spin code photoresist soft bake exposes with masks developed the photoresist then hard baked then etch the metal then the tip of the photoresist with acetone and you have a heater after the heater you have an insulating material on instead of material you can have inter digitated electrodes once you have inter digitized a torus again you know it how can you fabricate you deposit metal and for use lithography technique to form inter digitated electrodes on these interdigital electrodes you can deposit the sensing material and this sensing material is your piezo resistive material now if you have a busy resistor material that means say I will just use a block diagram to make it easier so there is a heater at the bottom which is I will call H on that there is a let's say in the digital electrodes which I call ID is on which you have the sensing material so I'll say P so register so P Z all right now if I apply force then the register P so register which are this particular four blocks this should show me the change in the resistance but it will only show the change in resistance when my silicon will bend but silicon is hard so what can I do that's why I can now create a diaphragm and this is what a diaphragm you can see here the diaphragm is created so that when I apply a force then this term will Bend and when it bends there is a strain in the prison resistor and as there is a change in the resistance so this is the point now if I if I on the piezo register again so let me again show it to you what exactly this block is so that you understand very clearly I'm just showing a block diagram it becomes easier okay that way so silicon and of course you have oxide oxidize silicon wafer so we will have sio2 right sio2 on that you have your heater sign right h4 heater on that you have entered again silicon insulate dioxide then on that you have inter digitated electrodes is ID is on IDs you have P so register so happy easy on that you have on pressure resistance you have in have an insulating material which is sio2 on you have gold pad which is a you on gold pad you have a su 8 pillars so I see 8 pillars I'll just draw like this this representative su 8 right so this is the structure of this chip what is at the bottom there is a heater which you can see here then there is an insulator and then there are introduced electrodes which you can see in this particular diagram on inter digitated electrodes there is a piezo resistor which you can see in this diagram right on that there is silicon dioxide over which there are equal pens you can use you can see here and then over gold but there are su-8 pillars which also you can see over here all right so this is the chip and on the backside of this silicon what you have you have edging which is your diaphragm right so this is the chip now if I place a tissue on this chip that means I have a tissue and this tissue is placed on this chip like this all right and if I place this chip here here all right in between what is there there is a tissue like this okay this is my chip with chip this one right or you can say this one hmm now if I apply a force through my indenter this is my indenter all right this is my indent if I apply a force to indenter what will happen if I apply a force on this tissue this is my biopsy tissue biopsy tissue so if I apply a force then my piezo register on the chip will show change in resistance right my visual resistor on this chip will show change in resistance depending on how much force it can it it it observes right or it is translated through the tissue there is a f-1 force that I apply through indenter and my tip will get F to force this F to will depend on the elasticity of the tissue or this stiffness that issue all right so if I know the difference of the force that I can measure the elasticity or the stiffness of tissue what it this this force change I can measure the hand pump is registered now let us see the second property this remains as it is all right now you see if you see the indenter which in this figure in this figure if you see the indenter there is a electrode and the mod tip of the indenter you can see electrons that tip on the inductor that means if I apply voltage here which is let us say voltage one one potential of the voltage is here and on the chip there are go there is a gold pad with su-8 penis right coal pair with Azure penis so if I apply a voltage here as another pair of this potential then what will happen if I apply voltage between V 1 and V 1 1 then depending on the resistance of the tissue my current will change right if I apply potential difference that is voltage between two pairs V 1 and V 1 1 it is like two electrodes okay so electrode one's an electrode one one little one one is on the chip electrode one is on the indenter this one right so if I apply voltage between those two electrodes and if there is a tissue in between then I can see change in current and that change in current will be because of the resistance of tissue so if I know the voltage if I know the current I can measure the resistance of the tissue so first we are measuring the elasticity now we are measuring the resistance let us see the third one what our chip has our chip has a heater isn't it our chip has a heater here right so if I apply a voltage to the heater it will heat that means I can heat my chip let's say at 37 degree centigrade okay and tissue is placed on this chip now if you see indent indenter has thermistor in denver has thermistor the end this thermistor would be on the top of the tissue here so let's say T 1 1 and the chip is at T 1 so because she was a heater in deny the thermistor I can measure what is a change in the temperature if I apply 37 degree centigrade what is a chair what is a temperature the tip of the tissue which is T 1 1 and from that difference I can measure the thermal conductivity of the tissue so now I can measure elasticity or mechanical properties I can measure resistance or electrical properties I can measure change in temperature or thermal conductivity of the tissue so all three properties I can measure with the help of a microfabricated biochip 4 ATM for measuring the ATM properties of tissue or phenotyping of the tissue now this is for particularly and then where is this tissue kept this tissue is kept in the casing that you can see here and this casing is with the help of 3d printing material 3d printer alright so I will treat you how to deepen their works in one of the lab class 3d printer alright so if you see here there is a top panel there is a PCB as a middle part here is our bio chip this bio chip is this one alright then there is a spring and there is a bottom part when you when you put everything together you have a cone in which you can place the tissue all right so this is how it works so let me go to the next slide here you can see a process flow quickly there is a silicon then you have an oxidized silicon then you have a micro heater on that you have a silicon dioxide again on which you have a inter digitated electrodes after endure these electrodes you have a piece of register after pressure resistor you have insulator and over which you have a gold pads on gold pads you have a su-8 pillar and then you perform the liftoff technique to coat su-8 pillars with gold once you do that on the backside you can create a diaphragm alright so I'll write down here silicon silicon dioxide nichrome heater on silicon dioxide then silicon dioxide on nichrome right on silicon dioxide on silicon this you understand this thing you understand again I am NOT adding everything then you have inter digitated electrodes on silicon dioxide on your heater here you have piezo resistive material on your inter digitated electrodes which is sitting on silicon dioxide which is on nichrome and which is on silicon dioxide further then you have gold pad so then you have insulated so you have insulators SiO 2 on PC register on I des I will stop writing down this particular things now you have gold on SiO 2 on PC register on ID is here you have this one you have su 8 on gold pads and then I am NOT adding this thing then you have su 8 which is conducting on gol pad and finally you have diaphragm right by etching the backside of the silicon wafer so this is the process flow for creating a chip that can measure the electrical thermal and mechanical properties of a tissue we will show it to you in one of the lab class paraffin eyes and deeper refine eyes how to dipper a fan eyes the tissue when you get the tissue generally it is covered with wax and this is called patient tissue box or block and then this tissue is taken out you can see the paraffin it will remove the paraffin and then this is your deeper a furnace tissue you can see here the paraffin ice tissue versus the deeper a finest tissue all right now this tissue you are the place in this particular conical or cone shape holder and if you see here the chip or a microchip or bio chip here it is placed inside this particular 3d printed case holder alright so I'll move to the next section and you already know this how to fabricate Michael heaters right I'll go to the next section these are the inter digital electrodes SEM images of it and these are on the there is a micro heater over which so there is a micro heater right on which there is an insulator on which there are in traditional electrodes and then if I go to the next slide you can see here the piece of registry materials or interdigital electrodes you can see a gold pads on the on seeso on the bezel instead of silicon dioxide on which there is a gold pad which su eight pillars are there and you can hear three the chip against one cent the reason of using cent is that the size of the coin doesn't change that's why the photograph is with one cent and here you can see the results you can very clearly see that the tissue that lies in the cancerous region would be having a different properties mechanical properties compared to normal tissues and same way if you see this particular graph you can see very clearly the resistivity of the cancellous tissues is different than the resistivity of the normal tissues and from this graph even it is very close when you understand thermal conductivity you will understand that the cancerous tissues shows a different kind of thermal conductivity compared to the normal tissues so now this is only for six subjects as you can see here three normal and three cancel if I increase it to six subject to 200 subjects then I'll have a more better or we can have better understanding about how to correlate these three properties with the existing morality that is your biomarkers right if your any question please feel free to ask me in the forum so that we can discuss further and to go ahead with this now I will show it to you this particular tool so what we mean is you can see the video and in this video what you can see is that the there are indenter right and this in dentals the player press against a tissue and when the in dentists press against a tissue there is a 13 debtor also so once the tissue is there you press it and then you rotate the tissue again you press it and you press it from the top so you are covering most of the surface of the tissue which is a better inner properties or it's important to understand or cover more area of tissue because tissue is n s topic and now let us see another chip that we can fabricate which has a different kind of design but it has introduced electrodes and heater for understanding the same tissue properties which is your electrical and thermal properties okay so what we will do is we will we'll cover that section in the next module is a small section so you understand that not only the way I have taught you in this section how the chip can be fabricated but there is another way of fabricating the chip as well and let us let us discuss this thing in the next module so that not to increase this module to more than it is required in terms of length right too much things can universally will board a person so I'll see you in the next class with a new chip there can also perform the electrical and thermal properties or you can measure the electrical and thermal properties of the dish right ill then you take care i'll see in the next class
