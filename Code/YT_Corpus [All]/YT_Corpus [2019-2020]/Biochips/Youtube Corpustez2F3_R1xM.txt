 okay so we are back cyberpunk 2077 we just  left victor's place in having to upgrade our   vision and our hand and this game is absolutely  insane so what's going on guys it's your boy   unreal royale and let's not waste any more  time and get this started so this game so far   has introduced a lot of different elements  that i'm really starting to enjoy so again   if you guys are new smash that subscribe button  give this video a big fat thumbs up yo what is   good shoddy yo yo legs looking fine you're  looking fine in that little that little one   piece you got there i'll lay you down that chair  and i'll spit you a story you know what i'm saying   all right let's get the hell out of here so we  are back outside i need to pay victor back and   i need to try and avoid the cops so by any  means necessary we have to avoid the cops   who is this who is this i have to pay my debt  back so let me see can i talk to homeboy here   what's up in the big world i need to know  what is what is with this person's gun okay so i'm assuming that this was one of the  complaints that was uh basically given about   the game and the fact that you know what is this  what am i supposed to do here can i open this   oh there we go all right so now we're beginning  to explore the area we got homeless chicks here   it was good i see you hungry looking for  some meat nope all right so yeah this this   basically brings us back to victor but i don't  have any money right i i don't have any ash   uh let me go to my let me go to my inventory real  quick all right so this is what i got going on i   want to go ahead and just change my uh change my  shirt there can i can i rock this by any chance   okay all right i i'm digging that a little a  little better than just rocking the plain tee   all right do we have a hat or a gas mask that that  gas mask would be pretty dope though um do i want   to switch out my outfit uh probably rock yeah  yeah yeah that that white suits me a lot better   my oh my dude looks like he's about to go just  smash an entire like room full of [ __ ] right   so um but this game is this game is wildly fun  so far um what's the special do i have a special   outfit i don't have any special outfits yet all  right we got our standard pistol which we have   um i might go on ahead and upgrade that to  actually no that one seems to be a bit lower   in terms of a stance let me see  can i put something here though   um i'm definitely gonna put that there so i have  two for two okay not bad i only got three hundred   dollars so there's there's not really much i  can do right now let me put my gun away i don't   want to start any trouble um all right so uh i  guess we're just gonna exit the alleyway here   now i i need to figure out what to do right  uh let me see fast attack all right so we   have fast attacks hold back it's a block okay i  can actually start picking fights on the street   i want to take a fight with somebody i just  don't know who to pick a fight with let me go on   ahead and pick a fight with let me pick a fight  with this dude oh did i miss you what up homie   he's running away all right whatever um i need  to pay my my homie back his debt i just don't   know how to do that because i'm about 20 grand  short or at least in this case i think it's 2 000   i'm not entirely too sure let me go ahead and  go downstairs and check with him real quick   all right bro listen where's he  at where are we at all right so   all right i i need i need 21 000 that sucks  i do not have 21 grand to my uh to my name so   let's go back outside and let's  continue to do our thing here so   uh do i have anything we have the car uh well i  i can ultimately confirm that car vehicle i guess   that's pretty cool the fact that we can actually  call for the car um what i need to figure out here   is where to let me see contacts let me  contact jackie let me see what he's up to   if jackie has something for me because i'm able to  do my thing now right like i have i have upgrades   but it's it's it is what it is  uh coach fred let me go to regina because oh wait here we go all right uh catch you  later tell me about watson yeah talk about why did   you describe watson in one sentence the japanese  built kabuki but the chinese live there mostly   north side is to be played  in chrome that makes sense   we have an entire what i need right now is to  steal money you know what all that comes out to   one sentence is never enough that's what i need to  draw some cash man all right i'll catch you later   so this is what i'm gonna do right now i guess i  want to catch someone right who is this can i talk   to somebody here what up oh got him party yo you  but yo oh wait hold on hold on all right so i just   i i just upped up my steep my street cred come on  come on come on come on there we go there we go   nothing left nothing left you still alive homie  ye all right there we go can i can i steal some   yash all right uh ricochet weapons all right well  whatever i can get out of this is better for me   let me pick this body up here i'm gonna  bring her back home no i'm just kidding   uh can i dump her in the dumpster by any chance  let me let me let me just dump her like right   back here can i can i do that oh did i blow  her hand i blew io i blew both of her hands off   okay all right uh but does this  pay off our depth no it does not okay well we did what we did i'm just trying to  loot to see i mean i i just can't believe i just   robbed some homeless gangsters right and didn't  even have much either so that's that's what sucks   uh i don't need my vehicle let me go into  my let me go into my inventory real quick   i still have 300 beans all right well is this  the subway station it looks like it make it   [ __ ] out of my oh punched her right in the  face and she even go down the mechanics for this   game are kind of weird not gonna lie uh paid  in full i have to pay this man in full right   i just don't know how to pay him because it's  like all right well what the hell do i do right   so i i guess this entire episode oh yes hello stay  right there don't move don't move psych all right   crime report oh they reported me for a crime  oh that's whoa okay time for us to skedaddle   oh i i i didn't even know that i i didn't even  think they could ride here they can actually   rat you out like that all right so being  the fact that i'm 50 years into the future   does this mean by any chance they're able to track  me via oh boy that they're able to track me via   some tracker locator or something like that right  i just want to know only because let me see if i   can just oh [ __ ] there are cops everywhere  there are cops everywhere homie i just need   to i just need to figure out how to get back to  this place real quick and hide it out let me see   these alleyways are so clean though like you  know what i'm saying there we go there's no   way they can find me now i'm already down  here i have i have one star so that's good all right let me see can i i still can't pay any  of my debts off which sucks let me ask about this   can't complain corporals learned to keep their  distance and soccer's back hiring alone mercs they   all gotta have newest shiniest implants oh wait  a minute good thing you got misty here to help   could have swore i heard cops outside yeah right  now their shops the best decision i ever made   all right seems like you're the only person  in night city who's happy with this lot   you get to a certain age there's cops outside  i can hear them this gets easier from there   well it looks like i can't initiate my  my protocol of paying this man back so   i guess i'm gonna have to go back outside  however i don't want to go back outside so   can i wear like this hazmat suit like can  i wear something this is gonna get crazy   hopefully i don't have the uh the one star  outside let's find let's find out shall we   oh it's gone look at that we shot a few people  and then that's that oh who the hell is this   whoa yo yo who who are you i'm standing  here oh whoa whoa what you mean   what you mean i i didn't even do anything oh  hell no this dude looking for a yo you looking   for smoke on me that's right that's right that's  right that's right oh oh crap this is not good   yo who are these people back up back  up i'm gonna pop you and your homie   yo i i i didn't even want to run i didn't  even want to run up on this dude man   oh i gotta get the hell out of here oh where  they shooting me from are they shooting me   from all angles oh this is bad wait a minute what  just happened oh the damn security thing got me   okay i wasn't even expecting that flat line load  from last checkpoint oh that was that was pretty   clean though i mean the combat system is kind of  like all right but i i guess if you're looking for   uh an exclusive gta s kind of game you ain't gonna  find it here but i'll tell you this much though   the civilians and the criminals are like heavily  armed right they have like they have suits they   have armor they have all types of stuff so that's  kind of interesting i mean i i guess this isn't   your you know like you're the only person in night  city who's happy with this type of stuff you get   to a certain age you drop all your illusions life  just gets easier from there of course it does   all right so i guess i'm just gonna bounce talk  to jackie all right there we go i finally get   to talk to you all it really took was for me  to die in order for me to talk to jackie all   right where is jackie your heart chocolate what  up homie out of whack babe i can really what is   she doing to him but you'd have to watch out for  negative energy fields and avoid mean negative   energy like like omega shenron negative energy  talk to dex while you were in with the dock   he's waiting on this ride for you ain't gonna  hop to where he's parked next to gramsci burgers   okay ramsey burgers to talk us up show yourself  all right i mean uh what the hell what what is   happening here what does regina want delicate  matter what is he sitting on cyber psycho attacks   in the city is on the rise now that's probably  not news to you but this issue matters to me   for a few reasons okay there are people  who say cyberpsychosis can be treated right   cyberpsychosis but i believe even an unproven  therapy is still better than a bullet to the   brain if i get it that's true that's true  what the hell what the hell is this titties look at his i hope that's all clear all  right incapacitate the uh   the the person okay let's see uh non-lethal  weapons not like the takedowns well i mean   i'm a very lethal person right i want to get up in  this and i want to be able to take someone out by   smoking them you know what i'm saying all right oh  crap we got we got rick ross in here bro all right   what's up thank you for letting me in the vehicle  oh not a nice way of opening the doors oh this man   got some logan paul money up in here what's good  oh look at this dude a pleasure next to this flesh oh crap we outta here mind if i ask  you something right off the bank   go ahead would you rather live in pieces mr nobody  die right old and smelling slightly of urine or go   down for all times in a blaze of glory smelling  near like posies without seeing your thirtieth   uh i mean first place no  place dex cost isn't a factor   classic so he's trying to  ask me if i'm trying to die   a warrior or what respect no way okay sorry  all right all right listen close scanning all right what's the job what's the job what's  the job homie prototype tech a biochip prototype it's not that simple the last time i thought  it was simple i almost got called by the cops   or i did arasaka surely that was soccer   okay well i mean it's not all that good special  treatment [ __ ] you ain't playing around   you got a feeling this could be a start  of a beautiful friendship built on yo this all right so again it's it's another mission of  me trying to steal something and getting caught   watch she wants to parlay with one of the team   okay this shouldn't be that hard but let's just  let's just see got a beef it's not in the shot oh what is that it's a shard it's another shard  what is with this game in like tech bro it's   insane two weeks back jumped a militech convoy  got away with the gear corp don't even know male   streams involved what are those like super  elites like you saw that convoy was carrying   the flat head a little combat bot a prototype  and i need me that bit of high grade military   this is wacky as hell get that body we  don't get no soccer chip and we sure as   hell don't get no happily ever after but don't  get excited so we need that soccer chip then okay   nah i flat out people these these criminals  they're not even just by the yourself   of brick i say win because brick was the  leader three days after we'd sealed our deal   his friend he was leader one simon randle  aka royce plane dropped his ass oh wow royce   dropped him and i got no way of knowing  if he aims to honor his predecessor's word   to actually kill britain of course that's  not criminal [ __ ] interesting convoy   all right uh who's the woman corporal agent  internal affairs been skidding around town   asking after oh she's an agent all right  depending on finding it this is like something   she's got zip ties some [ __ ] double oh seven  [ __ ] that we're about to pull right you guys   ain't growing any shorter so she must be getting  desperate people to think all right of course   to do so you'll need that frazzled cat's info  sending it now client all right let me let me   get the info on her why she need to meet woman's  name's evelyn parker veterinary wasn't easy   put the word out i was looking for any kind of  intel right and yo this this entire street this   entire like world

and  like i don't even know what the this whole thing   is i mean this world is pretty nutty everyone's  all bioed up biotech this woman's probably   like she's like she's probably the only one that
