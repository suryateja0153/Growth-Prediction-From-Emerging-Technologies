 This is the very first project of its kind, not just at a university but anywhere. You’ll see a lot of blockchain, supply chain projects things tracking like a part going through the supply chain or food or whatever. The thing that we’re doing that’s unique is we’re tracking every single individual item. These are the very first items in that new wave of retail tracking. This coat that you’re going to see, these shoes that you’re going to see, this is the first time that we’ve been able to transfer that item information all the way through the supply chain, through this blockchain project. We worked with Nike, PVH Corp., Herman Kay, Macy’s and Kohl’s, and they all work to contribute data from different points in their supply chains, whether that was from manufacturing or distribution or in stores. CHIP is a great example of the work that we do here at the university that we’re putting into practice. Now in this case, working with a lot of great companies, but ultimately it will impact the consumer. You. And the way that we get the product to you, to ensure that you get the right product at the right time, and that that product is safe and secure and of high quality.
