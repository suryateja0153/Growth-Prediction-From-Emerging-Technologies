 The brain is the most complex organ in the human body. But we need to understand its complexity if we are to develop effective treatments for conditions such as Parkinson's Disease. If we can mimic neural activity using technology essentially developing a brain-on-a-chip We can better understand the progression of these conditions, and we're not talking about silicon chips here, these are microfluidic chips. Small, transparent devices with even smaller micro channels that allow tiny drops of liquid to be visualized and processed. Brain-on-a-chip will offer an entirely new approach to personalized medicine. It can even one day allow treatment plans to be tested on your very own brain-on-a-chip to predict how you would respond to different therapies. Staying at the absolute leading edge of technology innovation requires us to be constantly refreshing and introducing new tech capabilities. This is the work of our Strategic Technology Group. Brain-on-a-chip is one of the many emerging technologies that we're exploring here at Cambridge Consultants.
