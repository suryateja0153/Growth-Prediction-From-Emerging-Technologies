 welcome back a 140 million dollar government contract is under question right now the Defense Department says it's to acquire syringes for kovat vaccines but claims online are questioning why the syringes have trackers in them well we had our verify team look into the claims here's our Jason Puckett with more there are two articles that we're focusing on this one in natural news.com and this one in Breaking Israel news.com both talked about a government contract to buy syringes with RFID tracking for kovat vaccinations now these articles led to social media posts claiming the covert vaccine will contain a chip to track you so let's verify will vaccine syringes inject you with an RFID chip our sources the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Defense and app eject systems America a syringe manufacturer so there is one nugget of truth in these claims the DoD and DHHS did enter a 138 million dollar contract with companies to order syringes quote for combatting Kovan 19 when a safe and proven vaccine becomes available but that's where the truth ends the claims say these syringes contain microchips and they point to the manufacturers websites as proof only problem the manufacturers don't say that the project page for these syringes talks about RFID tags under the label of the syringes put another way if the trackers are on the outside of these syringes they aren't injected with the vaccine or even in contact with the actual vaccine meaning any claims that these government vaccines will inject trackers are false if you've got other claims like these for us to look into you send us an email with your verify i'm jason puckett
