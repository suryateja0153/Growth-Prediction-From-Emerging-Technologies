 nano robotics are an emerging technology field creating machines or robots whose components are at or near the scale of a nanometer 10 - 9 meters more specifically nano robotics as opposed to micro robotics refers to the nanotechnology engineering discipline of designing and building nano robots with devices ranging in size from 0.1 to 10 micrometers and constructed of nano scale or molecular components the terms nano bot monoid nanite nano machine or nano might have also been used to describe such devices currently under research and development nano machines are largely in the research and development phase but some primitive molecular machines and nano motors have been tested an example is a sensor having a switch approximately 1.5 nanometers across able to count specific molecules in a chemical sample the first useful applications of nano machines may be in nano medicine for example biological machines could be used to identify and destroy cancer cells another potential application is the detection of toxic chemicals and the measurement of their concentrations in the environment Rice University has demonstrated a single molecule car developed by a chemical process in including buckminsterfullerene buckyballs for wheels it is actuated by controlling the environmental temperature and by positioning a scanning tunneling microscope tip another definition is a robot that allows precise interactions with nanoscale objects or can manipulate with nanoscale resolution such devices are more related to microscopy or scanning probe microscopy instead of the description of nano robots as molecular machines using the microscopy definition even a large apparatus such as an atomic force microscope can be considered a nano robotic instrument when configured to perform nano manipulation for this viewpoint macro scale robots or micro robots that can move with nano scale precision can also be considered nano robots topic nano robotics theory according to richard fineman it was his former graduate student and collaborator albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him circa 1959 the idea of a medical use for fineman's theoretical micromachines seem a no machine hip suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would in theory be possible to as Fineman put it swallow the surgeon the idea was incorporated into fineman's 1959 sa there's plenty of room at the bottom since nanorobots would be microscopic in size it would probably be necessary for very large numbers of them to work together to perform microscopic and macroscopic tasks these nano robots warms both those unable to replicate as in utility fog and those able to replicate and constrain idli in the natural environment as in gray goo and synthetic biology are found in many science fiction stories such as the Borg nanoprobes in Star Trek in the Outer Limits episode the new breed some proponents of nano robotics in reaction to the great GU scenarios that they earlier helped to propagate hold the view that nano robots able to replicate outside of a restricted factory environment do not form a necessary part of a purported productive nanotechnology and that the process of self replication where it ever to be developed could be made inherently safe they further assert that their current plans for developing and using molecular manufacturing do not in fact include free foraging replicators the most detailed theoretical discussion of nano robotics including specific design issues such as sensing power communication navigation manipulation locomotion and onboard computation has been presented in the medical context of nano medicine by Robert Freitas some of these discussions remain at the level of unbuildable generality and do not approach the level of detailed engineering topic legal and ethical implications you topic open technology a document with a proposal on nano biotech development using open design technology methods as in open source hardware and open source software has been addressed to the United Nations General Assembly according to the document sent to the United Nations in the same way that open source has in recent years accelerated the development of computer systems a similar approach should benefit the society at large and accelerate nano robotics development the use of nano biotechnology should be established as a human heritage for the coming generations and developed as an open technology based on ethical practices for peaceful purposes open technology is stated as a fundamental key for such an aim topic nano robot race in the same ways that technology research and development drove the space race and nuclear arms race a race for nano robots is occurring there is plenty of ground allowing nano robots to be included among the emerging technologies some of the reasons are that large corporations such as General Electric hewlett-packard synopsis Northrop Grumman and Siemens have been recently working in the development and research of nano robots surgeons are getting involved and starting to propose ways to apply nano robots for common medical procedures universities and research institutes were granted funds by government agencies exceeding two billion dollars towards research developing nano devices for medicine bankers are also strategically investing with the intent to acquire beforehand rights and royalties on future nano robots commercialization some aspects of nano robot litigation and related issues linked to monopolies have already arisen a large number of patents has been granted recently on nano robots done mostly for patent agents companies specialized solely on building patent portfolios and lawyers after a long series of patents and eventually litigations see for example the invention of radio or the war of currents emerging fields of technology tend to become a monopoly which normally is dominated by large corporations topic manufacturing approaches Manufacturing nanomachines assembled from molecular components is a very challenging task because of the level of difficulty many engineers and scientists continue working cooperatively across multidisciplinary approaches to achieve breakthroughs in this new area of development thus it is quite understandable the importance of the following distinct techniques currently applied towards manufacturing nano robots topic biochip the joint use of nanoelectronics photo lithography and new biomaterials provides a possible approach to manufacturing nano robots for common medical uses such as surgical instrumentation diagnosis and drug delivery this method for manufacturing on nanotechnology scale is in use in the electronics industry since 2008 so practical nano robots should be integrated as nano electronics devices which will allow teleoperation and advanced capabilities for medical instrumentation topic new BOTS a nucleic acid robot new Bart is an organic molecular machine at the nano scale DNA structure can provide means to assemble 2d and 3d nano mechanical devices DNA based machines can be activated using small molecules proteins and other molecules of DNA biological circuit gates based on DNA materials have been engineered as molecular machines to allow in vitro drug delivery for targeted health problems such material based systems would work most closely to smart biomaterial drug system delivery while not allowing precise in vivo teleoperation of such engineered prototypes topic surface bound systems several reports have demonstrated the attachment of synthetic molecular motors to surfaces these primitive nano machines have been shown to undergo machine like motions when confined to the surface of a macroscopic material the surface anchored motors could potentially be used to move and position nanoscale materials on a surface in the manner of a conveyor belt topic positional nano assembly nanofactory collaboration founded by Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle in 2000 and involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries focuses on developing a practical research agenda specifically aimed at developing positionally controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and ad I'm annoyed nanofactory that would have the capability of building diamond Doig medical nano robots topic bio hybrids the emerging field of bio hybrid systems combines biological and synthetic structural elements for biomedical or robotic applications the constituting elements of bio nano electromechanical systems by own um's are of nanoscale size for example DNA proteins or nano structured mechanical parts file ena beam resist allow the direct writing of nanoscale features followed by the functionalization of the natively reactive resist surface with biomolecules other approaches use a biodegradable material attached to magnetic particles that allow them to be guided around the body topic bacteria based this approach proposes the use of biological microorganisms like the bacterium Escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium uses a flagellum for propulsion purposes electromagnetic fields normally control the motion of this kind of biological integrated device chemists at the University of Nebraska have created a humidity gauge by fusing a bacterium to a silicon computer chip topic virus based retroviruses can be retrained to attach to cells and replace DNA they go through a process called reverse transcription to deliver genetic packaging in a vector usually these devices are pole gag genes of the virus for the capsid and delivery system this process is called retro viral gene therapy having the ability to re-engineer cellular DNA by usage of viral vectors this approach has appeared in the form of retro viral adenoviral and lentiviral gene delivery systems these gene therapy vectors have been used in cats to send genes into the genetically modified organism GMO causing it to display the trait topic 3d printing 3d printing is the process by which a three-dimensional structure is built through the various processes of additive manufacturing nano scale 3d printing involves many of the same process incorporated at a much smaller scale to print a structure in the 5 to 400 micrometer scale the precision of the 3d printing machine is improved greatly a two steps process of 3d printing using a 3d printing and laser etched plates method was incorporated as an improvement technique to be more precise at a nano scale the 3d printing process uses a laser etching machine which etches into each plate the details needed for the segment of nano robot the plate is then transferred to the 3d printer which fills the etched regions with the desired nanoparticle the 3d printing process is repeated until the nano robot is built from the bottom up this 3d printing process has many benefits first it increases the overall accuracy of the printing process second it has the potential to create functional segments of a nano robot the 3d printer uses a liquid resin which is hardened at precisely the correct spots by a focused laser beam the focal point of the laser beam is guided through the resin by moveable mirrors and leaves behind a hardened line of solid polymer just a few hundred nanometers wide this fine resolution enables the creation of intricately structured sculptures as tiny as a grain of sand this process takes place by using photoactive resins which are hardened by the laser at an extremely small scale to create the structure this process is quick by nano scale 3d printing standards ultra small features can be made with the 3d micro fabrication technique used in multiphoton photo polymerization this approach uses a focused laser to trace the desired 3d object into a block of gel due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation the Elle is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away feature sizes of under 100 nanometers are easily produced as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts topic potential uses you topic nanomedicine potential uses for nano robotics in medicine include early diagnosis and targeted drug delivery for cancer biomedical instrumentation surgery pharmacokinetics monitoring of diabetes and healthcare in such plans future medical nanotechnology is expected to employ nano robots injected into the patient to perform work at a cellular level such nano robots intended for use in medicine should be non-replicating as replication would needlessly increase device complexity reduce reliability and interfere with the medical mission nanotechnology provides a wide range of new technologies for developing customized means to optimize the delivery of pharmaceutical drugs today harmful side-effects of treatments such as chemotherapy are commonly a result of drug delivery methods that don't pinpoint their intended target cells accurately researchers at Harvard and MIT however have been able to attach special RNA strands measuring nearly 10 nanometers in diameter to nanoparticles filling them with a chemotherapy drug these RNA strands are attracted to cancer cells when the nanoparticle encounters a cancer cell it adheres to it and releases the drug into the cancer cell this directed method of drug delivery has great potential for treating cancer patients while avoiding negative effects commonly associated with improper drug delivery the first demonstration of nano motors operating in living organism was carried out in 2014 at University of California San Diego MRI guided nano capsules are one potential precursor to nano robots another useful application of nano robots is assisting in the repair of tissue cells alongside white blood cells recruiting inflammatory cells or white blood cells which include neutrophil granulocytes lymphocytes monocytes and mast cells to the affected area is the first response of tissues to injury because of their small size nano BOTS could attach themselves to the surface of recruited white cells to squeeze their way out through the walls of blood vessels and arrive at the injury site where they can assist in the tissue repair process certain substances could possibly be used to accelerate the recovery the science behind this mechanism is quite complex passage of cells across the blood endothelium a process known as transmigration is a mechanism involving engagement of cell surface receptors to adhesion molecules active force exertion and dilation of the vessel walls and physical deformation of the migrating cells by attaching themselves to migrating inflammatory cells the robots can in effect hitch a ride across the blood vessels bypassing the need for a complex transmigration mechanism of their own as of 2016 in the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA regulates nanotechnology on the basis of size suit ik beetle during his doctoral research at the University of Texas San Antonio developed nano composite particles that are controlled remotely by an electromagnetic field this series of nano robots that are now enlisted in the Guinness world record can be used to interact with the biological cells scientists suggests that this technology can be used for the treatment of cancer topic cultural references the nanites are characters on the TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000 the self-replicating bioengineered organisms that work on the ship and reside in the sol computer systems they made their first appearance in season eight nanites are used in a number of episodes in the Netflix series travelers they are programmed and injected into injured people to perform repairs topic see you also molecular machine nano
