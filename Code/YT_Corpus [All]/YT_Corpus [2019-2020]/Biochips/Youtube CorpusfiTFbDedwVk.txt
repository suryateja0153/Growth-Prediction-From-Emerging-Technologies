assessment strategies and protective equipment so today he will talk about a wearable microsystem for direct management of multi-voc worker exposure so please join me and welcome dr zeller okay well thank you sun kun for the introduction and um hello everyone uh thanks for coming to my talk uh since sun kun gave you the title here uh i'll just uh sort of fill it in with these subtitles so um what i'm gonna tell you about here is is a project that really represents essentially the culmination of about 20 years of work in my group and the types of microsystems that we're talking about are gas chromatographic microsystems gcs and we make the components of these systems using uh microfabrication techniques um on silicon chips so one sort of pet name for this area of research is gc on a chip and our pet name for the prototypes that i'll be telling you about is given here personal exposure monitoring microsystems or pem i want to acknowledge my co-authors right away here and i i listed them with different colors to sort of over emphasize the fact that in order to do this kind of work you really require deep expertise in a number of different areas so ehs is my home department but i also am appointed in chemistry and i have had chemistry phd students working on the project i had a student from applied physics because i'm also affiliated with that program and then we have collaborators not only in mechanical engineering but also in electrical engineering and then one of my former students willie steineker graduated some years ago and started a company and so we collaborated with him to build the prototypes that i'll show you uh and then as seonkyoung pointed out i've been affiliated with the center for wireless integrated micro sensing in systems uh for a long time i had a leadership role in that uh center and uh without that uh that affiliation none of this work would have been possible so here's my outline i'll provide a few introductory remarks just to put the work in context give you a quick tutorial on gas chromatography and a quick snapshot of some of the other work uh here at michigan that's going on parallel efforts in gc on a chip work uh and then focus on um two prototypes mostly on the generation two uh prototype of pem and uh go into the components and lab characterizations and then focus on the power that comes from using sensor arrays as detectors in these instruments and then a quick discussion of our first results from mock field testing so this can be a pretty technical talk and hopefully it'll uh retain your interest so uh vocs are uh ubiquitous uh we're we're breathing them all the time uh both outside and inside and in fact all of us are generating vocs and exhaling them polluting the air if you will because we produce them as part of normal metabolism luckily the concentrations we generate are are very low so no health effects and no discernible significant air pollution and of course in the workplace we run into vocs uh in different uh operations and it's here in the workplace that i'm going to focus my talk um and so in the workplace by virtue of the processes involved and the regulations we generally run into vocs in the the concentration range listed here maybe two to three orders of magnitude you'll run into in the workplace from ppb to ppm and then uh collectively the health effects uh that are ascribable to exposure to vocs they really run the entire gamut of health effects that one can encounter in the environment from rather mild narcosis cns effects respiratory tract irritation to more serious systemic health effects such as cancer and reproductive one of the challenges we face in doing exposure assessment or instrument building as i'll talk about is that you rarely you rarely encounter vocs alone as individual compounds but rather in mixtures and the complexity of the mixture can range from relatively simple just a few or a handful to literally hundreds of compounds at once so here are just some images of work situations work processes where uh exposure to voc mixtures would be encountered luckily in this country and in most developed countries we have organizations that help to set standards or limits to exposure and in this country the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists is one of the primary organizations we rely on to set guideline values or limits and these are called the threshold limit values or tlvs these are reviewed annually and so they publish a booklet and i hear this is the 2020 version of it and i've just picked a couple or a few common vocs here to enlisted their tlvs and you can see they're they're actually pretty high by by in exposure standards in the tens to hundreds of ppm some are much lower and some are actually a bit higher than that but these are sort of typical uh one of the overriding uh points to make though is that um in order to demonstrate compliance with guidelines like these and by the way these complement the osha standards that we have that are the legal limits uh and and all of these organizations mandate that you collect personal exposures meaning exposure measurements from devices that are worn by the worker and this is in recognition of the uh uh spatial and temporal variability in uh the concentrations of vocs that can occur in the workplace and that the only way to capture what a person's exposed to is to actually put the the device on their body and so this is a an important point for us so whether we're talking about regulations guidelines compliance with these regulations or we're talking about epidemiologic studies looking at health effects trying to establish risk estimates associated with exposure to certain chemicals uh we really need to know what is out there and how much and and so the term speciated analysis is used here to predict to indicate that you want to know exactly which compounds you're being exposed to and and you really have to do this quantitatively and so the the complexity of that challenge is uh sort of embodied in the fact that the standard method that we use in the workplace to assess exposures is really relatively old-fashioned so here's a picture of a worker guy and he's wearing a personal sampling pump and then his uh he's it's connected to a sorbent tube that he's clipped to his lapel in his breathing zone and so uh we would sample air for several hours or perhaps the whole working day of eight hours and then send the uh the sampler tubes off to the lab and that would be analyzed by by an instrument such as this bench scale gas chromatograph in the lab and and so we get integrated exposure measurements if we think about uh technology and trying to uh do this with instruments at one end of the spectrum are instruments like these these are handheld um and to to do the voc measurements both of these use photo ionization detectors this is a multi-gas detector but the other gases it detects are inorganic gases not vocs and then there are other handheld instruments some that use photoionization or metal oxide semiconductor but the point is they have a single sensor there's no selectivity they provide total voc or tvoc a composite measure and so they have limited utility for the applications we have in mind up here at the other end of the spectrum are much more uh much larger and more sophisticated instruments such as these two portable gas chromatograph mass spectrometers these are portable and then there's a 48 transform infrared spectrophotometer that can provide speciated quantitative analysis of voc mixtures but as you can see they're quite large uh they're very expensive this is a 50 000 this is close to a hundred thousand dollars to get into the field so they're not they're not suitable for routine deployment uh sensor networks or in our case what we're particularly interested in is a wearable monitoring microsystem so there's a technology gap here and this is what we view as the the sort of the place the niche that we're looking to fill with our gc based microsystems that employ micro sensor array detectors and those detectors are important so to drive this point home here is a hypothetical exposure profile here concentration versus time for three arbitrarily chosen vocs and the point is that with regards to personal exposure monitoring it's not possible to get this information from any technology that exists so here's a quick primer on how a gas chromatograph works every gc has three basic components an injector a column and a detector and then there has to be some sort of carrier gas that can be pressurized and and so a typical column would have a length of 30 meters in a bench scale instrument and a typical detector would be a photo or flame ionization detector so to go into a little bit more detail you know the heart of any gc system is the column and i've shown that in cartoon form here typical columns are of capillary dimension to about 100 to 250 microns in diameter and they will have a thin wall coating of a polymer called a stationary phase and then you inject your mixture of vocs which i've represented by these different shapes and colors shown here and i've assigned them names but these are of course uh uh arbitrary um and i'm showing a cartoon syringe here there are other ways to inject through a loop or through a pre-concentrator so you inject them as a bolus here together as a composite and then under the uh pressure or flow provided by the carrier gas they will be pushed down the column and then as they do so they will reversibly partition into the wall coding of the polymer and they'll do that thousands or hundreds of thousands of times depending on the length of the column and since most chemicals have different structures or volatility they will have different partition coefficients and that leads to different retention factors so that if your column is long enough you will be able to separate these in in space or in time if you will so that by the time they get to the end of the column your detector will see them as separated peaks like this and with a single channel detector like this the the only way to tell what the compound is is by its retention time the point at which it comes out of the column and then to tell how much is there you have to integrate the area under these peaks and so one metric for the for the separation is the resolution the change in the difference in retention time over the peak width a typical stationary phases are pdms polydimethylcyloxane that's sort of the the standard basic go-to column and of course longer columns yield better separations and as i say the benchmark here is 30 meters so um here at michigan as i alluded to earlier uh ma the the center for wireless integrated microsystems has been in existence since the since the year 2000 and we got some big funding from nsf back then to work on gc technology and so we had a lot of investigators doing so um and this was sort of our working diagram so you can look at this as sort of the archetype of the analytical system layout of a universal whims gas chromatograph i've highlighted here the fact that although most of the scaling laws for gc are favorable as you miniaturize one place where that is not the case is in the length of column that you can support in an inherently micro system so typical uh column lengths will max out at about six meters as opposed to the 30 that i was referring to for the bench scale so we have to work on uh making up for that uh sort of inherent deficiency so there are the the three key components to negc are represented by these cartoon icons here um the injector also serves in this case for this you know portable instruments that we're going to deploy in the field also as a sampler so it serves two functions and we call that the pre-concentrator focuser or micro pcf and all the and then the separation module is shown here and then here is the detector and for our detector we use an array of of chemical sensors called chemi resistors so let me just uh walk you through this so any uh any analysis requires two steps we first have to capture a sample so if we have our voc mixture out here in the environment we have an onboard miniature pump that will draw samples into the system and across this pre-concentrator focuser which is typically packed with adsorbent materials it can be single or multi-stage and we capture all of the vocs on this so we have to sample a certain volume of air to capture enough mass so that we can exceed the detection limits of the chemi resistor array and then we reverse the direction of flow we'll heat very rapidly so that we desorb the vapors on the pre-concentrator and inject them into the separation module represented by these two sort of convolved square spirals here one of the key metrics of a pre-concentrator is not only its capacity but also the second one is it's injection sharpness so it's that's an important feature to keep in mind and so uh to make up for the fact that we have relatively short columns uh with microsystems we can play all sorts of tricks now some systems just have a single column but some of the systems we've developed have two columns and we can put two different stationary phases represent represented by the co uh the colors here so a non-polar in a polar stationary phase will have complementary separation characteristics and that can enhance performance we can also temperature program them here at different rates using onboard micro heaters and that adds versatility and then for some of our systems we've incorporated a modulator at the midpoint where we can actually cryogenically freeze and then ballistically heat and re-inject compounds coming out of the first column into the second column to enhance the separation capabilities so we have built systems with all of these and i'll be talking about one system that that has some of these components to it so the point is we do our best job of separation uh present the uh hopefully separated compounds to the detector as i said we use an array of detectors or sensors called chemi resistors and i've presented here just the four traces from the multiple sensors that would be in there and uh what you'll notice is we get a chromatogram a trace from each one of the sensors but by incorporating selectivity into the chemi resistor we can actually get different responses from each of the channels in this for different compounds and the way we do that is to deposit layers of what we call mpn's or monolayer protected nanoparticles onto the different chemi resistors and these are just gold nanoparticles with self-assembled monolayers on the surface that are functionalized differently so that they give rise to different responses in the sensors so if we look at any one retention time corresponding to any one compound you can get a crude pattern here or a spectrum if you will that can sort of serve to identify the compound and differentiate it from others that might be eluding nearby or even co-eluding as i'll talk about later so it's a combination of potentially selective pre-concentration the inherent selectivity of separation and then the added selectivity of response patterns that we combine in our systems to get this goal of reliable multi-voc analysis and of course there are a ton of applications that would benefit from this kind of capability and we've explored many of these over the years in my research group and the one i'm going to focus on today is is human and particularly worker exposure monitoring now our group is not the only group to be working on gc here at michigan and i want to acknowledge one of my colleagues professor gyanchandani and then another colleague professor fan and then another colleague professor kurobayashi who were all working uh on their own parallel paths to uh to this uh image here so this image um was one that we developed early on in the whim center as being our sort of iconic uh vision for our our work on developing micro gc we wanted it to be pocket sized and to be able to analyze um voc mixtures of arbitrary composition complexity and concentration so that was our ultimate goal and over the years we've produced a lot of prototypes that are attempting to to do that in in one way or another and so this is just the latest set of prototypes what i'm going to focus on today are pem 1 and pen 2 and particularly pem2 and we've we've published papers on these recently in the literature okay so uh here's the worker guy that i showed you before i found out that his name is actually chuck um and so this is the model we started with and our vision was to be able to put a an instrument on the on the belt of a worker that could get the kind of analysis speciated quantitative analyses they talked about before so we wanted to be belt mounted battery-powered and autonomous so we approached this problem in basically two phases the multi-year phases the first one involved the generation one pem prototype which is shown here all the key analytical components are shown here the intention was that it would serve as a test bed for the gen 2 wearable this one is not battery operated operates on mains power and you can see here's our pre-concentrator focuser in this system we had two columns in series and uh we had the chemi resistor array that i'm abbreviating with with that and then a whole bunch of valves and pumps and other components uh none of these were pre or micro fabricated in our system um and uh we used a laptop with labview control and just you know we learned lessons from this and uh made mistakes and figured out how to optimize the analysis so here's an image halfway through the build of the instrument and we we did all of the building here in-house much of the design you send out for pre printed circuit boards but we designed them in-house and this thing's about nine inches wide by about five inches deep by about five inches tall and you can see this is the finished instrument next to a desktop computer keyboard so it's a little narrower and actually a little uh shorter or less deep but a little bit taller and these are a couple of columns here all of the analytical components are on the top and all the support stuff is is here on the bottom so this was used to uh then allow us to move on to the gen 2 prototype and that's shown schematically here we used a very similar pre-concentrator focuser design some subtle changes uh same thing with the chemi resistor array and then we did a pretty big redesign on the columns though essentially similar in terms of their capability i'll say more about that in just a minute so then we got together with my former student willie uh steinecker who uh started this company vgc chromatography and then it's he's got a sort of a subsidiary called tcm global and they came up with this con concept diagram that incorporated all the components and then they ultimately built this is the very first prototype that came off the line i showed here on a scale i should have shown the weight it's about two kilograms so about four pounds this is the size and then we had battery power and the initial uh power requirement was about 11 watts uh we got that cut in half actually ultimately and we have a microcontroller on board here and so um no one else was willing to stand up and serve as the spokes model for the for the money shot here uh so i got called upon to do that and so this is our first prototype the very first day we picked it up down at willy's place in ohio you can see it's a little too large but really not bad for our first prototype so what i want to do now is walk you through the details of each of the key components of the system and and hopefully uh convey to you the the the time and effort and thought that went into the design of these so what you're seeing here in the upper right is an image of our pcf pre-concentrator focuser these are actually two separate devices but they were shown here to show the the top view and then the bottom view this is the heater uh films on the back of the of the device it has two cavities that are etched into it using microfabrication techniques these are silicon chips with glass cover plates on them and we use two different adsorbents these are commercially available graphitized carbons one's carbo pack b the other one carbo pack x they have two different uh specific surface areas and here's an uh micrograph image of what they look like they're irregular carbon solids and we use two different uh surface areas because we want to distribute the vocs across two different strengths of absorbance so the surface area determines the strength for the less volatile compounds we want to capture them on a lower surface area for the more volatile ones we need a higher surface area and then we load in one direction and then inject in the other direction and we use capillaries for the interconnects here here are some stats on the size and then the amount of mass of each so very small you know a few milligrams is not very much and then the flow rates for loading and desorption and then in order to get the sharp injections i'll tell you in about in a minute we have to heat at exceedingly high rates so this is very high heating rate and we're able to do that because these are so small and we can dump a whole bunch of voltage across them so there are two functions served here the trap and the release and so for trapping we had to make some concessions but we decided that we would do selective trapping and the selectivity would be based on volatility and so we picked a volatility window that we defined as being uh uh less volatile than 13 kilopascals now if you're not familiar with vapor pressures in these units uh that's about that's the vapor pressure of benzene so that's our uh actually high cutoff in terms of volatility and then we also needed to pre-trap out the very heavy compounds and we define that as a dodecahen here which has this vapor pressure so that's our vapor pressure window and in order to determine how this functions we had to run some tests and so you're seeing here some breakthrough curves so this is uh we we expose the device to steady atmospheres of each of a whole bunch of chemicals either individually or in mixtures and see how long we can go without seeing it come out the the other end and so we found that for benzene which is our benchmark compound we could sample 30 milliliters of air without seeing significant breakthrough by which i mean 10 of the challenge concentration coming through so there's lots of lighter compounds here more volatile ones that we are not going to capture either at all or only partially and we're not claiming to do quantitative analysis of those but anything less volatile than benzene would fall out here and we can do quite well in trapping that quantitatively so that's one way to define uh one end of the uh of the performance uh spectrum for this device then of course we have to be able to inject these efficiently so that's another criterion and by that i mean we need to get it all off no residues and then try to inject it in as sharp a band as possible at a flow rate that's consistent with separations on the gc column and that's three mils a minute for us and so we found that we couldn't do that very well without implementing a technique called split flow injection where we would pass a higher flow through the the pre-concentrator and then just tap off uh two-thirds of it and vent it and then send the rest of it to the gc column and so in this way we were able to get uh peak widths that were for injection that were less than one second for all of the compounds in our range and particularly good for benzene i should say that our we've done a more recent project where we've been able to divide to get this down by about five fold down to under 200 milliseconds of injection for something like benzene but for this prototype this is as good as we did and then uh this shows a chromatogram from a bench scale gc with a long column and a flame ionization detector here you can see the peaks are really nicely shaped and that's partially an indication of how well we're injecting in particular the early eluding compounds here one through seven we're getting even partial resolution of these these are the tough ones to separate and these are the ones that really drive the sharpness of the injection band because some of these others don't really require the sharpness these do uh that number seven here in this test set was benzene so all these are more volatile and so this is just an indication of how well we're doing and we did quite well let me move on to talk about the columns so in our pem-1 system we had two separate columns that were three meters long each for the pem2 system we decided to explore something called zone heating and for that we created a one single monolithic column shown here top view uh and this has a total channel length of of six meters and so the the channels in our columns are similar to the capillaries that one uses in a gc bench scale gc but because of the way we create them using the etching processes they have a crop they have a rectangular cross section and for ours uh the dimensions of that were 250 240 by 150 microns we used a pdms wall coding and um so each one of these is really a two meter subsection that's interconnected with each other and so the inlet you can see barely up here from this capillary comes into the first one and the outlet from the third one is here so the flow comes in and it spirals into the center and then reverses flow and spirals out so that it connects to the second one and spirals in and out to the third one etc uh we wanted to implement this zone heating concept so we had to etch some fins or or gaps between the different subsections to get thermal isolation and so this is the top view this is the back view of the the three different heaters and then this is the concept shown here that we we were thinking we wanted to save some power save some energy uh when we thought we could inject our mixture here and have the first part heated these are cool let the compounds elute from that first section and then turn off the heater here and then heat up the second one rapidly do the separation there then turn that one off and then heat up the third one and then have them elude out the tailpipe uh this was difficult to implement we had to do some what's called band trajectory modeling and things and so you have to predict what the retention is but it worked and in the best case we got about a 30 reduction in energy which is pretty impressive uh in the end we didn't utilize this in the prototype though because it was just a little too complicated to implement finally for the detectors so i re i said before we use this chemi resistor technology and we use a an array of them and in this case we we had 10 elements in our array this shows a picture of the chip an enlargement of one of the chemi resistors and then a us quarter for for scale and what's going on is summarized here so what the chemi resistor consists of is just a series of inter-digital uh electrodes this is just metal and they're overlapping to have this overlapping finger pattern and then we deposited on the surface of those layers of these monolayer protected nanoparticles so this is like four nanometer diameter gold self-assembled monolayers with different functional groups at the tail of those monolayers now if you if you apply a voltage across here you'll drive what's called a tunneling current through the uh the film and as vapors come out of the column and they reversibly absorb and desorb that will lead to uh swelling and shrinking of the film and since the resistance of the film is exquisitely sensitive to the distance between the nanoparticles we can get really sensitive detection of vocs and so that was the approach that we took uh these are the dimensions of the electrodes in the chemi resistor we had a heater on the back side this is glass substrate and then we had a lid that had a deep reactive iot silicon channel in it with these dimensions so that the flow would only go across the detectors not these out here are the bonding pads and electronic stuff so that's our detector okay so now getting back to the sort of uh system level discussion so there are a bunch of questions you have to answer in order to make one of these instruments and then make it work and so these are some that i've kind of addressed earlier size weight power battery life and onboard control and so these were what we ended up with for our first prototype here is a picture of the prototype with the top taken off so you can see the components uh this is the pre-concentrator separation column chemi resistor array we've got these small valves commercial valves on a manifold there's another one underneath and then we decided to go with an onboard carrier gas of helium and that's a canister with a regulator there uh we had looked at systems that you just use scrubbed ambient air which is the first thing you think of but there are trade-offs with that and in particular the chromatography you can do is is kind of undermined by using air so we went with helium and we paid the price in terms of size and weight there people also asked me why don't we integrate all of these on a single chip and the reason why is that we have to you know fill or coat each one with a different material and if they're all on the same substrate that's difficult and then each of them has its own temperature requirements and there so to put them on the same chip we would have to isolate and it turns out that we it's just hard to do that and hard to do it well so those are some of the questions but there are more and so uh you know which vocs you're going to go after and how many and what are the concentrations what are the interferences and so uh this sort of catch-22 uh listed quote here is what you face and what you learn soon after trying to design an instrument and that is in order to determine what air contaminants are present and at what concentrations you need to know what air contaminants are present present and at what concentrations that seems kind of odd but it is absolutely true so an instrument like this is not going to be used to go out and test the unknown environment you have to have a stable environment where you know at least pretty well what's going to be there because you have to optimize the conditions for analysis you have to choose the right absorbance the right gc conditions for separation and then have the sensor array operating at a correct temperature and have the right sensors in it so we had to answer these questions and we picked okay if we can do 20 compounds we'll declare victory i already talked about the fact that we made a concession here to define our target chemicals as any vocs that would fall within this vapor pressure window and then by definition then interferences would comprise compounds falling outside of that vapor pressure window and then we said if we can go down to a tenth of the tlv for each of the 20 and out to two we actually went to four times the tlv uh we would say that's pretty good for doing quantitative analysis for worker exposure that would meet the goal and then how how rapid well we were able to do about once every six minutes so we we thought that that would be fast enough for the time resolution of exposures so uh jumping past pem pen one which i could talk about for the rest of the afternoon um i'm going to just jump into some our some of our early results for pem2 and we did some initial characterization testing with a a mixture of nine vocs from benzene to trimethyl benzene and uh we optimized things and we were able to get uh this kind of separation in about two minutes uh after sampling for just a half a minute at a relatively high concentration so overall analysis time of three minutes now i should have explained what i'm showing you here are the traces the chromatograms from each of four sensors in the array and these acronyms are just the names of the nanoparticles that we had on each surface and we only use about four sensors in the array because of limitations on data acquisition for the portable instrument and also you don't really need more than about four or maybe five to do the job in these so overall the peak shapes are pretty good a little bit detailing but overall pretty good not so good here but uh but overall we were pretty happy with it and we did calibrations we got really nice linear calibration curves which makes life easy and then the response patterns we got from just taking the slopes of these calibration curves and those were unique enough now in this case when you have full separation the identification capability is you might argue less important but we would argue it's extremely important because you're able to actually identify what the compound is by its response pattern and that's not currently a capability in portable instruments other than the gc mass spec we talked about before or the ftir so good linearity we had detection limits that were outstanding uh just a few nanograms which corresponds to this range of concentration for a five mil air sample uh and then i already talked about the response patterns and then we ran some short or medium term stability tests to show that yes indeed we stayed stable and that means that the patterns are stable as well um and so you know everything was good then we said okay well that's nine compounds let's push the envelope a little bit and so we took it out to 21 compounds and what you're seeing here is the collection of chromatograms uh we changed out one of the sensors here um and uh for those 21 compounds from the the same instrument i just showed you that we got for for the nine compounds and so the 21 compounds are listed here so we started at benzene ended at dodecane and like i said that was our vapor pressure window and it's about a 500 fold range of vapor pressure the conditions of sampling and analysis are given here i'm not going to go through this but i will point out that we did do that two to one injection split and i'm going to talk a little bit more about that in just a moment and you can see that again the peak shapes are pretty good the separation is pretty good but you'll notice that we have some binary overlaps here here here and here and then you'll also notice that our opa sensor kind of crapped out on us these these tailing peaks are merged and turns out it was a bad film and so this is one of the liabilities when you're dealing with these nanoparticle films is it's a real art to cast them and to get them to stick to the surface and behave so this this kind of misbehave a little bit but to push the uh story further i'm going to focus on this sensor the eoe sensor channel um and this was the uh chromatogram that i just showed you just reproduced here and it this was with a 2 1 split and so as i said one of the problems we face is that we don't have uh perfect uh separation we have either full or partial overlap here so to be able to identify which and how much of the of each of these binary mixtures so to speak are present we have a problem but here's where the chemi resistor array comes in so if we look at any pair of these partially overlapped compounds we have the four channels of response that yield these these patterns and so the first pair here happens to be tricholoethylene and heptane and you can see just by visual inspection that the response patterns are quite different and by using quantifying that using principal component analysis we're able to show quantitatively in in pc space so to speak these projections here that the patterns are very different and that's what these two circles represent and then the mixture of the two has to be tested as well and we have good separation in uh in this four-dimensional space which is projected down onto two dimensions uh to be able to separate these and and so the same was true for mibk and toluene here you can see three separate circles and if we skip over to the uh ethyl butyl ketone and no name good good result there the place where we fell down was ethyl benzene and xylene and if you know the structures of these you'll know that they are isomers we're lucky to be able to separate them in the gc because they have very similar volatilities and structures um and here the pattern recognition failed because predictably because they have the same partition phenomena now luckily the separation was pretty good here in fact so that uh we could probably separate and deconvolute their their uh contributions to that peak without too much trouble but we ran some monte carlo simulations on these patterns and that's really what these circles represent these are the 95 confidence limits so very well separated except for this one exception so let me take this one step further and then say okay we've got 21 compounds here if we take them all at once it's a very difficult single problem of pattern recognition um if we wanted to identify them all so what we did was to break up the chromatogram into a series of retention time windows and the where we cut these was somewhat arbitrary but we you know made it so that there were four or five compounds in any one window and then we just treat each window separately and that simplifies the pattern recognition problem and you can see for those compounds one through five here we've got really good separation again these are the 95 confidence interval boundaries for all the compounds one through five and here are the compounds uh six through nine and here's the overlap of ethyl benzene and xylene so there's our one problem the rest look pretty good uh c12 and c11 these are undecane dodecane and of course their patterns are very similar because they're homologous alkanes but as with c9 and c10 any homologs are easily separated in gc because they have very different vapor pressures very different boiling points so you know the liabilities that we have in separation are made up for it to some extent with the patterns and then the reliabilities we have in the patterns are made up for by the separation so it's a nice complement uh complementary technologies okay so let me just provide about three slides on our field tests we just did some very basic field testing uh this is nico our electronics guy and we got him all informed and uh suited up in uh in protective equipment he's wearing pen one of the pen two prototypes here and doing some just made up solvent transfer operations here using a hot plate and some beakers and then we ran a um a capillary up here to get it into his breathing zone from the inlet to the machine and then we co-located a capillary from our bench scale gc which is sitting just outside of the plane of the slide here and so we did a relatively simple approach first for our field mock field test just five compounds and you're seeing the output from our four sensors very well separated here no problem at all these are the the compound acronyms these are their tlvs and we kept the exposures below tlv just to be safe and then these are the conditions of analysis we were able to run every five minutes for 60 minutes using this protocol one minute sample two minute separation two minute reset and in that time period we could run two quick gcf id reference samples these are the patterns they're all pretty different different enough given uh in combination with retention time to be able to tell them apart and so this is the list of activities that nico went through over the course of the hour and what you're seeing here are our money shots so what you're seeing here are the traces over an hour of what the pem2 yielded in concentration for each of the five compounds and then the gcf id is shown here as the dotted line and for three of or four of these they're almost superimposable a little bit of error here in xylene and then mibk a lot of error actually too much and we trace this back to an error in calibration you can see it's a systematic error so shift them all up and we're in good shape so we got good agreement also among the sensors in the array represented by the error bars good agreement between the pem2 and the gcf id and then i won't show it but the pattern stability was also good over the course of the hour so that's basically it what i've shown you here is the first and i think still only belt mounted micro gc in existence and we were able to develop it test it in the lab and do a quick mock field test performance overall was really quite satisfying the detection limits were low for small sample sizes and we could run about once every six minutes good linearity out to four times our benchmark tlvs for all the compounds that we're interested in uh i didn't talk about power or energy but they are quite low which bodes well for operating for eight hours good response stability the via the the complexity i'm sorry the resolution of the compounds was pretty good and as i showed we can use the pattern recognition capability to complement or fill in with where we have overlaps the mock field tests were very encouraging uh this project is actually over with but if we ever pick it up again we want to go and test more complex mixtures or other mixtures to see sort of how versatile it is go for longer and then take it out to the field to see what it can actually do so with that i will thank you for your attention i realize i'm running right up against the hour here i want to acknowledge uh this is a bunch of the group members the ones in red circles were integral to this project uh professor kurobayashi and rob knightits did our fabrication there's willie and his partner seth and other folks at vgc that helped us out so with that uh thanks for your attention thank you ted so we have uh this is now a tour 49 so in case you have to leave then it's okay and but for those who can't stay at this 10 more minute please stay and then you can unmute your microphone and then you can ask so anyone has any question i think everyone should be able to unmute themselves but if you can't just shoot me a message and i'll take care of it for you well one question i can raise myself that people might be wondering about is what is the status of this in terms of commercialization and uh it turns out that willie at vgc has not picked this up to commercialize it uh but we have some other partners that we're talking to to see if they want to pick it up and take it so that we can uh perhaps produce these and uh get them into the hands of industrial hygienists who may actually measure worker exposures because the capabilities we're providing i think are quite compelling one of the challenges is that they're probably too expensive so i don't know what the production cost would be but it's going to be probably over ten thousand dollars and that's a lot of money to put into a single instrument to put on the belt of any number of workers so that's a constraint that uh we're facing but who knows it might be worth it to certain customers like like the military for example so then so the main uh the advantage of using this system over like a bench system and then collecting like a biological specimen is working real time and the short-term exposure and so like that's why the targeting voc is now the like a main target compound but is it also possible that this system can also measure not volatile compound but uh onboard compound but uh like occupationally or environmentally uh important contaminant well so that's a loaded question of course and you know we picked the volatility range that we did for good reasons because it's really hard to deal with less volatile compounds and you know you can do breath monitoring with this technology because you're generally dealing with volatile compounds and people are working on extending the range down in volatility to to do things like pcbs or higher molecular weight organics uh this is strictly an organic chemical analyzer though so you're not going to do any inorganics or things like that and you can do water quality monitoring too but again you have to have volatile components so anything biological that's not going to have a vapor pressure would not be amenable to analysis by this kind of technique and then yeah you know you could argue that a lot of compounds don't require the time resolution we're getting here but it's we don't know that and so dose rate effects in toxic and toxicity are not well understood and plus in terms of interventions you'd like to know where the peaks are occurring so that they you might be able to control better if you were to know that not to mention the time and cost saving of of having the data delivered to you immediately rather than having to send out for it to laugh okay so from the audience so anyone has any questions hey stewart hey ted that's my cue i guess so um great talk as always i don't know if you can see this little gizmo here um this is the latest uh flow 2 unit which has a ozone nox voc and pm system in it you talked about the metal oxide systems but i mean the idea here is crowdsourcing these things and right you think we're gonna actually see some speciated stuff that works for say let's call it um community science what was the question when do i think we went yeah when do you think we're going to get the technology that um downsizes and makes it you know cheap enough to actually use in say happy studies yeah not in our lifetime i know that doesn't necessarily mean a very long period of time uh no and that you know i've been following of course the uh the community or citizen sensing field for a long time and this stuff is too just just too complicated and expensive to make it commercially successful for uh for the general population we'll be lucky to see it in you know in the workplace or even in the military who and they have the biggest budgets typically so i think we're going to have to suffice to have our our metal ox you know our tvoc measurements uh for the general population just as they're using these particle monitors to get basically just particle mass which is also of limited value for health effects or things like that that's the sad truth yeah thanks i wish it was rosier actually it's only particle optical characteristics even well right you have the inherent limitations of any scattering for the particles but those are the most successful for those citizen sensing things as you probably are aware the particle monitors are the are the ones that most people go after because they're cheap and easy problem is you don't have good sensitivity with those even you know for environmental levels of particles in most cases that's that's what we think anyone errors yeah this is pretty technical stuff but you know this is what i love to do and this is what it takes to to do this kind of stuff and then you know hand i want to hand it off to people like stewart and rick knightzel who was who was on for a while uh to take him to the field and um do the work that they're good at and i'm not real good at so about that point ted i have one more question so the you know like in another you know what one more dioxane is a you know the one of the chemicals that many people are concerned and but when i look at some of the biomonitoring uh data no biomonitoring study actually detect not uh like in the like the community resident so and no matter actually they even though they have some exposure but you know biomonitoring is has some limitation to capture uh actually exposure because you know this is two ago volatile or the exposure level is not uh you know high enough to detect and but like using this more of a portable system so do you think that this is a like a possible choice to detect and then assess this type of chemical in the not not occupational setting but in the environmental setting yeah right so we've we thought of that and um you know one application you might think of would be for vapor intrusion studies because you have this groundwater contamination and dioxane is is volatile enough that you might expect it to uh to be able to evaporate into people's homes one of the problems is that it's carried in groundwater and it's pretty water-soluble so that the partitioning out of water is pretty low unlike chlorinated solvents which are the classic ones that are that are causing vapor intrusion problems uh and so that looked like a non-starter for us already and keep in mind we we can't reach the detection limits you need to reach for ambient or you know even breath low-level breath monitoring we can't do low ppb it's just not possible with this technology so the workplace was chosen for among many reasons because the concentrations that are allowable and that are found there are in the ppm range and and we can do those really well but if you drop me by three orders of magnitude uh we can't do it without an add-on system to the front end a big pre-concentrator and then you know for yeah for i don't know dioxane the exposures are so low i mean you i guess you could conceivably find some on the breath i suspect it's metabolized quickly and that the breath concentrations would be vanishingly low so i i don't see a real path there to something of a problem that we could solve with this technology stewart might know more but that's my skin on
