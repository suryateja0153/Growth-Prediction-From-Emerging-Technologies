 What's that? Is it a mesh for catching fishes? Or part of a tennis racket? Or a fibre mesh fence? A "Maschendrahtzaun"? It's very lightweight! It's carbon! And that we put in concrete to get carbon reinforced concrete. Carbon cannot corrode, and so we are able to build very thin and this has a lot of advantages: We save material, more than 50%. For example sand, which is rare and scarce in the world. Then we can reduce CO2-emissons with over 70%. And if you consider that concrete or the cement of concrete is responsible for 6.5 % of the CO2-emissions, that is a lot. We can strengthen old buildings and use them much longer. This is the best part of sustainability. Buildings from carbon reinforced concrete will stay 200 years and more, more than the 80 years of normal steel reinforced concrete. We have a new architectural speech of forms and we are able to recycle carbon reinforced concrete. Until now we have built a lot of structures for example facades and food bridges and other structures. We have saved old buildings by using carbon reinforced concrete as a strengthening layer. But now we are making the next step. The first building totally made of carbon reinforced concrete will be built. The double-curved shell shows the architectural chances we have. The box on one side shows the economical possibilities of using carbon reinforced concrete. So we are reaching the next level in the economical and ecological way to build with concrete. And so concrete has a future.
