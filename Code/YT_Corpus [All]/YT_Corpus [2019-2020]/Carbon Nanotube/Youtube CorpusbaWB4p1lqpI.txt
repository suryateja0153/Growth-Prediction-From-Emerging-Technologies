 [Music] hello and welcome what we will start today is a slightly different topic in the sensor it has become extremely important in the last couple of decades or more that we normally called call a subject called nanoscience which is about electronic properties of systems at a nano scale and now some of these examples we have already highlighted in my previous talk that the previous lectures we discussed graphene carbon nanotubes and this kind of things and these systems are actually nano systems in the sense that they have one dimension which is confined so in that sense they are also nanos now systems but in general by nano system once may 1 means systems which are which which have a size of less than typically 100 nanometer or so in all directions so carbon nanotube is for example in nano nano size system one can make a small graphene sheet also a nano sized graphene sheet that will also qualify as a two dimensional nano system the reason that these small systems are important are many fold and they if you look at their applications they are now applied in almost every one branch of science including biology of course chemistry they have a huge application and in electronics and physic mainly physics applications or devices applications and the name quantum device for example is doing the round and these are systems which are also used for quantum devices the advantage of nano system is that they are their bandgaps can be manipulated and the bandgap depends on the size that is one aspect of it the other aspect of it is that they are reaction capabilities sometimes they are used as catalysis and the reaction capability becomes very large because there is a large surface to volume ratio so let me just illustrate these chair this section which I call the low dimensional systems not necessarily always nano systems but it's low dimensional which means that it is not a three dimensional system bulk system these are these have dimensions lower than three so let me recap the whatever we have learned in quantum mechanics because our my approach will be of course from the physics side the reactions and chemical applications are extremely important but that's a different story so we will confine ourselves only to physics applications so let's just try try to understand why is it that the low dimension systems behave the way they do so this is the Schrodinger equation time independent Schrodinger equation that we all know how to solve under different conditions in most cases we can't solve them in analytically but certain fortunate cases like harmonic oscillator like Coulomb potential particle in a box these kind of situations one can easily solve this problem analytically completely unethical okay nevertheless with the power of computers today solving this kind of equations in any geometry is not very difficult it's a linear equation so it's and it's it is solved in almost any geometry that you you like to solve it in so the the simplest thing is a free electron where you have your potential zero and State cell like plane waves and then you know that the spectrum is P square by twice F and P being H cross K it's h cross square K square by twice M so the there is also in since it's completely free that K has no restriction right so there is no boundary condition that you have to apply that the wave function vanishes after a certain beyond a certain region and so on so those conditions are not there so that K takes all possible values from anywhere to anywhere 0 to infinity and so on now see through K is basically continuous whereas if you have a confined system we call it quantum confinement because the Schrodinger equation is for a quantum system quantum particle and quantum particle confined in a particular material which is which size at least in one direction is very very small now this very small ism is a qualitative term sometimes you really need to understand what the small is and this small depends on your what your applications are and what kind of confinement you need for that particular application and so on so suppose this is a very simple example of surface-to-volume ratio so as you as you clearly see that the this surface-to-volume ratio basically increases as you decrease the size of a system I mean clearly right so for example volume is here if it is two inches on this one is for example two inches on every every this length is 2 inch and every every side has a side has a bread length and height two inch and so this this is 8 cubic inches this is the volume of this object inch of course is an American style American still use inches but nevertheless whatever is this 8 cubic whatever unit you want to write you can write centimeter also but suppose this is the 8 cubic inches so whereas the surface area is 6 surfaces for square inch each so it's 24 square inch so surface to volume ratio is 1 is is 3 now look at just reduce it by half of course you know what will happen the volume is now one cubic inch the surface is surface area six cubic inch and the surface to volume ratio is six and simply that volume changes by a cube power of three whereas surface changes by a power of two so volume changes much faster than the surface so as you lower the size and that's exactly what what has happened by so it changes by one length scale here you need a one length scale which is a half the size I doubled the surface to volume ratio so and you can go on doing it you can make it one-fourth then you will have four times and so on and so forth the interesting thing is of course these these have strong and important applications in chemistry because chemistry and some physical applications like adsorption and phenomena that depend on the surface reactivity in chemistry for example adsorption capability because the surface is where the absorb adsorption mostly takes place [Music] and so these that kind of applications required the large surface area so so that is one side of the applications one side of the story the other side of the story is that they there is a quantum mechanical effect due to this if you come down to very small length scales again that very small we have to be clear about what it means it means that compared to the the electronic mean free path the size should be comparable I mean that is how a quantum confinement is generally defined so if any dimension becomes comparable to the electronic mean free path then you should be should be in the region regime of a nano system or a confined system so so let's just so there is no rigid definition as such it also depends on what applications you want to do and so on so we will show you some slides later on as to how for example in optical applications what's the typical sizes that you require so so the next slide basically tells you the what happens quantum mechanically so finite sample size drastically alters allowed energy levels as we know from a particle in a box case for example if you make the Box size the energy for example is n square PI square by 2m L square so this kind of energy n is an integer for example this kind of energy for example if if your L becomes very large L is say almost infinity then of course you have the the gap between states is exceedingly small so it's like a continuous right and that's what we we said when we said to a free particle it's like a continuous spectrum all K values are allowed whereas if L is if L is small then of course the NH and n plus 1/8 level the separation becomes larger and you can easily calculate it and that separation basically goes as its energy scale energy itself goes as 1 over L square so the that the separation will now increase from a semi-continuous to a discrete spectrum that's exactly what we we have seen in in particle in a box case now that's that has an application I mean that is very interesting because if you are doing a if you are for example a normal semiconductor in in bulk system you require two bands one band is full the other band is empty and unique where a gap but in quantum systems just reducing the size brings in gaps between States and so you don't even even a metal can behave like a semiconductor if you can bring its size down to a very small size at least in one dimension you can always get a confined spectrum even discrete kind of spectrum and so that's this is ideal the example that shows that the electron here there in the left hand side is a continuous spectrum and you electron can on optical excitation for example the electron can move up and yet can move to any of these states right starting from anywhere here whereas in this case it's a nano-sized system and the same physics applies here but you can only go from one set of discrete States to another set of discrete States what it normally vertically goes up and the so that means there you do not have all choices of energies will have discrete choices of energies where you can excite an electron now the we know that the three D electron gas of course we have studied so far there the the density of states goes like this it's like a square root of energy and the Fermi function of course does not depend on the density it just depends on these function this function and and the temperature and it looks like this so these are the two things that are necessary to calculate properties or electronic properties of a system at T equal to zero the Fermi function is like this T zero is the this is the vertical drop at EF now these two things are all that you need density of states and the Fermi function to calculate a tronic properties and let us now look at what happens in in a low dimensional system for example this is a two dimensional system why is it two dimensional because the dimension in this direction in the Z direction for example the vertical Direction is very small and it's of the order of mean free mean free path of the of the electron that we are considering so for example that a typical scale for that is the wavelength of the electrons at the Fermi level for example so if that is what your dimension is comparable to that then of course you are in a regime where one direction the direction vertical direction here is confined but it is still free in x and y direction so it's like a free particle along KX and KY so the spectrum is H cross square KX square plus h cross square K Y square / - em whereas there is a in the z-direction of course there is a confined part to the spectrum which is a discrete spectrum so that's what is being shown here and the density of states in two dimension is actually independent of energy this is what we have we had done and that's that's what is being shown here for free party for a for a K square spectrum this is how the energy goes in in two dimension density of states goes as a function of energy in two dimension okay this is an example of a one-dimensional system now why is it one dimensional okay so look at the the direction in which the electron can flow freely there is only one direction along this this is written as Z direction okay so along this direction the electron can move freely and the other two directions the confinement is of the order of the wavelength of of an electron G's or the mean free path depending on what how you define it but that's the kind of length scale that one is confining the electron to so this is an example of a it's like a where this is also called a where it's one dimensional two dimensions are confined and one dimension is free so it's spectrum will be along K said it will still behave like a free and free particle H cross square KZ square by twice M whereas along the other two dimensions it will have this discrete energy levels and you need this two quantum numbers m and n to define the quantization along the x and y directions and the density of states as we had done in the previous lectures is a square root of e inverse of that so e to the power minus and so that is that is what is given here this this is the picture for the energy levels compared these two two dimension to dimension is basically flat completely flat so again you jump to a discrete level it's flat you can jump to another discrete level it's flat and so on whereas here from one so here did each of these discrete levels will give you this spectrum along this so these density of states this Dover e comes from this real part of this easy part of this respect to this free part of the spectrum which is H cross square K square Z square by twice M so it in one dimension so that is just one dimensional spectrum and that will give you 1 over root e then again you come to the next energy level discrete level you have this square it will be minus half dependence and so on so it goes on which in the two dimensional case was flat at each level you have a flat disc dispersion flat density of states because of this this term the the XY degree of freedom which is the two diamond two degree of freedom the discreet net comes from the one dimension here this e sub n you need only one quantum number there okay so that is basically the story of what one does with this kind of see why are these systems interesting and important low dimensional systems and there are many many different phenomena which one can study this is for example the extreme case where all directions are confined so these are called quantum dots or 0 dimensional system so they are not literally zero dimension dimension but there confinements are of this order in all three directions so then these are there is no degree of freedom along which they be the electron but the quantum particle can behave as a free particle it will be confined in all three direction so it's like a true particle in a box situation in all direction the particle is confined in a finite size so this is the confinement in three directions 3d three this is 3d confinement it's quantum dot typically their sizes at two to ten nanometer that also can change I mean DC depends on what application you are up to then you can change the size it depends also on the system itself and so on but these are these are the typical ballpark figures that it has to be around some nanometer so the so it's like an atomic state I mean it's it's like a giant atom like in atoms we have these discrete States right - 13.6 for example in hydrogen then it goes up then it goes up and then so on so here also you have fixed energy levels for each of these systems so there is a so there is a complete discreteness now in no Direction one is free and the density of states is basically a your energy has to hit this value each of these values - to get a finite number so it's like a histogram I mean you are now finding out how many states are available at what energy and you know that only a certain discrete energies the states will be available so you are you are summing these two comes from the spin degeneracy - into e - EJ EJ's are these quantum states they are defined by three quantum numbers and this this relation basically this Delta that there is a delta function here Delta of e - EJ and that is what gives you the the density of states and which is like a comb I mean it's like a calm that we used to come over here these are like spikes at fixed energies and if you have large number of them then it will be just like spikes the one picture that you must have seen many times is this picture this is c-dac and here this is quan these are quantum dots you can see the sizes the size is to 2 nanometer then 2.5 nanometer then 3 nanometer and 3.9 nanometer and 4.2 nanometer so c-dac cadmium selenide quantum dots and look at the the energy band energy so as we say sure in one of these previous view graphs that your optical excitations which is responsible for the optical gap which is responsible for the energy that it emits which is basically the color of the light it falls in this case it falls in the visible range of the spectrum in all these cases for so in the in this case one can one can easily see that the the color of this CdSe quantum dot it's a material is the same c-dac but the color is changing because with change in size your band these gaps are reduced gaps are increasing quantum so the inter inter level gaps these this tree if you look at the previous side this gap from the first to the second maybe to the second to the third all these gaps are now increasing as you decrease the size so if that happens then as you go down in size from right to left you will be your spectrum will now shift towards blue because you more energy to the gap is large so the energy emitted corresponds to that gap and the corresponding color is more towards blue so this is the beautiful example of a same system look at the system it is it's a system cadmium sulfide so as you decrease the size the band gap is consistently increasing there are other applications which are high quantum yield basically there because the states are so sharp and they are not disturbed by anything noticeable nothing no broadening nothing there they are extremely bright and very good sharp colors that come out and their quantum this is quantum yield is very high they are very narrow as I said and symmetric emission spectrum there is no as there isn't because there is the width of these states is very low there is almost no known asymmetry sin in the spectrum and of course these are tunable as I said as you just decrease the size of the nano part an ode OTT you can you can you can increase this I mean go towards blue color by by just changing the size of the system so that is an example of tunability of the wavelength emitted wavelength so to summarize these are three dimension is of course there is no confinement spectrum is like a free particle P Square by twice M in all directions then you have you are confining 1 1 directions which is one dimension one dimension is now confined which makes it a two dimensional system the corresponding density of states is like this this staircase like the three dimensional bulk one has this square route II this has no TAV no dependence the density of states is independent of e these are all for free part the free particle spectrum that we are talking about so then free particles confined in in this is like it in two dimensions the object with the particles are free but in one dimension they are confined this is all three dimensions they are like free particles this one is now one dimensional which means that you have where which features confinement in two directions and that means that there is only one direction where it will behave like a free particle and for that the spectrum will be like this e to the power minus half 1 by square root a and the zero dimensional object which is a quantum dot which has confined confinement along all directions and that has this spectrum of Delta functions basically you have discrete energy levels and the gap increases between the states as you reduce the size of the of the dot which was exemplified in that example of cadmium selenide quantum dot so the the the reason one studies low dimensional system is one of the thing is that the huge application of nano systems in physics chemistry math biology and so on and the other one is that the physics is very interesting I mean now you have quantum mechanics playing out in front of you you can actually see the discreteness that we learn in quantum mechanics for finite confined systems and that can be displayed right in front of you experimentally you can tune that energy levels and so on so it's a lot of interesting new physics that comes in the additional interest comes in when there are these electrons start interacting with each other and that is a subject that is of course we will not discuss here but that is an extremely important sub when you have a conference system in which electrons are confined and they are interacting with each other what happens then and there are beautiful interesting physics that is that happens there and those also have fantastic applications so in the next lecture what I will do is that I will show you one very major discovery which is which has tremendous applicat tremendous application he still has in metrology and it's the in application terms it was it was metrology that was mentioned first basically metrology means the making standards like the corner of the weight the the time length all these things are standardized and these the subject that deals with the standardization of Units measures is called the metrology and so this subject this discovery basically shook people up in the sense that it told us that real quantum mechanics plays out in the transport and one has beautiful new physics that comes out in presence of magnetic field so that is what I will start doing in my next lecture which is called the quantum Hall effect we will only discuss the integer quantum Hall effect because fractional quantum Hall effect is a very different beast although it's special fascinatingly interested interesting subject but we will confine ourselves only to 2d electron gas in a magnetic strong magnetic field at ultra low very low temperatures and we will discuss the physics of that and eventually show that the the off-diagonal resistivity can be quantized we will come to that in the next lecture
