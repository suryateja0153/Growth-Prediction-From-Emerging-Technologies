 [Music] [Music] okay so welcome to introduction to civil engineering part of the lecture on structural modeling I am dr. Pradeep Rath Appa some of you might know me I'm a faculty in structural engineering here at IIT Madras in the department of civil engineering so today we will be looking at some part of structural engineering and mechanics which is called structural modeling so in this lecture what we will see is we will first understand we will look at some examples of modelling and simulation and what modeling and simulation actually means and what does it mean in the context of structure engineering and mechanics we look at a very simple example in terms of what you actually know from before you came to IIT and then see how that transforms into computer models and how does it help to solve huge problems who huge solve complex problems in civil engineering and structural engineering and then we will also see after that how this structural modeling can enable to venture beyond the horizon so if you already know that is maybe discover new types of structures few types of materials model new kinds of structures which you haven't envisioned before and all that and then we will see how its kind of changing the phase of innovation and technology and all that in the end okay so let's start so here I have an animation or simulation computation of a computational model you can see that it's a model for blast loading in a building so what's exactly happening if you notice is at the bottom there is a blast and a column at one of the corners this column starts failing and that leads to a progressive collapse towards upwards each slab and each of the structural elements in the slab keep collapsing and then there is a collapse of the entire section of the building so these kind of things can be studied well in advance even before such things happen you can try to predict how a building might fail if there is a blast load and then maybe try to strengthen the building or different cases and come up with innovative designs and this is another simulation of a building subjected to earthquake loads so what is an earthquake load an earthquake is where the ground shakes so in this case we are looking at ground shaking happening in a lateral horizontal direction and then you have a simulation of a structure which is on the ground so you can study how the forces or deflections of the members of the structure are vary as a ground is shaking and this key this will give you a sense of what is the maximum stresses or forces that my structure can take is it good enough will it be safe and if it is not can i maybe resize my structures like for example can I make my beams and members larger in size so that they will be more stronger right and this is another example we just look at these three examples and then we'll go into the course so this is another example I thought is interesting so this is a suspension bridge so in a suspension bridge what you have is you have a deck right and it is suspended from cables at the top and suspension bridges are very important because their dynamic characteristics are very important because when you have a bridge it's subjected to dynamic loads vehicle loads wind loads earthquake loads and so on so why are dynamic loads difficult to understand and why why why is it important to understand structures in the context of dynamic loads so think about a simple pendulum let's start with the simplest object you know a simple pendulum oscillating a pendulum oscillating has a natural frequency or a time period what is that it is a time taken for the pendulum to complete one oscillation and if you see I have shown here three pendulums one in blue color other in golden color and a blue black color and what is difference between them the length of the pendulum is different that is their geometry is different so if the geometry of a structure in this case the simple pendulum is different it can have a different frequency of oscillation you can see the blue one is oscillating much faster than the black one right similarly when you look at a structure depending on the size of the structure the material you used in the structure and how the structure structural members are connected you can have different modes of oscillation in the quantum figure I showed four different modes of oscillation in a simple pendulum case you just have one mode of oscillation so there is just one degree of freedom is what we call it but in a structure there are different kinds of oscillations that are possible for example you can see the first figure is more like a sinusoidal curve right but the second one is more sort of a lateral torsional oscillation so different such oscillations are possible and each oscillation has its own frequency depending on the geometry of the structure so in summary it's just all about how this geometry and the material property is going to affect your frequencies and how these frequencies are related to the dynamic forces acting on the system if you can understand that you can design the structure better for the dynamic loads so now let us get into what is modeling and simulation so what are models this is quite a general concept as I wrote here models are used to understand explain or predict something there could be theoretical models mathematical models numerical models computational models statistical phenomena phenomenological and so on we will see some of these in the next few slides what they actually mean and how they are different and then what is simulation simulation is recreating a system or a process or a phenomenon for example here I have an animation right so if this is about computer simulation of a car crash so if I want to understand car crash I don't necessarily have to crash the car thousands of times in different directions maybe I run a few thousand simulations and then finally test one or two of the of the critical ones right and when I want to do that what a a to understand is I want to understand a mathematical or a theoretical model for the structural chassis of the car and then do some computer simulation solve this problem on a computer and then I can visualize what's happening right so these are some examples of modeling and simulation so the first one is weather forecast so let's say you want to predict the path of a hurricane or when the Cyclones would come where which states the cyclone would cross and so on this is very important for irrigation purposes and many other water resources problems right so this is typically done based on previous data and also you could maybe use atmospheric physics so it's a combination of physics and data problem financial engineering is we have two stock markets so you have a stock market data based on many years the trend of the stock market and then you want to decide whether you want to buy a stock or a seller stock depending on how you think on how you predict the stock market is going to behave in the future and for that you need a model for it so this is typically done using statistical model and then there are also other models for example atomic qualifier interactions have to be modeled if you want to design drugs for some diseases right I want to study how the molecules are going to interact form the bonds or maybe break some bonds to create new drugs maybe for cancer or some other diseases right so such this is can be done if you model atomic and using maybe some experiments as well as some physics based loss and another example on thermal analysis so this might sound a little interesting because here you are looking at a computer motherboard so the animation or the figure here the colored figure here so as a computer motherboard and what we are trying to do is cool down a processor it gets pretty hot in the processor in the computer motherboard and if it crosses a critical temperature the parts can fail even structurally if it structurally fails you your circuits are now no longer connected and it cannot function right so you want to keep the temperature of the processor below a minimum level and maybe further that you want to design a fan so now how do I decide what should be the shape or design of the fan what should be the speed and all that right for that what I want to do is I want to study how the wind passes through this processor and how does it dissipate the heat further do you want to do thermal analysis so that is the modeling and simulation that can be useful in the context of thermal analysis and what about fluid mechanics I show here a aircraft so in a aircrafts you have wind flowing on the surface of the body of the aircraft and if you can model the wind flow on these structures you can potentially reduce a drag on the system so if you are moving your hand in the wind you can see that you have a resistance right so if you if I can model that wind on the surface maybe I can model the shape of my surface in an efficient way so that that drag will be lesser if you move it like this versus like this there's a difference right so that's what you are trying to understand so that is related to fluid mechanics because air is a fluid and then finally if you look at structural analysis which is a main theme of this lecture right we look at the overall context of modeling and simulation in the context of structural analysis so before we go into the actual talk let's motivate ourselves why computers are important I am sure you know you know why computers are important for various reasons but in the context of modeling and simulation why are they important let's start with the basic problem one of the basic problem so can you solve ax equal to B right so what do you need to solve ax equal to B an algebraic equation you read the input a and B and then if a is a real number and B is another real number you should be able to tell me what axis for example if 2 X equal to 3 X is just 3 by 2 right now if I say a and B are not just single numbers but they are mattresses right so if a is a two by two matrix and B is another two by two matrix such as the one shown in this example can you find me a vector of size two by one from this given input which is quite trivial you just have to invert this matrix which can be trivially inverted for a two by two matrix as shown here and then multiply the right side vector you get your unknowns x1 and x2 but then if I ask you can you solve this matrix system with an N by n matrix and an n by 1 vector on the right hand side so basically I'm asking you to find X 1 X 2 X n where n could be may be thousand I'm asking you to solve thousand equations at the same time can you do that manually no right so why don't we use computers for that so let me put this into a bigger context so what are computer models made off right so I have this numerical problem in terms of a huge matrix and a set of unknowns x1 x2 x3 xn and then given B 1 B 2 B n right so let me give you a physical context of what these means at the right bottom corner on the screen you are looking at a beam which is undergoing some sort of animation and explain what is happening so imagine this B 1 B 2 B 3 B n each element in that vector corresponds to a vertically downward force at each point on the beam along the length of the beam so let's say I am applying a b1 here B 2 here V 3 here and so on BL right now correspondingly if I am pressing a vertical force on the beam there should be a displacement at those corresponding points now I will denote X 1 X 2 X 3 X n as a corresponding displacement at all those forces so now if I solve this matrix problem a times X equal to B for a given set of forces on the beams I can find the given setup I can find the corresponding displacements on the beam so that is the structural analysis problem now once I stop is a context of this problem I have this numerical problem which I have to solve I have a matrix I have force set and I want to find a displacement on the structure how do I solve this matrix problem it's a linear algebra problem you typically have algorithms or solution procedures for standard problems in terms of the properties of the matrix a so example you might have heard about Gauss elimination method right on how to solve a matrix with a lot of unknowns and so on right so you can use such an algorithm or you can use different algorithms such other ones shown here and that should be able to solve the problem so that is all theoretical you have a mathematical framework how to solve ax equal to B now how do I use a computer to solve a problem because even if I have an algorithm if you have to solve a thousand by thousand problem I cannot do it manually right so I need to tell a computer of how to understand this mathematical algorithm and solve it for that you need to use what are called programming languages like C or Python or Fortran or MATLAB or whatever you are comfortable with it and then translate this algorithm which is shown in this green box into a code or a software so once I have my software all I need to do is view the inputs to the software which is all the elements of the matrix a and all the elements of matrix B and then this software using this algorithm should be able to solve for all the vector X I right so once I do that I can visualize my results using graphics which is shown in the last one so what is happening here is actually I started with a set of forces b1 b2 BN and I kept increasing the magnitude of the forces I kept in making the forces larger and larger and at each point I am trying to find my displacement X 1 X 2 X n so as you can see as the forces are increasing the displacement is also increasing right for each of those I am solving that matrix problem so now let's see how one could develop a theoretical or a numerical model for a typical structural engineering problem right so you are all familiar with Hookes law right if you have a spring and if I apply a force on it the displacement of the spring is prep our long action of the spring is proportional to the applied force and this is the standard basic Hookes law and it is given by this expression KX equal to F so in this case F is the input variable force on a spring and X is the corresponding elongation so this is also shown in a plot here so the x axis corresponds to the displacement of the spring y axis corresponds to the force and let's say you take a real spring and start applying forces maybe 10 Newtons 20 Newtons 30 Newtons and so on but you have a displacement so once I have that I'll mark the corresponding displacement and I will make a plot as shown here once I join all the lines firstly I will notice that they are falling on a line and once I join the dots I get a slope of the line and that slope is nothing but the stiffness of the string given by K similar analogy can also be applied for a steel rod steel rod is also a spring except that the stiffness of it is much higher than a normal spring you see right so again you have a Hookes law for a steel rod and why is this useful now once I have a model so let us call this the theoretical of the mathematical model for a spring or a rod there based on experiment once I have this model next time you give me a force applied on the spring of the rod I do not have to go back and do my experiment right the model is now able to predict the displacement that can occur in the rod so that is the idea behind all of the theoretical model and this is very simple and it's kind of obvious if you can think about it right but now let's go into a slightly complex problem so let us say how this water tank structure shown here right and then I am saying I want a model for this structure because in the end all I am interested in is I want to apply forces on my structure at different points let's say f1 f2 f3 are various forces applied at different points on my structure right and for those corresponding forces I want to find the corresponding displacements because those forces will cause some displacements or distortion of the structure that is what I want to do what do I go back what do I do based on my previous experience I how to do an experiment so if I can do an experiment with forces and displacement and make a plot and maybe potentially find is K full the stiffness of the structure then I am good right but how easy is it to perform experiments on structures like this or maybe more complicated structures which we will see eventually right it's not quite feasible at this point we use the math and develop what is called numerical models since I know how to deal with a single rod I can approximate this entire structure as a combination or a network of many bars which are subjected to forces so each bar here is connected to every other bar and it's kind of approximates this real structure so when you are approximating you know you are dealing with a model now this is a numerical model right and since I know for each bar I can write k 1 x1 equal to f1 each bar still obeys the theoretical Hookes law which we saw in the previous slide and for the entire structure all I have to do is combine all the equations from the bars and develop this huge matrix right so this huge matrix and displacements at each of the rods and the forces around each of the rod is what dictates the structural behavior of my complicated structure so this what is what represents our numerical model for this problem and once you solve this numerical problem on a computer because it is so huge and you cannot solve it manually that becomes a computational model so you you take a real structure you convert it into a numerical model and then you solve the problem that is we have you press some buttons here but what is actually happening once you press the buttons is that the code is running and it's trying to solve the matrix problem that is giving you the displacements or forces or whatever you asked it for and then you can visualize the result and see and make sense whether your structure is safe or are you okay with you do you want to change it and so on right so let's put put it in the overall context of what you might have seen in the previous two classes on structural engineering maybe you heard about analysis and design and so on right so what is happening when somebody wants to build a structure or a bridge or something they start with an idea yes I want to build a bridge here or I want to build a building in this location and this location is characterized by such-and-such atmospheric forces or temperature and so on and this is the material requirement these are available in this location these are not and so on right based on all that you start with an initial design or a preliminary design for your structure right and once you have your design based on what we just saw you would walk you can't you cannot do a full-scale experiment for it in some very rare cases although that is possible but let's in general it's not possible so you construct a computational model for the initial design and this computational model is informed from theory experiment as well as mathematics right so once you have a computational model run it through a computer and perform the analysis and see whether this structure is safe and acceptable or that design you came up initially is it safe and acceptable can it take all the forces without tailing in the structure stand or will it fall if it is safe and acceptable you and your design and you're good to go with your initial design if not you go back maybe change this layout of your members or you change the sizes of the members to make it more or less stronger whatever you want and then go back and update your computational model again because when you change your structure and then perform the analysis and this loop keeps going on until you are satisfied with it these are what are called design iterations typically if you are performing any structural analysis or building a new structure many hundreds of such designs are possible depending on the complexity of the structure now imagine if you don't have this computational modeling capability of subtle modeling capability you would have to perform experiment for each structure you come up every time you change and you think this is not good enough for me you have to perform an experiment because you don't have a stiffness or property of the structure right so this analysis actually is cutting down the time on your design iterations and helping you have design the structures more efficiently so now let's look at some applications on how the structural modeling has helped in designing some of the most complicated and wonderful structures on this planet right so this I am sure you might have seen in other lectures in this course Burj Khalifa another is the tallest building on the planet right and there are some interesting aspects to it from the context of actual modeling and simulation so firstly when I say you have a very tall building extremely tall building what is that that comes to your mind imagine you are on the top floor of the building high wind loads say there's going to be very high wind loads so how is this building different from any of the other buildings because you are at such high level maybe you have a stream of jet wind's coming onto your building and that might affect some structural dynamic behavior which we have discussed in the beginning right so what typically happens is if you look at this blue part of the animation I am showing your cylindrical structure which is put in a fluid motion so the fluid let it be wind or water it's moving on the cylinder and once the velocity of the fluid crosses a particular point you will see what is called vortex shedding which is happening here so there are some kind of features in the fluid that keeps moving out away from the structure and if it is happening at some frequency that can resonate with the structure and make your structure oscillate and that can be very bad for your structure it can even lead to collapse of the structure so you do not want your structure to be a cylinder and standing so tall and your wind is so bad that you have vertex induced vibrations what they are called so you are to overcome the designers have come up with this interesting design where they have cylinder staggered as you go up if you see in the structure there is some sense of spiral action going on here so cylinder height is here and here it is higher than that here it is higher than that I have done that and so on so this staggered pattern disrupts this kind of periodic shading that is happening on the structure and prevent waters induce vibrations and if you see the final wind simulation of the building you can see there is no such periodic shading happening it's all dissipated here and that is how you know this building is not going to fail under such wind induced loads and all this is possible if you could just simulate it right it doesn't cost much but imagine you how to make a real experiment of such a large-scale structure it's not possible there are some extreme cases like I said before maybe you can make a scale model of the structure and then test it in wind tunnels but even that is pretty expensive but compared to making a computational model and studying which wind loads are the most critical is much easier right and this is another example where you have an earthquake load in the building so it's oscillating in different modes so you want to study again which dynamic modes are critical for the building and so on so now if you see those buildings and if you call the number of rods we said we will discredit display the structure with you can imagine your matrix size could be running into thousands right in some of the cases it will be of the size million by million or 100,000 brandable it will be in the orders of millions in many of the structures then you have very small rods exports emitting is such a huge structure so can your computers actually solve that problem of a million by million matrix times some vector is given forces a simple standard computer cannot necessarily solve very huge problems in such cases you have to deal with lot of current supercomputers so for that what you need to understand is this high performance and parallel company and I I thought it is very important that you know about this it is a little bit background on us because in today's world most of the computers even the personal computers you are using are using parallel computing parallel computing need not necessarily be in your 10 computers in front of you all you are doing is your many cores and whatever job you are giving out so let us say how to make them calculation I don't want to make the calculations one after another I want to do them all parallel so let's see how that works so let's say I'm interested in a matrix times a vector I want to calculate this matrix times vector so how do I definitely calculate I calculate b1 as product of this row times this vector right so a 1 1 X 1 a 1 2 X 2 and so on a 1n xn only after that I can go to b2 and do this row times this and so on so if I were to write a MATLAB code for this you have it here so for I equal to 1 to N that is for each B 1 or B I calculate the product of the row elements of the matrix a IJ times the corresponding elements of the vector X I XJ and the way this thing works is first it will calculate b1 then it'll calculate b2 and so on so what we suggest to do is you run it on multiple computers the first loop so what I want to do is I want to calculate B 1 B 2 B 3 B and all simultaneously and just to get an intuitive understanding of what's happening here I have a couple of figure has taken from the larva website so the first figure you are looking at flowing a field you have one factor on one machine you want to plow a field 100 tractors going at the same time you can finish the whole field in the time taken by one tractor two towers the field right in other case you are constructing a building one worker versus hundred workers focus working on it at the same time so that's the idea so now what we want to do is I will calculate my b1 in one computer or one node or one CPU and b2 in another CPU v3 in another CPU and so on but what we need in extra - what we already have with all standard computers is we need a network which connects all these computers to tell me that these B 1 B 2 B 3 could belong to the same problem that is called a computer cluster and there are many thousands of computers that can be connected and very huge problems can be solved on them family and let us look at an exotic example of structural modeling I thought this is imp this is interesting because it will give you a sense of how can I come up with a structural model for a structure which I haven't seen before for example I haven't seen this structure before this is a folded structure made out of a flat sheet of paper and it turns out it has some very interesting properties so you see is a flat sheet of paper and somehow I folded along it some corrugation said you end up with the structure right and each part of this cell is again shown here in detail just for you to get a understanding of how it looks and let's say I want to model it structurally so before I go into structure model I wanted so I have a paper model here you can come and see it after the class so it has an interesting behavior if I pull it out it extends in both the directions why is this interesting you take a rubber sheet and pull it out contracts in the other direction but in this case if I pull it out in one direction it's extending in the other direction right so this is called a miura-ori origami sheet origami is art of folding paper so let's say I want to do a structural model for this so I take my unit cell I understand its geometry in terms of something shown here but now structurally I want to model it what do I do I go back to my idea of replacing the structure with bars right and bars are nothing but strings so I have a quadrilateral panel here firstly I replace my quadrilateral panel with a set of four bars then I understand that the opposite corners of the quadrilateral panel cannot be independent they cannot just go as they want because it's just a plate right so they have to be quite rigid that means I have to put another bar connecting the diagonal that is a more realistic representation of this panel right so that's how I come up with a model and I put some spin Springs on it to give a structural behavior and after I do that I model it on the computer right I simulate it on the computer and you can see it can give the same behavior as I have shown you as you pull it out in one direction the other direction expands and if you kind of contract in one direction the other direction contracts right so this this is how structural modeling can help you understand structures which you didn't know how they would behave for example and there are also other systems such as atomic systems such as a1 shown here so this is a combination of graphene and carbon nanotubes these days you might be hearing a lot of these buzzwords carbon nanotubes graphene and so on they have interesting properties electronic properties and so on right but even structural engineering has a role to play over there why is in the in the end nobody wants things to fail structurally by making an electronic circuit or a PCB or whatever I don't want it to break I wanted to be strong enough for whatever stress I see even if that is undergoing even the smallest things are subjected to forces I do not want them to break right so in this case researchers have found that if you combine carbon nanotubes which are shown as pillars here so these are carbon atoms and then if you combine the graphene sheets they have a better structural property than both of them working independently and this has lot of applications in electronics and a structural engineers I see there see them as columns and slabs and beams and it's the same concept right in fact the researchers who formed this idea was severe in for civil engineers from Rice University so this is another interesting application of modeling in the previous flowchart where we discussed design iterations I said once you are not happy with your design you go back change your member sizes and analyze it again but doesn't it seem a little bit inefficient that I have to tell the structure what to change what to increase what to reduce and so on right it would be nice if I have some sort of model maybe an optimization model which tells the structure no now you want to remove the material there or maybe increase the material here to make it more efficient so that is what is happening here so I start with a cuboidal domain shown in blue color initially and then I applied a load at the top and then I gave it a ordering algorithm which says remove the material which is our inefficient which is not taking load efficiently and that is going to give you the beam structure which uses the least amount of material and if you can use such algorithms to design futuristic buildings such as the one shown here you can get these kind of bracings which are similar to what you might have seen in standard buildings but are also slightly different and there these are supposed to be at least theoretically optimally optimal and more efficient in terms of structural efficiency and if we have time we can go and in detail on what kind of cantilever structures you can obtain using this algorithm I think you might have seen the cantilever structures in your previous lectures cantilever is you have support on one end and I apply a load somewhere else and in between that I want to create a structure which can take this load support right so that is explained in this figure here and these are some examples of cantilever structures where you have the support on one end and you have a huge structure in between so let's see how they are compared to what this optimization algorithm would you so the optimization has told me that this length is small enough I just need a we type brace and as you increase the thing you read more and more bases to transfer this load to the support right but one thing is common between what is existing and what are these braces are common but the way the braces loop and the amount of bracing that has to go at one end versus the other end that is changing right so of course there is hope that you can make structures more efficient maybe you can use 50% of the material that was used in this to get the same structure and be more efficient right so all this sounds good and it looks interesting but can we actually build it right that's quality the question you have in mind so here is an example of concrete structure this column is made out of concrete and typically you might not have seen concrete in some random forms but even if you have to build a concrete in some weird shells shape and so on you knew how to take a lot of effort to make the formwork for the concrete and so on in this case they have used 3d printed form work to make this complex 3d structure so what I would like to highlight here is it's not impossible to make structures which were not possible before there are always advances happening in the field to build structures using innovative techniques and what you thought might not be possible might be a reality tomorrow right and another surprising thing is even how 3d printed metal lattice structures and these are right now actually being used in the industry so industry is actually 3d printing metal lattices to be used in automotive or manufacturing and so on so that is already that already has become practical can anybody guess what this is so does it look something like a part of a Nathan power right maybe it would like this this truss structure right but if you notice this length square I showed here it is telling you that the length measurement from here to here is 10 micrometers what does it mean the entire width of the slide is about the thickness of your hair strand so somebody actually sat down and used some advanced manufacturing techniques maybe such as 3d printing to build a structure within the thickness of your hair strand and that structure is inspired by the big scale structures like a filter and why is this important how does this make sense or who cares about this right so if you think about it when I was talking about optimization algorithm I was talking about removing the material which is not taking the load and making the structure more efficient if I am using less material I am causing less environmental impact in some sense so that is one of the motivations you want to design your structures in a more efficient way right so if you are removing material which is not being used you are making a structure light in weight and also having the same strength so you're making your structures lightweight and high strength so many of the structures you see around maybe they have too much weight just because we do not have any other way to manufacture them so you do not want to do that right so these are called mechanical meta materials they are made in some exotic ways and they are some exotic properties which you might have thought are not possible so another example on mechanical metamaterials so what are meta materials just definition here is their artificial materials that can exhibit exotic engineering properties what is exotic something fancy something you thought it doesn't make sense to me maybe something like that so let's look at this example in a visability clock maybe most of you know about Harry Potter's invisibility clock right so it's a garment then you enclose it around an object you will not be able to see the object does it physically make sense the is it just pseudo science or science fiction or something or does it make sense physically it can be explained physically but the practicality is a different question so let me try to explain what is actually happening when we talk about invisibility clocks so on one end the light waves are coming in and there is an obstruction and somebody is viewing the light waves from here right if there is an obstruction I should not be able to see what is there behind it that is a reality now if I can make some kind of meta material around this which will behave in such a way that it will take these waves it will manipulate them in such a way and send out the same waves as they are coming in such as our one phone all right say if I can do that somebody is sitting here they will exactly see these light waves as they are here which means they will not see what is there here the black dot they will not be able to see that is idea of invisibility clock and metamaterials has read with it so practically we still do not have it yet but I take inspiration from this towards what about elastic core acoustic metamaterials instead of light waves let's say you have sound waves are maybe structural vibrations I can use the same idea to create some sort of meta material around some structure I want to protect and make sure maybe these waves do not touch my structure and just go away right so that is explained in this simulation here so let's say I have some meta material so or in some sort of this lattice shown here and then you have some vibrations on one structure and I don't want this vibration to go to the rest of the structure now if I can design this geometry of this structure using some optimization in such a way that these vibrations cannot pass through this that is they will be repelled or absorbed by this lattice then I can protect this part of the structure so you can wipe isolate you can isolate the vibrations so another example is way of grading so I have this lattice and then you can maybe distort the lattice in some way to make the waves propagate in some particular direction you want right so the theoretically this is all possible there are challenges there are limitations but the good thing is now theoretically it's not it doesn't seem nonsensical so let us say how sensitive structure may be a nuclear reactor and I can put such a lattice grid below the ground and then if I can maybe play around with my lattice and design my geometry of the lattice you can potentially control the vibrations maybe earthquake vibrations coming to the structure go around the nuclear structure and make it safe right so the modeling and simulation the importance of the context here is you still do not have these systems you don't have any experiments but the theory and the models that have been developed fundamentally can be extended to more complex ideas which can result in futuristic structures and materials that is what I want you to take away from this and now let's summarize so I just go briefly on what the major topics which we are touched upon so the first thing is models are intended to depict reality models are not reality we want them to depict the reality as best as we can using experiments or other insights and theoretical and mathematical models are typically delivered based on experimental observations most of the cases but also there are cases where you can derive from first principles or fundamental laws for example maybe Newton's law of gravitation or maybe quantum mechanics can be used to understand atomic interactions using fundamental laws not necessarily entirely based on experiments and computational models are obtained by solving theoretical models on computers which we have seen and we have seen the importance of parallel computing in solving large-scale structures and structural modeling is useful to calculate properties of structures which are very difficult to obtain from experiments and this is what we have highlighted in this lecture and we also noted that it reduces the time taken for each design iterations it makes a designing process of the structures more efficient and structural computational modeling is useful for analysis as well as design and this is a novel concept relatively in a sense that optimization frameworks that can also design the structures are not very rigorously or widely used in the industry yet so there is a transitioning phase that is coming in there now you can design and analysis do everything with modeling at least that can give you an insight on what the best designs can be and then of course you can have a human factor in to make it more practical finally latest advances in manufacturing and construction technologies make structural modeling all the more relevant and critical for rapid technological progress finally I would like to conclude this slide and I believe that human creativity plus computers make advanced technological innovations feasible thank you [Music]
