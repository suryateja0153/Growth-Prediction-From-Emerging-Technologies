 hi my name is charizatsumab and i'm the manager of climate change and clean energy here at the canadian electricity association today on the future is now series we're chatting about a project outweighs from capital power welcome renee thank you tell us a little bit about the genesee generating station how did capital power identify the genesee generating station as a priority for the efficiency improvement program starting in 2016. sure thanks um the generating uh the genesee generating station provides over 1300 megawatts of reliable base load generation for albertans and it's capital power's largest generating station it's a foundation for capital power it's often referred to as as our flagship recognizing the importance of carbon reduction capital power focuses on emission reductions reliability and sustainability so when genesee unit 3 was built we used state-of-the-art technology and capital power agreed to impose at that time of voluntary reduction of the coal units emissions to the equivalence of a natural gas combined cycle facility so once carbon regulations came into effect in alberta at that time then capital power continued to meet this voluntary standard in addition to the regulated reductions for the entire genesee site now at genesee carbon intensity and the site's emissions have always been a priority in focus our genesee station adds to the stability and the reliability of the alberta electric grid and it helps albertans to keep their lights on and their homes warm we want to make sure that it's available when needed optimized for the most efficient performance in turn reducing emissions and protecting our environment so this efficiency project put a target to genesee's emission reductions um we're going to improve the greenhouse gas emission intensity and the performance and the efficiency of the unit by 12 by 2021 the result is lowering the plant's emissions by approximately one million tons and carbon compliance cost savings for capital power under alberta's carbon pricing framework the project preserves and it extends the value and the life of genesee to keep it as a competitive source of power generation and a major contributor to the province's power needs okay that's great so this is an ongoing project can you take us through the timeline and describe the milestones your team hopes to achieve for sure um so yes and in 2016 the genesee efficiency improvement project capital power committed to reducing the emissions at genesee by 12 by 2021 which we are on track to achieve uh when this project began we first looked at improving operational efficiencies to improve the unit's intensity and then as the project progressed we started to move on to larger emission reducing projects that involved major equipment replacements this then these larger projects started to lay that foundation and the groundwork for capital power to increase dual fuel capabilities and our natural gas usage um at genesee and then um another project that we have by the end of 2021 capital power has plans to commission the first phase of the genesee carbon conversion center which will capture co2 from flue gas from the units and convert it into a very valuable product called carbon nanotubes so we have partnered with a company called c2cnt whose proprietary technology we will be deploying in in this carbon conversion center the carbon nanotubes that this project generates has significant emission reducing benefits when used as an additive or an ad mix in industrial processes for example if you add carbon nanotubes to a cement admix it reduces the amount of cement or the cement product that's required and it also strengthens uh the cement at the same time so currently we're testing these carbon nanotubes from and t today in in cement now further to just this capital power has also started the process of converting our units to 100 dual fuel so today we're currently achieving approximately 30 percent dual fuel capability uh with that's a 30 natural gas coal fire uh which is already reducing the emissions at the site we're also proposing to repower genesee units one and two to the best-in-class hydrogen-ready natural gas combined cycle technology this will be setting a new standard for gas generation efficiency in the province now based on a successful outcome of the regulatory process genesee one would become a dedicated natural gas unit by the end of 2023 followed by genesee unit 2 at the end of 2024. okay that's great and how will this project support canada's climate change goals renee so sustainable energy i think it's important to canada's economy um capital power is committed to responsible generation reducing emissions through the genesee efficiency project was the first step um for capital power the path forward for us would be converting our generation through innovation and technology deploying a multi-faceted approach to decarbonization genesee has been integral for the last 30 years to alberta's power needs um it'll continue to be for for years to come um i mean the energy industry it's it's interconnected it's not it's not segmented between green energy versus thermal energy projects like our genesee carbon conversion center it's an opportunity for us to look beyond just energy such you know we get a chance here to partner with new industries to grow canada's economy and reduce emissions together capital partner or capital power is partnered with c2cnt to develop this carbon conversion center using this new technology it's building the world's largest carbon nanotube facility which has the benefit of impacting carbon emissions by using carbon nanotubes a valuable product in other applications such as additives to industrial processes like cement you know it's it's an opportunity to to expand and partner with industries outside of just energy the project reduces emissions through carbon capture and then that end product has the ability to transform other industries reducing their carbon footprints exponentially as well it's a partnership yeah absolutely and these technologies and projects are really what make the future look hopeful so i appreciate you sharing that with me yeah i know we totally agree i mean i think that's the path forward yeah that's great to hear so where do you see the genesee generating station project in the next 30 years as we get closer to net zero by 2050 well so the gener the genesee generating station has been around for 30 years so you know a lot can happen in yet another 30 years which i mean the site will be around for even longer we hope and you know it'll include things that we can't even imagine today you know i think covid is a good example of where things can you know what how things can change and how we've had to change our thinking you know genesee is a hub it's a hub of innovation both in terms of power generation finding new opportunities for creating a low-carbon world in other industries capital power is a team of future focused experts and creative minds and aside from being you know net zero at the facility by 2050 i think genesee will be producing new and exciting products um that we can't even yet imagine and which will contribute to a strong and healthy future for all of us yeah absolutely 30 years is a long time and we're excited to see what's in store so before uh we leave today i wanted to ask you what's one word you would use to describe electricity i would say evolving yeah that's a good one i agree well thank you so much for joining us today renee it was a pleasure speaking with you and good luck on the genesee generating station projects great thank you so much for having us
