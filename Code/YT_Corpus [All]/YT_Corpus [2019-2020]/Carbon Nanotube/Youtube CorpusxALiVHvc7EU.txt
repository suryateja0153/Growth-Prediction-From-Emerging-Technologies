 so why why are why is the fact that an electron is a wave why is that so important first of all because it sets up you know this this detective story of the electron set up this new theory that's coming quantum mechanics right um but also it immediately just like just like we started painting with them right remember that was one of my widest matters we also realized that we could see with them we could see with electrons because you know if electrons are waves then i can shine them just like i shine light and see what it shows me right it can illuminate matter so you know if you look at the frequency here of light right this is this is a electromagnetic spectrum radio right microwave infrared visible uv now here's the thing if you want to see something uh some feature size you're limited by the wavelength of the light it can't be bigger than the features you're looking at roughly ish okay that's what you're so if you're trying to see something tiny but the wavelength of light is really big you won't see it so we need if we want let's say we want to see atoms let's say we want to see atoms or or or even more nuclei look at how tiny those are 10 to the by 10 centimeters 12 meters those are x-rays or gamma rays but the problem is if we shine x-rays on things and we will do that when we look at crystals but if we shine x-rays it's very hard to then collect them and make a photographic image okay right i mean at least one that gets you that resolution and gamma rays are even harder to catch right oh but see here's the thing electrons electrons give you exactly what you need because you know if we do this math for an electron let's bring this one back down if we do this math for an electron well i'm going to use ah i thought i had the middle one so if i have an electron let's suppose i have an electron that is um electron i'm gonna say i accelerate it over 100 volts i'm going to take an electron i'm going to put it over 100 volts i'm going to give it some kinetic energy right so its kinetic energy is then going to equal 100 ev right okay so now i've got an electron moving with a kinetic energy that's 100 ev now you can convert this to joules and you can set this equal to one-half mv squared right mass of the electron times its velocity squared and then once you have the velocity so you get the v and then once you have that you get the momentum the p right and then once you have that you get the wavelength right so i can go now from like something that's easy to do 100 volts is a lot but in a lab safe not in your dorm you could apply 100 volts to an electron get it going at this speed and once you know the speed you know the momentum and if you know mv then you know its wavelength and that in that case from this relationship you would get that it's about 0.12 nanometers but look at this the wavelength of a simply accelerated electron is right where i need it it's right where i need it it's an angstrom right so now i think if i take advantage of the wavelengths of the wave nature of electrons and i shine them on materials then i can see materials that way and i can see them at that scale and we do that all the time all the time in in many many different areas of technology and of research today we use electrons to image in fact the best images you can get are made with electrons right um here's an example of using uh scanning what's called a scanning electron microscope right so you see a butterfly but you want to really see a butterfly or we can go even further and instead of just drawing pictures of this these beautiful materials made of carbon those are called nanotubes these are called this is called graphene it goes in tight it's a single sheet of carbon atoms one atom thick material notice with these materials every single atom is a surface atom that's pretty cool they also have lots of other cool properties and i'll give you examples throughout you know in other other lectures of how these kinds of materials can be used but for now i'm talking about seeing them and this is what happens when you actually look at them with an electron that's a nanotube and here is a picture of graphene the only reason we can see graphene is because we have electrons and we take advantage of the wave nature of those electrons we say well okay but why does that matter well that matters tremendously because one of the first experiments that really did what feynman what richard feynman wanted richard feynman predicted the the field of nanotechnology 50 years ago he gave a famous speech at caltech it's called there's plenty of room at the bottom he's also an amazing teacher and he taught actually the double slit experiment i highly recommend you googling that lecture and he said that you know someday you can put the atom where you want right and the first time that was done was in 1989 by ibm they had 35 z9 atoms they moved them around the point is you couldn't realize nanotechnology you couldn't realize the ability to actually move atoms if you can't see them right and so this you know the ability to see what you were doing changed everything it changed everything and you know nature had been doing this and i love these examples so you know nature has been doing nanotech for a long time right so you have the inner ear of the frog it's a cantilever that uh sensitive to a few nanometers of movement the frog can actually hear that you've got features in the ant's eye i love the the silk moth the male silk moth has a single molecule detection system on board that can sense a single molecule pheromone it can detect a female silk moth two miles away two miles away we have nothing like that we have no technologies like that i can't even tell if someone's in the next room i have to look at my phone or something this is because of nanotechnology that kind of detection system right but it was the ability to see atoms and molecules with electrons that that kind of blew open this entire field right and it's made it so that we can now try at least to rival nature here's one example you're not just seeing graphene but check this out you're seeing a single atom of graphene and you're seeing what happens under a certain kind of ra irradiation and you're seeing this whole and you're seeing the whole grow and that's really important because something i care a lot about our membranes right and another why this matters i'll tell you about membranes but here you know i'm actually making the thinnest possible membrane that that you could make because it's only one atom thick and i'm controlling how i make that but i would never know what my controls do if i couldn't see it in real time right so this is this is my my why this matters it's seeing things at this scale you
