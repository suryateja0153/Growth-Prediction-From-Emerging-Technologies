Wang and dr. Cardy for the invitation great pleasure to be here it's my first time so I heard so much about the Waterloo a serial for nanotechnology the nano technology program and the graduate program at Waterloo and we tried actually to push you away at the time to to emulate you know the Waterloo but didn't have the courage I must say because it's a very courageous step and it's one of a kind in in in the world not just Canada so today I'm going to tell you about this materials how how we engineer materials using supramolecular chemistry and how we can a janier function in those materials using principles of supramolecular chemistry I'm sure many of you may have heard about sporran chemistry or self-assembly some rag and dwell on on that in this presentation that in itself is a very interesting philosophical question but that's something that will transpire through my presentation AG stands for supramolecular desk at assembly group that's my group this is our logo so the these are some of the applications of those materials that I'm going to describe in this presentation we have generated applications in catalysis especially cross-coupling chemistry we have decorated these nanotubes with with with the poor friends we can have multiple porphyrins on the surface of these nanotubes to mimic photo systems bacteria photosystems we have looked at coatings for implantable medical devices bone and stands medical stands and we have looked at tissue engineering cartilage tissue heart tissue and bone tissue regeneration we also use these materials for for blocking cancer cells growth this is in vitro study and we have shown that when this negative are decorated with the appropriate functionalities they can bind to the surface of this cancerous cell and induce the apoptotic pathway leading to programmed cell death here is another aspect of this work where we combine multiple nanotubes to display multiple functions so we can target specific cells or tissues so this is in a nutshell the type of applications that were we have been involved in there are two or three other applications in oil and that petrochemical industry that I was involved with when I was in Alberta but there are not covered here so the outline of my presentation is shown here I'm going to tell you about these nanotubes their design a characterization their functionalization we are show you some structural analogs and I will if we have time we'll go through one or two biomedical applications how much time do I have okay all right so imagine a geometrical figure that has the ability to spontaneously form a ring a super macrocycle the notion of supermarket cycle is not new in supercooled chemistry it was introduced by Jean Marilyn in France Nobel laureate and the George Whitesides at Harvard many years ago Steve Zimmerman urbana-champaign and the Hamilton when he was at Yale so this this notion of taking molecules and assembling them into certain structures is that new but what I found interesting is that if you take a molecule that has this shape and create a circular structure this circular structure ought to express a new set of properties physical properties and if carefully chosen you can induce this structure to ender go yet another level of self-organization which may we may refer to as hierarchical step of super bleecker organization where now the ring serves as a template for another ring and forms a tubular stack that you can compare to this dynamic tower this is a proposed actually architectural real macro structure that was never built but you can see that the academic designed this tower was planning to allow each floor to rotate freely 360 degrees such that each owner of an apartment in this building will have a 360 view of the surrounding scene but what's interesting for me in this architecture is that it is actually quite similar to to this one in the sense that it can have a helical organization and this one is a right-handed helical structure or super helical structure or we can have segments of hilly city or it can be completely disordered it turns out that in the molecular or macro molecular scale molecules are they talk to each other they two for them to be randomly organized in this fashion in a tubular stack or stack of this sort is almost impossible the worst-case scenario there will be segments of order and maybe some segments of disorder but it turns out that in reality based on a number of experiment we have done that this architecture actually assumes a helical organization and we have published a whole bunch of papers on that and just the chirality of the system could be the subject of one hour lecture so I'm not going to get into the discussion so how do we go about making molecules of this kind we started from the natural DNA bases guanine and cytosine and we replaced the imidazole on the guanine molecule by this cytosine base so we ended up with a G C base this is a non-natural base that has no equivalent in nature and it the only relevance so to speak to the two DNA is that it presents a donor donor acceptor of hydrogen bonds and acceptor acceptor donor of hydrogen bonds so it is self complementary and because of its geometry it can undergo and under the appropriate terminal condition you can undergo a self-assembly you can modify this molecule such that you can insert additional ring between the G and the C phase and I will show you the purpose of that in the next few slides so when this molecule is put in water under neutral conditions or even a acidic or even slightly basic conditions it spontaneously forms a ring maintained by 18 hydrogen bonds and because of the like I said the geometry of this molecule the only way for this molecule to satisfy its hydrogen bonding arrays is to close the ring to form a circular structure maintained by this hydrogen bond and we establish this architecture using solid-state NMR thanks to Arthur and rod resolutions 900 the solid-state megahertz instrument at NRC Ottawa we actually have gotten and this work has not been published yet but it will appear soon this is really the first example we're sorry state enema was used in in this and this type of architectures so we're very happy with this results i'm going to take you through this very quickly so if you take an NMR spectrum of this molecule in solution well it starts by some sharp peaks and then within a few minutes it's completely flat and that's because it forms large aggregates so we decided to move towards solid-state NMR to to to overcome this problem but solid-state NMR you know not any sort of silly remark can handle this we actually worked with 21 Tesla instrument the 900 megahertz instrument at NRC and we looked at the measuring angle and spinning the the NMR tube at 60 kilo Hertz that's extremely fast and the NMR spectra that you can get with any of those conditions are almost solution like spectra but in addition to that what we have done is what we re synthesize this molecule with n 15 labeled atoms so we replaced all these nitrogens here with n 15 ok and n 15 is a NMR active so you can get very very nice spectra and 15 spectra so what you see in this slide is about six years of work and about six or seven people including three postdocs in the mix so what we try to establish basically is that there is this hydrogen bonding erase that there is actually some correlation between these protons here connected with this green bars that there is a true bond correlation between and six which will establish unequivocally that this is a hydrogen bond structure in a circular fashion entry and n-6 can not see each other intramolecularly because they are separated by three bonds okay three carbons the only offer them to actually talk to each other is through bonds and the only way for them to do that is by forming this triple hydrogen bond and so these are some of the spectra so first of all if you look at the top left in the a here what you see there is a proton and on in B is the n15 solid-state NMR spectra look how sharp those Peaks are it's remarkable so this can be assigned from the correlation Peaks observed in the the 2d proton and 15 heteronuclear correlation spectrum the Hector spectrum shown here so this is an N fifteen proton correlation spectrum and you can correlate who is connected to what and from that you can tell assign each one of this each one of of the peaks in the protons a special so now one thing the first thing that you notice in the spectrum is that there is a peek here that is at about 32 13.7 ppm and in this field if you are working in the hydrogen bonding area 13.7 ppm is usually the result of a hydrogen bond and intermolecular hydrogen bond okay and so that was one indicator the second thing that you should notice is that there are series of correlations between H a HH b HB hdhd HC that are shown in this 2 D spectrum okay so that's further evidence that this protons are actually in a in a space close to each other especially this proton here and this proton here on the same molecule this proton cannot see this one because it's too far from it so the only way it can talk to it is if it is intramolecular okay the third thing to notice in this spectra is that the proton and 15 2d Hector shows a week but a significant correlation between HB and h and n 3 this is n 3 nitrogen 3 and this is HB on the other nitrogen face in it and there is a very nice correlation there and so that's another indication and the fourth that there are two more indications that really establish this structure by solid-state NMR the n 15 and 15 to the DQ correlation spectrum which is shown here so this is n 15 f15 correlation spectrum shows a a correlation between nitrogen 3 and nitrogen 6 nitrogen 3 and nitrogen 6 can talk to us are only again through space and this is a true space to the correlation spectrum and finally the n 15 and 15 2d inadequate spectrum shown here shows a very clear correlation between this is a true bond correlation between nitrogen 3 and nitrogen 6 and then there's a whole bunch of other things the paper is going to appear hopefully in the very near future we have a scone and the reviewer right now so and you will see the additional details that we have in support of this structure but beyond NMR there's also x-ray powder diffraction what you can see here is the the peaks that are characteristic of a hexagonal unit cell with a parameter lattice parameter of 26.5 action which corresponds to the dimension that you will expect for a structure of this kind this particular display CBC here 3.5 corresponds to the stacking distances between the D rosette structures but if you are not really a believer we also have x-rays structure where that shows the six-membered ring maintained by 18 hydrogen bonds so this is a very nice proof further proof of the organization that I told you this is just a model to show how the rosette stacks come together and this one was functionally with lysine amino acid on the surface three and a half nano meter diameter three nanometer core diameter and one nanometer inner diameter this red dots dotted area corresponds actually to water and i'll show you how water actually plays a very important role in this architecture and its formation here is just an animation to show you how the self-assembly process takes place this is a molecular dynamics simulation that one of my colleagues generated perhaps is a little bit long so I'm going to accelerate it just to show you how the molecules come together and form a tubular structure this is a side view and the one on the right is a top view of the same so the way he did this is by actually doing a molecular dynamics simulation raising the temperature in silico breaking structure basically as an increase in temperature and then playing the process backward so what you see here is the the backward process of breaking the nanotubes so if we believe in reversibility this should be true for the formation and the TM image is is here what you can see here each one of this lines corresponds to an individual to they can be extremely long some of them actually we cannot find the end of the tube so long that we you know on on one particular area of a TM grade you don't see the end of the tube but you can control the length by playing with the concentration and the solvents and and also the chemistry what we put on the surface of this all these narratives and you can see that they're monodisperse three and a half nanometers in this case and across the entire entire grid what question that I get all the time is the following what make you what what makes you certain that the structure is actually a stack because when you think about a stack the first thing you think about is that it can fracture very easily whereas a helical structure will be much more stable if you create a helical structure of this kind it should be more stable or even better if you create a double helical structure of this kind you take two of these and just whine them and maybe you can even offset them a little bit so that you can minimize the repulsion interactions you can create a fairly stable structure the reason I don't believe in this structure and we did a lot of molecular modeling and calculation on the system and published it in chem phys chem if you are interested in the details of these calculations the helical structure is not viable because the n plus 6 unit is going to sit right on top of the first unit or this one for example and because of the repulsion you're going to have nitrogen sitting on nitrogen carbon on carbon oxygen oxygen those are going to be repulsive interactions so that's not a viable option so I challenged my my my collaborator that this is not viable I said okay well why don't we take two of these and offset them by 30 degrees such that we can have the advantage of a stack and the strength of a helix I said you get me there you're right so let's see what what the calculations tell us it turns out that the helix is less stable than stack but and when you look at the when you break down the energies into internal energy salvation energies you find that the actual internal energies are not favorable but that the the book of the energy actually is coming from salvation you'll find that the stacking structure is more stable however when you take a double helix the double helix is as stable as the stack at least according to these calculations and so the only way for us at that point was to go to the STM to the molecular verve and see if we can see these molecules and see we can resolve the structure and indeed in in this image here these are there are four tubes here single tube here this is the current profile and from the current profile we can see we can get the the exact dimension in this case is 3.2 nanometers you can see that the current profile drops in the middle because the tubes are are hollow we can see that there is an increase in current conductivity in in the periphery of the tube that's probably due to the charges on this side change and a higher current density here probably due to the basis or now on and that make up the roses but what's interesting is that you see the striations as you can see also here those striations are actually distanced by by about not by three and a half action but by seven actions and that tells us that the STM actually can see one stack and and misses the next stack and the reason it misses the next stack is because the next stack is rotated by about 28 or 29 degrees and so the current profile when it reaches that rotated disk is such that it shows an indentation in the in the in the structure and this give us further evidence that the structure is not helical it is actually a stack and we have additional images in support of this as well so let's look at the self-assembly mechanism these structures come together through through stacking interactions hydrogen bond in London dispersion forces and so on but it's very hard to believe the small molecule the size of a base you put it in water and it manages to come together into a ring if you take DNA for example and for those of you are working with nucleic acids a double helix if it's not more than 12 or 15 nucleotide it's not going to form a double helix right because it's not enough hydrogen bonding in there to hold the structure together okay and then you have the charges on the outside that are going to pull those strands away from each other and we have charges too so what's bringing this structure together and and the question it's the answer is is multifaceted there's no one answer one quick answer to that question but I'll give you some elements of answers to this so for instance you what you can see here is as the self-assembly takes place there's a drop in the Association free energy and that's because of the hydrogen bonding but if you break down this hydrogen bonding and it is such an energy that you have here going down as the number of steps increases it's only because of the solvation free energy the actual internal energy increases the basis I actually don't like to come together because there there's electrostatic repulsion but because this ovation of the base the hydrophobic base is so it's so strong that compensate for this repulsive force and you end up with association that's one thing the second thing is the templating if you were to take a ring and six units and assemble them separately you take this six unit symbol separately from the other ring each time you assembly there is a drop in energy but the drop of energy is greater if the first ring acts as a template for the second ring so there is a templating effect it is a there is a the auto catalytic process so to speak a ring One Ring catalyzes the growth of the next ring and here again it's also due to this salvation free energy that drives the self-assembly process so and there's a gain and you can see that the gain increases as the troops get longer so there's a cooperative effect longer the tube becomes the higher the gain in energy will be cup and this is the number of rosettes and this is the stack in free energy and so this actually validated some of the work that we have done many years earlier on the safe assembly process of the system so this is a very detailed kinetic study that you can you can read in jax to publish many years ago where we established that the process of self assembly is actually what we call a superb little chain reaction where the the nanotube itself catalyzes its own formation through fracture so to Forbes it fractures into smaller pieces and each piece act as a template to grow additional tube and so we have an exponential growth of this nanotubes and the growth is constant it's continuously happening in solution so that's why the structures actually stable at least they appear stable the water I told you plays a key role and we look at the salvation of these nanotubes you'll find that there is actually water lining up the inner walls of this negative but there's also a layer of water this one string of water molecules going down this tube we have seen these water molecules by NMR thanks to solid-state NMR instrument at at the NRC we can see one peak for for the six molecules at 7p p.m. and the other one at 1 ppm water by NMR normally appears around 4.8 so the shield initialed in effect that you see here for this to bound and light slightly bound molecules is clearly the result of this interaction with the the nanotubes and that water contributes point 5 kilocalories per mole per water molecule so you can imagine that for six molecules of water per disc and with thousands of discs you end up gaining tremendously in energy so this is structural water and in bartow system it's known that water can also play a stabilizing effect on on structures these are just the water molecules organized inside the channel and we identified specific water molecules where we can see the hydrogen bonding of the water molecule with the carbonyl of one disk and another carbonyl of the next disc so this bridging effect is stitching effect actually stabilizes the structure alright that's enough for structure now let's look at some chemistry how many chemists are in the audience one two three four or five six okay so this might be of interest to you Chris you're gonna have to go to sleep maybe for a few minutes okay so so the chemistry i'm going to go through it really quickly because really much of this stuff has already been published and and the chemistry is what we call bucket chemistry we can do this in hundred grams quantities although it's these are log syntheses each step is you know very nicely established so we can do SNA are this is an erratic new feeding substitution or cross coupling chemistry and to introduce substitutions here or we can do reductive amination deprotection alkylations to introduce functionalities in in that side so this is the standard the first process that we have developed we can make these molecules literally in 40 50 gram quantities starting from 500 grams of of bug rhetoric acid and in 12 steps 11 steps here I about it depends how we count steps some of them actually without purification so about 11 steps you can obtain this this molecule in good yields and then once you obtain this molecule here you can break you can oxidize this double bond first you protect the base with with a book and then you with awesome tetroxide and some pariah date you can convert this alkene to aldehyde and then do a whole bunch of reductive amination reactions and from that we made literally over 200 derivatives of this molecule and it's very compatible with anything that has an amino group can be attached to to this molecule and we can make itself a sample so the functionality is that you can get all these tubular structures is is virtually unlimited if you have a target or users for one of these tubes and you want a functionality you let us know and we'll provide it for you so so this is these are some of the amino acid that we have played with these are some larger molecules you can see her c64 friends you have crown ethers you have equity in type molecules you have long chain substituent c12 molecules you have ligands for metals distr pyridine or this type of ligand here a pyridine fluorinated molecules and so on and so forth also we made a legal team functionalized nanotubes for example this one here with six style fins attached to the tube on the surface has the same conductivity upon self-assembly as polythiophene so it's basically the electric organic conductor but without self-assembly it's not a conductor it's only a positive assembly that those tile Finn's become organized on the surface and serves as conduit for four electrons we also attached longer peptides so this one here is the right from the from the bone morphogenetic protein seven bmp-7 specifically from the knocker region responsible for the biological activity this is one of the peptide that we have synthesized there are a number of others that we have synthesized for that region this is a KR s are peptide used for bone regeneration and this is an rgd rgd binds to integrate receptors on cells and it's a integrins are present on essentially all living cells cross-coupling chemistry is another approach i'm not going to take you the into the actual chemistry so to speak but we can from this building block here we can generate this structure and the X group can now functionalized with an R group and the are groups that we can make our numerous i'll give you a table of that here so these substitutes are one can be any one of these substitutes here and the point of this synthesis when we made these molecules was to tweak the electronic properties of this base so that we can use the tool that come out of this in organic photovoltaics and you can see that we have put here electron donors electronic scepters conjugated molecules and so on so that gives us a way to tweak the homo-lumo bandgap of this molecule and hence the ability of the 22 can that electrons or holes okay enough for the synthesis so now let's go to the structural analogues of this of these nanotubes how far can we take this concept and here are some examples remember in one of the slides earlier i told you that we can instead of having a bicyclic system we can design a system that is a try cyclic or even tetracyclic okay and each time you add a ring in this in this molecule this juicy motif you are effectively affecting the energy levels of that molecule okay and the electronic states of that molecule and with that the ability of that self-assemble structure to carry electrons or holes so that was our reasoning we said if we can take this all the way to something that looks like pentacene we can have an organic conductor in one dimension okay so there's a whole bunch of organic conductors but when you assemble them it's just a material it's a 2 or 3 D 2 dimensional conducting materials there's no such thing as a one dimensional organic conductor and this is this is was one of the our biggest goal for for a number of years and and we haven't reached that goal yet but we are getting closer and closer so this is the the parent molecule with one nanometer inner diameter when we double the number of hydrogen bonds that each that each one of these molecules can make we can generate you that are extremely stable and I'll tell you what we can do with those so this one's for example don't melt in water even a hundred degrees Celsius John we talked about those protein the virus viral particles and the stability to about 80 degrees or so this one's behave just like those those viral particles this one melts at about 80 85 degrees Celsius this 100 degree Celsius they're still there and so because of that stability we can now do a lot of other things with this material if you add one more ring here you end up with 1.4 nanometer in a diameter and if you have one portfolio mirror in the diameter now you can start functionalizing here and convert the hydrophilic character of this tube into a extremely hydrophobic interior so you go from hydrophilic to essentially carbon nanotube interior for this for this system here okay because it has this ethyl group on this ring that's points towards the interior of the channel so the water that used to be trapped here is no longer there or not as tightly bound in this system here you have different kinds of interaction holdings tubular structure together the tetra cycle will take us to 1.79 Emerson we completed this synthesis and we actually already published one of the papers on one of the synthesis of of this system so we can we have this leverage here to to control the the diameter of the of the nanotubes and at the same time play with their electronic states that we have also minimalist design this is a four-step synthesis of this night remember i talked about 11 12 steps before now we can do it in four steps and generate a molecule in thirty percent yield and from that we can start functionalizing this molecule using exactly the same type of chemistry and create a this one is a bright blue fluorescence nanotube when you shine UV light on it it emits that beautiful blue light in solution I don't have pictures of that but it falls beautiful nanotubes as you can see in this picture here so this one here is here this one here and this one is here so so we can control the inner diameter of these nanotubes and would like to start filling these nanotubes with a whole bunch of different things actually this was published a long time ago I'm going to skip the synthesis of this you don't need to look at more synthesis but my group does a lot of chemistry love organic chemistry to make these molecules and I realize in retrospect how how risky that was when I started my career because you know synthesis that took us three years before we actually knew that the molecule was going to self-assemble but it was very rewarding at the end of the day so what I mentioned something about conductivity earlier and how we can alter the electronic properties of the molecule by adding a ring in the system so this is the tricyclics system with lysine amino acid on the surface this is the tube when you because of increased size of the module the outer diameter has also increased to 4.3 from 3.4 nanometers okay the inner dam is 1.4 nanometers this one is one nanometer so these are identical the only difference is that this one has one extra ring right here between the G and the C phase and it forced beautiful tubes as you can see here AFM sem TM sem but what's interesting about this system i will publish this in jax couple years ago is that as the self-assembly takes place we start seeing this beautiful sharp band towards the red around 390 1095 nanometers and that band you are in teams workers group you know probably what j aggregates are this is a signature of a j-type ideas and one way to establish the radius j gauges have argued to do steady state fair since studies and we did and the stock shift that we obtained for that j band is only about five to ten nanometers which suggests reinforce or confirms that that this is indeed a g-type aggregate furthermore if you were to record the city spectrum of this of this self-assemble structure at that particular band this here at three hundred ninety or so the ellipticity that will measure at that site is the highest ever record for any helical met so it has a motor ellipticity of about 3 to 4 million it's about 10 times higher than the highest known in literature which was published some years ago by Tomcats at Columbia University using Hailie scenes that form this also this helical structures so optically is also very it becomes a very very interesting structure and this is a very simple alteration so I'm really really really curious to know what the Tetra cycle is going to give us because we have looked at the physical properties of the system yet but we anticipate that this band here the 409 nervous probably shift to about 450 or 500 nanometers and maybe this one type sister will go up by perhaps five tenfold and probably the material will become close to a semi conductor you know a good semiconductor molecule so this concludes this particular part now the internal functionalization that i mentioned earlier allows us to encapsulate all kinds of molecules we can also think about catalysis applications or insulated nanowires but in terms of this is just the chemistry I'm going to skip that this is the cross section of that too with the ethyl groups in the middle that line up the walls of this hydrophobic core suggests images of those same nanotubes as you can see by afm SEM and TEM the deform beautiful nanotubes they also give a very nice J band is a weaker in this case but it's there and we have nice CD spectrum but we also can use these molecules to encapsulate drugs such as this this anti-cancer agent Biggs a methyl zone and tamoxifen so we can not only capture but also release over a certain period of time we have looked in detail in the kinetics of this process but that's something that we'll acquires to do more studies but suffice it to say that because of the hydrophobic character we can encapsulate hydrophobic molecules and we can release them slowly the kinetic of that process is still under study so this is the largest inner diameter one that I mentioned earlier the tetra cycle and the chemistry was published recently I'm not going to take you through that I'm going to skip this chemistry slides and take you basically this is the the final structure that we have obtained I'm going to take you directly to to the tuning of the stability of these nanotubes all right so after this I'll have to accelerate a little bit so when I started my talk I mentioned this particular GC motif with lysine amino acid and that forms a rosette in this system what I have done we have done in our group is incorporate 2 GC motif through a spacer or linker into a single molecule so this molecule expresses 2 GC motives in other words the ability to form 12 hydrogen bonds instead of six hydrogen bonds and when this molecules have assembled it forms a twin rosette one rosette on top of the other connected covalently by this little bridges so there is stitched together by six bridges so this entity here is maintained by well 36 hydrogen bonds instead of 18 hydrogen bonds it's a double number of hydrogen bond and as a result it also forms choose but these tubes are much less congested on the surface as you can see this one relative to this one less congestion let's charge ok let's stay up your portion less electrostatic repulsion makes this narrative extremely stable and when you look at the melting studies this is the CD spectrum of the one with only one ring at a time it melts at 85 degrees Celsius and when you call it goes back to the initial CD spectrum this one here at 95 degrees as basically in a cell when water starts literally to boil there is a decrease of the CD spectrum about forty percent and then we could it down goes back to its natural state it's so stable that we said let's try something interesting can we use these nanotubes to select car chiral carbon nanotubes separation of carbon nanotubes this address is surely right now carbon nanotubes separation is is a challenge and you know you get this you get these beautiful materials but their function depends on the ecology whether they are conducted non-conductor semi-conductor depends on their chirality and the idea that we had is can we use these nanotubes because they are Carol to capture one particular set of those carbon nanotubes and it worked so what we've done here a we this is just an animation of the self assembly process of the GC motifs around one carbon nanotubes this is a 66 single walled carbon nanotube was prepared by colleague at Texas Tech University mark green and we studied the optical properties at los alamos national labs and established that indeed there is a direct encapsulation of these nanotubes but I have visual image of that where we have rosette nanotubes this is actually holy carbon for this way familiar with TM there are there are areas where the carbon film is is broken and so when you have a resistant attitude that crosses those those breaks it vaporizes because organic material organic matter where as carbon nanotubes that are metallic they don't vaporize under the electron beam and so as the rosin and the governor to inside resist as you cross the this broken parts of the film the organic matter vaporizes but the carbon nanotubes stay between the two parts of the film so such that this led us to further confirm that the carbon answers are indeed encapsulated inside this rosette nanotubes here is another type of interaction where we speculated that the rosette managers are actually growing perpendicularly to a carbon nanotube in this fashion and because of the hydrophobic nature of the surface this is just a TM image showing 1 rosette nanotubes with a carbon nanotube in the middle this is just more images showing the same we have you can see the carbon nanotubes here and the organic matter on on each side but the best image in my view is this one where we can actually see a carbon nanotube and a rosette nanotube basically around so this is a hetero structure that has been peeled in this particular segment so so this is for the evidence that we can encapsulate governor now we can think about potential biomedical applications those ultra short for example carbon nanotubes could be encapsulated inside disorders managers and delivered to a particular target and we can use perhaps a ferret radiation to induce a local ablation of cancerous tissue or some other targets with the same latitude that are now extremely state what can we do we started looking at growing nanoparticles on the on the surface and here we basically take that stable system and what we do is we add the metal and normally when we started we started to add in a reducing agent like hydrazine or it turns out that later on we don't need the reducing agent we can do an electrolysis the position of the metal on the surface of this rosette nanotubes and obtain this type of structures so in this case is palladium or gold palladium and platinum and you know when we do electrodes the position the size is one point 21 with a very very narrow distribution this is a dark field image that shows the particles on the rosette nanotubes and you can see that the particles grow only on the nanotube the mechanics of this process is very very fascinating and we published the gold system but we haven't published the platinum and palladium system yet so this is just additional images showing that this is a site-specific nucleation growth and morphogenesis of nanoparticles and that they are organized in a non-random way there are about 1.4 nanometer in diameter with polydispersity index of 1.0 for which led us to suspect that this gold particles are actually Schmidt's cluster gold 55 which has exactly one preferred nanometer dimer in an aluminum area in in diameter but in addition to that Schmidt's cluster structure of which was published in science just four or five years ago has actually 12 coordination site on a surface stabilized by bayi can stabilized by phosphines for example and it turns out actually that on the surface of our nanotubes that there are actually 12 coordination sites where we can capture this gold 55 and stabilize them so bind to them we grow them there they go until they reach 55 and then that's a magic number for world all clusters and and and it's it's it's stabilized and that the model that we came up with and published is this one here where we have a zigzag structure so now we can label these nanotubes with gold palladium or platinum but we can also label them with other type of molecules in this case mag 3 that can bind technician so we can respect imaging this one is SF SF b which has a fluorine gap before in 18 so for another type of imaging this one is fitc as fluorescent label so you can the fluorescence imaging so in summary for this this presentation so far is that we have materials that are synthetically accessible chemically physically and barley tunable they are biocompatible we have established that in a number of systems in animal models as well they are non-toxic they are multifunctional so we can incorporate functionalities either to target a particular cell or to kill the particular cell we can do a targeted delivery by by targeting specific receptors and we can encapsulate certain cargos and deliver it in specific specific tissues so I could stop here or I could tell you about it I RNA delivery so very either do I have a couple minutes five minutes okay so this is a so so what we've done here is we we took those nanotubes functionalize them with the since we now know how to function lies them and play with them and control the charge on the surface we thought that SAR the delivery and you look at literature on a siren delivery it's basically polymers cationic polymers and what we have been making all these years is basically kathai cationic polymers the only difference is that they are they are non covalent structures they are self-assemble structures and so we can do we can capture so the idea basically is that if we take our and cheese vs nanotubes with lysine amino acid on the surface we can effectively complexes rrna and protect it from biological degradation so that's key number one to prevent degradation assignor which is very very sensitive to two rnases so we know that art isn't safe efficient carries we know that our energies can mediate effectives RNA silencing and but we don't know yet if they can have a therapist in capacity so that's something that we need to explore so this is the the knowledge that we have investigated we took the very stable system that i mentioned earlier with the two bases and attached up to 15 lysine amino acid on surface from one to 15 so we made 15 different nanotubes and we looked at the self-assembly process and this paper just the sentence of this molecules and the study we are going to be on the cover of nano scale in a couple months so just the characterization of this material now in terms of the application we can combine them with we take the slicing functionalized we add our GD to them and we end up with the rgd functionalized nan og to target specific tissues and then we take them to cells ok we take acid RNA those nanotubes it's already labeled with green fluorescence and we look at how those nanotubes behave in the presence of certain cells we looked at about at least at least two dozen cell lies this one is mesenchymal stem cell this one is a primary human fibroblast kidney cells so this is weed out the nanotubes these three here and this is with the nanotubes you can see the green fluorescence close to the nucleus that is shown in blue the so the nuclei are labeled in in blue another series of so this human breast cancer this is human contour sarcoma cells this is an epithelial if you skin cell cancer here's an another family of cells this is rad astrocyte mouse macrophages this is primary chicken liver cells and in each case the the the RNA goes in essentially with 98 to ninety-nine percent efficiency so it's a it's a remarkable system or even tested in an animal model and it goes in we can the imaging of the asa RNA as it binds to its target cells so with that I'd like to close with a quote from Leonardo da Vinci where nature finishes produces all species men and women this is the colloquial man begins using natural things and with the help of this nature to create an affinity of species thank you ah what do we want to do that I mean what you're proposing is it's extremely interesting this is sort of thing I'd like to do if I could live for 200 years and and just one of the things I will probably do at some point in my life but what we're trying to do to reach that that specific aim is to to control the growth of the tubes in a in a way that you control the synthesis of that you use DNA synthesizers to control the length of a DNA double helix to be more precise if you can take the GC base and turn it into a phosphoramidite okay and the automated DNA synthesis into an oligomer okay that oligomers you can incorporate functionality anyway you want in that structure and when it self-assembles it will position those functionalities exactly where you want them in other words you have perfect control in that case and we made the phosphoramidite but we are still far away from getting the right protecting groups for DNA synthesis so far the stability you come at the hospital you know you have a one slice imagine that you can increase temperature then forces this example right yep yeah we can do NMR in solution but what you see is not the self-assembled structure will be our a when we did NMR was to look at the hydrogen bond network if you heat it up you're going to break it you get a beautiful spectra yeah in terms by NMR I mean what if you take if you take this they say nanotubes that is assembled okay if you put an NMR spectrum in an NMR tube you're not going to see anything by NMR okay because of all the dipolar couplings okay and if you break the structure because it's just line broadening it just broadens and becomes completely flat ok when you if you if you heat the sample let's say you do the experiment in DMSO or even in water heated you break the structure into molecules or small aggregates then you start seeing the managers and we'll publish that we can we have actually to the NMR spectra that show that these actually correlations supporting the hydrogen bonding we published that a long time ago did I answer your question yeah yeah I just want to know it breaks everything so the rosette man the rosette itself is a transient species the rosette is an intermediate it's not a stable entity in water it's two hydrophobic its way two hydrophobic for it to survive in an aqueous environment the only way you can see a rosette is if you functionalize it with organic substituent and put it in hexane or chloroform or dichloromethane and they have been papers shawn marion published the rosette structure he claims that he has a NMR spectrum and he sees a chemical shift around 14 ppm indicating hydrogen body a long time ago no you can't because of because of the size line broadening so what we do to do that is we we take a suspension of carbon nanotubes okay in usually in water plus a little bit of DMSO one or two percent okay so it's a suspension it's not it's not carbonated not soluble obviously in that environment and then we add the powder g0 one of our modules powder in that solution and as it dissolves it finds the carbon nanotubes it just binds to them in a in a problem probably not specific way okay and then as the safe assembly takes place on the surface of the carbon nanotubes then you start organizing the tubular structure around the carbon nanotubes so it's not taking a carbon nanotubes ins and inserting inside the resident energy you need a perhaps you can do that if we had very short carbon nanotubes yeah we can see both you know we can see both yeah I showed you a slide where we have both yeah yes all right the size of the nanoparticles so we I have actually some slides on that show you how how actually the mechanism of that work using TM and so on so the way we do it we take our our nanotubes one specific kind of nanotubes and we mix it with s rrna so we formed this large aggregates they are pretty messy and when you look at by TM you can see that they are actually large blobby areas then we before we actually use it in sales we subject it to ultrasound to break it down very important step and the time in also is very important so we break it down into smaller pieces that look like little rafts okay these are basically assemblies of rosette nanotubes it's a RNA resident energy of srna and so on so those those pieces are under 100 nanometer 100 maximum 200 nanometers and those can enter the cell value problem what kind of 10 the pathway is endocytosis endocytosis yeah it's it's a it goes into an endosome and then it's released on the other side so we looked at the we labeled amid fears and labels we can see the the tubes sticking the to the surface of the cells and then we can see them internalized we can see little dots endosomes filled with fluorescence and then it's released and then the way it makes its way to DNA I don't add 2 to the nucleus that I don't know I wish I knew the answer the question but we haven't done any a nuclear you know guiding peptides or we haven't decorated our lil choose with anything that would guide the managers to the nucleus yet but that's one of our aims but so far it works so so we're trying to understand how it works yeah yes yes it is possible because so if you ask me if we were able to remove all the water I'll tell you I don't know and probably we don't there's always liberal fire that stays the reason is because these are charged molecules that are very hygroscopic they're going to pull water from the air okay and if you want to move every trace of water you're going to have to do some drastic drying you suggested right methods one day I actually asked the student to really try everything possible to dry the sample and he and he did a long time ago and that sample in particular did not self assemble so that was a one case we didn't actually push that study too far but that led me to suspect that water probably plays a very important structural role now if you take methanol or DMSO or DMF there's always water in there even if you dry it there'll be trace of water and you don't need a lot of water for these things to come together and once the structure is formed then the role of water may no longer play a crucial role a crucial part of the of the process it's just getting that first tube to grow and then it acts as a template for its own growth I think surely want to ask a question yeah yes it's it's it's selective we tried 66 and we try i cannot remember the exact type of carbon narrative that that my colleagues tried they will try it actually at Texas Tech and Los Alamos and the only one that worked is the 66 because its diameter is about point nine nanometer but nine angstroms or so 99.1 actions something like that and our inner diameter is one point one nanometer so it's perfect size for it so in terms of chirality selection I don't have a definite answer to that we need to try a few more things but we know that we can select one type of carbon nanotubes are of at least four different care kind of cover narratives ciety said yeah 100 to 200 but not more than that can we we did so this study was done by biologists the they really don't pay attention to the material part so we give them a material and and and and the tested him and it's working but if it was done in my lab what I would do probably is look at different sample preparation methods and see how dimensions sonication time periods would have what I think they would have maybe even Asian time and so on so these are very important parameters that will allow you to tweak not only dimensions but also perhaps the effectiveness of delivery ok so the templating effect in this context is let me let me go back to that slide if you if you look at this slide here you can you can actually the paper with a period in canvas came i think in 2010 if you wanna if you want to look that up this is the difference between the two pathways the two pathways are one pathway we have one rosette and six molecules of GC base and we assemble those six molecules one at a time without interaction with this rosette okay so we just calculate the entire this little total energy of the system and so we formed the first hydrogen triple hydrogen bond then we bring in another molecule we have three molecule for molecule five and then six okay and each time you add more hydrogen bonds the energy of the system drops okay and in this case what we did instead of going going despite what we actually put the first molecule on the rosette so there's a stacking interaction okay that's stacking interaction add stabilization but also upon hydrogen bonding it brings the energy further down so from this study it is this is a modeling but we have also experimental data but from this study appears that the static in the templating of the formation of the second rosette is facilitated the energy pathway to form in the next ring after the first word is formed is easier okay so this is the templating effect yeah yep so the the experiment was published seven years earlier and and this is a friendly detailed kinetic study if you wanna if one look it up so here what we found this is this is a very very long explanation is going to take probably 10 or 15 minutes we can if you want to can explain to you after the top but briefly there are two pathways there is a fast slow pathway and a fast pathway the slow pathway is when the module is not preassembled and we have conditions under which we can prevent that ok so it's low concentration now we were very lucky in this system in a search that in a way that this module has a crown ether and this crown ether binds to this promoted from there's actually an amino acid and amino acid has an ammonium group it binds to the crown ether okay all right follow me now as soon as it binds it actually liberate this base so that it can undergo self-assembly because this current either actually hydrogen bond to the base okay so it prevents it from self-assembly when you add the amino acid it opens up the molecule and now the molecule can form a ring okay so that's what we call it a promoter it forms the ring and then itself assembles into it too and we can follow the kinetics of self-assembly very very early on and the kinetic shows a sigmoidal growth indicative of an auto catalytic process so the kinetic type the nature of the kinetic profile is in agreement with an auto catalytic process so there's initiation and then there is a right we with this was done by by fluorescence no by a circular dichroism because it's done as a very low concentration NMR is not going to take this this is sub micro molar concentration okay well I think I finished by saying that in order to measure of the interest in you talk that I haven't been able to get a question thank you please join me in back thank you
