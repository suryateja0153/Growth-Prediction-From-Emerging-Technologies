 a carbon nanotube field effect transistor CNT Fe T refers to a field effect transistor that utilizes a single carbon nanotube or an array of carbon nanotubes as the channel material instead of bulk silicon in the traditional MOSFET structure first demonstrated in 1998 there have been major developments in CNT Fe T since topic introduction and background according to Moore's law the dimensions of individual devices in an integrated circuit have been decreased by a factor of approximately 2 every 2 years this scaling down of devices has been the driving force in technological advances since the late 20th century however as noted by ITRs 2009 edition further scaling down has faced serious limits related to fabrication technology and device performances as the critical dimension shrunk down to sub 22 nm range the limits involve electron tunneling through short channels and thin insulator films The Associated leakage currents passive power dissipation short channel effects and variations in device structure and doping these limits can be overcome to some extent and facilitate further scaling down of device dimensions by modifying the channel material in the traditional bulk MOSFET structure with a single carbon nanotube or an array of carbon nanotubes topic electronic structure of carbon nanotubes the exceptional electrical properties of carbon nanotubes arise from the unique electronic structure of graphene itself that can roll up and form a hollow cylinder the circumference of such carbon nanotubes can be expressed in terms of a chiral vector c h equals na 1 plus Emma 2 which connects to crystallographically equivalent sites of the two-dimensional graphene sheet here N and M are integers and a 1 and a 2 are the unit vectors of the hexagonal honeycomb lattice therefore the structure of any carbon nanotube can be described by an index with a pair of integers n m that define its chiral vector in terms of the integers n m the nanotube diameter DT and the chiral angle theta are given by D T equals three see - see em too Plus and Plus n to pi display style D underscore t equals frac sqr t3a underscore CC s QR t m carat 2 plus MN plus n carat 2 pi theta equals tan - 1 3 n to em Plus display style theta equals tan carrot - one left frac sqr t 3 n 2 meters plus n right the differences in the chiral angle and the diameter caused the differences in the properties of the various carbon nanotubes for example it can be shown that an nm carbon nanotube is metallic when N topic M has a small gap ie semi-metallic when n M three I where I as an integer and a semiconducting when nm does not equal three I this is due to the fact that the periodic boundary conditions for the one-dimensional carbon nanotubes permit only a few wave vectors to exist around the circumference of carbon nanotubes metallic conduction occurs when one of these wave vectors passes through the K point of graphene studi hexagonal Brillouin zone where the valence and conduction bands are degenerate for the semiconducting carbon nanotubes there is a diameter dependency on bandgap for example according to a single particle type binding description of the electronic structure E equals gamma to a D T display style II underscore G equals gamma left frac to a D underscore t right where gamma is the hopping matrix element and a is the carbon carbon bond distance topic motivations for transistor applications a carbon nanotubes bandgap is directly affected by its chirality and diameter if those properties can be controlled CNTs would be a promising candidate for future nanoscale transistor devices moreover because of the lack of boundaries in the perfect and hollow cylinder structure of CNTs there is no boundary scattering CNTs are also quasi 1d materials in which only forward scattering and back scattering are allowed an elastic scattering means that free paths in carbon nanotubes are long typically on the order of micrometers as a result quasi ballistic transport can be observed in nanotubes at relatively long lengths and low fields because of the strong covalent carbon-carbon bonding in the sp2 configuration carbon nanotubes are chemically inert and are able to transport large amounts of electric current in theory carbon nanotubes are also able to conduct heat nearly as well as diamond or sapphire and because of their miniaturized dimensions the CNT Fe T should switch reliably using much less power than a silicon-based device topic device fabrication there are many types of CNT F et devices a general survey of the most common geometries are covered below topic back gate at C NT f e t--'s the earliest techniques for fabricating carbon nanotubes CNT field effect transistors involved pre patterning parallel strips of metal across a silicon dioxide substrate and then depositing the CNTs on top in a random pattern the semiconducting CNTs that happen to fall across two metal strips meet all the requirements necessary for a rudimentary field effect transistor one metal strip as the source contact while the other as the drain contact the silicon oxide substrate can be used as the gate oxide and adding a metal contact on the back makes the semiconducting CNT gate able this technique suffered from several drawbacks which made for non-optimized transistors the first was the metal contact which actually had very little contact to the CNT since the nanotube just lay on top of it and the contact area was therefore very small also due to the semiconducting nature of the CNT a Schottky barrier forms at the metal semiconductor interface increasing the contact resistance the second drawback was due to the back gate device geometry its thickness made it difficult to switch the devices on and off using low voltages and the fabrication process led to poor contact between the gate dielectric and CNT topic top gated ZN t fe tees eventually researchers migrated from the back gate approach to a more advanced top get fabrication process in the first step single walled carbon nanotubes are solution deposited onto a silicon oxide substrate individual nanotubes are then located via atomic force microscope or scanning electron microscope after an individual tube as isolated source and drain contacts are defined and patterned using high-resolution electron beam lithography a high-temperature anneal step reduces the contact resistance by improving adhesion between the contacts and CNT a thin top gate dielectric is then deposited on top of the nanotube either via evaporation or atomic layer deposition finally the top gate contact as deposited on the gate dielectric completing the process arrays of top gated CNT Fe T's can be fabricated on the same wafer since the gate contacts are electrically isolated from each other unlike in the back gated case also due to the thinness of the gate dielectric a larger electric field can be generated with respect to the nanotube using a lower gate voltage these advantages mean top gated devices are generally preferred over backdated CNT Fe T's despite their more complex fabrication process topic wraparound gate CNT f e t--'s wraparound gate CNT f e t--'s also known as gate all around C NT f ETS were developed in 2008 and are a further improvement upon the top gate device geometry in this device instead of gating just the part of the CNT that is closer to the metal gate contact the entire circumference of the nanotube is gated this should ideally improve the electrical performance of the CNT Fe T reducing leakage current and improving the device on/off ratio device fabrication begins by first wrapping CNTs in a gate dielectric and gate contact via atomic layer deposition these wrapped nanotubes are then solution deposited on an insulating substrate where the wrappings are partially etched off exposing the ends of the nanotube the source drain and gate contacts are then deposited onto the CNT ends and the metallic outer gate wrapping you topic suspended CNT Fe jeez yet another CNT Fe T device geometry involves suspending the nanotubes over a trench to reduce contact with the substrate and gate oxide this technique has the advantage of reduced scattering at the CNT substrate interface improving device performance there are many methods used to fabricate suspended znt Fe T's ranging from growing them over trenches using catalyst particles transferring them onto a substrate and then under etching the dielectric beneath and transfer printing onto a trench substrate the main problem suffered by suspended CNT Fe T says that they have very limited material options for use as a gate dielectric generally air or vacuum and applying a gate bias has the effect of pulling the nanotubes closer to the gate which places an upper limit on how much the nanotubes can be gated this technique will also only work for shorter nanotubes as longer tubes will flex in the middle and droop towards the gate possibly touching the metal contact and shorting the device in general suspended CNT Fe T's are not practical for commercial applications but they can be useful for studying the intrinsic properties of clean nanotubes topic c NT f ET material considerations there are general decisions one must make when considering what materials to use when fabricating a CNT Fe T semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes are preferred over metallic single walled and metallic multi walled tubes since they are able to be fully switched off at least for low source-drain biases a lot of work has been put into finding a suitable contact material for semiconducting CNTs the best material to date is palladium because its work function closely matches that of nanotubes and it adheres to the CNT s quite well topic IV characteristics in CNT metal contacts the different work functions of the metal and the CNT result in a Schottky barrier at the source and drain which are made of metals like silver titanium palladium and aluminum even though like Schottky barrier diodes the barriers would have made this FET to transport only one type of carrier the carrier transport through the metal CNT interface is dominated by quantum mechanical tunneling through the Schottky barrier CNT Fe T's can easily be thinned by the gate field such that tunneling through them results in a substantial current contribution CNT Fe t SR ambipolar either electrons or holes or both electrons and holes can be injected simultaneously this makes the thickness of the Schottky barrier a critical factor CNT Fe T's conduct electrons when a positive bias is applied to the gate and holes when a negative bias has applied and drain current increases with increasing a magnitude of an applied gate voltage around VG equals V DS - the current gets the minimum due to the same amount of the electron and hole contributions to the current like other FETs the drain current increases with an increasing drain bias unless the applied gate voltage as below the threshold voltage for planar CNT Fe T's with different design parameters the FET with a shorter channel length produces a higher saturation current and the saturation drain current also becomes higher for the FET consisting of smaller diameter keeping the length constant for cylindrical CNT Fe T's it is clear that a higher drain current has driven than that of planar CNT Fe T since a CNT is surrounded by an oxide layer which is finally surrounded by a metal contact serving as the gate terminal topic theoretical derivation of drain current theoretical investigation on drain current of the top gate CNT transistor has been done by kazursky and colleagues when an electric field as applied to a CNT transistor a mobile charge is induced in the tube from the source and drain these charges are from the density of positive velocity States filled by the source NS and that of negative velocity States filled by the drain nd and these densities are determined by the Fermi Dirac

the self-consistent voltage that illustrates that the CNT energy is affected by external terminal voltages and as implicitly related to the device terminal voltages and charges at terminal

iterative method according to the CNT ballistic transport Theory the drain current caused by the transport of the non-equilibrium charge across the nanotube can be calculated using the Fermi Dirac

this equation can be solved easily as long as the self-consistent voltage is known however the calculation could be time-consuming when it needs to solve the self-consistent voltage with the iterative method and this is the main drawback of this calculation topic key advantages better control over channel formation better threshold voltage better sub threshold slope high electron mobility high current density hi transconductance high linearity topic comparison to MOSFETs ce NT f e t--'s show different characteristics compared to MOSFETs in their performances in a planar gate structure the pc and TF ET produces tilde 1500 a per meter of the uncontrollably at a gate overdrive of 0.6 volts while P MOSFET produces approximately 500 a per meter at the same gate voltage this on current advantage comes from the high gate capacitance and improved channel transport since an effective gate capacitance per unit width of CNT Fe T is about double that of P MOSFET the compatibility with high K gate dielectrics becomes a definite advantage for CNT Fe T's about twice higher carrier velocity of C n TF ETS than MOSFETs comes from the increased mobility and the band structure CNT Fe T's in addition have about four times higher transconductance the first sub 10 nanometer CNT transistor was made which outperformed the best competing silicon devices with more than four times the diameter normalized current density 2.41 milli amperes per micrometer at an operating voltage of 0.5 v the inverse sub threshold slope of the CNT fe t was 94 millivolts decade topic heat dissipation the decrease of the current and burning of the CNT can occur due to the temperature raised by several hundreds of kelvins generally the self heating effect as much less severe in a semiconducting CNT fe t than in a metallic one due to different heat dissipation mechanisms a small fraction of the heat generated in the CNT fe T has dissipated through the channel the heat has non uniformly distributed and the highest values appear at the source and drain sides of the channel therefore the temperature significantly gets lowered near the source and drain regions for semiconducting C and T the temperature rise has a relatively small effect on the IV characteristics compared to silicon topic disadvantages topic lifetime degradation carbon nanotubes degrade in a few days when exposed to oxygen there have been several works done on passivating the nanotubes with different polymers and increasing their lifetime topic reliability carbon nanotubes have shown reliability issues when operated under high electric field or temperature gradients Avalanche breakdown occurs in semiconducting CNT and jool breakdown in metallic CNT unlike Avalanche behavior in silicon avalanche in CNTs as negligibly temperature dependent applying high voltages beyond Avalanche point results in dual heating and eventual breakdown in CNTs this reliability issue has been studied and it is noticed that the multi channeled structure can improve the reliability of the CNT Fe T the multi channeled CNT F ETS can keep a stable performance after several months while the single channeled CNT F ETS are usually wear out after a few weeks in the ambient atmosphere the multi channeled CNT Fe T's keep operating when some channels break down this won't happen in the single channeled ones topic difficulties in mass production production cost although CNTs have unique properties such as stiffness strength and tenacity compared to other materials especially to silicon there is currently no technology for their mass production and high production cost to overcome the fabrication difficulties several methods have been studied such as direct growth solution dropping and various transfer printing techniques topic future work the most desirable future work involved in CNT Fe T's will be the transistor with higher reliability cheap production cost or the one with more enhanced performances for example such efforts could be made adding effects external to the inner CNT transistor like the Schottky barrier between the CNT and metal contacts multiple CNTs at a single gate channel fringe capacitances parasitic source drain resistance and series resistance due to the scattering effects
