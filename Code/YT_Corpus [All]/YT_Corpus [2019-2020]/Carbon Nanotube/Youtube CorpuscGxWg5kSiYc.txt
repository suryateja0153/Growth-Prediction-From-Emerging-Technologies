 Research from Swansea University has found a way to convert Plastics into carbon nanotube material. The global plastics crisis has recently focused scientists’ attention on finding technical solutions for the ever-increasing oversupply of plastic waste. Black plastic is one of the greatest contributors to landfill waste, because it cannot be sorted using industrial practices based on optical reflection. Black plastics are commonly used as packaging for ready meals and fruit and vegetables in supermarkets. The research Team was able to do chemical-recyling of the plastics including the Black Plastics into Electrically Conductive Carbon Nanotubes Nanotubes can be used to make a huge range of things, such as conductive films for touchscreen displays, flexible electronics fabrics that create energy, antennas for 5G networks while NASA has used them to prevent electric shocks on the Juno spacecraft.
