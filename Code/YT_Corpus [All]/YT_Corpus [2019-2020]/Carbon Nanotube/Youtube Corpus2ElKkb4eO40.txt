 [Music] [Music] good afternoon again from the MIT campus Cambridge Massachusetts we welcome you to the third in our sequence of MIT C AES ILP distinguished lectures ILP is industrial Azon program here at MIT C AES is the Center for advanced educational services for those of for those of you not here presently in the audience on the MIT campus I'm delighted to report that it's early March and truthfully speaking crocuses and daffodils have shown their their sprouts we won't discuss the weather any further than that we are delighted to have with us today a true icon of MIT somebody were very proud as a member of our faculty Institute professor Millie dresselhaus she took time out of her busy schedule to join us today she's an award-winning solid-state physicist and she's done lots of service in the scientific area as well as being a world distinguished acting Domitian and researcher and teacher most recently she adds to her long list of accomplishments she's been named president-elect of the triple-a s the American Association for the Advancement of science and I guess she joins this pretty soon within the next several months she becomes officially president-elect rumor has it that if she's good at this job she then becomes president and about here and then after that chairman of the board of directors in 1998 Millie dresselhaus is the ninth woman ever to be elected to be president of the triple is a real distinction her leadership within that Association reflects a desire to foster more encouraging atmosphere for scientists and engineers in a time of shrinking and constrained public resources professor dresselhaus is a National Medal of Science winner whose research has helped unlock many mysteries particularly mysteries of carbon one of the most fundamental of organic elements and she studied various aspects of graphite and his author of a newly published comprehensive source book on fullerenes known affectionately as bucky balls or bucky tubes in fact i hadn't heard of bucky tubes i look forward to learning about them today but she's gonna show bucky balls today and this is one of the symbols this is I guess a smaller buckyball she also has a larger one she's going to show us later today that's supposed to be a joke folks yeah her current research concerns various carbon-based systems including these bucky balls and nanotubes low-dimensional thermoelectricity magnetism high-temperature superconductivity she's been at MIT even longer than I have since 1960 we don't say what I entered but it is shortly thereafter and she's been the member of the local engineering department physics department and perhaps most importantly she likes to cite that with her husband dr. gene F dresselhaus who's the theoretical physicist they have four children and three grandchildren at last count as the count change since since we heard about this okay Millie dresselhaus thank you very much for joining us today [Applause] well I'm delighted to be here and participate in this series it's really important for the professor's to get out and talk to the public including the industrial liaison members and tell you what we're doing that's so exciting today I'm going to talk about these little objects this is an object that's probably quite familiar to most of you many people play soccer so this is just a soccer ball but it is also a regular truncated icosahedron and if you imagine that at every sixth ever if each of the 60 vertices of this object is a carbon atom then we have the C 60 the fullerene the smallest fullerene that we have most common of the fullerenes and it's seven tenths of a nanometer in size which is very very small so that's what we're going to talk about and I've entitled the talk here see if we can get the even works new frontiers of carbon research well I have been involved in carbon research and now as I figure it since 1962 which is a long time but the kind of thing I've been involved with is very very different from what I'm going to talk about today which is something new and I'd like to set to cite my collaborators these people from around the world who've recent collaborators on the buckyballs and Bucky tubes and I have a list of gene Dressel houses at the who was introduced by Professor Larson plus a lot of graduate students who are currently and very recently involved with the buckyballs of related carbon objects that we've been studying in our lamp let's take a moment and think about more traditional carbon we in in the field of material science we always start out with a phase diagram because that tells you gives you some kind of scale of what's going on this particular phase diagram for carbon is especially interesting one because it was the one that was used to first synthesize diamond 1960 so this is a very long standing phase diagram and you you notice that the temperature scale here goes to very high temperature five thousand degrees Kelvin so the scale for a carbon is the highest the largest scale and temperature for any of the elements out there and on the scale and pressure is also quite large the center of the earth in these units of kilobytes of pressure thousands of killer bars of pressure so three mega bars would be the center of the earth so we're talking about high pressures and here we have diamond somewhere in here with the help of a catalyst was first synthesized in 1960 the laboratory was a great discovery now I've spent my career working with this object here which is the structure and properties of graphite which is the ground state and the equilibrium situation for carbon and it's the basis of an industry out there and all of that what I mentioned on this phase diagram was this object here I think maybe I'll try pointing down to the board as well for the people in the live audience that the three-dimensional object is as a wide gap semiconductor that's become more and more important as time goes on because of the very unusual properties that all of these carbon-based materials have there have the highest thermal conductivity for graphite the highest anti satrapy for any material so they're interesting both from a scientific standpoint as a base material a reference material something that we like to talk about in the classroom to teach students about and then we go on from there to generate other materials related to these often having some stimulus and we get ideas from these kinds of assistance well what I'm going to talk about today is based on carbon based on the phase diagram but has a little different twist and this is what we've been concerned with for the last 10 years and it has to do with a cluster so with instead of having an infinite array very large 10 to the 20th or so atoms we have a very small number then the equilibrium state is no longer the 3-dimensional or the two-dimensional graphite that I mentioned these layered sheets that are weakly hooked together nor the the diamond structure but instead we have some other structures and why is that well the science behind it is that in this structure you see we have all these edge sites these edge sites have dangling bonds those give rise to additional energy and and that's very unfavorable so if we have just a few carbon atoms the equilibrium state is not the state of a solid but is something different and if we have a very small number of atoms then they form into these kinds of structures as I'm going to show in a little while the buckyballs and another possibility of the Bucky tubes and I'm going to show those in the next view graph so the low dimensional structures which have been recently discovered until carbons around have been studied by people chemists material scientists and many folks for hundreds of years but it's only in the last 10 years that anybody has gained any insight into these odds small dimensional forms of carbon so here we have the buckyball that's c60 which is i a soccer ball that you know and the one-dimensional form which I'm going to explain later which has also has remarkable properties shown below which is the tube and that's a one-dimensional tube and you see that add the edges the ends of that one end and the other end we have half of one of these bucky balls and in between we have a cylinder of carbon atoms and believe it or not these things occur in nature so we'll find out about them and those are the remarkable new structures and i'm going to tell you some of the remarkable properties that these structures have and the end of the lecture i'll try to rush through different things to give some time to show you that people in industry are probably also have will have some interest in this in these kinds of materials because they have promised for all kinds of applications so so here is carbon and just to review what i've said we have the ground state which is graphite that's the lowest energy state that's the equilibrium phase and very close and energy is diamond with twenty millivolts above and we know that it's almost stable its metastable because you have a diamond ring it will last certainly a lifetime and then then for your grandchildren you can be quite comfortable in your heirloom properties the buckyballs bucky tubes are next in energy and there in about 30 millivolts so now why is that they're almost like graphite that's rolled up in a tube so the energy is almost the same but when you make the bucky balls you see that they have much higher energy and that's because of the curvature of the balls so so that's the general picture and so with with the very small number of atoms we gain energy by not having the edge unpaired carbon atoms but we have high curvature okay so let's now i have a my secretary and putting together the leap the poster for me in my absence because she thought it should be more accessible to the general public promised that I would tell you some other fields of interest so I said well let's have some art and here is Renaissance pre Renaissance painter and in his spare time he figured out how to assemble out of the planar objects one of these icosahedron so this is in the 15th century and Leonardo da Vinci so Leonardo who was a great talent in many fields and one of the things that he did was he made of a Bucky ball and there's mirror writing that tells you about the buckyball so and in more recent times we've had buckminster fuller here's buckminster fuller and his Bucky ball and that's a geodesic dome and in fact that's the reason that the buckyball got its name was named after buckminster fuller and then for sure it called bucky balls so that's the origin and you can see that how does the curvature comes and become about well the curvature on a Bucky ball comes about by putting in these black Pentagon's you probably never looked at the at the soccer ball in this way but the soccer ball consists of 20 hexagon hexagon faces those are the white faces and twelve Pentagon faces and the Pentagon's you could see every one of these units here with the five hexagons and the one Pentagon in the middle that's qu'ran Yuling which is a common chemical molecule that has curvature and the same curvature is that is incur annulene is also present on this cluster this motif and c60 so if you put these together then you get the buckyball so this object is of interest to all kinds of people and I had a view graph here to tell you it's Interdisciplinary I'll just say something but I won't have much time to go through all of these but the architects are interested Buckminster Fuller and the astrophysicists are interested in this because long time ago when before the fullerenes were discovered it was the astrophysicists that led to the buckyballs because of anomalies in the in the spectra out there coming from the cosmos and the chemists are interested sure the chemists are interested why because here are the bucky balls and we can append all kinds of molecules and appendages to them with all different properties and many people believe that there's a whole science out there and in technology that's derived from fullerene derived molecules and and solids so you could see all kinds of phenyl groups and oxygens and whatever here now I'll say more about that later another thing that you can do with these fullerenes you can shine light on them and when you do that they find each other and they bond in this way so we still have the same c60 atom here and 60 carbon atoms there but if they're properly aligned then they come together in such a way let me borrow professor Larson's ball here I don't have to the same size but they bind together and they come together in the right orientation and they come closer together than actually the carbon-carbon distance on the ball and so they form this polymerized state and I'll tell you some applications based on this so this is very interesting that you can do this and it's a headache one one hand because sometimes you want to do optical experiments and you put on too much light and you fry the samples but on the other hand you can use this to make some devices in the laboratory well if you want to have to find out a little bit more about Bucky balls and and Bucky tubes so we have a new book that's just come out from Academic Press and expands greatly on what I'm going to tell you here well first I'll have some make a couple of comments that might engage the mathematics people in the audience know mathematicians already know this but this is good for kids I'd like to explain a fundamental aspect of these buckyballs that was essential and of great importance in in their first identification how do we know we have buckyballs and it was through a specter of course of some sort that we found this out so what should we look for and the Euler theorem that goes back to the seven early 1700s tells us about this so what does the Euler theorem say it says here that it's given up up here it says the number of faces F plus the number of vertices V is equal to the number of edges plus two and that's true for all closed polyhedra now if the polyhedra have the polygons of the polyhedra happened to be Pentagon's and hexagons P and H and that all faces F is equal to P plus h that gives us one equation and then the number of edges so and that's shared up here you can see that every time you have an edge like here it's shared by two polygons so tui is equal to five P plus 6h plus hexagon has six edges of course and for the the vertices likewise that each vertex is shared by three polygons and the number of vertices for the Pentagon's is five by hexagons of six so we get then three equations and three unknowns you solve them together you get a remarkable result that for the fullerenes from any kind of fullerene composed of Pentagon's and hexagons the number of Pentagon's is always 12 it 12 are 12 Pentagon's are needed to take a flat sheet and to convert it into some closed object that's what this theorem is saying and if you have a bigger polygon polyhedron the number what happens in in making the the bigger size is just the addition of hexagons but the number of Pentagon's remains the same and every time you add a hexagon you add two carbon atoms so if you're looking for a signature of fullerenes you look for objects that have an even number of carbon atoms and in fact that was the main item main issue main point that was used in the initial identification so now I go back to some historical aspects about the identification of the fullerenes so this is 1984 which is one year before the first paper on the buckyballs that comes in 1985 and we at MIT here had a PhD student who did a an absolutely wonderful thesis on liquid carbon and that was not a great interest to the practical world of industry because it's very hard to make liquid carbon the melting point is 4,500 degrees Kelvin and and we could keep the carbon liquid for only nanoseconds in time so we had to make do quick work to to find out about our liquid carbon anyhow one of the things that we were able to do was to figure out how much material left the surface when we applied a certain amount of energy with a laser to the surface so we had some idea of the energy balance and we knew that the carbon had to come off in large chunks but at the time that we did the work it was only known that carbon clusters existed in very small numbers like c2 c3 c5 s even see tens were not very common in around that time I visited Exxon and talked about our work and they assured me that there were no higher fullerenes a higher clusters of carbon well they pursued this work whether it was because of our work or because of other people's work because as you know in science many things come together all at once and they had the courage to go and look for what happened at these higher mass units here we see a plot of the number of species of a given type that are found and on this axis on the x axis how many carbon atoms are contained therein and you could see that there's a new series that starts up somewhere close to 40 carbon atoms and in this series each peak is separated from each other peak by two carbon atoms so that's a sign of what we were talking about and there's a very large peak much larger than its neighbors around c60 and then a secondary peak over here around c70 now the people that are the Exxon group that published this paper they were very excited from about finding this series and also finding a series where the peaks the objects were all separated by two but they had no idea that this was related to anything new that had anything to do with closed-shell molecules or fullerenes or anything so they did a wonderful piece of work but they sort of missed the boat and science is sometimes a little cruel that way but the group at a Rice University they were doing a similar experiment and they were doing it for totally different reasons they were trying to understand why this spectrum from outer space that that has to do with carbon is anomalous they had all kinds of shifts of the spectra of the spectral species with respect to the spectra of carbon that we measure in the laboratory here on earth and what forms of carbon were out there in the cosmos that was there with her big question so they were looking around for this and they also found this C 60 and they but they went at it a different way because they were looking for special species that were responsible and they postulated this creature and because it had the N plus two sequence they stuck their necks out and they said it had something to do with a closed-shell molecule they had very little evidence beyond that it was very flimsy evidence well the vibrational spectra of the fullerenes are unique and somewhat wonderful why we have 60 carbon atoms so we have a huge number of degrees of freedom 60 times 3 is 180 and even if you subtract the rotation and translation it's still a huge number so there are many many modes but the high degeneracy the high symmetry makes these modes rather special and only a very small number of these modes are either infrared or Raman active so if you're doing experiments in the laboratory the spectra are really quite simple and the upper trace here is the infrared mode you see four lines four big lines and then below is the Raman spectra with ten lines and there are 32 silent modes that's very very unusual in molecular spectroscopy and here we have this situation there's another thing that's very nice about it is that because the system is so highly molecular it is possible to look at higher-order spectrum and actually yet you do molecular spectroscopy to identify these higher-order modes won't go into that today like to leave some time for applications the electronic structure is also very unusual and could be understood by just thinking of electrons shared throughout the surface there are 60 carbon atoms one PI electron for each carbon atom so we have 60 electrons to account for 60 filled States for the molecule and if you just assign angular momentum quantum numbers to this series you can account for the angle those are indicated by the pluses here and the minuses are the unfilled states so that the there's a band gap then the 60 electrons go up to here and this is unfilled so we get a band gap between those and the simplest models already are able to give the rough electronic structure of this molecule this is really quite remarkable and it's kind of nice for teaching because we could give this as a homework assignment to students and they get great gratification with just a few weeks of introductory quantum mechanics they're able to explain something as complicated as what happens the on the electric to the electrons on a Bucky ball okay so here is the molecular picture and I just repeat that all the levels are filled up to this homo level H sub u highest occupied molecular orbital home o stands for and then the LUMO which is just the level above it is the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital so a band gap forms between the two and we have then a semiconductor with a band gap and then when we make a solid we crystallized that we get a lot of buckyballs near each other then there's some weak interaction between them so you get some band States yeah but the band width is very very small compared to the band gap that's totally different from what we're used to semiconductor physics like for example silicon or gallium arsenide or something like that so this is a kind of a different physics and has changed in fact my way of teaching and thinking about many things for for student purposes well let me say something about the condensed phase and and they'll take the electronic structure from a different standpoint here is our molecule and it has 60 equivalent sites every site on the buckyball is just like every other site so let's look at one of these and you see that two of the sites two of the bonds emanating from a carbon atom are in pentagon and they're single bonds so one electron and this bond here is between two hexagons so that's a double bond so one plus one plus two is four and that takes care of all the electrons force for an element in column 4 of the periodic table of course carbon is an element and column for the periodic table so all the bonds are satisfied you expect this to be an insulator or semiconductor and that's exactly what it is but we can dope the semiconductor just like we can dope silicon except that we can dope this semiconductor in many ways so here are the three common ways the first one is we can put something inside the icosahedron so that's really fun and that gives rise to something that we call an endo he drove fullerene right now this is a year 1996 approximately 10 years a decade since the first discovery of the buckyball we've known about buckyballs now for some time and we know the existence of these endohedral fullerenes but nobody has figured out how to produce these endohedral fullerenes and mass quantities and gram quantities are all the same so we have just very flimsy knowledge about this and this is an emerging field maybe it'll be interesting maybe there'll be some interesting applications and properties so we have many things to look forward to as I progressed in my talk today I will point out a whole areas of lack of knowledge and for young students that's always the great thing is sometimes they come to the University I think everything has been solved and we have to tell them it's not so that just for all every time we find out something there are 10 new things that we find out that are also interesting to pursue so this is a fundamental thing that we don't understand this is an object and you can imagine a whole series of fullerenes with additional hexagons a little bit bigger in size but in all of these we could put something in the middle and make something that's Enda he'd room with unusual properties well we could take one of these atoms off the one car of the carbon atoms and substitute say a boron atom so that's substitutional doping as is done in silicon to make N and p-type junctions we could do that and that's another possibility but the most interesting possibility is is the third one here which is called XO he'd rule doping where we put some guest species like an alkali atom between the buckyballs and an alkali metal has one electron that's very weakly bound and that electron will come off and we'll find its way to the buckyball buckyballs love to have extra electrons on them they just love that they love to be anions and if you have a whole bunch of these anions the electron can hop from one buckyball to the neighbor and do a hopping and then to the next one and and like that you can get conduction so the possibility of doping these bucky balls and making anions makes the possibility of making conducting buckyballs well if you have conducting buckyballs maybe you can do even better than that and that's what I'm trying to show on this viewgraph so here we have the introduction of dopants and so we have different structures here with different numbers of dopants this is one per unit cell and here are two and so forth and one of them I colored in in green here so you could see that was special and that is three of these electrons so we have a buckyball with three extra electrons three anions and with that we get the conduction band the conduction band I can hold six electrons three electrons fills it in half half fills it and that gives the maximum conductivity so for that one we in fact get metallic conductivity so the conductance the reason stivity goes up with temperature that's a sign of metallic conduction and when we go down to low temperatures what happens is well at some transition temperature the resistivity goes to zero and we get a superconductor so not only do the buckyballs support metallic conduction but they also support super conductivity now this is this phenomenon was discovered in 1991 unfortunately it wasn't discovered in 1986 1986 was when high TC was discovered and bucky balls were discovered in 1985 and there was really no reason that that high TC superconductors couldn't have been discovered at that time because the transition temperature the highest transition temperature until the year 1986 was 23 degrees and you could see there are many bucky balls that dope bucky balls that are have transition temperatures well in excess of that the highest transition temperature and bucky balls so far is 40 degrees kelvin however people that are in companies and want to make a living out of superconductors this isn't the way to go because these are not stable superconductors they're wonderful for a study for a student's thesis work but they're never going to make it who are not for some time unless somebody has a good idea and we can make a stable superconductor out of these now let me make a few comments about the bucky tubes the bucky tubes are really interesting and kind of remarkable and i just say make a few comments about them to leave some time for the applications part of my talk so we start out with a Bucky ball here's our Bucky ball and let's imagine that we take the we cut the buckyball normal to the axis that joins these two Pentagon's okay so we just cut like that and then we're gonna add a whole row of carbon atoms around the belly okay and the number of carbon atoms that you would need to go around the belly is exactly 10 you look at the picture here you'll see exactly 10 so that makes see 70 and that's why see 70 is is stable because it's just like see 60 with 10x extra ring of carbon atoms and now if we put two rings around we get to see 80 and if we put many rings eventually we get it to so that's what I'm going to show you so here are the tube's examples of tubes now this is just a Gedanken this is fantasy now fantasy world and I'll show you reality in a bit so we have we can make the tubes normal to a five-fold axis or we could also cut the buckyball normal to it an axis that goes through these hexagons and that's a three-fold axis another possibility and then we could we have many more possibilities but that's what I'm discussing so we have 1/2 of a buckyball here the other half is over there and we join those two halves with a cylinder ok and similarly for the bottom now let me show you a little bit better about that so here is the honeycomb lattice for graphite single layer just one layer of carbon atoms and you see over here I have zigzag edge and what I'm do to form the cylinder is I fold this over to make them fit perfectly one onto the other and you could see that they would fit perfectly and what we have over at the edge is something with steps and that those steps is what we call the armchair that's shown over here so that's our armchair that's that and if we instead take this sheet and we fold it this way so we make the armchair edge superimpose like this then what's left at the to join up to the hemisphere of the buckyball is this zigzag edge and that gives us this kind of a Bucky ball bucky - so that's how we get these in in simplicity i'm gonna leave this out in case i want it again why people might be interested in these bucky tubes yes the remarkable properties that the carbon fibers have to which the cup bucky tubes are related as you know carbon fiber is the strongest and stiffest material that we have out there here is steel for comparison and steel is usually considered as something quite strong that if you pull on it it won't break very easily or if you bend it like this this is much what modulus means it won't it doesn't Bend very well so it has a high modulus but relative to steel Bucky about carbon fibers are very much better in the question is if you have Bucky - how would that compare and we thought that Bucky tubes might be the embellishment the an example a prototype of theoretical carbon fiber and in fact that that's true but it has some remarkable properties of course now that we've been studying Bucky tubes that we hadn't expected like science is always that way it has a few surprises well very shortly after people started thinking about these tubes there was a report literature nature magazine and here are some tubes 67 angstroms so a little bit less than seven nanometers in diameter and inner diameters for this tube this last tube here that's the smallest inner diameter of a little over two nanometers so very small tubes and the length is a micron so they have a very large aspect ratio so very interesting now the theoretical work that was done in our lab here at MIT and around the world is almost all for single wall tubes because those are the easiest to discuss so there was some impetus to the experimental community to come up with single walled nanotubes and sure enough within a year they came up with them so here a single walled nanotubes and they're made with catalysts transition metals and the bar chart that's on the bottom of this view graph is very interesting because it shows for the single walled nanotubes the largest diameters are very small they're less than 2 nanometers there are hardly any in this beyond 2 nanometers the maximum is about one nanometer that's the most probable size and the smallest size is 7 angstroms or 7/10 of a nanometer what's 7/10 of a nanometer this thing so what it tells you is that you have to cap these these tubes with something otherwise you have exposed carbon atoms on unsatisfied bonds so that's not very favorable and the smallest ball that you can make fullerene you can make with Pentagon's that are not on top of one one another that is separated Pentagon's is the bunk is a c60 so this is a very special molecule it has special properties and also defines the smallest nanotube that you can make there so that was very interesting discovery in fact science is very interesting years ago 20 years ago because this new graph shows dates of publications that are 20 years old people were studying carbon fibers very a very small diameter they call them carbon fibers they're really nanotubes but they call them carbon fibers because the method of preparation is the same as what we use today so they are carbon fibers and even the question was asked what is the smallest diameter that you could ever have for carbon fiber and that was Professor Cooper those people that are in physics would recognize the name very famous theoretical physicists of the century and he wanted to know what smoke if you have these things what's the smallest diameter you can have of course at that time nobody understood the connection between the tubes and the fullerenes so there was no answer to that question so that's what we really waited for for all this time is to understand in a more microscopic way what these smallest tubes are well I'm going to tell you a little bit in very short about the remarkable electrical properties this gets into a little bit of math and maybe the most interesting part is what the end result is we can in fact make a whole family of nanotubes because all that's important is we have to have some way of rolling up the sheet so that the two sides can match there are many ways to do that and this picture on top shows the different ways so if I go from o to a here in the in the view graph so a point O and point a are exactly identical they're the same point from a crystal like crystallographic standpoint and if I then that's an arbitrary lattice point there are many like like point a that's not unique and if I now drop normals like OB or a be prime to the line o a then I have the lines that I have to join so that shows you that there's a whole family of these tubes I can make they have a different property and that they're chiral that is the the atoms will wind around in spirals as they go up the tube rather than just circles for the simple cases that I mentioned before but there's a whole family of them and what's most remarkable remarkable about these tubes is that one third of them are metallic and two-thirds of them are semiconducting depending on geometry so that's a very interesting thing I'll give you a very brief summary about why that comes about but I can't give a very simple display of that the argument is based on the following concept that when we have the tube we make the tube like this and we have a finite number of carbon atoms that go around the circumference the number of wave vectors that we would have assigned to this system in reciprocal space those people that understand those things is equal to the number of atoms and if what we want to do is as we go around the cylinder we want our electronic wave function to be continuous as we go around so going from this streak sheet to the next sheet we should have continuity so we max the boundary conditions and that imposes certain restrictions and what the dispersion relations can be what it all boils down to in the end is and I guess that I need my next picture to show that is here our dispersion relations with nine atoms across the belly of the tube this is to belly nine atoms and then the one on the right has ten atoms that seems almost very little difference right but when you look at it for the nine atom case there's a band II generous see that is the conduction and valence States the occupied states and the empty states are degenerate so with almost no additional energy an electron can conduct so we have metallic system and which is just like graphite which is a good rather good conductor in this case here a band gap for forums and so what's the difference well the difference has to do with the number of wave vectors which is totally a geometric effect on this diagram we go this is now reciprocal space and that we have vertical lines for all the wave vectors and you'll see that there are nine such lines that are drawn here the distance between em and the edge which is also a gamma point which I should have mentioned noted on on the view graph is one-third so if the number of atoms is divisible by three we get a metallic state because then we'll always have a wave vector that goes through this endpoint which is our degeneracy point but if we have ten ten is not divisible by three there's no wave vector going through that point and therefore we have a semiconductor this is a quantum mechanical phenomenon but it has remarkable properties and effects on these tubes well it's wonderful to talk about basic science in this way but can we demonstrate this in the laboratory and the answer is yes and here is 1994 so it took a little while to do this difficult experiment and this is done with scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy and we see here the IV characteristic current versus voltage and for a set of different nanotubes they had a whole bunch of nanotubes and there are three of them that are shown in this picture for illustration nanotubes number one the IV characteristic goes through the origin here straight so this is an ohmic one so that's metallic and two and three have a step they don't go through straight they have a cake and the size of from the size of this king you can figure out what the bandgap is supposed to be and with the scanning tunneling microscope they can also on the same tube you'll nanotube measure what the diameter is so they measure the electrical properties and the geometrical properties all at once that's really remarkable that you could do that something that's as small as this one or two nanometers in diameter and what they come up with is this result that the energy gap for the semiconducting tubules all collected together goes as the reciprocal of the diameter which is in that that functional forum is what you come up with also theoretically the experiment did it first so they were in influenced by the by the theory well I could tell you many more remarkable things about the nanotubes the fullerenes but I thought I would say a little bit about the practical applications in my remaining I think I have five or six minutes let me say a couple of things about the nanotubes if you could have nanotubes that are conducting and an insulating so M is metallic and AI is insulating you can imagine you have a cable here the cable memory device and put it in some kind of shell so they you you could preserve what what information you put in so here's a Junction metal semiconductor Junction etc so you could imagine different structures now this is all nobody's made these this is just Gedanken experiments right now we're only at this stage of measuring with scanning tunneling spectroscopy there is some measurement already of transport properties of these objects on a single nanotube which is quite remarkable putting so here's a single nanotube twenty nanometers in diameter that's the best they've done so far for leads to on each side and of course they get metallic conduction and it's about the right magnitude so we're making progress it's an interesting thing because usually in semiconductor physics as some people in the audience work on we deal with planar structures and here the metallic system is a cylinder so re-entrance cylinder so it has some different physical properties I'd like to mention some other application Nations because people industries more interested in new materials if they have some promise of doing some new things let me talk about several applications they're in our book we have many applications we have maybe a hundred applications but here are and we talk about maybe 20 of them in some detail but I've selected a few for it for today photo transformation what is that good for photo transformation is the foundation of photo resists here we have objects that are very small there are less than one nanometer they're all the same we can make a whole bottle of buckyballs pretty cheap now that are all the same and if you put light on you hook them together when you hook them together they no longer soluble so there's a different solubility between the polymerized buckyballs and those that exist in the monomer form that haven't been exposed to light so you can make a pattern system and for some applications this could be quite interesting the use of n o I in the process makes this quite efficient and makes it compatible and interesting in terms of efficiency compared to presently use photo resists so I imagine there could be some interest in the applications well how does this all work this shows the temperature range in which the photo transformation works well you have to be at temperature that's high enough so that the buckyballs will move around a bit so that they find each other in the right orientation but not so energetic that they have energy to break the bond so that's there's a temperature range where this thing works and they you can form bonds between these and others you can have many bonds you can have a polymer and that's what's shown here number of bonds and you can detect this with some kind of spectroscopic tool like rahman or infrared spectroscopy where the because the the carbon atoms that come together are small the distance between the carbon-carbon bond is smaller for the photo transform once than it is otherwise there's a different signature there's different vibrational frequency so you can detect them remotely so you have an easy way to know when you your system is working or if it's not working and you better fix it let me give you another example of where buckyballs one of I like this example silicon carbide what silicon carbide good for it's a wide band gap semiconductor three electron volts is the bandgap it has some excellent properties in terms of stability has good mobility thermal conductivity etc but it's almost never used because it cannot be patterned and it cannot be controlled very well so you can't edge it you can't pattern it and there aren't very good techniques for growing nice single crystal films but with buckyballs you can do do that now why on this picture here I show you a transistor textbook transistor in fact so we have silicon that's the the dark area and the hatched area a silicon dioxide is the the darkened area and the hatched area silicon that's your transistor silicon has the property of having many dangling bonds and that's that's the the the nature of silicon the silicon surface those dangling bonds engage the buckyballs readily so bucky balls will stick very nicely to silicon silicon dioxide doesn't have dangling bonds so the bucky balls do not stick to the soviet so if you have that transistor for example and you have a rain of bucky balls coming on the surface they'll stick only where the transistor place is and we have a silicon dioxide is they won't stick at all so like that you can build up a surface if you heat up the the system the silicon and the carbon from the buckyball will react and make silicon carbide and you get a film and the film is crystalline this I'll show you in the next view graph so this is a way and it's been done now in quite a number of labs around the world all right now is in universities there's no practical device yet but I think there could be and this shows you that it's single crystal and here are the reflections for a cubic silicon carbide it has a very nice frictional property so people that are in MEMS and micro mechanical systems they might find this a good system and you can prepare films up to two thousand angstroms which is as bad as thick as you want to go for a device applications and there may be other things that you can do with the buckyballs this is one example of that has already been done as I mentioned earlier there are many chemistry applications and at least in some of the chemistry labs around the world people are working on these there are patents out there new materials is about half the patents and the patent literature on buckyballs it for new materials based on on buckyballs new materials derived because of interaction with buckyballs so chemistry is a large part of this and here you see the polymers you see halogens oxygen and different different species that you can attach to these and make some interesting systems I thought my show in my last viewgraph something that's stylish nowadays biochemistry people are working hard to try to find some way of reducing the activity of the HIV virus and so the this picture here is the HIV virus and then you see there's a cleft in there the cleft in the virus is exactly the right size of the buckyball so if you interrupt if you send buckyballs raining on the HIV virus some will attach in this place and then they will destabilize the virus and it won't multiply anymore so this started out as a theory paper and then people tried it in the laboratory and they've had some laboratory tests with mice and it even works so there may be some possibilities in biochemistry for this remarkable molecule so I think my time is just about over and there's good time to stop and ask for questions [Applause] and once the first one yes sort of three questions to baby the saying well let's try with one and then we'll give somebody else a chance like you mentioned in Memphis you mentioned metal semiconductor transitions you didn't mention the word insulator can any of the Bucky structure to be insulators well they could be insulators but one of the problems with with buckyballs that makes well if you have a buckyball surface that's out exposed to oxygen it will have a very high resistivity if the buckyballs are very clean and pure then the resistivity goes down so for the practical device if you want to have a good insulator I suppose you could say that a surface will be insulating it I wouldn't be out selling this for my best world's best insulator but in principle it has a band gap of 1.5 evey breakdown voltage I'm not sure that we know exactly what it is it's not very high no no the reason why the superconductor lated today the reason why the superconductors are unstable is that every single dopant that has been successfully used to make a superconducting fullerene is chemically unstable that is you leave it in the atmosphere the reagent that you've added to like you have an alkali metal you add that to a fullerene you leave it out in the air the alkali metal leaves it oxidizes immediately upon exposure to air so that's that's not to keep the superconductor superconducting you have to encapsulate them and that makes the material not very practical for commercial applications that's a quite a different story from the dielectric properties and another question yes there's a lot of activity maybe it it interferes somewhat with the literature because some of the best ideas probably are under patent and so they they're not published in the open literature immediately so that's that's one thing especially in the area of chemistry and new materials some some of the active areas are diamond synthesis there are quite a number of patents odd that is here this is a curved surface the diamond differs from graphite graphite planar diamond has spq bonding so when you get a curved surface you have some admixture of spq bonding so by having this curvature built in here it is thought that it would promote in some way formation of diamond and in fact it does and people have used this as a source for clusters carbon clusters that are used in in the diamonds in film synthesis and it works very well and produces a kind of diamond that has very small grains which means that you have a nano crystalline size so that the surface doesn't have so much friction as the usual diamond surface that is produced by present-day techniques so for some applications you imagine a stylus going along a surface to have non bumpy surfaces a Vantage so there's some people that are pushing that the improving the technology trying to make it competitive in cost and reproducibility so that's I don't know how close to commercialization it is but there's a lot of activity worldwide in that area but there are there are just many four sensors and just many different things nanotechnology there's just a whole range of different applications I have a listing of all the different patent areas in the book you're interested whether any of these structures may be speculative as to as far as I'm aware the answer to that is no and speculate may be why that's true why why haven't they arisen as structures that you see [Music] in the biological world we see some structures related to the two buckyballs but we don't see buckyballs themselves in fact an astrophysics people have now been searching for it now that they know the existence of buckyballs they have been searching religiously to try to reconcile the various spectra that we find here on earth from these whole menagerie of fullerenes and not there is no correspondence yet there's no verification that the anomalies in space are really associated with these objects so in some sense the unknown still remains with us this has been an active research area since 1920 some time like that so it's many many years and when buckyballs were discovered they thought aha well i we have the answer but it's still not certain that there's much connection between the anomalies and astrophysics and and the ball's now getting back to the biological systems which is what you asked about there are many viruses that have this kind of shape but they're not only fuller they are not only carbon they have other things study of these is interesting for the biologists because of the similarities of the structure and perhaps they can learn something but this itself is not known to exist but but it is believed that this is benign in the body that is if you swallow some buckyballs it's not going to kill you there has been research and this is important for researchers you know that you work on some new chemical and it's it's okay the tubes are another matter if you look in biological works there is a lot of evidence for very narrow tubules and what they have seems somehow to be related although nobody has yet made the connection but there seems to be some correspondence to me anyway looking at the two kinds of pictures of what I know that we have in in the in the inanimate world and what I see on my biology friends there are a lot of tubes that that join different things and it functions and and so forth if we understand these nanotubes I think we could be quite helpful to the biology people that are trying to understand these structures that exist in living systems but they're not only carbon are very long 20 football mattad - no one of course done it wonder is there a theoretical reason why we couldn't have reels of the stuff kilometres or something interesting well with carbon fibers which are a little bit larger in size you can make meter long lengths I think has been for something that's about one micron in diameter that that has been demonstrated with the nanotubes it nobody has been working on that particular aspect the main thing with the nanotubes is the lack of control is that one knows how to make nanotubes you can always make nanotubes reliably but you take what you get and you don't have real control about what the diameter is going to be what is the length what is the chirality and this is future research are quite remarkable and interesting and have real possibilities for applications why is that it has to do with the fact that you have a molecular solid that's number one the valence and conduction band have the same parity and because of that dipole transitions are forbidden okay so that at the absorption edge you have to do things to make that transition take place so that means that you can control it how if you can by some means get electrons in the excited state then they couldn't more easily make transitions to higher states because then you can have allowed transitions well what that allows you to then achieve is a metastable state for the lowest state in the conduction band so that becomes metastable and therefore becomes a way to get saturation in in absorption so that is the basis of of an optical limiter which works much better than any other material in terms of efficiency and at the appropriate wavelength so that's one application that probably will find some use in soon just because it works so well but there are many other optical properties most of the optical properties are not not so well understood because the polymerization effect that I mentioned has been in the way of serious studies when people haven't realized that that when they put light on the samples they're making photo transform material so which lowers the symmetry and therefore changes many things so once you understand that you can work around and work at a higher temperature or do something to break those polymerized bonds and and you know when that takes place then we'll know much more about the optical properties in detail that's the one area that's not well understood right now about the the buckyballs [Applause]
