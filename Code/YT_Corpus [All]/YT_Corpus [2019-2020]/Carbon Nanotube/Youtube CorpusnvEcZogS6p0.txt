 field induced polymer electrolytes and f IPL technology is a low-power electroluminescent light source three layers of moldable light-emitting polymer blended with a small amount of carbon nanotubes glow when an alternating current is passed through them the technology can produce white light similar to that of the Sun or other tints if desired it is also more efficient than compact fluorescent lamps in terms of the energy required to produce light as cited from the carol research group at Wake Forest University to date our brightest device without output couplers exceeds 18,000 candelas per square meter this confirms that f IPL technology is a viable solution for area lighting f IPL lights are different from LED lighting in that there is no junction instead the light emitting component is a layer of polymer containing an iridium compound which is doped with multiwall carbon nanotubes this planar light-emitting structure is energized by an AC field from insulated electrodes the lights can be shaped into many different forms from mimicking conventional lightbulbs to unusual forms such as 2 foot by 4 foot flat sheets and straight or bent tubes the technology was developed by a team headed by dr.
