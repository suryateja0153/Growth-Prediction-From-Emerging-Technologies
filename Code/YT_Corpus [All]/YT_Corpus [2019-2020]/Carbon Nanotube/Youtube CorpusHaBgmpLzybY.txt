 this is an ultra black and in case you missed the memo ultra blacks are the new black these light capturing coatings have been used to cover luxury cars and even make art projects like this black hole which was so black a viewer actually fell in their depth perception rendered useless by the optical illusion that black hole is an artwork by the artist Anish Kapoor who controversially secured exclusive rights to use what was then the blackest coating called vantablack in his work that upset a lot of other artists who also wanted to use these blackest blacks this is so rude you've got to make a black who's better than his black that's Stuart's simple and he created this paint which is one of the blackest paints you can buy but here's the thing there are blacker blacks and scientists are measuring just how much light they can capture our blacks are the blackest that we know of that's John layman a scientist at the National Institute for Standards and Technology he has helped develop one of the blackest ultra blacks yet the not-so-secret sauce carbon nanotubes which can only really be seen under powerful magnification carbon nanotubes are structure made of a layer of graphene some millionth of the diameter of a human hair those nanotubes blacks might have military applications be useful for photography and to make ever more accurate sensors so why do we care I spoke to both simple and layman to find out what's behind this race to make the most light trapping substances yet but first let's watch some paint dry for you this journey really began with Anish Kapoor and sort of locking up of the blackest black if that hadn't happened would there be this race to create the blackest black in the art world that would have been because I don't in the art world wouldn't even know that there was a material sniff it have stayed in astronomy or defense or military or something we wouldn't have known it existed but because an itch was using it artists sort of tuned into it and then we realized that we wanted to have a go and use something like that - we're artists we're interested in what you can see with your eye so really it doesn't matter what it's doing in the infrared spectrum and UV spectrum in a science lab what we want is a really flattened boy looking like we can make work with so if you put it next to vantablack yeah it kind of looks similar to the naked eye but if you start measuring it smells different why do you think people are so excited about the idea of creating the blackest black paint I think artists have always been very interested in black because it's actually not a color and we're talking about the absence of light and since the beginning of time so when you're going about trying to make a paint that is not a color but the absence of color where do you begin a lot of the other super black things that you say scientific processes and they're incredible but they're made in labs and they drone nanotubes and they've made in vacuum tones it's complicated we approached it like paint makers so black 3 isn't the same things you know these Fanta blacks or singularity black you although it does have no no particles in it it is very much obtained so we have to create a new pigment from scratch called black magic which is born Matt can you tell me about some of the ways you've seen black 3.0 being used in the wild I've seen it used in so many exciting ways you know we always wanted to make something usable so that was the whole point astronomers are using it amateur astronomers inside their telescopes so they reflect less light photographers using it inside camera bodies magicians are using it sure this paint is cool and it makes for some pretty neat art projects but scientists are pushing for these light absorbing materials for different reasons this is a microscopic image of a forest of carbon nanotubes that's what makes the most light absorbing ultra blacks work so well carbon nanotubes are structure made of a layer of graphene a millionth of the diameter of a he so how do these carbon nanotubes capture particles of light or photons as scientists call them so basically what we're doing when we make something very black is we're creating this topology where in if photons intersect this coating they rattle around until they get absorbed but making light absorbing carbon nanotubes isn't easy it has to be done under careful conditions each lab does it a little differently but the basics are roughly the same so when you're developing this extremely black light absorbing surface you have to start with these nanotubes how are those grown or developed so let's say we're going to make some carbon nanotubes so we do in fact grow them in a nun evacuated oven that is it has a vacuum and we're going to introduce carbon into that oven and that's going to be the basis of the nanotubes so we're going to grow the nanotubes on a substrate which is in our case of silicon you can think of that of the cookie sheet and then we're going to grease the cookie sheet with iron and then as the substrate heats up and the carbon is introduced the nanotubes will start to grow from the substrate and the longer we bake it so to speak duck taller the nanotubes will grow after that we take it out of the oven and we have a wafer with nanotubes on it so the whole point of this is more than just a vanity project we're not just trying to make the blackest black because it makes for cool art or because it's a great thing to brag about but because there are real practical applications of this stuff what do you think are some of the most important things we can do with these blackest blacks we're not just trying to make the black as black we're trying to make useful detectors right so the carbon nanotube coatings on a detector allow us to do better measurements of the temperature of the earth there is room for you know 10 times improvement over what's been done the temperature measurements we have of the earth right now could be improved by a factor of 10 with your instruments there's a difference between what we can do in the lab on earth and what we can do in space so our goals for what we're doing in space are approaching at 10 times improvement and because we can put them on small fast relatively inexpensive detectors means we can put them into space more readily I'm imagining these sort of satellites painted with the blackest black coating being launched into space is that sort of accurate or can you describe what you've actually sent into space so for the blackest coatings that we put on detectors they're typically part of a larger instrument so the detector might be you know a few millimeters by a millimeter and it's buried inside this instrument that has a prism and some optics and so on so it's taking that light dispersing it picking a wavelength and looking at it very closely and do you just have the one satellite or what kind of scale are we talking about right now we just have one satellite we've just launched our first one and we have another one planned this obviously isn't the first attempt to make an ultra black black there are other materials like vantablack is one that's been in the headlines a lot black 3.0 paint is another one what makes your black different than those ones we are interested scientifically in this question of you know what's the blackest black and and and to be frank I mean we have a publication which shows that our blacks are the blackest that we know of and we've rigorously defended the uncertainties and the measurement method and you know in a spirit of scientific progress I would challenge anybody else to do the same and see if they agree with us by your own measurements the material you've developed captures some small percentage of more light than anything else out there that's what we believe when we get to this level of blackness we're in this realm of well is it really the blackest black or is it the best measurement of the blackest black and so at least in the scientific world or you know for us where we have to know very accurately we put effort into dances so I don't know how much blacker we can make something and actually know that we made it blacker because there's such a small amount of light being reflected back that it becomes increasingly hard to measure at that amount of light yes exactly exactly thank you so much for joining us it's great to talk to you thank you [Music]
