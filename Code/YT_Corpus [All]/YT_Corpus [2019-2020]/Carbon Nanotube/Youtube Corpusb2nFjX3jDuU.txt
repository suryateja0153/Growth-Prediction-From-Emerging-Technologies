 so there's as always a lot of stuff happening in space let's first start by diving a bit more into the details of the potential landing sites of starship on Mars then we also want to talk about our good old Yusaku our favorite Japanese billionaire who already wants to prepare training for the dear moon mission and on the topic of starship the Mk1 starship in Boca Chica will soon be ready to get the nose cone installed and let's also talk about Mos Eisley I mean Boca Chica spaceport and regarding the moon NASA is currently actually investigating the possibility of using Bigelow Aerospace BA330 modules as the key elements for its lunar gateway station talking about Artemis you won't believe it NASA is still working on SLS and targeting the uncrewed Artemis one launch around the moon for 2020 lastly we stumbled across a highly interesting paper which could drastically lower the costs for building a moon base the spaceline a moon space elevator so stay tuned for these fascinating space news so in our last space news episode which you can watch right here we were giving a broad overview of all the potential landing sites of starship on Mars based on a collaboration between NASA and SpaceX using the HiRise instrument of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter now we found that Arcadia Planitia is a very interesting site offering many advantages such as potential water ice reserves a higher atmospheric pressure therefore lower radiation levels and flat surfaces for easier starship landing and even potential lava tubes and highly interesting geological formations but now we want to go a bit more into detail about a few of those landing sites so the University of Arizona which is actually currently responsible for the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter released a set of highly interesting images detailing the potential landing sites of starship on Mars with quite a few sites of interest now five of these landing sites are actually located very near to each other so last time we said that these landing sites are situated in the Arcadia Planitia region but more precisely they are actually located at the border between the Arcadia Planitia region to the north and the Amazonis Planitia region to the south in the region known as Erebus Montes now Amazonis Planitia is a giant flat low-lying region situated to the west of the giant volcano Olympus Mons while Arcadia Planitia is lying to the north both these regions are thought to have been covered by a giant ocean early in Mars history which according to newer research lasted at least 1 billion years last time we've already talked about many key advantages but actually there are even more we said that water ice plays a very important role for future Mars bases which is by the way also true for moon bases turns out there are huge subsurface glaciers in the Erebus Montes region as detailed in this paper here link in the description explaining why five of the landing sites would be situated in that region These so-called Lobate Debris Aprons short LDA can be found in multiple regions showing that directly below the surface there are large ice masses slowly flowing down from higher ground to lower lying regions they can be easily accessed since they only lie a few metres below the surface perfect for future settlement and we talked about that the thicker atmosphere there would be very advantageous for landing and for reducing the impact of cosmic radiation now another big advantage that we didn't mention last time but which is also very important is that of course more co2 pressure means that the Sabatier reaction process where co2 and hydrogen is being converted to methane and water would of course be more efficient when you have more co2 pressure in the atmosphere because of course you could acquire more co2 someone on reddit even posted a more detailed picture of two of the five starship landing sites in the Erebus Montes region now on this picture the height profile is ten times more amplified to give you a bit more of a feeling for the topology of the region together with the potential presence of large underground lava tubes which will play a very important role for future underground Mars bases and the vicinity to Olympus Mons then the larger atmospheric pressure and the presence of large water ice deposits below the ground in the form of subsurface glaciers and of course as a potential site of interest to find past Martian life this site becomes more and more interesting we have to say now with the first cargo missions to Mars currently being slated for 2022 we probably can expect the first base in the Erebus Montes regions should this site actually then be the site where starship will land around the mid-2020s of course until then still many challenges have to be overcome the two major ones of course being the low gravity problem and the cosmic radiation problem which fortunately both can be solved as we try to show in this video right here but before going to Mars Starship will first be tested multiple times and the first longer voyage will be on the dear moon mission planned for 2023 with our favorite Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa the news emerged recently that he actually plans to sell a 30% stake in his online fashion retail company Zozo to Yahoo Japan Yusaku will resign as CEO of Zozo receive about 2.3 billion dollars in cash and maintain a 6 percent stake in the company the reason behind this move being according to him freeing up more time to train for the starship dear moon mission in 2023. And very interestingly before that, he plans to do a round trip around the earth in starship now we don't know more details on this mission but it might happen as early as 2022 certainly quite a while before the dearmoon mission these are highly interesting news now staying on the topic of starship the mk 1 prototype in Boca Chica seems to be nearing completion the last ring segment of the main body has been installed and now it looks like the prototype is soon ready to get the nose cone installed so that it will look something like this it will be an incredible 55 meters tall and while the MK2 (of course) Florida starship will be transported to the Kennedy Space Center and maybe do the first flight tests as early as October Elon time the mark 1 will start directly from Boca Chica as pictures from an FAA document filing show there will actually be three phases for the Boca Chica spaceport and contrary to Mos Eisley spaceport there will be no scum and villainy there quite the contrary this here is the configuration of phase 1 but in phase 2 it gets far more interesting since for this phase we'll start seeing medium hops to a height of about 3 kilometers from this FAA document we can assume that phase 2 spaceport will be finished in time for the 20 kilometer hops in October and then phase 3 will see large hops that take starship up to 62 miles above Earth with high-altitude flips reentries and landings so much for our favorite rocket starship but let's now also take a look over to NASA to see what those guys are actually doing NASA is currently assessing the potential of the BA330 inflatable modules from Bigelow Aerospace as modules of choice for the planned lunar gateway as part of NASA's Artemis moon strategy we have to say even though we are not fans of the whole NASA approach of getting back to the moon with the gateway at least using Bigelow Aerospace inflatable modules would in our eyes remedy this whole thing to some extent NASA is currently conducting a two-week ground test on the BA330 as Bigelow Aerospace's headquarters eight NASA astronauts have participated in the trial so far and four were under scene last week to assess various aspects of the expandable module as part of NASA's next space technologies for exploration partnerships program we really hope that NASA will decide for the inflatable habitat solution as it offers some key advantages over rigid metal based models for example better micrometeorites protection a much larger internal volume and a much lower payload weight and space requirement 3 ba 330 connected would already yet more internal volume than the entire ISS because one such habitat has as the name indicates 330 cubic meters of pressurized volume speaking of the whole Artemis plan now we admit we sometimes make a bit too much fun of NASA but you have to admit it's quite hilariously obvious how Lockheed and Boeing are milking NASA as long as they can by dragging out the whole SLS construction process to an absurd amount in any case we're trying to hold ourselves back this time and NASA has actually released a new video of all the parts of the SLS rocket detailing where all the parts currently are and what they are doing with these parts now many of those parts are still being tested so-called test articles whereas others are already being moved around at the Kennedy Space Center such as the large hydrogen tank as seen here apparently NASA is still committed to have Artemis one launched by an SLS rocket in mid 2020 that is the uncrewed flight of an Orion capsule around the moon now we would be very surprised if this would actually really happen by mid 2020 but we would be extremely glad to be proven wrong then the Artemis 2 mission is currently being scheduled for 2022 which will be actually a crewed flight around the moon as done in Apollo 8 this will basically be the Apollo 8 of our time and then the Artemis 3 mission would be the first crewed landing on the moon which is currently scheduled for 2024 but we have the feeling that when Artemis 3 will finally land on the moon in 2024 the chances are high that it will go something like this on the topic of the moon we stumbled upon a highly interesting paper recently uploaded to ArXiv about the possibility of building a moon space elevator which the authors called the spaceline now what is so cool about this plan well contrary to an earth installed space elevator that would need some extremely strong carbon nanotube material to make it work the space line could be built with today's technology a Dyneema or Kevlar cable turns out would be strong enough to withstand the forces acted upon it now this cable would be only a few millimeters thin and extend from the surface of the moon to around the area of geostationary orbit it could of course not be anchored to the earth because the moon doesn't rotate around the earth in synchronicity with Earth's rotation the Earth rotates in 24 hours whereas the moon needs 28 days to circle the earth the lower end of the cable would thus be floating in space and being tightened only by the gravitational pull of the earth the authors make some calculations with different materials and found that the whole cable could be built to weigh only 40 metric tons the entire thing could be launched with one starship launch isn't that funny and of course the cost would be extremely low not even reaching 1 billion US dollars for reaching the moon we then only have to reach the end of the cable nearest to earth below or around geostationary orbit which would of course greatly reduce the costs of sending payload and people to and from the moon now the energy for the climber who would travel between shortly below geostationary orbit all the way to the surface of the moon and back could be entirely provided by solar energy now this moon elevator would also pass the earth moon lagrange point L1 which is situated 84% towards the moon so around 325 thousand kilometres of distance which is indeed a very interesting point because they could store large things or even build giant space stations because the gravity pull from the earth and the moon cancel each other out there entirely so you could keep stuff floating around there without needing additional energy so there would be really many advantages to the space line it would be really nice to see the first space line being set up after we establish the first moon base so that the cargo and crew transport to and from the moon would actually be done with a space line which will then free up all the starships from any moon missions so that SpaceX could concentrate on using all starships in existence for the Mars colonization efforts because without the space line probably quite a few starships will need to travel between the Earth and our newly established moon base so what do you think about the spaceline and do you agree with us that it's an awesome idea we'd certainly like to have those cheap moon bases and free up all the starships so that they can fully concentrate on Mars and what do you think about the Erebus Montes landing site and do you think that artemis one will really launch in mid 2020 we'd love to hear your opinion in the comment section and we will reply as much as we can and if you're new to this channel be sure to subscribe and turn on the bell so
