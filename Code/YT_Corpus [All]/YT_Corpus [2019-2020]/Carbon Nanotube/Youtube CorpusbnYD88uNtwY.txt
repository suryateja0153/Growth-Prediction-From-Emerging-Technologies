 hi girls my name is sue yanga and I am currently at the MIT Koch Institute which is a building our cancer research and today I'm going to talk about the biological engineering that we do in order to find and image deeply embedded and difficult to reach tumors so currently in the clinic the number one therapy method for cancer is oh thank you for cancer is surgical debulking which is basically removing of the mass tumor masses and then chemotherapy and so it's very important for surgeons to be able to locate precisely and early on in the stage of the tumor the masses that they want to remove to be the most to in order to do the most effective therapy and so cancer cells are basically cells that have unusual dividing ability so they proliferate without stop and they are differentiated from the regular cells around them by certain markers on the surface of the cell and so what we want to do is use these markers in the surface in the cell in order to find and then tell locate where the tumors are and tell the surgeons okay this is the place where I should remove the biological tissue and you don't want to damage the healthy tissue around it so you want to be very precise and very so there are two tools that we use in our lab in order to find the tumors in the body the first is the custom-built imager that we're working on with the with collaboration at the Lincoln labs and the second is the biological probe it's a little shuttle that we use in order to go ahead and find the cells in the body so we can both so we can talk about both of them today so the biological martes goal that we use is called the m13 bacteriophage and bacteriophage really just means bacteria eater so it's a virus so as with typical viruses it infects bacteria sends its in DNA takes over the local mechanism of the bacteria and begins to replicate itself so what we can do is hack the system in order to use this molecule for our own benefits it's a very beautiful very simple sort of molecule it's just a piece of DNA so a DNA that codes for its you're not up information and a bunch of proteins that's wrapped around the body and so because we can manipulate the DNA we can change the peptides that are on the body of the phage and so we can choose the protein so that they have specific binding abilities to certain materials or certain ligands or certain markers so this is the tumor cell markers that I'm talking about we can change the protein at the head of the virus in order to bind specifically to the surface of a cancer cell and we can change the proteins on the body of the virus to bind to a specific imaging agent or therapy agent that we can then shuttle to the surface of ourselves so for our system here the imaging agent that we chose is called a carbon nanotube and so a carbon nanotube is just a piece of graphene that's been rolled up and what graphene is is it's just a single layer of graphite graphite is what you find in your pencils in ledge and so it has very interesting optical and electrical properties it's very well studied but for us what's interesting about it is the wavelength at which it's light this is in the second window near-infrared wavelengths and so it's slightly longer than the visible wavelength and the cool thing about this is it's able to penetrate deep deeper into the biological tissue and you have less scattering and less interference from the surrounding materials so finally this is the design of our shuttles that we send in to find tumor cells we have the m13 bacteriophage which has a particular protein at the head that detects the tumor cells and we have on the body the CNT the carbon nanotube that was going to light up and tell us oh this is where we should go ahead and remove bath so the first model that we have actually done in our lab is on ovarian tumor and ovarian tumor is one of the tumor bottles that is very difficult to detect early on it's unlike you know things like breast tumor you can't feel it and when usually when the surgeon or the doctor diagnoses it's quite late in the stage of the tumor so it could have turned a metastatic and metastatic means that the tumor cells have detached from the body and travel to other parts of the body and so proliferated other tumors throughout the body so this is a stage do you don't want to reach so it'll be very cool if you can put our probes into mice with ovarian tumor light up the tumors give the surgeon damaged and the church and can go ahead and move the tumors in the myself and survive so this is a first step in putting our system to its clinical application so this is what happens in real life you see here the stomach cavity of the mice and in the bright orange you see all the tumor masses that of lit up so we have injected the mice with trillions of a tiny little molecular shuttles that carry our CNT to the location of the tumor and using our imager which we have built with help from the Lincoln labs the surgeon is able to go in and remove all these nodules and the cool thing but the nodules here is we're getting the ones that are even below a millimeter in diameter so usually when a surgeon goes in without any guidance he might miss these because he's just going my eye but because he has the imager he can go ahead and move most of the tumors so here's an example of what we're doing in real time so during surgery if the surgeon can directly refer to the images that he's getting then he can go ahead and implement our technology in a very real way so here we see doctor nos at from mgh he's doing surgery on mice and you can see on the screen you can see brightly lit up this is where the tumors are and this is where I should take them and so here's a serial image of what's happening so here's the probst lighting up where the tumors are this is what happens when the surgeon goes in by I and is like okay from my experience this is where I should take out the tumors and you see that there's quite a bit of mass left but if we have the imager then we have a much cleaner image at the end of the surgery and so there's a lot less of a chance that the term which is going to recur so for me personally there are two things I'm doing in order to expand on our system that we have already built the first is manipulating the m13 sage two different geometries so I call this in your age in your just means small in Portuguese and so based on the aspect ratio which basically is the diameter versus the length of our phage they might have very different traveling abilities in the bloodstream so because of their oblong shape they have and a tendency to stick to the walls and tumble around but if we can change the state shape to an optimal size then there's a chance that they will travel for a longer period of time in the bloodstream and so find the tumors that are farther from the site of injection the second thing is we are expanding on the library of cancers that we can attack so so far we've looked at varying tumor and now I want to look at brain tumor and the most difficult thing about brain tumor is the blood-brain barrier so it's just a layer of cells that separate your blood from the matter in your brain and the molecules that passed through are very specific and very small so it's very hard to deliver from your bloodstream very strug the imaging agents to the actual brain mass so what we have done here is actually engineered the head peptide so the proteins at the head of our age so that it allows for travel across the blood-brain barrier so we can deliver these imaging molecules to tumors in the brain so one thing to remember here is that the scale that we're working at the scale at which we're working it's very very small so if you look at CNT or the hour phage really it's about times a hundred thousand times smaller than a strand of your hair so there's really really tiny face so when I make the small phage they're even smaller than our regular phage a regular phage is about 800 nanometers so here's an example of 289 a meter phage 100 nanometer phage and 50 nanometer phage so when I make them and I want to look at them it's really hard because they're so small and you can't just use regular light microscopy to detect them so another interesting thing that I do is use atomic force microscopy I don't know if you've heard of it but what it is is basically you take a sample and you have this very very tiny needle that scans across the surface and so you're getting a topology of the surface and from that scanning kind of like reading Braille you get a good idea of what the profile of your images so these are the images that I get from this sort of needle probing for the brain tumor another interesting factor not only can we you know bring the phage to the surface of the tumor so this is tumor here shown in green this is tumor that actually has green fluorescent protein so that means big glow and if we send in our fade we see that oh yeah our phage goes ahead and coats in red the tumor but then the other thing we notice is that the phage is actually internalized into the tumor cells so the phage comes and attaches to the surface and then the tumor cells eats the phage so in the blue here is the nucleus of a page and in the red spread around the nucleus in the golgi region is our phage so just tells us we can possibly deliver things to inside the cells of the cancer so that means we can send in therapies that disrupt the function and so in this way kill the tumor cells and so can we not only detect where they are and see if we can remove them effectively but we can also locally care them so overall today we've looked at the very real medical impact that we can do with imaging and the probe that we have biologically engineered netlab and the two things that I've done is you know look at what we can do to change the geometry and what we can do to change the different cancers that we can attack and all of this work of course isn't possible with that a collaboration that happens between the colleagues I have at the MIT Koch Institute as well as the scientists we have at the Lincoln labs so that's another really cool thing but others projects it's so very broad and so it brings in so many different techniques and brings in so many different people as I really want to thank them and another aspect of this work that I really find meaningful is that it's but I am personally funded by families that are affected by these types of tumors on these types of diseases and so I really want to thank the the Goodwin cracked our staller and salmon families who have been really generous with their funding for this project and yeah finally I want to say that for me the m13 is kind of a building block we're here all as girls who built and so for me for my building projects is the m13 and I hope that you guys are able to understand from this that as an engineer for me it's really just about finding creative ways to use my building blocks to make a difference to address the problems that I think are most important to me and so yeah thank you very much for listening please feel free to ask me any questions I can talk more about myself or I can talk mark my research I yes thank you yes samples from cancer but these detect intact cancer or is it just Civic it can detect any type of cancer as long as you have a specific differentiating markers on the cancer that you know of yeah so not only is this use foreign cancer it's also useful in detecting any other material as long as you're able to modify the head so that it is specific to that material or to that so then you can do that which makes it a very elegant very cool molecule which is why I think it's you know something i should be using you
