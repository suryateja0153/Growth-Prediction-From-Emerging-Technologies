 the 2000s have seen the beginnings of the applications of nanotechnology in commercial products although most applications are limited to the bulk use of passive nanomaterials examples include titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles in sunscreen cosmetics and some food products silver nanoparticles in food packaging clothing disinfectants and household appliances such as silver nano carbon nanotubes for stain resistant textiles and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst as of March 10 2011 the project on emerging nanotechnologies estimated that over 1300 manufacturer identified nanotech products are publicly available with new ones hitting the market at a pace of three to four per weeks nanotechnology is being used in developing countries to help treat disease and prevent health issues the umbrella term for this kind of nanotechnology is nano medicine nanotechnology is also being applied to or developed for application to a variety of industrial and purification processes purification and environmental cleanup applications include the desalination of water water filtration wastewater treatment groundwater treatment and other nano remediation in industry applications may include construction materials military goods and nano machining of nano wires nano rods few layers of graphene etc also recently a new field arisen from the route of nanotechnology is called nano biotechnology nano biotechnology is the biology based application oriented frontier area of research in the hybrid discipline of nano science and biotechnology with an equivalent contribution topic applications by type nanomedicine now Green nanotechnology energy applications of nanotechnology industrial applications of nanotechnology potential applications of carbon nanotubes nano art
