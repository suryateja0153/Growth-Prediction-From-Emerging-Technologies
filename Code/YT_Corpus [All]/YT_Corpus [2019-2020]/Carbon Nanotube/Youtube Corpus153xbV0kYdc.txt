 [Music] hi welcome to this particular lab module in this lab class the idea is to show you how to dice the wafer what I mean by that you you now understand that we use entire silicon wafer right and once you have the silicon wafer with many sensors you have to chop up the sensors so if you see the screen if you have silicon wafer okay and then you have let's say 3 by 3 3 rows 3 columns sensor chips right and finally the sensor chip may be like let's say pressure sensors okay now this is your substrate I cannot use the entire substrate for measuring something right I want to dice this off that means I just want a pressure sensor to be out so how to dice it right so we can dice it like this and then we can get a pressure sensor chip like this so how our diced wafer under the microscope looks like we will see the inspection of that also we look at the CNT sensing layer for fabricate a sensor what does it mean let's say I'll just show you in terms of blocks so you have a substrate again right and on the substrate you have a heater on the heater you have inter digitated electrodes on interdigital electrodes you have a sensing they're sensing clear now what does this become this becomes a vo C sensor or gas sensor right you have a substrate a heater interdiction occurs and something there now you know that if I change the sensing layer from thin films from thin films of metal oxide semi conductors to nano structured nano structured metal oxide semi conducting materials like indium tin oxide zinc oxide tungsten oxide tin oxide right indium oxide and many more then the Nano structure also I can use CNT like carbon nanotubes the Nano structure would show a higher sensitivity ater lowered room temperature because it has a higher surface to volume ratio compared to thin films and that's why we go for our sensing layer which is made up of nano structural materials so we will see in this lab that how the carbon nanotube looks like on the wafer which has those sensing there and so sientese sensing that on the wafer which has the inter digitated electrodes alright so this is a lab class and I request my lab assistant actually is a project assistant I'm sorry teeing assistant then he is also a part of this particular project and then to show it to you how this chip looks under the microscope right and I'll see in the next class till then you take care bye welcome to this module as part of the last few modules we are looking at sensors several examples of sensors that we are fabricated in our facility and I have shown you like how a glass wafer will be how a silicon wafer will be how it will look like after it is deposited with gold and what are the processes that is involved in making micro heaters I've shown you all those things today what we will do is I had we had a glass wafer that was deposited with cold okay and I have shown it to you in the previous video also I will show it to you today as well and I will show you after patterning how the glass wafer will look like and this electrode which I am showing I think you might have seen previously in the course but I think you might not have seen before and after pictures of the electrodes on the glass wafer now the idea is that I have told you that we are using these sensors for Biological applications right so you need to also understand that what is the relevance of several designs in within the context of biology like why do we decide to make micro hitters in such specific way why do we decide to place micro heaters in specific way what are the design challenges and many part of this I have covered in the previous module I will further extend that knowledge in this module as well so I have told you that main process that we that are involved will be a photolithography the pattern before that we will do deposition some form of deposition either EBM evaporation or sputter deposition or thermal evaporation and then we will after deposition we will pattern it and then we will etch out the unwanted material from the wafer the wafer or the substrate may be silicon glass or it can be see this instant of silicon wafer can be a germanium wafer it can be a PMMA substrate it can be glass substrate lot of different varieties of substrates are available now let's I will show you a few of the patterned electrodes on glass here I have two two wafers one is a glass wafer which I have shown you in previous modules which is blanket deposited with gold and another one we have patterned with electrode structure okay now I will show you the electrode structure also under the microscope again so that it becomes very clear to you the thing is I am not opening it directly you should always carry your devices or wafers in wafer carriers for contamination purposes and also for safety of the wafer so it doesn't break these are all expensive materials and it should not break so it should be carried in wafer carriers also all the time so let me open it for you so I am opening it and this this is the wafer which is deposited with gold I think you can see it now I we have put this protection layer of plastic on top of the glass wafer so that when you close the lid of the way forget it nothing happens so we have taken it out now this is the glass wafer okay which is deposited with gold so we have the wafer deposited with gold in the wafer carrier you can handle it with the with the tweezer and if at all you are handling with your hand make sure that you don't touch the active area of the wafer so if I am handling with my hand like this should always be handled like this and don't touch anywhere inside the wafer because that will leave your fingerprint on the wafer okay now this is a glass wafer that is deposited with gold there is no patterning done on this okay now I have and show you a patterned glass wafer so this is patterned you can see it right the glass the gold has been removed from areas where the gold was not required and wherever the device is there it is there now if you see if you observe this is a four inch glass wafer okay now the the active that these are these patterns that you are seeing are the devices okay and the devices are there are lot of area where around the device which there Gold is still there why has this happened this is because we have you so this is something to do with photolithography okay so for photolithography we need a substrate as you will know with deposited with some material you will coat that substrate with the photoresist and you need a mask with the pattern design on it and that pattern will be transferred onto the substrate correct now it's usually for for in substrate you will need to use a 4 inch mask likewise you can even use a 5 inch mass with 4 inch area in the mask but we have used a 3 inch mask because we make these designs also on 3 inch glass slides so on a 4 inch wafer with the positive bit gold we have used a 3 inch mask to pattern this that is why many of because 3 inch mask will only be this much area so the remaining portion of the gold will not be patterned because it is not that mask is not covering that area that is why ma'am so this area of is gold and this is the active area and we can see that devices here so we will quickly see these devices under the microscope so we have I have a microscope behind me I will quickly load this micros device onto the microscope okay just see me I will be loading it already some devices are there on the microscope I will first remove those devices keep it somewhere else and then lowered this chip so this is how you should hand in your devices I have one device in my tweezer this is something else I will talk to you about this also I will remove whatever is already loaded and then keep this electrode so I have removed it now I am transferring the patterned gold electrodes onto the microscope now you can see that I have loaded the device on to the microscope this is the methodological microscope you have covered this in the course before now let's look at D let's start the software to see the image let's look at the computer screen so now I'm opening the software I have to adjust the white balance and auto exposure so that we can see this thing and then I have to go to the right kind of magnification that I need so what magnification will be used for imaging that depends on your understanding of your design okay so this design is a 10 micron 20 micron features so I can see the overall structure of the design if I go at 5x lens that is 5x lens with 10x eyepiece magnification that will be 50 X magnification so let's look at it now so I you can see the scene computer screen so I am I am going to find out the exact active area of the device so it is come you can see it I'll go to another device so you can see the entire device under the microscope now so you can see major railroads here major railroads there and you can see fine structures here those are the inter digitated electrodes in their digit dated digits like fingers so fingers are also called digits on your length this is called a index finger so they're called digits also so these are like fingers they are 10 micron width and 10 micron spacing gold electrodes okay so these can act as sensing layers for a multiple purposes whatever so because by default if nothing is there on if nothing is there on top of this this will be a infinite impedance right ideally so if something some material some analyte is kept on top of this electrode it would cause an electrical connection that you through that electrical connection we will be able to measure the resistivity of the electrode so for different biological material will have different resistivity and the same biological material of different conditions of it also there will be different resistivity this can be used as biomarker for detection that is how this sides are this type of bias and sir works so this is the electrode that we have seen in the glass wafer okay let me just go to higher magnification just keep looking at the screen I will go to let's say 10x magnification you can see that the focus has shifted because every time we are changing the objective lens we have to focus it now it is in focus you can see the interdigitated structure more clearly now very clearly correct you can see it very clearly now let me go to another higher magnification will be inverted to index these are 20x I will do further focusing so at 20x you can see much more clearly the features of the digits how rectangular are they are they perfectly rectangular they will not be perfectly rectangular because if this is this the electrodes are made using etching process so it slightly at the edges there will be some curvature these curvatures will be very clearly visible we have gone to 20x magnification now now you can see the digits of the electrode much more clearly and you can see the features of the electrodes how fine are they the curvature of the electrodes and all you can see ideally they should be very perfectly rectangular design but the process that we use we do lithography and then we HH do wet etching process so a testing process may not give such sharp features for that only we go for dry etching so this is a chemical etching process and that involves some liquids and there will be undercutting and that are etching is most more towards isotropic etching than anisotropic etching because of all these factors you can see some circular features on the electrodes this you can be very more more clearly if you go too high even higher magnification so if I go to 50 X magnification keep looking at a screen I have gone to 50 X magnification and I am focusing it so I focused it here you can see the fine features on the electrode that you can see that it is not perfectly straight if there are some roughness which is tolerated because it is it is at very high magnification at 50 X magnification you are still able to see that it is reasonably straight you can see this this structure this curvature right you can see a u-shape here slight U shape here slight U shape here these are all at high magnification you can see if I go to even higher magnification let's say I go to 100 X 100 X lengths you can see much more clear clearer picture I'll increase the brightness so you can see how like the imperfections in the design you can see see here Meza material is gone some here my teal is gone which are okay for our sensing purposes so I can go to the other structure also that you shape the structure see the U shape you can see it is supposed to be perfectly rectangular you can see the edges are actually curved this is because of the isotropic nature of the etching process that we do which is fine for our sensing application so you can see that at 5x magnification it looks a bit more perfect manner than mean we go to this is this is basically sensor inspection you are inspecting how you're watching profile has been how your design has finally or how are the design that you have made in the mask how it has been transferred to the substrate so that's how you do inspection by going to higher and higher magnifications okay so next we will do we will see one one sensor that we have made on silicon wafer previously we saw gold patterning on glass substrate we saw a glass substrate that was blanket deposits with gold then we saw a patterned glass substrate with the gold gold electrodes we saw it under the microscope we saw how the features are visible as we go at higher magnifications okay now I will show you another design which we have made on a silicon wafer on the silicon wafer we have deposited platinum and we have used lift off process to make the features why we have used lift off process so generally people go for lift off process when there are no clear very practically usable actions available for the deposited material let's say when you have Pena take gold you have good agents which give you controllable accelerates in the innovate bench so you can use for you can use direct aging process but platinum some people use acquire easy and all but that it's rate is extremely high you will not be able to preserve your features so for that people use liftoff process I think lifter process has been covered in the lecture course before I will not go into details of it the basic idea is that before you deposit the that is platinum itself you do lithography after coating photoresist onto your substrate you do lithography pattern transfer onto your substrate and then on the pattern the substrate you transfer your you deposit your material in this case platinum and then you do the lift up process the idea is the photoresist will come out by and while it comes out it will take away the material platinum from places where it is not required that is the overall idea of overall idea of lift off and an analogy is like let's say you have put some things on a bedsheet and you want to remove that item you pulled a bit sheet and the item comes with the bed sheet so it's something like that just that it's not exactly ability because if it's a bed sheet is in a blanket removal so if you just simply remove the peer a whole platinum layer on top of will come out but because you are developing the P R some part of it can be taken out and somebody will remain and for and the Platinum can be preserved with the features now we have I will show you the substrate that has been patterned through liftoff technique and dyes decimal so dyes ducing wafer dicing machine so that that way because you will not be able to see the you not be seeing the you'll not be seeing the devices in a full silicon wafer but it is a diced silicon wafer so you can see it under microscope under the camera so this is this is part of a whole silicon wafer okay but what we did these are individual chips you can see we have diced this wafer and if we dicing is done using an automatic dicing machine that is available in the Institute and we give the pitch and spacing of the device of the devices and that machine will go around making x and y lines on your wafer it's a very sharp tip light Dicer and will cut make and these lines on the wafer and the devices will come out you can see these dyes dicing lines on the wafer now this is a specific special design where that incorporates micro heaters the resistance temperature devices electrodes isolation ranges a lot of things on this device I am NOT going to the application of it because it's still under research but I can show you the design as such and before dicing we keep the wafer on a sticky paper so that it can be diced by the machine that's why I can take it like this the devices are on it and the devices you can see you can take it out from this to keep paper sticky material and the material will be diced and we can take it out now I have removed so this is the wafer okay wafer with the platinum electrodes and the divided devices have been diced now some this wafer I have taken out one one device so that one device is in my tweezer here you can see it in this this is one device we can see this device under the microscope then I will explain to you what is it about so we have seen the sensors on the substrate right now I have taken one such sensor and I'm holding it with my two sir tweezer here you can see it right in my hand this is the size of one sensor okay now let's look at this engine under the microscope so I'm keeping it under the microscope you can see the microscope behind next to me I'm keeping into another microscope we will look at it under 5x optical magnification okay so let's look at the screen I will focus it now let's see the sensor so you can see the sensor now on the screen very clearly correct now if you see the major part 80 to 90% of the sensor arc on that pads the active area of the sensor is very very very small it's only 0.5 mm by 1 mm okay which is what you are seeing in the screen at the center you can see a circular structure which is a micro heater around that micro heater you can see inter digitated electrodes in a circular fashion around that you can see a dark ring like structure correct the darkling light structure is actually a trench or a deep hole that has been made for thermal isolation around this trench you can see three structures right three winding structures these three winding structures are again resistance temperature devices what are resistance temperature devices resistance temperature devices are also like micron heaters but the thing the difference is that they are not actively heated that means they only respond to a change in temperature to which they are exposed to they are themselves not heated to a particular temperature so resistance temperature devices change their resistance as heat is impeached on them that's the idea the authority is that you heat the micro heater to a particular temperature you put a sample on top of the sensor and that through the micro heater that temperature will spread right and that change in spread through the sample will be dictated by RT DS that is a general idea about the working of the sensor and there are a lot of applications which we are not allowed to divers so this is how you make a sensor design so you can see that this this says the sensor has electrical properties thermal properties a lot of properties also included in the design which can be measured ok so this is one design you can see that bigger metal parts that are going out are actually the for the contacts for the pads they eventually end up with pads we can say I can show you the pads also if I go towards the right keep going can see that these that will keep on increasing and it will end up in pads these are pads this is the edge of the pattern okay and the dark edge that rough edge is the edge of the sensor this white thing is the pad part of each of the connections and what you saw at the center is the active area it's called the active area of the sensor so you have seen how the sensor structure is how though let's let's come back so you have seen how the sensor structure is so we have seen how silicon wafer which is pi could find a micrometer in thickness can be diced how platinum material can be deposited on top of the sensor and how it will be diced and what what is a process that you use if you have a material for which you don't have an etching agent proper acient which can give you controllable h rates what is the alternate process that you can go for which is liftoff that we have seen we have shown you how we have made a sensor with platinum using liftoff technique how the process was done how that wafer was diced using an automatic dicing machine we did not we don't have that machine in our premises so we just spoke to you about that then how it will be stuck on to a sticky material and then you saw the dicing lines on the substrate then I took out one such wafer one such a sensor I showed you that sensor in my tweezer and we looked at it under the microscope also and saw how the functionally it might be useful for any sensing applications okay now another example that we have is you might have seen the sensor during this course of this project cause of this NPTEL course it's a small it's a very simple micro heater structure that we have I have here with me a lot of micro heaters okay on this wafer I have a lot of micro heaters on this wafer okay one such micro heater let me take it in my twister it's very small micro heater it's literally in the micro so I have it in my tweezer I don't think I don't know if you can see it this is the size of the micro heater okay and there at the top and bottom you have contact pads for the micro heater and it's a winding structure now how do you handle such things to make in division systems so for that how do you handle such things to make intelligent systems so for that you need to use a technique called wire bonding okay so you can you can increase the area that you have to work with by bonding these contacts of the sensors on to a PCB kind of structure using a technique called buyer bonding and then you can take the cornerbacks from there I will show you this same sensor that has been wire bonded onto a substrate so in my hand let's look at it in close in my hand I have these sensors which you can see and their contacts have been wire bonded on to these pads and these pads can be taken from here so now it is very easy to solder onto it this is like a PCB this is a PCB only from the sensor we have wire bonded onto the PCB and it can take out from the PCB see this is part of packaging it's called MEMS packaging so we have packaged in the sensor in a way that it can be used into a into another further or upstream or downstream electronic circuit otherwise it is very difficult if you don't package it it will be difficult to interface it with a downstream and upstream electronic circuits so that is the importance of packaging so that's how the small sensor we have made it in a size that is hand level in our hand and we can interface with a bigger electronic circuits that we might have it might be having so this is one system on one of the methods that are used for MEMS device to make systems out of it so packaging is a very important aspect of that so that's what we saw now now another sensor that we can have is again electrodes but the size and dimensions are different just wait a second let me close this up and then we can see the next sensor now it's a similar structure as compared to what we saw for the platinum electrodes these electrodes are also platinum based but these are used for gas sensing applications you can see the sensor in my hand here you can see a bright spot a white color spot at the center rate that is because it has been coated with an active material for sensing applications and underneath this active material you have electrodes so let's look at this also under the microscope I have kept it in a microscope so this is an electrode on top of its we have a sensing a layer ok so let's look at this computer screen so you can see the computer screen it's very difficult to see you can just see so you can see the mice mouse pointer on the screen so you can see the mouse pointer so you can see that underneath this is a lot of noise right lot of you it looks like some dirty thing but it's not actually dirty it's the sensing material which is carbon nanotubes so if you have to see these carbon nanotubes properly you have to go for a cm imaging not optical optical imaging but underneath this nanotube you can see this electrode structure here below you can if you look closely you can see the electrode structure so on top of the electrode here on top of the hood we have coated with carbon nanotubes so this will act as a sensing layer so if some material comes and interacts if the carbon nanotube it will change the impedance of the underlying electrode and that can be used for sensing so this is a course in sensors and actuators that's why I am making you through different different interesting types of sensors and how they can be actuated in the real-life real-world situations so this is one type of sensor that can be used ok so in the past several modules short short modules we have seen different types of sensors different types of materials different types of processes different types of substrates Gold's of glass substrate silicon substrate gold material platinum material a qing process lithography process let's drift off process a lot of things we have seen sensing materials carbon nanotubes I have introduced you to all these things now as the next step what we will do is we will see these actually these sensors have to talk to real world systems right so how do you so let's say if I take a sensor that can measure properties of a material how do you prepare the material so it can measure from the sensor so on such material that we use our tissues from patients so how can we how do we prepare the tissue so that it can be used to measure with the sensor so in the next module we will look at how issues can be deeper at the Paris inhalation is a process which I will introduce to you in the next module and we'll see how tissues can be prepared after they have been taken from the patient and preserved for a long-term preservation such from such samples from long-term preserved samples how can you take out tissues and how can you process them and condition them so that they can be used for measurement with the sensor so that will be next module hope you are finding all these modules interesting thank you see you next time
