 Nanotube Sensor Detects Nitrosamines in Air Superfund Research Program Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers   have developed a sensitive and inexpensive sensor that can measure N-nitrosamines in air Classified as probable human carcinogens, N-nitrosamines are produced during cosmetics, pesticides, and most rubber product manufacturing and have been found in air, water, and food Older techniques to detect N-nitrosamines are slow, expensive, and require sophisticated instrumentation The new sensor is made of cobalt (III) tetraphenylporphyrin molecules attached to carbon nanotubes stretched between gold electrodes The sensor is integrated with an air pump drawing air in, and a processor to collect data and report in real-time to a computer or smartphone This research addresses problems that impact human health, including reducing human exposure to N-nitrosamines To learn more about this research, see: He M, et al. 2019.
