 good morning how are you doing today wow this is we have one week left are y'all anxious to go home the only issues alright enjoy the time you are here I guess the last week will be the most challenging and it'll be most fun reminder Monday we we are going to take the official PW si 2019 photo so everyone please wear your pw-sat t-shirt so we'll walk over to Walker right after the seminar Monday take the photo and then lunch so I guess we have to decide who's gonna get lunch first maybe whoever arrives first get the first lunch but anyway remember to wear your BWI t-shirts so it is great pleasure to introduce professor Evelyn when she is the department head of our Mathis mechanical engineering department but as a way of introduction I'm going to call each class and could you wave your hands so race car let's see UAV racing car works Meza lyrics see build a CubeSat okay embedded system security hacking a 3d printer okay I'm going from my memories of assistive technology remote sensing for the disaster response okay so our came from Mexico all right did I forget did I forget someone oh I was counting clearly I must not be prior mighty since I cannot count the UA UAS synthetic aperture era team but maybe you go first for lunch today [Music] with that let's say welcome professor everyone went [Music] good afternoon everybody it's really great to be here it's also great to see the energy in the room so thanks Bob for really taking the leadership in this program he's been really the key figure to make this all happen for you all so we're all very appreciative that I like to today share with you some our work at the intersection of thinking about renewable energy and the needs for clean water and in particular the group that I lead focuses on taking advantage of engineered materials and a way to help us try to advance these types of technologies so certainly we all know that in the u.s. we consume a lot of energy and we rely on all sorts of different sources for this type of energy this is a pie map showing you where we get most of our energy from you can see that we have a high reliance on petroleum natural gas and coal and certainly it's been very useful as we all use it in our daily lives thinking about how we heat and cool say for example residential commercial buildings how we light up the buildings for example and how we actually live comfortable in these buildings in general well so think about how we transport ourselves from place to place and think about how we utilize internal combustion engines mainly for transportation still finally a lot of industrial processes and everything that we use from that of what we're wearing to that of that a power generation still relies still traditionally on a lot of these traditional sources of energy so this is no surprise that this is a time where there are challenges now that we are faced with in particular thinking about climate change and the impact it will have in all of us as we look forward in the next decade even and so I think a lot of the opportunities lie at least for our generations and you guys is thinking about well how can we develop new technologies such that we can solve these problems and that we can facilitate opportunities for the generations to come a lot of my group has focused on thinking about these advancements in nanostructure materials for those that are unfamiliar with this area it's been abundant in the last few decades now and thinking about how we can take advantage of engineered structures where we can tailor them at the length scales even smaller than a hair right and that ability to take advantage of these kinds of materials and the ability to manipulate in the way to enhance and create new functionalities they can have for example all sorts of interesting new material properties right for example what I show you on the right here is a structure that's in fact 3d printed it's a three-dimensional structure that can have interesting mechanical thermal and optical properties all at once and that's an example of the types of materials now that we can create because of our new capabilities at these modeling skills we can also manipulate light and new ways we can think about how we affect how we wet materials for example example thinking about raincoats and the coatings that we utilize say Teflon to repel water I can think about these materials for co2 capture for example in capturing the the extra the co2 is emitted from the greenhouse gases finally there are certainly many opportunities in energy conversion and storage so while there's abundance of these types of opportunities in research that a lot of us have pursued in the area um the perspective that I have is that this is where the innovations lie and think about how we can address developing technologies and being able to address developing technologies at the macro scales so I'm not sure what happened here give me one second so my perspective here is that if we can advance these materials you can really advance I don't know what's going on okay and the opportunities lie and now think about these large-scale systems such as that of solar power plans that of photovoltaic cells maybe that of water desalination and taking advantage of the innovations at the small scale to now start to think about more efficient lower-cost solutions so what I thought I'd talk about today are three examples of where this has been pertinent to my research I bring back this pie chart that I showed earlier and I wanted to highlight in particular you said there's a small sliver right now that is focused on this renewable technology it's about 10% of all the total energy and in fact when you look at the breakdown of Howard's getting this kind of renewable I want to highlight in fact you can see solar still has a very small penetration it's only about 6% of that 10% and so so solar energy in particular is relatively underutilized and it's by no surprise when we think about the total energy reserves for all the different resources we have solar energy trumps everything else right in terms of how much energy we can produce per year compared to that say of traditionally coal of an of our total reserve a coal so I'd like to think about a lot of my group is how we develop more efficient and lower-cost solutions such that we can in fact deploy more solar energy approaches such that we can help solve this problem of climate change so the first example I'll give you is an area that you may or may not have heard of where we're looking at solar thermal photovoltaics or otherwise known as STP v's and you may have heard the word foldable tax of course and when we think about photovoltaics or solar cells they've been relatively now more commonly used where the idea here is that you take advantage of the partial spectrum of the Sun where the energies are above what you call the bandgap of the photovoltaic cell and those that energy is in fact converted to electricity through generating electron hole pairs it's a relatively scalable technology it's solid-state in nature however a big challenge at this technology while the costs of photovoltaics have gone down it's intermittent right because the fact that storage right now still with electrical batteries is extremely expensive in contrast to photovoltaics you can think about the other types of power generation approaches for large-scale systems and that's traditionally known as solar thermal so you may have seen there are certainly many examples of this around the world now what happens in this approach is that you have a concentrating system in this case it's a parabolic trough you collect the solar energy in the form of heat and the heat is then taken to drive a traditional steam cycle in this case you can in fact absorb all of the solar spectrum in the form of heat so harness is a full spectrum and it can be also utility scale however because there's a lot more moving parts we're using a steam engine in this case right if maintenance can be more challenging the advantage however is that because now we have taken the solar energy in the form of heat we can store it relatively cheaply and so certainly there are many opportunities there and this is why we've been particularly interested in this now certainly there are advantages of these both approaches as I just presented and the ones we've like to focus on is thinking about well how do we now harness a full spectrum of the Sun how do we make it scalable potentially solid state because that's moving parts makes it potentially cheaper and also allow for this continuous operation so he utilizes energy at night and this is where the concept of a solar thermal photo heck comes from so what I show you here is a schematic of a photo tag and the idea here is that instead of just having the photovoltaic what you do is you insert in the middle between the Sun and the phoebe cell a selective absorber emitter the idea here is you absorb all the spectrum of the Sun in the form of heat and you tailor the emission the the the emission the thermal emission from this selective absorber emitter such as it targets the bandgap of the PV cell and this way you can theoretically achieve over 80% conversion efficiencies with these devices so this has been the opportunity we've been pursuing it's a little bit less traditional in nature you may ask well why has not even deployed and certainly there are many challenges but the idea is that how can we then take advantage of these nanostructures materials in a way to help us think about this concept and maybe get closer to this theoretical potential so this is a schematic on the left and some images of what we have created here so we've in fact experiment Li now been pursuing understanding characterizing these types of devices and taking advantage again of interesting materials platforms to help us realize higher efficiencies what I show here is in fact now the solar sunlight is coming in here and as I mentioned it has to be absorbed from in the form of heat and so we have to in fact take a very good absorber what we've decided to do is that we know that black paint is a very good absorber but we've used to get very high absorbed tivity in fact our carbon nanotubes carbon nanotubes you may have heard of are these kind of kind of cylindrical structures that you can in fact row that are relatively scalable and they have a carbon base right so they actually had very good absorb absorptivity and because of that we've decided to pattern it in a way as or a selective absorber to capture as much of the solar energy in the form of heat now in the backside as I mentioned you want to capture the energy in the form of heat but then you want to admit it because we're doing thermal mission this has to happen in about a thousand degrees Celsius so it's a very high temperature emission process by which now in fact on the back side we can tailor what's happening by utilizing kind of nanostructured materials to now guide the light in terms of the wavelengths that we'd like to pursue and then finally then we have the photovoltaic cell right I mentioned a key attribute at the photo take is a bandgap because that's what determines if you reach kind of the near the bandgap you can kind of convert these electrons electron will create these electron generate electron-hole pairs essentially to generate electricity and so this is a setup that we've used to now think about how we could potentially now realize these kinds of devices what I show on this video here in fact you can see that in fact the device this select absorber emitter is glowing right because it's a beyond a day per point and it's actually so hot that you can see it glowing okay so what we've been doing is in fact as I mentioned looking at these kind of interesting structured materials to be able to maximize performance of these systems I already mentioned these carbon nanotubes but in fact we're using multi wall and they have carbon nanotubes these are typically what they look like this is a scanning electron microscope image of kind of this cross-section of this region here which we have patterned onto this surface I'd also mention on the back side we have these what we call photonic crystals essentially what they do is in fact effectively kind of it selectively tune the wavelengths by relying on interference of the light right in in fact in relying on the constructive destructive interference of light then you can get particular wavelengths that then are emitted and so in this cross-section image here this is a one dimensional with the calls of photonic crystal it's made of silicon and silicon dioxide layers as you can see here of different thicknesses and because you're relying on these different thicknesses in design now have these interference patterns that's what allows you to tailor the spectrum the other aspect what we've done is that because it's not completely efficient in the process we've inserted now in front of this photovoltaic cell a filter and so when there are photons that are below the bandgap the energies are below the bandgap in fact they can now get reflected back to the Selective absorber emitter and then essentially recycled such it they can be used for emission at the proper wavelengths again so this has been the set up that we've been working on and I just thought I'd show you one graph of where we are so ideas with this kind of design in fact what I'm showing you as a baseline is if we didn't have this selective absorber emitter structure this is your photovoltaic cell and in this particular device the efficiencies are relatively low in fact this is a relatively low quality cell it's not a silicon cell it's a low bandgap cell because basically the idea is that bandgap dictates what temperature you need for the thermal mission so we're dealing with relatively lower temperatures on the order of a thousand degrees if you want to use a silicon cell which is of course much cheaper and now they can create relatively high efficiency cells you have to reach about 2,000 degrees Celsius so this is just to give you a comparison of where we are the gray as I said is a baseline you can see here that in fact these are two different s T PV devices you can see here this is convergent efficiency as a function of our power output power density and you can see that we've at the point now when we have this kind of FD PV device we can in fact exceed the performance of these photovoltaic cells and what this suggests in fact this kind of spectral control via the nanostructure design facilitates us to achieve this type of approach an important metric also is looking at heat generation as you can imagine if there's any inefficiency in the system that gets converted into heat so you see here on the right figure this is a heat generated as a function again of the output power density and you can see that in the typical PV so that as you expect as you have higher output density you have a higher amount of heat that's generated because it's more inefficient right and so what we see here is that using these STP V's using the Selective as we're emitter you can reduce the heat load also by about 2 X so when we've reported this work a few years ago this was the highest conversion efficiency that we've demonstrated to date using these SDP vs certainly I said well the potential is at 80% and we are working towards that because as I kind of alluded to the heat kind of the temperatures that we're dealing with are large that means the kind of loss is able to deal with the system are challenging so one of the things is that while we deal with in our lab kind of a 1 centimeter squared or 2 by 2 centimeter square type device as you scale up its can minimize some of these losses so what we anticipate is that as we scale to about a 400 centimeter square device which is a more practical type device our conversion efficiencies can reach about 10 to 15 percent which make them more competitive with PV s and then thermal storage becomes much cheaper so this is one example of the opportunities that we think present themselves and thinking about these kind of tailoring of the nano structures for you know thinking about solar thermal utilization now coming back to this plot this fly that I showed you earlier I wanted to touch a little bit on transportation because certainly an aspect of this problem is how we can minimize greenhouse gas emissions by using electric vehicles instead of that of internal combustion engines so this is a project that we've worked on also for about now five years or so this was funded by arpa-e which is a program government agency focused on trying to think about breakthrough solutions in the energy space so what we've been working on is what we call a thermal battery and the whole idea here is again the challenge with electric vehicles the reason why they have not readily deployed is because of driving range and we no batteries are improving Electrical batteries are improving however when we look at actually what consumes is a significant portion of the driving range it's in fact HVAC right it's for human comfort in the vehicle when you're driving in a hot day and in fact based on the statistics you can see this is a power consumed by the HVAC depending on what the temperature is and it can be up to about thirty percent of the power of the whole vehicle so in fact what this translates to in fact is a reduction of your driving range to up to about forty percent so can be significant and so in fact what we've been thinking about is well how do we develop a more efficient HVAC potentially that does not drain the electrical battery power of your vehicle why it's driving alright so essentially what we're trying to create now is a thermal battery it's providing heating and cooling on demand that you can also charge with your charging station at home say when you're not driving but not utilize electric battery power so this is what we've been working on like I said I we coined it a thermal battery because of the idea it's storing heat rather than storing electricity and the metrics that we've defined here is based is based on how we can in fact now make this competitive to that compared to what Electrical batteries can do when interfaced with a typical vapour compression cycle for HVAC systems the way we decided our approaches problem again is taking advantage of interesting nanostructured materials in fact the materials were using our desiccants so you may use them everyday without even knowing them for example using a Brita filter right a Brita filter in fact uses these zeolites what they call zeolite particles that help you filter out these various minerals that you don't want to drink and so these kind of desiccants or in fact they're used in packages to keep things dry right silica gels are often used in this capacity an idea here is that we're taking and it's what we call these desiccants in a different way and the idea here is that in fact say imagine you have a surface with these desiccants and in fact we want to now we have water say a bucket of water and we now evaporate this water and it gets adsorbed onto these desiccant materials in that process of adsorption because it's on the surface so it's called adsorption what the process of water molecules now sticking to this high surface area material you in fact release heat in this process okay so that process of now kind of absorbing is exothermic in nature you can imagine maybe where I'm going with this and now if you think about in the process of the evaporation itself like when we sweat what are we doing we're cooling right so in fact if you have water that can now evaporate then in fact you can get cooling and when you think about well sure that's one way right that's one direction process by which you now capture all this water say on your desiccated material now how do you release it well the way you release it is you provide heat you're essentially using thermal energies away to now release these water molecules from the surface of the material and then eventually you can now condense it okay so that's kind of the operating principle that we've been working on using these all sorts of different types of kind of nano structured desiccants to help us think about this thermal battery so I highlight now exactly how this would work in an electric vehicle so in the cooling mode you have a reservoir right so you have this reservoir now that delivers say water through your evaporator to this adsorbent bed this is where your desiccants fly and the idea here is that again as you evaporate that water you are cooling by providing cooling and you can deliver that cooling to your electric vehicle cabin now in the heating mode what you do is in fact now you take that now evaporated water and then you absorb it and once you absorb it as I mentioned that's an exothermic process by which now you can generate heat the thing is it's interesting about this when you think about changing phases so from liquid to vapor phase there's an important quantity known as a late heat of vaporization the reason why it's so powerful for water is because it's extremely high right and that's why in fact your computers in fact utilize liquid to vapor phase change for cooling your microprocessor and so the idea here is that if we use water as adsorbate right this liquid that we want to change phase in fact you can get very high heating because in fact the latent heat of adsorption as you in fact interface these water molecules with the surface is about 1.4 times that of latent heat of vaporization and so that's why this is an interesting approach and effectively what we're doing here is we're creating thermal storage but not in the traditional sense is that we're relying on a chemical potential difference between having a dry as orbiting bed of your desk khun's with a wet reservoir and that chemical potential is what allows you to store this thermal energy and once you open up the valve you allow this evaporation process to happen or that adsorption process now regeneration of this will be done by applying heat right so you can imagine now we have this normal battery we charge it up like we charge a let's call battery at home we can use take advantage of solar or waste heat sources very readily because it's relying on thermal energy rather rather than electricity so we've been working on this concept for some time as I alluded to already that the key here is thinking about how we can now get the kind of energy densities that we need in terms of thermal energy and an important aspect of this is how we tailor these kinds of material structures these desiccants so silica gels are not great while they're very cheap they don't really have the characteristics that we want so we've been working a lot on these kind of zeolites in tailoring them which are these very highly porous high surface area structures as well as what another kind of class of materials known as or metal organic frameworks laughs and by incorporating these high-capacity adsorbents and also incorporating novel kind of binders that bring these kinds of what you almost look like powders into a matrix you can in fact enhance in mechanical and thermal processes in a way to make this kind of thermal battery work and finally there's a very important aspect it's not just about the materials engineering is a really critical part of this all and that you have to design the system in a way so that you can ensure that the rates are sufficient to now deliver all the kind of various the adsorbate to the system and actually release the heat and deliver the heat when you need it in different places so it's really the kind of the combination advanced materials choices to be able to as well as that heat and mass transport processes that dictate the design of the battery well they won't go into too many details I'll show you that we've had many generations of prototypes this is our last generation developed in the lab and collaboration of Ford in fact who is interested in deploying these in their next generation electric vehicles and the idea here is in fact that we have a two-bed design the reason why we've created a two-bed rather than a single bed which I kind of demonstrated with your schematic the schematic is that you can potentially charge onboard right because if you'd have waste heat from your from your electric vehicle you can in fact recharge it and now regenerate in this process I just want to thought I show you that and of course experiments are never trivial you want to characterize these kinds of systems this is a kind of an image of what we have in a lab to now replicate what's happening in electric vehicle and we fought a lot about the packaging and the weight and size constraints of these kinds of designs such that we can in fact effectively deploy them at some point in the future and I finally show a graph of a representative performance so what I show you is the power as a function of the time if you integrate this you can get in fact how much what is this power dense kind of the energy that you can extract from this heating and cooling and when we kind of integrate basically under the curve you can see that get about heating about four kilowatt hours thermal and cooling about 2.6 kilowatt hours thermal which is exceeding the initial target that we had to kind of aim for and in the perspective when we think about how this thermal energy kind of can be compared to that say of say lithium-ion batteries integrated HVAC what I show you is this plot here looking typically how you compare thermal batteries in general and how we can put ourselves in the mapping of things so here on the top this left axis is specific energy and the bottom axis is energy density and what we've demonstrated so far is in this region here in this blue we believe and just to give you some sense here the red is where lithium-ion battery packs are based based on this kind of cooling you can see that we think that as we now develop further these technologies we can really get to this top right regime which is where we want to be so we can be really competitive with the market that's at this stage what I've described to you is an example of electric vehicle type applications however we believe this kind of approach using these kind of novel desiccant materials and adsorption processes in fact can be now translated also to HVAC in your home which is also a significant energy consumer and there are a lot of different applications you can imagine with the same types of physics so for the last part of my talk so I think I'm a little bit at a time um I'd like to think about share with you our some work and think about kind of I mentioned you know there's a strong connection between energy challenges and water water scarcity is a significant challenge in a lot of our world in fact two-thirds of the global population is facing a water crisis and the future we anticipate water demands will be even more critical even potentially more critical than that of energy itself you can see that from this mapping the world that there are some developing regions that have significant shortage of water the the colors on this map showed the number of months in which water scarcity is oh it's greater than not it's potentially a hundred percent see there are a lot of place in the world that's dark red and so certainly this is a big challenge for us an approach that we've been very interested in is thinking about well not only can we dis Allen 8 which is also used in various regions um there's a lot of water in the air in fact the amount of water that as a resource is equivalent to about 14% of fresh water in lakes on earth or that's about 13,000 trillion liters of water so some significant amount of water in the air and so the question becomes or what we were asking is well how do we harvest this water from the air and maybe we can produce drinking water especially in areas where you can't afford desalination units to make them efficient they usually are very large in nature such as our RO plant and so this is the last topic I like to share with you where we're taking advantage in fact for the same materials I just talked about these zorb n't desiccant materials in a different way to harvest water certainly water harvesting is not a new idea people have been working on it for some time a pretty traditional way to do this in fact is using for duration so basically you take your surface below the dew point and you start to condense the challenge with this is that this works very well in high humidity regimes so you can see from this plot here if your humidity levels are say above 50% or so it can be relatively efficient but if you're in desert like regions where the humidity say on the order about 20 or 30% the efficiencies of these types of systems are so low it makes this type of do harvesting process practically infeasible so we've been interested in this particular regime given the fact that if you look at that map again most of these regimes in fact the regions of the world where there's a significant scarcity in the water are also very arid in nature so what we have been doing in fact is thinking about utilizing these porous materials again and introducing a new water harvesting device that's based on adsorption the idea here is we've been focused on specifically metal-organic frameworks I mentioned these are also 3-dimensional frameworks the reason we've been interested particularly in these materials because the way you can tailor them to have the functionality that you want and get the kinds of behaviors you want to make this device work in these arid climates and the way this device works is shown on the schematics your life the idea here is that you have these absorbance in a thin layer and at night when it's cold outside in fact you capture the water from the air and it is orbs naturally on to these materials now during the day you want to harvest the water utilize sunlight again as a means to do this because you're using again as a form of heat as a heat source to now extract or release the water from this material in this device that basically a very high humidity environment and because of that process by which now you can generate enough vapor locally at high human high humidity conditions now that in fact you can condense at ambient and rather than now relying on a refrigeration cycle and so because of that we've been interested in utilizing this kind of water harvesting from air approach using these interesting materials like I said these moths and their all sorts of moths out there the one we focused on is Moth 801 and this is a characteristics here you can see here the water uptake as a function of your humidity conditions is that there's a nice kind of rise in the uptake around humidity conditions about 20% and we're really relying on that point you can tailor where that rise happens such that we can maximize the amount of water that we can capture using the materials such that this kind of concept can become feasible this is an image of our device this is a proof of concept device done and MIT initially the idea here again here's your layer of your metal-organic framework this is a surface initially we were trying to control the temperature of the surface so we knew exactly what that temperature was but what was exciting about this demonstration certainly from utilizing sunlight to release the water from these materials you see certainly over time you see more and more accumulation of these water droplets and this suggests that there certainly is promise in this approach however we know that as you've experienced Boston is a very humid climate and what we want to demonstrate is that we can do this in these kinds of desert-like regions and so we went to Tempe Arizona we were lucky to have really gracious colleagues that work at University of Arizona that let us use our rooftops you can see why this is challenging here so this is looking at the climate this is a temperature over time of day and you can see here that in fact that the dew point in this case right over night and daytime in fact is negative what that means for traditional state of the art doing type technology where you rely on refrigeration is the fact you have to freeze the water right to be able to actually now do this process when you freeze water as I just alluded to earlier the latent heat is so high for water that becomes so inefficient in this process and so this is the opportunity for our type of device because we don't rely on getting below the dew point you can see here that again here in the green is what the humidity looks like right and so because of that you can see the humidity's are low this is a the right axis here so that this is a perfect test platform for what we'd like to pursue so we've done some modifications because we wanted to further optimize for these particular conditions I won't get into too much detail here but one of the opportunities that we pursued in fact at night time you can in fact radiate towards the sky because it's radiation of the process by radiative cooling as you can in fact help us further improve the device performance at how much we can actually capture at night okay so we've done this on the rooftop like I said this is just an image of what now this device looks like and in fact this time we do not use control temperature stage and everything's just relying on ambient cooling and so here's an video of what happens as you see that you're actually now desorbing the water from these materials because he initially fogs up right and as the system heats up you start to see that you can actually see what's happening on this on the surface right so you can see certainly there's a lot of water droplets are being formed certainly this is still proof of concept but we think this is a important demonstration to get to the next step and thinking about scalability of this device and how we potentially now could think about a larger device for say a village in remote area when power is not readily available so I just showed you a few examples of where the role of nano structure materials in different forms can have an important impact in the development of renewable energy technologies as well as water devices I mentioned already but I'll highlight again I think while there are certainly many opportunities and thinking about nanostructured materials still we need to think further about where are the challenges and what are the things we need to address the first often is scale up with the materials the off and the materials are still the bottleneck in the total cost of the system because some of these materials we finally tale in a way that we have not been able to necessarily produce them at scale yet and related to that as I mentioned is cost reduction that's really critical in this process for practical systems also robustness is very important that academics sometimes don't think about because of the fact that we can demonstrate something once they say oh it works but obviously to deploy it in a real system we have to think a lot about the robustness of the materials it was like that the cyclo bility of these materials especially with temperature gradients in and finally we also want to push performance because I think as we I've demonstrated some potential as we get them to be more efficient as the key metric oftens efficiency per cost right so we have to really think about that but certainly I hope you remember from this talk that I've given is that there are abundant opportunities and there is this important role in kind of novel nanostructure materials to help us think about addressing these large-scale challenges we face to mitigate climate change so with that I want to acknowledge my group this is my current group that's really done a lot of the work that I've demonstrated that I just talked about today some of my collaborators as well as funding sources so thank you very much oh I'm happy to answer any questions fall is joy just take them or do you want out okay I'll hunt you the right to on the top yeah it's a very good question I'm in the Camco denier and so I think there are different perspectives from different people for me I see it as I need to understand what the problem is right so I'm usually driven by so what is a challenge that we're facing and then I explore I'm not a material scientist by any means but what we do is we look around say oh what are the material scientists what have they done right what are the innovations and so we say well if we could utilize our materials can we design a system now that can address this need and so that's always been kind of the philosophy in the process of my group good yeah that's a good question um so I should mention just to qualify we're not creating a product yet I call the proof of concepts because they're not out there in the market usually product is considered something that's already kind of for sale and liable and all that stuff I would say that as the more people that you consult the better and there are many ways to do that first of all I have wonderful students they teach me stuff every day and so we always discuss this together as a team so usually there's a group of us maybe a handful that really initially discusses the concepts and comes up with the ideas then we also have group meetings within our group but also an opportunity as always conferences and things like that nature where it's not maybe as active discussions but you present your work you always get feedback and a lot of that helps you kind of iterate in that process so probably when you think about kind of how things of all probably end up having at least tens of people right I've seen your work right but a lot when the initial concepts are kind of a few people god yeah that's a very good question it's a question that we get asked a lot and I think it's a question of what scale this kind of approach is applicable we don't see it as something that can address all of the water needs of everywhere in the world and we think that if you locally affect it slightly it won't really affect total water patterns but that weather patterns but we do are concerned about that and we have to look into it further but we kind of see it as like a household kind of unit or like a village like scale but that's some a very important question that we still have to address on the top over there yeah it's a good question so um I'd like to think that I think in fact a lot of our materials are not really flammable there's not really an issue with as much as state safety compared to that of electrical battery because the concept is very different right so these materials are these kind of for example metal organic frameworks you know there are these materials that basically are pretty they're basically metal clusters with organic linkers so there are these organic materials that really don't really affect they shouldn't have much they don't have reactivity for example and so in that way then the other thing we're dealing with is water right waters not really flammable right in that sense so in fact because of this mechanism and we're relying on the thermal processes in your vehicle itself already and so because of that we don't see this as a significant safety issue at all gets over there to the left [Music] sure yeah certainly plasmas are used a lot and a lot of physics types approaches is especially thinking about potentially a fusion maybe or other ways of generating energy I can't speak to specifically as I don't work in that area but I think that there certainly I think the I think it's an open question in general still right where the where do we think and I think different communities will think different perspectives of where we can really where is the the best opportunity to create energy in the most efficient and low-cost way right and I think the other thing will be what's the scale right and think about where the needs for different regions of the world and trying to address that maybe and specifically in targeting what are the needs for those areas yes over there yeah I have not worked specifically on transparent solar panels I know people are working on them to help I think there are opportunities there and thinking about maybe cogeneration and the idea here is that if you utilize some of the heat for something else maybe there's an opportunity for to facilitate a new system type design and so while there are people working in that area I have not pursued that myself yes go ahead mm-hmm yeah I think batteries certainly have made quite a bit advancement especially the siomay on the past few years even right but I think to really be aggressive and hit some of these targets I've been proposed I think they're due there does there has to be something else right now I don't know maybe a battery people would disagree with me but I think there's at least what I've seen is kind of what's projected I think it may be hard to kind of aim for these kind of targets like you said in that European Union this is where we think the thermal battery could have a potential but I think it really I think it's non-traditional in the sense that in particular the automotive industry when we worked with them they're very conservative for good reason and so trying to think about new approaches say even for HVAC when they've also used to using a vapour compression cycle there's a full Safa chol kind of psychological kind of change and shift that needs to happen our hope is that as we get further and further developed in this technology working with car manufacturers such as that afford that there could be once someone's willing to buy in that potentially it can enable kind of kind of thinking about it kind of more deployment electric vehicles and trying to hit some of these targets that are set pretty aggressively by different places yes go ahead it would be that certainly I think there's certainly in terms of airplanes there's a lot of aspects of the airplane so a question is where do you start right I think a lot of this is so for example people have been creating composite materials for airplane wings for example to make them much lighter right and so there are lots of opportunities and airplanes themselves from the body of the airplane the heating cooling of the airplane to the engine designs there's a lot right that is there and I think it's right for many opportunities in all these applications we could certainly try to implement new nanostructured materials and how that advanced is kind of the design of these systems however so much of these materials are exploratory so like I said the key is well how do we get it the path so that they become reliable and it's not just a one-off experiment in the lab or ten of experiment all right and so those are the questions that we need to pursue go ahead yeah it's a good question so I guess I didn't mention this my collaborators explicitly so for example Mar and solo check who's worked a lot with photonic crystals he's in physics here at MIT Omari Yogi's in Department of Chemistry so I think we often say we have a problem what's what are the innovations we read papers and then we say hey this guy is a big shot in the field let's go try to talk to them right and it doesn't matter I think at this stage I think where we are in academia we cross boundaries all the time so and in fact in our department we have material scientists in our department even though there are Macao engineering so you can see that departments don't matter you see that in fact a lot of the impacts that we're all trying to make relies on the interdisciplinary collaboration of many disciplines it's go ahead I'm not too familiar of venta black what is that okay okay so I see so certainly you want to maximize so in a solar thermal application you want to maximize it matter of thermal energy you could capture so right now you can see that when we carbon nanotubes you get pretty much almost 99% essentially absorption right so certainly we can look at other materials and maybe it could be lower cost in some ways as well for panels themselves you don't necessarily want to just absorb all that because I know the heat up right so you don't want to heat a solar panel typically because then the efficiency goes down about a point five percent or something like that per degree right so in a typical PV cell you probably don't want to use those kinds of materials yes going that's a good question I don't know I don't have that number off the top of my head but I could say that they're pretty scalable now because of what they're often done is grown and a chemical vapor deposition kind of setup and he grow tons per you couldn't really grow a lot of it I don't have that number off the top of my head I would say that I didn't get into the details so this is really try to help us get a proof of concept and I think there are other opportunities other than carbon nanotubes the reason we chose with carbon nanotubes it's because we patterned it in a specific way as I mention I dig into the details but we were trying to get a bidding higher and higher area ratios between that as admitted to absorber and the idea here is you want to maximize the amount you can capture but we patterned in a local area because also because it's very good absorber it's also a very good blackbody emitter so you actually lose a lot of the heat and we're relying on an area ratio to minimize that heat loss because the rest of the surface actually has a low emissivity so it's kind of this trade-off we've been playing with and so we've worked with that platform but maybe in the future it's not necessarily what we will use yes go ahead yeah [Music] in fact I think the early conceptions of STV is a good question we're thinking about space applications for sure good can you repeat that first part I missed a little bit of your first part of the question pollution that's it so in fact this is a vapor transport problem right so way we've could capture the water in fact relies on vapor and vapor it doesn't usually capture also takes contaminants with you so in fact there's that because of the phase change itself it's kind of readily kind of filtering the extra contaminants in the in the air I would say that's something that still we want to show but we that's kind of the ideas that we think that it should actually be pretty pure water and big cities though I think there's a like I said I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all technology for these water challenges or energy challenges I think it's going to be dependent on location sometimes in certain big cities they may have the infrastructure to say use other types of approaches for our larger scale of water production such as that of reverse osmosis or something like that as well sure one more question last question that's a very good question and as I've become more into the academic world where you you're you start off as an idealist and thinking oh everything we developed oh of course people will just buy in but it's actually probably the opposite right of what happens and so it's a good question because I think I've started realizing the importance of trying to educate more broadly kind of what we can offer right in terms of what technologies have and and of course they'll always be lobbyists and others that are in opposition is figuring out how to navigate that so becoming kind of engaged in the policy discussions and things that are outside of engineering become really important and thinking about deploying technologies and so actually as I I think I think it's all of its its role for all of us to be a part of and I realized for myself I need to be more engaged in those discussions and go to DC and talk to these people and hopefully as you eat people more that they can also see your side well they may not agree with you always hopefully you can penetrate a few people right and maybe make things happen because that certainly is an important challenge we have a lot of kind of advanced technologies out there and I think the reason they are not deployed are because of the reasons you just mentioned and so it is an educational opportunity for all of us and also a challenge that we all have to face and figure out how do we overcome over overcome these kind of hurdles but I'm convinced that as a technologist that if we can learn how to also speak their language there's significant opportunities to maybe help contribute towards that and make impact you [Applause]
