 carbon nanotubes CNTs are allotropes of carbon with a cylindrical nano structure these cylindrical carbon molecules have unusual properties which are valuable for nanotechnology electronics optics and other fields of materials science and technology owing to the materials exceptional strength and stiffness nanotubes have been constructed with a length to diameter ratio of up to 132 million to 1 significantly larger than that for any other material in addition owing to their extraordinary thermal conductivity and mechanical and electrical properties carbon nanotubes find applications as additives to various structural materials for instance nanotubes form a tiny portion of the materials in some primarily carbon fiber baseball bats golf clubs car parts or Damascus steel nanotubes are members of the fullerene structural family their name has derived from their long hollow structure with the walls formed by one atom thick sheets of carbon called graphene as well as buckminster fuller's name these sheets are rolled at specific and discrete chiral angles and the combination of the rolling angle and radius decides the nanotube properties for example whether the individual nanotube shell as a metal or semiconductor nanotubes are categorized as single walled nanotubes SW NTS and multi walled nanotubes MW NTS individual nanotubes naturally align themselves into ropes held together by Van der Waals forces more specifically PI stacking applied quantum chemistry specifically orbital hybridisation best describes the chemical bonding in nanotubes the chemical bonding of nanotubes involves entirely sp2 hybrid carbon atoms these bonds which are similar to those of graphite and stronger than those found in alkanes and diamond which employ sp3 hybrid carbon atoms provide nanotubes their unique strength you topic types of carbon nanotubes and related structures there is no consensus on some terms describing carbon nanotubes in scientific literature both wall and walled are being used in combination with single double triple or multi and the letter C is often omitted in the abbreviation for example multi-walled carbon nanotubes MW NT you topic single-walled d equals PI in two plus in M plus M 2 equals 78.3 n plus M 2 minus n m p M display style D equals frac o pi s QR T in carrot 2 plus n M plus M carrot 2 equals 78.3 s QR t n plus M carrot 2 nm p.m. where equals zero point two four six nanometers SW and T's are an important variety of carbon nanotubes because most of their properties change significantly with the nm values and this dependence as non monotonic Cicotte our a plot in particular their bandgap can vary from zero to about two electron volts and their electrical conductivity can show metallic or semiconducting behavior single-walled nanotubes are likely candidates for miniaturized electronics the most basic building block of these systems as an electric wire and SW NTS with diameters of an order of a nanometer can be excellent conductors one useful application of SW n T's as in the development of the first intermolecular field effect transistors FET the first intermolecular logic gate using SW CNT FETs was made in 2001 a logic gate requires both AP FET and an infant because SW NT s RP FETs when exposed to oxygen and infects otherwise it is possible to expose half of an SW NT to oxygen and protect the other half from it the resulting SW NT acts as a not logic gate with both P and n-type FETs in the same molecule prices for single walled nanotubes declined from around $1,500 per gram as of 2002 retail prices of around $50 per gram of s produced forty to sixty percent by weight SW and T's as of March 2010 as of 2016 the retail price of s produced 75 percent by weight SW NTS was $2 per gram cheap enough for widespread use SW NTS are forecast to make a large impact in electronics applications by 2020 according to the global market for carbon nanotubes report I topic multi-walled multi walled nanotubes MW NTS consists of multiple rolled layers concentric tubes of graphene there are two models that can be used to describe the structures of multi walled nanotubes in the Russian doll model sheets of graphite are arranged in concentric cylinders eg a08 single walled nanotubes SW n T within a larger 0:17 single walled nanotubes in the parchment model a single sheet of graphite has rolled in around itself resembling a scroll of parchment or a rolled newspaper the inter layer distance in multi walled nanotubes as close to the distance between graphene layers in graphite approximately 3.4 ax the Russian doll structure is observed more commonly it's individual shelves can be described as SW n TS which can be metallic or semiconducting because of statistical probability and restrictions on the relative diameters of the individual tubes one of the shells and thus the hole m w NT is usually a zero gap metal double walled carbon nanotubes d w NTS form a special class of nanotubes because their morphology and properties are similar to those of SW n TS but they are more resistant to chemicals this is especially important when it is necessary to graft chemical functions to the surface of the nanotubes functionalisation to add properties to the CNT covalent functionalisation of SW and TS will break some C equals C double bonds leaving holes in the structure on the nanotube and thus modifying both its mechanical and electrical properties in the case of DW NTS only the outer wall is modified DW NT synthesis on the gram scale by the C CVD technique was first proposed in 2003 from the selective reduction of oxide solutions in methane and hydrogen the telescopic motion ability of inner shells and their unique mechanical properties will permit the use of multi walled nanotubes as the main movable arms in upcoming nano mechanical devices the retraction force that occurs two telescopic motion is caused by the lennard-jones interaction between shells and its value as about 1.5 nanonewtons you Topic junctions and cross-linking junctions between two or more nanotubes have been widely discussed theoretically such junctions are quite frequently observed in samples prepared by arc discharge as well as by chemical vapor deposition the electronic properties of such junctions were first considered theoretically by lambent at all who pointed out that a connection between a metallic tube and a semiconducting one would represent a nanoscale hetero Junction such a Junction could therefore form a component of a nanotube based electronic circuit the adjacent image shows a junction between two multi walled nanotubes junctions between nanotubes and graphene have been considered theoretically but not widely studied experimentally such junctions formed the basis of pillared graphene in which parallel graphene sheets are separated by short nanotubes pillared graphene represents a class of three-dimensional carbon nanotube architectures recently several studies have highlighted the prospect of using carbon nanotubes as building blocks to fabricate three-dimensional macroscopic greater than 100 nanometers in all three dimensions all carbon devices Lalwani at all have reported a novel radical initiated thermal cross-linking method to fabricate macroscopic freestanding porous all carbon scaffolds using single and multi walled carbon nanotubes as building blocks these scaffolds possess macro micro and nano structured pores and the porosity can be tailored for specific applications these 3d all carbon scaffolds architectures may be used for the fabrication of the next generation of energy storage super capacitors field emission transistors high-performance catalysis photovoltaics and biomedical devices and implants topic other morphologies carbon nano buds or a newly created material combining two previously discovered allotropes of carbon carbon nanotubes and fullerenes in this new material fullerene like buds are covalently bonded to the outer side walls of the underlying carbon nanotube this hybrid material has useful properties of both fullerenes and carbon nanotubes in particular they have been found to be exceptionally good field emitters in composite materials the attached fullerene molecules may function as molecular anchors preventing slipping of the nanotubes thus improving the composites mechanical properties a carbon Peapod has a novel hybrid carbon material which traps fullerene inside a carbon nanotube it can possess interesting magnetic properties with heating and irradiation it can also be applied as an oscillator during theoretical investigations and predictions in theory a nano torus as a carbon nanotube bent into a torus doughnut shape nano tori are predicted to have many unique properties such as magnetic moments 1000 times larger than that previously expected for certain specific radii properties such as magnetic moment thermal stability etc vary widely depending on the radius of the torus and the radius of the tube graphin ated carbon nanotubes are a relatively new hybrid that combines graph it exfoliates grown along the sidewalls of multi walled or bamboo style CNTs the folia density can vary as a function of deposition conditions eg temperature and time with their structure ranging from a few layers of graphene you topic extreme carbon nanotubes the observation of the longest carbon nanotubes grown so far one over half a meter 550 millimeters long was reported in 2013 these nanotubes were grown on silicon substrates using an improved chemical vapour deposition CVD method and represent electrically uniform arrays of single-walled carbon nanotubes the shortest carbon nanotube as the organic compound cyclo paraffin allene which was synthesized in 2008 the thinnest carbon nanotube as the armchair to to CNT with a diameter of 0.3 nanometers this nanotube was grown inside a multi-walled carbon nanotubes a signing of the carbon nanotubes type was done by a combination of high resolution transmission electron microscopy HR TEM Raman spectroscopy and density functional Theory DFT calculations the thinnest freestanding single-walled carbon nanotube as about 0.43 nanometers in diameter researchers suggested that it can be either 5 1 or 4 2 SW CNT but the exact type of the carbon nanotube remains questionable 3 3 4 3 & 5 1 carbon nanotubes all about 0.4 nanometers in diameter were unambiguously identified using aberration corrected high resolution transmission electron microscopy inside double walled CNTs the highest density of CNTs was achieved in 2013 grown on a conductive titanium coated copper surface that was coated with coal catalysts cobalt and molybdenum at lower than typical temperatures of 450 degrees Celsius the tubes averaged a height of 380 nanometers and a mass density of 1.6 grams CM minus 3 the material showed ohmic conductivity lowest resistance 22 kilo ohms you topic properties you topic mechanical carbon nanotubes are the strongest and stiffest materials yet discovered in terms of tensile strength and elastic modulus this strength results from the covalent sp2 bonds formed between the individual carbon atoms in 2000 a multi-walled carbon nanotubes was tested to have a tensile strength of 63 giga pascals 9 million 100,000 psi for illustration this translates into the ability to endure tension of a weight equivalent to six thousand four hundred twenty two kilograms force sixty two thousand nine hundred eighty n fourteen thousand 160 lbf on a cable with cross-section of one square millimetre 0.0016 square in further studies such as one conducted in 2008 revealed that individual CNT shells have strengths of up to approximately equals 100 Giga Pascal's 15 million psi which is in agreement with quantum atomistic models because carbon nanotubes have a low density for a solid of 1.3 to 1.4 grams per cc it's specific strength of up to 48,000 kilonewtons M kilogram minus 1 as the best of known materials compared to high carbon steels 154 kilonewtons M kilogram minus 1 although the strength of individual CNT shells is extremely high weak shear interactions between adjacent shells and tubes lead to significant reduction in the effective strength of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and carbon nano tube bundles down to only a few GPA this limitation has been recently addressed by applying high energy electron irradiation which cross links inner shells and tubes and effectively increases the strength of these materials to approximately equals 60 Giga Pascal's for multi-walled carbon nanotubes and approximately equals 17 Giga Pascal's for double walled carbon nanotube bundles CNTs are not nearly as strong under compression because of their hollow structure and high aspect ratio they tend to undergo buckling when placed under compressive torsional or bending stress on the other hand there was evidence that in the radial direction they are rather soft the first transmission electron microscope observation of radial elasticity suggested that even Vander Waals forces can deform to adjacent nanotubes later nano indentations with an atomic force microscope were performed by several groups to quantitatively measure radial elasticity of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and tapping contact mode atomic force microscopy was also performed on single walled carbon nanotubes young's modulus of on the order of several GPA showed that CNTs are in fact very soft in the radial direction you topic electrical unlike graphene which is a two-dimensional semi metal carbon nanotubes are either metallic or semiconducting along the tubular axis for a given n/m nanotubes if N equals M the nanotubes as metallic if n minus M as a multiple of three and n does not equal m and nm does not equal zero then the nanotubes as quasi metallic with a very small bandgap otherwise the nanotube as a moderate semiconductor thus all arm-chair in equals M nanotubes are metallic and nanotubes six four nine one etc are semiconducting carbon nanotubes are not semi metalic because the degenerate point the point where the pi bonding band meets the pi asterisk antibonding band at which the energy goes to zero is slightly shifted away from the k point in the Brillouin zone because of the curvature of the tube surface causing hybridization between the sigma asterisk and pi asterisk anti-bonding bands modifying the band dispersion the rule regarding metallic versus semiconductor behavior has exceptions because curvature effects in small diameter tubes can strongly influence electrical properties thus a 5 0 SW CNT that should be semiconducting in fact as metallic according to the calculations likewise zigzag and chiral SW CNTs with small diameters that should be metallic have a finite gap arm-chair nanotubes remain metallic in theory metallic nanotubes can carry an electric current density of 4 x 109 up per square centimeter which is more than 1,000 times greater than those of metals such as copper where for copper interconnects current densities are limited by electro migration carbon nanotubes are thus being explored as interconnects and conductivity enhancing components in composite materials and many groups are attempting to commercialize highly conducting electrical wire assembled from individual carbon nanotubes there are significant challenges to be overcome however such as undesired current saturation under voltage and the much more resistive nanotubes to nanotube junctions and impurities all of which lower the electrical conductivity of the macroscopic nanotube wires by orders of magnitude as compared to the conductivity of the individual nanotubes because of its nanoscale cross-section electrons propagate only along the tubes axis as a result carbon nanotubes are frequently referred to as one-dimensional conductors the maximum electrical conductance of a single walled carbon nanotube as 2 g o where G 0 equals 2 times 10 to the 2 per hours as the conductance of a single ballistic quantum Channel because of the role of the PI electron system in determining the electronic properties of graphene doping in carbon nanotubes differs from that of bulk crystalline semiconductors from the same group of the periodic table eg silicon graphitic substitution of carbon atoms in the nanotube wall by boron or nitrogen dopants leads to p-type and n-type behavior respectively as would be expected in silicon however some non substitutional intercalated or adsorbed dopants introduced into a carbon nanotube such as alkali metals and electron rich metallocenes result in n-type conduction because they donate electrons to the PI electron system of the nanotubes by contrast pi electron acceptors such as iron 3 chloride or electron deficient metallocenes function as p-type dopants because they draw PI electrons away from the top of the valence band intrinsic superconductivity has been reported although other experiments found no evidence of this leaving the claim a subject of debate you topic optical carbon nanotubes have useful absorption photoluminescence fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy properties spectroscopic methods offer the possibility of quick and non-destructive characterization of relatively large amounts of carbon nanotubes there is a strong demand for such characterization from the industrial point of view numerous parameters of nanotubes synthesis can be changed intentionally or unintentionally to alter the nanotubes quality as shown below optical absorption photo luminescence and Raman spectroscopy --zz allow quick and reliable characterization of this nanotubes quality in terms of non tubular carbon content structure chirality of the produced nanotubes and structural defects these features determine nearly any other properties such as optical mechanical and electrical properties carbon nanotubes are unique one-dimensional systems which can be envisioned as rolled single sheets of graphite or more precisely graphene this rolling can be done at different angles and curvatures resulting in different nanotube properties the diameter typically varies in the range 0.4 to 40 nanometers ie only approximately 100 times but the length can vary approximately 100 billion times from 0.14 nanometers to 55 point five centimeters the nanotubes aspect ratio or the length to diameter ratio can be as high as 132 million to one which is unequaled by any other material consequently all the properties of the carbon nanotubes relative to those of typical semiconductors are extremely anisotropic directionally dependent and tunable whereas mechanical electrical and electrochemical supercapacitor properties of the carbon nanotubes are well-established and have immediate applications the practical use of optical properties as yet unclear the aforementioned tunability of properties as potentially useful in optics and photonics in particular light emitting diodes LEDs and photo detectors based on a single nanotube have been produced in the lab their unique feature is not the efficiency which is yet relatively low but the narrow selectivity in the wavelength of emission and detection of light and the possibility of its fine-tuning through the nanotube structure in addition bolometer and optoelectronic memory devices have been realized on ensembles of single walled carbon nanotubes crystallographic defects also affect the tubes electrical properties a common result is lowered conductivity through the defective region of the tube a defect in armchair type tubes which can conduct electricity can cause the surrounding region to become semiconducting and single monatomic vacancies induce magnetic properties you topic thermal all nanotubes are expected to be very good thermal conductors along the two exhibiting a property known as ballistic conduction but good insulators lateral to the tube axis measurements show that an individual SW NT has a room-temperature thermal conductivity along its axis of about 3500 WM minus 1 K minus 1 compare this to copper a metal well known for its good thermal conductivity which transmits 385 WM minus 1 K minus 1 an individual SW NT has a room-temperature thermal conductivity across its axis in the radial direction of about 1.5 to WM minus 1 K minus 1 which is about as thermally conductive as soil macroscopic Assemblies of nanotubes such as films or fibers have reached up to 1500 W M minus 1 K minus 1 so far the temperature stability of carbon nanotubes is estimated to be up to 2800 degrees Celsius in vacuum in about 750 degrees Celsius in air crystallographic defects strongly affect the tubes thermal properties such defects lead to phone and scattering which in turn increases the relaxation rate of the phonons this reduces the mean free path and reduces the thermal conductivity of nanotubes structures phone and transport simulations indicate that substitutional defects such as nitrogen or boron will primarily lead to scattering of high-frequency optical phonons however larger scale defects such as stone-wales defect scause phonons scattering over a wide range of frequencies leading to a greater reduction in thermal conductivity you topic synthesis techniques have been developed to produce nanotubes in sizable quantities including arc discharge laser ablation chemical vapour deposition CVD and high-pressure carbon monoxide disproportionation hip Co among these arc discharge laser ablation chemical vapour deposition CVD our batch by batch process and hip go as gas phase continuous process most of these processes take place in a vacuum or with process gases the CVD growth method is popular as it yields high quantity and has a degree of control over diameter length and morphology using particulate catalysts large quantities of nanotubes can be synthesized by these methods but achieving the repeatability becomes a major problem with CVD growth the hip Co process advances in catalysis and continuous growth are making CNTs more commercially viable the hip Co process helps in producing high purity single walled carbon nanotubes in higher quantity the hip Co reactor operates at high temperature 900 to 1100 degrees Celsius and high-pressure approximately 30 to 50 bars it uses carbon monoxide as the carbon source and nickel iron pentacarbonyl as catalysts these catalysts acts as the nucleation site for the nanotubes to grow vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays are also grown by thermal chemical vapour deposition a substrate Cort silicon stainless steel etc is coated with a catalytic metal PHA Co knee layer typically that layer as iron and as deposited via sputtering to a thickness of 1 to 5 nanometers a 10 to 15 nanometers under layer of alumina is often also put down on the substrate first this imparts controllable wedding and good interfacial properties when the substrate is heated to the growth temperature approximately 700 degrees Celsius the continuous iron film breaks up into small islands each Island then nucleates a carbon nanotube the sputtered thickness controls the island size and this in turn determines the nanotubes diameter thinner iron layers drive down the diameter of the islands and they drive down the diameter of the nanotubes grown the amount of time that the metal island can sit at the growth temperature is limited as they are mobile and can merge into larger but fewer islands annealing at the growth temperature reduces the site density number of CNT per square millimeter while increasing the catalyst diameter vias prepared carbon nanotubes always have impurities such as other forms of carbon amorphous carbon fullerene etc and non carbonaceous impurities metal pays used for catalysts these impurities need to be removed to make use of the carbon nanotubes in applications you topic metrology there are many metrology standards and reference materials available for carbon nanotubes for single wall carbon nanotubes iso/ts ten thousand eight hundred sixty eight describes a measurement method for the diameter purity and fraction of metallic nanotubes through optical absorption spectroscopy while iso/ts ten thousand seven hundred ninety seven and iso/ts ten thousand seven hundred ninety eight established methods to characterize the morphology and elemental composition of

the basic properties and the content of impurities while iso/ts eleven thousand eight hundred eighty eight describes morphology using scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy viscometer e and light scattering analysis iso/ts ten thousand seven hundred ninety eight has also valid for multi-walled carbon nanotubes you topic chemical modification carbon nanotubes can be functionalized to attain desired properties that can be used in a wide variety of applications the two main methods of carbon nanotube functionalisation are covalent and non-covalent modifications because of their apparent hydrophobic nature carbon nanotubes tend to agglomerate hindering their dispersion in solvents or viscous polymer melts the resulting nanotube bundles or aggregates reduce the mechanical performance of the final composite the surface of the carbon nanotubes can be modified to reduce the hydrophobicity and improve interfacial adhesion to a bulk polymer through chemical attachment also surface of carbon nanotubes can be fluorinated or halo fluorinated by CVD method with fluorocarbons hydro or halo fluorocarbons by heating while in contact of such carbon material with fluoro organic substance to form partially fluorinated carbons so-called fluo car materials with grafted halo fluoro alkyl functionality you topic applications topic current current use and application of nanotubes has mostly been limited to the use of bulk nanotubes which is a mass of rather unorganized fragments of nanotubes both nanotube materials may never achieve a tensile strength similar to that of individual tubes but such composites may nevertheless yield strength sufficient for many applications bulk carbon nanotubes have already been used as composite fibers in polymers to improve the mechanical thermal and electrical properties of the bolt product Easton Bell Sports Inc have been in partnership with zai vex performance materials using CNT technology in a number of their bicycle components including flat and riser handlebars cranks Forks seat posts stems and aero bars zvex technologies has also built a 54 feet maritime vessel the Parana unmanned surface vessel

of 15,000 pounds over a range of 2,500 miles amaura Europe boy manufactures hype tonight carbon nano epoxy resins where carbon nanotubes have been chemically activated to bond to epoxy resulting in a composite material that has 20% to 30% stronger than other composite materials it has been used for wind turbines marine paints and a variety of sports gear such as skis ice hockey sticks baseball bats hunting arrows and surfboards the Boeing Company has patented the use of carbon nanotubes for structural health monitoring of composites used in aircraft structures this technology will greatly reduce the risk of an in-flight failure caused by structural degradation of aircraft Sri nanosystems synthesizes carbon nanotubes to create vantablack other current applications include tips for atomic force microscope probes in tissue engineering carbon nanotubes can act as scaffolding for bone growth current research for modern applications include using carbon nanotubes as a scaffold for diverse micro fabrication techniques energy dissipation in self-organized nano structures under influence of an electric field using carbon nanotubes for environmental monitoring due to their active surface area and their ability to absorb gases Jack andraka used carbon nanotubes in his pancreatic cancer test his method of testing won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair Gordon emore award in the spring of 2012 3 you topic potential the strength and flexibility of carbon nanotubes makes them of potential use in controlling other nanoscale structures which suggests they will have an important role in nanotechnology engineering the highest tensile strength of an individual multi-walled carbon nanotubes has been tested to be 63 giga pascals carbon nanotubes were found in Damascus steel from the 17th century possibly helping to account for the legendary strength of the swords made of it recently several studies have highlighted the prospect of using carbon nanotubes as building blocks to fabricate three-dimensional macroscopic greater than one millimeter in all three dimensions all carbon devices Lalwani at all have reported a novel radical initiated thermal cross-linking method to fabricated macroscopic freestanding porous all carbon scaffolds using single and multi walled carbon nanotubes as building blocks these scaffolds possess macro micro and nano

capacitors field emission transistors high performance catalysis photovoltaics and biomedical devices and implants CNTs are potential candidates for future via and wire material in nano scale VLSI circuits eliminating electromigration reliability concerns that plagued today's Cu interconnects isolated single and multi walled CNTs can carry current densities in excess of 1000 mega amperes per square cm without electromigration damage large quantities of pure CNTs can be made into a free-standing sheet or film by surface engineered tape casting setc fabrication technique which is a scalable method to fabricate flexible and foldable sheets with superior properties another reported form factor as CNT fiber aka filament by wet spinning the fiber is either directly spun from the synthesis pot or spun from pre-made dissolved CNTs individual fibers can be turned into a yarn apart from its strength and flexibility the main advantage is making an electrically conducting yarn the electronic properties of individual CNT fibers ie bundle of individual CNT are governed by the two-dimensional structure of CNTs the fibers were measured to have a resistivity only one order of magnitude higher than metallic conductors at 300k by further optimizing the CNT s and CNT fibers CNT fibers with improved electrical properties could be developed CNT based yarns are suitable for applications in energy and electrochemical water treatment when coated with an ion exchange membrane also CNT based yarns could replace copper as a winding material pyro Hannon at all 2015 have built a motor using CNT winding you topic safety and health the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH is the leading United States federal agency conducting research and providing guidance on the occupational safety and health implications and applications of nanotechnology early scientific studies have indicated that some of these nanoscale particles may pose a greater health risk than the larger bulk form of these materials in 2013 NIOSH published a current intelligence bulletin detailing the potential hazards and recommended exposure limit for carbon nanotubes and fibers as of October 2016 single walled carbon nanotubes have been registered through the european union's registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach regulations based on evaluation of the potentially hazardous properties of SW CNT based on this registration SW CNT commercialization is allowed in the EU up to ten metric tons currently the type of SW CNT registered through reach is limited to the specific type of single wall carbon nanotubes manufactured by OC ziyal which submitted the application you topic history the true identity of the discoverers of carbon nanotubes as a subject of some controversy a 2006 editorial written by Mark mondo and Vladimir Kuznetsov in the journal carbon described the interesting and often misstated origin of the carbon nanotube a large percentage of academic and popular literature attributes the discovery of hollow nanometer sized tubes composed of graphic carbon to sumio Iijima of NEC in 1991 he published a paper describing his discovery which initiated a flurry of excitement and could be credited by inspiring the many scientists now studying applications of carbon nanotubes though Iijima has been given much of the credit for discovering carbon nanotubes it turns out that the timeline of carbon nanotubes goes back much further than 1991 in 1952 lv radish kovitch and vm Lukyanova CH published clear images of 50 nanometer diameter tubes made of carbon in the Soviet Journal of physical chemistry this discovery was largely unnoticed as the article was published in Russian and Western scientists access to Soviet press was limited during the Cold War Montu and Kuznetsov mentioned in their carbon editorial the fact as radish kovitch and Lukyanova CH should be credited for the discovery that carbon filaments could be hollow and have a nanometer size diameter that is to say for the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1976 more noble end o of CNRS observed hollow tubes of rolled-up graphite sheets synthesized by a chemical vapour growth technique the first specimens observed would later come to be known as single walled carbon nanotubes SW NTS endo in his early review of vapour phase grown carbon fibers vp CF also reminded us that he had observed a hollow tube linearly extended with parallel carbon layer phases near the fiber core this appears to be the observation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes at the centre of the fibre the mass produced MW CNTs today are strongly related to the vp g CF developed by endo in fact they call it the endo process out of respect for his early work and patents in 1979 John Abramson presented evidence of carbon nanotubes at the 14th biennial conference of carbon at Pennsylvania State University the conference paper described carbon nanotubes as carbon fibers that were produced on carbon a notes during arc discharge a characterization of these fibers was given as well as hypotheses for their growth in a nitrogen atmosphere at low pressures in 1981 a group of Soviet scientists published the results of chemical and structural characterization of carbon nano particles produced by a thermal disproportionation of carbon monoxide using Tim images and XRD patterns the authors suggested that their carbon multi-layer tubular crystals were formed by rolling graphene layers into cylinders they speculated that by rolling graphene layers into a cylinder many different arrangements of graphene hexagonal Nets are possible they suggested two possibilities of such arrangements circular arrangement arm-chair nanotubes and a spiral helical arrangement chiral tube in 1987 Howard G Tennant of Hyperion catalysis was issued a US patent for the production of cylindrical discrete carbon fibrils with a constant diameter between about 3.5 and about 70 nanometers length 102 times the diameter and an outer region of multiple essentially continuous layers of ordered carbon atoms and a distinct inner core además discovery of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the insoluble material of Arc burned graphite rods in 1991 and mint Meyer Dunlap and Weitz independent prediction that if single walled carbon nanotubes could be made then they would exhibit remarkable conducting properties helped create the initial buzz that is now associated with carbon nanotubes nanotubes research accelerated greatly following the independent discoveries by Bethune at IBM and Iijima at NEC of single walled carbon nanotubes and methods to specifically produce them by adding transition metal catalysts to the carbon in an arc discharge the arc discharge technique was well known to produce the famed buckminsterfullerene on a preparative scale and these results appeared to extend the run of accidental discoveries relating to fullerenes the discovery of nanotubes remains a contentious issue many believe that each amaz report in 1991 as of particular importance because it brought carbon nanotubes into the awareness of the scientific community as a whole equals equals
