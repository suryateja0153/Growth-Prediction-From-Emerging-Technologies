 well we're on an efficiency theme so let's keep it a mic back there just for another moment for another yeah the farthest one why not thank you I'd like to just offer a comment my name is Janice Shaw I teach chemistry and physics that was Catholic High School in Philadelphia I love to come to events thank you I'd love to come to events like this because this is how I get a jump start to bring more enthusiasm to the kids I meet every day so I'm going back there tomorrow and i'm going to say guess what you need to do some work on material science let's do a project thank you very much where you comment thank you so I promise this gentleman up here yeah right there yes my name is Curtis Thompson I'm actually a research methodologist in the general field of social sciences and so I'd like to consider this in terms stages and your kind of laboratory and I think most of the stuff that you're talking I'm not going to talk specifically about fracking because I think fracking has some side effects that are not good I mean there are possible dangers and dr. Connelly said something about he i always had he never knew what he to quit or to stop i forget how you expressed as specifically but there was a question about the speed of what you're doing something and the legislative bodies of of pennsylvania now have passed a rule of law and corbett i think is probably signed it already that these gas companies in the gas lines actually have precedence they can decide without the city or the community saying where where that's going to go and this is there a question here descent okay i'm sorry just one is it because we're getting down to the wire what you think the word i think the chemists on the stage there seemed to think that there were no side effects are there any possible side of that you're not considering with regard to the maybe I could kind of address your question in terms of what I think all of us do in any product that we develop so we talked a lot about research in the labs but in any product that we develop extensive testing is done to make sure that it's safe for use as we kind of bring it out into you know general use in the in the industry that same thing goes on when we look at all the different operations that we run inside our companies whether it's in the upstream organization where we're pulling oil and gas out of the ground I mean there's a very extensive and elaborate evaluation that has to be done for the safety of that operation it mean just just just a comment I you've mentioned fright with the to the two dimensions of fracking that are talked about in really in relation to this tremendous benefit of low-cost energy are essentially water-related one is the fluids that go into the wells that are brought out often with large amounts of dissolved solids and other product and the treatment of those liquids in a way that they can be either reused or put back into the environment a safe way there's lots of technology going on to deal with that issue and if managed well and I believe it will be will be able to be sure that as we develop the technology of fracking for low cost energy will do in a way where that problem will be solved the second problem that gets a tent that gets mentioned as a potential problem is the contamination of aquifers from the actual fracking process where you now have not liquids have been brought out but permeation into drinking water for example and that needs to be watched as well the facts are the geological constructs generally for fracking or such that there are huge distances between where the fracking goes on and where the drinking water occurs for society that doesn't mean we kidding nor that issue but it does mean we have to pay attention to and manage it and if we manage risks in all of these areas whether it's fracking or anything else appropriately I think we'll find the benefit to risk ratios done well will be extraordinarily helpful for for society and for our children our grandchildren if we manage those risks in a reasonable way so we have time just for maybe two more questions the most anxious arm I've seen so far is this gentleman over here so please bring the mic over there hello my name is Paul mcgivney and I'm a chemistry teacher also at a high school arm I get my kids involved with material science because I give them innovative things like organic LEDs you're talking about LEDs I also get them involved in carbon nanotubes and my question to you is where do you see nanotechnology being incorporated into these modern materials in the future do you see that playing a big role I'll take one quick shot at that we're involved in in that in one area this is another area where you know will it ever see the promise of of what people have expected at a nanotechnology the issue in carbon nanotubes as you probably well know is as you produce them they are produced in bundles and exfoliating them separating them in an efficient way that allows and B to be used in a low-cost way and by that I mean with high yields so today to exfoliate these these carbon nanotubes the yields are very low two or three or four percent so you make a hundred percent and you have three or four percent to use the rest is waste very high cost back to some of the themes you heard over here so solving that problem of exfoliating them where you can get high yields will change the game for carbon nanotubes and there are technologies they're being developed today that are close to commercialization that I think will go a long way to solve that problem and then you'll see the cost curve for these carbon nanotubes come down enough so that they can be incorporated into everyday uses perhaps tires since I've talked about the tiring but imagine a carbon nanotube an entire now in addition to the other technologies entire to increase wear and durability and tire so the trick there is is the cost curve and it has to do with yields and there's a lot of technology being applied to that that's a great i just want to give a few other people opportunity to say something very quick comment on that our industry mainly the chemical industry and also micro electronics industry have been using nanotechnology before it entered the lexicon of the populists okay whether you take cracking of naphtha the heterogeneous catalysts are there is nanotechnology i won in his book described you know like aluminum gallium arsenide lasers those were done way before nanotechnology got popular in your particular example of carbon nanotube source we we just need to separate out is it a technology looking for a problem to solve or is it the other way around most of the other successes were they were actually solving a real problem we're just looking for a problem with the technology in hand so we just have to be careful not to get hyped about certain fat of the decade or fat of the month because they come and go okay so it's it's really how we make our lives better so I'll add one thing I don't disagree with anything that was said nano technology has been around a long time and those of us that have been in it had to figure out ways to try to show how what we were we've been doing for years now suddenly fall in this category of nanotechnology on the other hand I'll tell you from from studying materials there is a fundamental difference between a bulk material property and what happens when you down scale it oh so so when you take a bulk material and even go to a thin coating something different it's it's you get different properties when you go to the nano scale again you see a discontinuous change in properties so for me that means there are some things for us to do there not just with nanotubes but a lot of things for us to do in this nano nano space to develop really new materials we have time for one more right there yeah hi i'm steve freeman i teach innovation at university of pennsylvania and one of the things we emphasize in an understanding innovation is the difference between kind of continuous innovation or and radical innovation and despite the kind of exhortation zuv i've been running running the running the panel where he said try to liberate yourself from from present situation virtually all the all the innovations you spoke about were pretty much incremental you know going along the same path possibly the LED was something something really really new but i wonder i mean typically these things happen in an industry every generation or so you have some major change that really really changes the whole platform so i'm wondering if you're seeing any of those things on the horizon is there anything right now in the in the works that that really is a not just an incremental innovation but a fundamental change in the way you're doing business so i think there is a basic change in the way biology is going to impact the world of of of the material sciences all right wait and having been trained as a conventional classic chemical engineer and you take a look at biology in the ability to now engineer organisms to produce materials a broad array of materials at essentially room temperature atmospheric pressure in aqueous media with no exotic metals we this is a gam gamut of technology in a suite of of science that is going to radically impact the way we make materials for the future and and you add to that the exquisite specificity of biology me to allow us to produce materials not only more cost effectively than some of the conventional thermo thermochemical type processing but produce materials that yet you simply can't produce using conventional catalysis I think that is a really transformative change that's occurring in the world of materials that's we're living right now just one thing I think about along this line is if you if you really want to get a sense of how powerful biology can be in materials innovation just walk in a redwood forest or the Amazon and look at all the materials around and the remarkable properties they have you can start to bring that now into it into the artificial world and start to apply those ideas to the constructed landscape with new materials for technologies we're interested in that's a very powerful idea to me anybody else just I talked about carbon nanotubes I think that's one where there there could be in the foreseeable future a major breakthrough in yields that would lead to a big big change but you know innovation and breakthroughs it's an interesting question it's not that long ago you know we like to see things happen in two days two weeks to two months but if you look at and you talked about incremental changes but if you really look at the last 30 years of material science and plastics and synthetic rubber and the number of things that have been done perhaps incrementally individually in some in total much like the question earlier about improving energy efficiency of automobiles in some have been incredibly innovative and life-changing for society so you might have to look back 20 years and add up a whole series of things to really reflect on it and say this is major innovation as compared to looking for some breakthrough that occurs in a two day or two week or two third even one year period and I think that's something to think about when you think about innovation breakthroughs are often the sum of increments over time at least that's my personal you just to add one more one more thing to that I think it's true a useful way that I found to think about this whole issue is it is incremental if you're on the same s-curve everyone's familiar with the concept of the s-curve and as you begin into something you go up the curve there's lots of incremental improvement then there's a time at which that improvement stacks up breakthrough is jumping onto a new S curve and sometimes when you jumped onto a new S curve it looks a lot like the old when you were on for a little while and then you find there's a new slope to it and you can go up again you can go to a whole new place and so while there's no doubt there are degrees of breakthrough innovation and you know the jet engine was a breakthrough overflight and flying was a breakthrough rover just having horses to go around and those are those were changing in lots of ways that we all know are bigger than some of the things we've talked about but when the science breakthroughs allow you to jump to a new place and solve problems by breaking old rules you can go to a whole new place that will keep adding up time over time and that's what ultimately I think it's a partnership that we have to make we may have to make happen together is to identify those things and work to keep jumping onto those new curves because if we get complacent and just sit around waiting for a breakthrough to happen it actually is never going to happen and before we adjourn I just want to give the panelists 15 second opportunity for a final words or sound bite in case there was something you really wanted to say but you have been able to get out yet but I'm going to cut you off brutally the only thing I want to do is this thank you and the CHF and discover and mostly the people that actually were interested enough to come and listen to us I think we need please generate you know 11 more of you for everybody that's here we need more people more materials enthusiasts so thank you very much and with that I also thank everybody who came tonight to make this really a terrific evening thank you to the panelists organizers thank you very much
