remarks muriel i'll pass it over to you it's really a great honor to be um giving a few remarks uh to to open this and thank you very much to the organizers for inviting me uh of course millie was you know somebody who who was so wonderful and inspiring to everyone both uh personally and professionally um i particularly want to speak today as chair of the mildredessa house medal that ieee has recently instigated uh that was probably my my proudest achievement uh of my time as uh as chair of all ieee medals and and i definitely want to encourage everyone uh to consider nominating um the candidates for this medal it's a medal whose remit from the point of view of topics is very wide we're really looking for people who have had an impact um that goes beyond the technical uh but that includes of course uh the technical achievements um but from the point of view of of topic and particularly specialization actually were quite wide so please do consider um nominating um a worthy colleague uh somebody whom you feel reflects well the kind of qualities that that made nellie so remarkable and with that vladimir i'll give the floor to you it is uh truly an honor uh to uh recognize uh today's speaker the mildred dress class lecturer professor evelyn hoon professor who is a tar coin professor of applied physics and electrical engineering at john paulson school of engineering and applied science at harvard she's presently a co-director of the harvard's quantum initiative who is a member of the national academy of sciences the national academy of engineering the american academy of arts and sciences and the academia seneca of taiwan she's a recipient of the nsf distinguished teaching fellow award and triple a s lifetime mentor award the 2019 scs air engine medal and the 2020 ieee grove award she calls honorary doctorates from ethe hazurich at the university of glasgow heriot-watt university hong kong university of science technology and the university of notre dame and i am absolutely delighted to ask her to take over and tell us her story of transforming defects into opportunities by leveraging the nanoscale it gives me such great pleasure to try and express my gratefulness to millie for all the guidance and mentorship she's given to me from the time i was a graduate student and to be able to um publicly publicly express my gratitude for her and the inspiration that she's given to us all let me as i begin provide share a secret with you all perhaps a secret that a common experience that i've had with millie and that somehow has seemed like a good luck talisman to me um a la harry potter millie and i went to the same high school and you can see that millie has talked about how hunter high school was a real turning point for her this what you see on your screens is a report from the hunter college high school alumni update um recognizing millie's reception of the kavli prize and similarly for me hunter high school was a turning point i like millie grew up in the bronx there are many divergences in our pathway but i also appreciate the ability of an exceptional school and an exceptional education in being able to introduce young people to the world and giving them a wider perspective millie also commented very often in the beginning the encouragement came from women i think she was um recognizing the influence of various important people like rosalina and i wanted to note that hunter high school when millie and i went was an all-girls school and that was very important to my coming of age and the paths i took and certainly the encouragement came from women such as hunter high school such as millie who actually provided guidance for us all as you know millie is very often touted as the queen of carbon and queen of carbon and so much more and i show here uh and a schematic of a single walled carbon nanotube something that millie did much to lay the foundations for and many of you know that this single walled carbon nanotube seems to be a model of perfection symmetry periodicity the kind of material many of us like to work with because of its beautiful symmetry its regularity and because in many ways it's easier to do the computations and analysis for such a material so the question is in an imperfect world is perfection is this kind of regularity is this kind of symmetry a necessary precursor for transformative advances in science and engineering and of course my answer in this imperfect world is um undoubtedly there must be more creative ways to approach the wealth of materials and phenomena we have in the world and it was millie in fact who um in her lifelong career recognized that the youth there are unique opportunities at the nanoscale um at the nanoscale you are able to transform the materials that nature gives you what nature gives you by ways of electron energy levels um phonons and a variety of processes and you can engineer you have a chance to engineer or re-engineer those properties through a strategic understanding of what you can do at the nano scale and with this kind of inspiration um in fact millie in the 1990s beginning in the 1990s and continuing with work um that's being carried on today um rethought thermoelectric materials materials that can control the exchange of thermal and electric energy for a variety of very important applications where we can harness electronic energy from heat or consequently use use thermal energy to provide electronic information so what i show here is an equation many of you may know this and for those of you who don't don't be alarmed the most important thing here is to understand that there is something called a thermoelectric figure of merit and uh if you've seen this before that figure of merit has quite a simple relationship to some fundamental parameters the electrical conductivity the temperature the thermal conductivity and something called the stay back coefficient representing thermal power the issue here is that when we seek to improve the electric figure of merit that is to get a better performance or better exchange of thermoelectric energy with the materials that nature has given us even three-dimensional perfect crystalline materials all of these parameters are interrelated so that if you sought to increase the figure of merit by increasing the electrical conductivity you would soon find that in most materials thermal conductivity would follow in response and so that limits the amount of optimization that you're able to achieve with the materials that nature has given but millie was very early to realize that there may be new approaches and new directions in engineering thermoelectric materials at the nanoscale and this is an example although her work began with some seminal papers in the 1990s this is some more recent work that appeared in advanced materials and with uh ganchong who is a co-author and i think i believe still works in this arena and here is the here are the insights that millie realize um that if you can actually create a heterogeneous material engineer a material that nature didn't give you but take nano scale components with unique properties of their own for example this diagram that appears in this paper shows layers of quantum dot structures that have altered electronic densities of states they're embedded within a series of layers that have barriers or interfaces that are used to filter out and control electron energy levels so quite simply the heart of her idea was this to use unique properties at the nanoscale that involve quantum confinement to profoundly change what we call electron density of states and what i call controlled discontinuities aka interfaces now why do i say control discontinuities these interfaces these super lay super lattices are intrinsic to the idea that millie proposed and yet very often interfaces represent a discontinuity between different phases of materials they're often problematic because interfaces are sources of scattering and therefore decoherence for electronic states photonic states or phononic states but used in the right way they can all be brought together at the nanoscale to produce a material far better properties than nature has given us and so i want to take millie's inspiration and tell you today a little bit about how we followed in my group those new directions in understanding and engineering materials at the nanoscale in our case in particular finding directions to engineer materials with a combination of photonic correlated with spin coherence in those materials and i want to give my thanks to the variety of uh the researchers my in my lab who have graduated who are currently working very um diligently on this general set of issues and um members including members of my lab who recently joined roderick defoe is in particular a member of tim caceres's lab and we've had collaborations with tim's lab as well as the groups of david ashlam at the university of chicago and jorg rothschip at stuttgart and by the way diana is currently a postdoc working at mit so how do we realize opportunities at the nanoscale perhaps in a way analogous to the insights that millie showed in working with thermoelectric materials well we're going to take some unique properties at the nanoscale we're going to take the building blocks of quantum coherence but we're also going to work with defective materials seeming imperfections in a material so if we take a look here this is part of a crystalline structure of something that's called 4h for a particular poly type of silicon carbide and you see silicon in carbon here what you see largely is a periodic crystalline structure so that's the starting point we begin with a perfect single crystal semiconductor material but now what we're going to do is disrupt that perfection we're going to remove silicon atoms from that material so we create what i call silicon vacancies here and here and having insulted the material in this way we're now going to look for opportunities so this picture that i've given you of our starting material vacancies in silicon carbide perhaps is the wrong way to look at the problem the way i've presented this to you is that we're taking a perfect material and we're making it somehow less perfect but if we were to take the half full rather than the half empty view of science think of those vacancies not as something missing from the material think of those vacancies surrounded by the electrons in the local atomic vicinity as atom-like entities with particular um electronic and spin states that in turn are embedded within a complex wide bandgap environment that in fact has used tremendous sophistication to actually electrically isolate these um atom-like entities so with this point of view in mind let's ask what indeed are the electronic photonic and spin properties of the defect well a very simple and summary way of regarding it is to look at this simple electronic structure to the right and to note that the silicon vacancy which um is a not a vacancy but an actual atomic entity has its ground and excited electronic states as you see represented here and those by exciting elect electrons from ground state to excited state one pathway to um releasing that energy may be in the emission of photons with a distinctive energy the silicon vacancy also has an electron spin and it's known in this case that the electron spin is three halves and therefore you see that these electronic states the sub-levels depend on the spin um the particular spin or the projection of spin very interestingly but very importantly in this electronic structure there is this um titled ms which means um it's a metastable state i call it a shelving state it's a state that actually um helps to purify the spin state of the vacancy as we continuously cycle it through a series of excitations and release of energy what you can see here is that the various excited speed states three halves one half have different probabilities or different rates of interaction with this metastable state and therefore what happens is that the various spin states as they de-excite are held for more or less time by this metastable state and this quite simply and superficially um unfortunately um is the basis for a way that as we um excite and de-excite we continuously cycle through this process we can actually purify the spin state that we see observed from the silicon vacancy so the end result of all this and the takeaways are this seeming absence of silicon actually has quite a character character of its own it has the properties that its unique photon and spin states are correlated and coupled we have therefore the capability of by using optical signals we are able to prepare and read out spin states and more profoundly in terms of the wide range of applications we might be able to realize think of it this way that we have an atomic scale reporter with a quantum mechanical property called spin which is exquisitely sensitive to the magnetic or spin atomic environment and we have associated with that spin reporter a unique photon energy that can take this information and propagate over long distances far away from the very local information that this silicon vacancy can give us about its environment but having said that let me say but wait this is but hold on and this is the first of two but weights that i'm going to introduce to you the butt weight is i've told you about an atomic scale entity with a combined correlated photon and spin re information um with exquisite sensitivity to its local environment but as indicated symbolically here how can we obtain how can we possibly attain enough signal from a single atomic scale defect that's buried someplace in a block of material and indeed if i try to excite a block of material and take a look at the resulting photoluminescence spectrum that this emits at room temperature what i get is an almost featureless spectrum that basically tells me very little to nothing about the local environment if i cool my sample to 77 kelvin liquid nitrogen temperatures i begin to see some characteristics some identifying um indication that there is indeed um a silicon vacancy within but what you can see is that the peaks are faint and they're basically almost lost within the background and notice here that i have two peaks identified one is called v1 one is called v2 these are in fact um the different signatures from the slightly different silicon vacancies i showed you two vacancies in earlier um schematics there are slight differences in the crystallographic environment that lead to this distinguishing difference in the photon emission signature of the silicon vacancy so this is both good and bad it's very impressive that a silicon a missing silicon has such sensitivity to its home location in the starting crystal that it gives you a distinctive photon signature but the what if remains and the what if is how are we ever going to pull a reasonable signal out of the noise of these spectra so the answer also lies by our ability our insights and our talent to manipulate the nanoscale and the way that we're going to proceed is to create an integrated nanoscale environment for our silicon vacancies and i've introduced that concept symbolically here these parentheses indicate a um an isolated environment that induces a conversation or a coupling between our silicon vacancy um the atomic unit of interest and the environment so think of this as a breakout room at the quantum level where we place um our atomic scale silicon vacancy into an intimate and isolated conversation with its environment and its environment actually happens to be a discrete level of optical or photonic states so in effect what i want from this unique environment is to create a precise and distinctive application of the signal from the silicon vacancy it's a precision response that has to take into account the frequency that is the photon energy or frequency that's emitted by the silicon vacancy therefore a reflection of the precision of the electronic states of the silicon vacancy but it also has to identify and target precisely the spatial location of this silicon vacancy and remember we're talking about atomic scale entities um so this precision response to frequency and spatial location is a way of uniquely coupling to this silicon vacancy by this environment and in addition i hope it goes without saying that since we're talking about photons since we're talking about amplifying photons and we're talking about the unique photons that are emitted from the silicon vacancy this environment has to be very low optical loss this environment and far lower than many of the cavities you think you know those in the audience who worked with um cavities and i've already given it away because this is what i call this environment i call it a cavity um this cavity has to have the capability to recycle innis in essence store that photon energy as it goes back and forth between the emitter and this environment until i ask that information to be released for whatever purpose i wish so that is the wish list what i want of this kind of environment what does it actually look like well it actually probably looks much more humble than you might imagine it is basically this is silicon carbide this is basically a suspended one-dimensional modulated structure you can see that there is this marker here that states one micron there are holes that are punched into the silicon carbide and that's what i mean by modulated i modulate the structure by a series of periodic holes these holes center to center are about 100 nanometers um in distance this it may be difficult to see but this one-dimensional-like structure bridges it's a suspension bridge that is elevated over the substrate and it needs to be elevated because i want to minimize optical loss from this bridge to any other source now we call this bridge a photonic crystal with engineered photon states some of the best most seminal work on photonic crystal structures has come from mit and the term photonic crystal is in uh in acknowledgment of the fact that a regular crystal for those of us who work with semi-gun doctors for example a regular periodic crystal has well-known states and bands of energies for electrons this is the analog with well-defined states for photons but basically the message i want you to take away is humble though this may appear this is in fact and you'll have to believe me and i'll show you some evidence a precision finely tunable instrument with an exquisitely pure response that will make the silicon vacancy within it sing now to show you a little bit more detail in terms of how it sings and um what effect this nanobridge has i show you an electromagnetic simulation of what happens if i were to launch light through this nanobridge in essence what happens is for the right frequency of light there are standing wave patterns that are set up those standing wave patterns happen with wavelengths that actually correspond to this kind of structure that i superimpose that is the standing wave patterns show you concentrations of very high electromagnetic field that are in these regions about a hundred nanometers apart from each other and what you see basically are that there are very high regions of electromagnetic field that are localized in volumes of about a hundred nanometers cubed so very high field in a very small volume now to give you some indication that this works that we indeed can bring signal out of noise by in by building this very um bespoke that is um particularly generated uniquely distinctive environment that we design for the silicon vacancy within if you remember the photoluminescent spectrum i showed you at the beginning even at low temperature we could hardly distinguish the signal from the silicon vacancy from the background noise when we place the silicon vacancies within this cavity and we don't do anything to fine-tune the response or the conversation between the cavity and the silicon vacancy we see immediately and this is at room temperature this is untuned this is the particular v2 you can see that the signal to noise is um enormously better there's an exquisitely thin narrow response that corresponds to the silicon vacancy within this cavity now um you may think that what i've done with the cavity actually is taken a bandpass filter perhaps and with the bandpass filter that is located around a particular peak of interest i've managed to just filter out all the surrounding noise i want to emphasize that this is not this cavity is much more profound in its effect than simply filtering the response in fact this cavity brokers a unique conversation between electronic and photonic states and i know that this is a lot to uh for those of you who are hearing this for the first time it's a perhaps a big complicated um concept to lay before you and similarly for this equation but let me just try and simplify this this is an equation that actually describes how the cavity brokers that conversation and if the only thing you look at is this part purcell factor f is the ratio of the emission rate the photon emission rate of our silicon vacancy in free space that is free space in bulk material that is in the material as usual if i didn't do any consideration at the nanoscale and the emission rate in the cavity this is the critical feature and our hope is by instituting this unique environment that we can actually make this purcell factor quite a bit larger than one and what that means is that somehow we're brokering a conversation and exchange an almost lossless exchange of energy between electronic states in the silicon vacancy and photon states in the cavity so that the emission rate in the cavity is maybe orders of magnitude higher than it would be normally these components tell us what is important in doing this and it's a different way of describing what i said for um initially this high q over v this is a quality factor it it describes the resonance of the cavity in frequency with the silicon vacancy high q over v means that i have a really high field it's exquisitely in tune and it's concentrated in a very small volume this component is what i spoke about earlier and saying i need to pinpoint exactly where my silicon vacancy is um and be able to make sure that that field overlaps the position of that atomic scale entity so in essence this cavity is not simply a filter this cavity engineers a change in the spontaneous emission rate of the silicon vacancy and that is something that is profound if we go from further to show the possibilities of this cavity what i show you here is here is the cavity mode so we're going to go the next step and this is at a low temperature this is not at room temperature this is at four degrees kelvin and actually what we see that when we can actually do better in picking out the unique signatures of the silicon vacancy i told you about v1 v2 v1 actually has an excited state which we call v1 prime but the purpose of showing you this diagram is that we can take this beautiful instrument that we've made humble though it appears and we can change its resonant frequency actually by changing by adsorbing um condensates gaseous concentrate onto the cavity so we're by doing so we're changing the resonant response of our instrument and as we do it we change this cavity mode the response so we shift it to be in frequency resonance first with v1 prime and then v1 and what you can see as we do that in succession we can get this enhancement this purcell enhancement of as high as 75 for one of these transitions now this is almost two orders of magnitude and i go back to the first what if that i asked you because i'm um i'm going to uh the or what if hold on because i'm going to go on to the second hold on but to say that what we've done is actually address this issue of taking perhaps a single atomic entity and then getting enough signal now of course we don't really have in what i've shown you a single atomic entity although we may have five or ten and i'm going to go on to the next hold on but i want to as we move along our journey actually talk about this idea of resonance and exquisite instrumentation and acknowledge um millie's exquisite capabilities as a musician um and the resonance and the pure tones that she was able to achieve um in that other uh very talented manifestation of her her life so hold on to because in this very short introduction to you i've skipped over a lot hold on there should be lots of questions you're asking how can we controllably create the defects a single vacancy um and ensure that they have the electronic photonic and spin properties that i've glibly told you about how can we sculpt that nano environment that i showed you without giving you details and yet using the tools that a sculptor uses how can we do that without creating further defects and then if i do create further defects there must be other nearby defects in this environment how is it um what is the effect of those other nearby defects what are they and how will those other nearby defects within that small volume about 100 nanometers cube how will they affect the ultimate performance of the silicon vacancy that i'm interested in so just to show you um and to say um this is partially as far as we're going to go on today's journey but to let you know that new experiments are going on even as we speak we are taking this nano cavity and i show you this in this blow up we've been recently doing experiments to see how can we change the silicon vacancy and its um its defect colleagues in this environment how can we change it by coupling in additional energy like laser radiation at different frequencies or thermal annealing we've actually seen very interesting performance we've seen the ability to improve the signal we've seen the ability actually to make the signal go away which may actually be exciting because it may be a harbinger the fact that maybe we can have means of nudging the defect into the right spatial location but the end result of what i want to tell you here is that we can also use this nanoscale cavity not only as an amplifier but because it amplifies the signal use it as what i call a nanoscope to reveal local atomic environments and i say all this in deference to milli because it was always millie's interest to be led by the science to go down those wonderful rabbit holes of inquiry and excitement always taking the big picture understanding um the applications but wanting to understand the detailed science as well so at this point i think this is an appropriate resting spot for the journey that i've tried to take you on that was inspired by some of the um the insights and the approaches that millie espoused throughout her career um she's given all of us guidance along our collective journeys and wonderful recommendations to follow our interests have the best available education and training set our sites high always be persistent keep our options open accept help when offered and always be prepared to help so with all the guidance that millie has given all the transformations that she's made personally in science and in the sociology of science in opportunities that she's created for a vast community of people as scientists um as students at every phase of their career um i think millie's legacy of course relates to her tremendous accomplishments which are a lesson to us all her energy which was boundless and i just have a short story i want to tell here um millie served as a chair of a visiting committee for a science and technology center that i was involved in while i was at ucsb and um i remember that day where the committee had met they had come to some um advice and recommendations millie was scheduled to leave from santa barbara to fly to israel and she was talking about how she would arrive in israel eat a a short dinner she was going to perform in a string quartet and about a half a day later she sent us her notes the report that she had generated from the visiting committee so her energy is something that we can all emulate and many of us will fall short of her optimism was continuous and continues continues to inspire us her humility throughout all of this um is singular um and unusual with all her accomplishments i think it is important lesson to her all but i want to end with one comment that i've remarked on in terms of how when we honor millie and if you look at the multitude of encomiums that have been given on her behalf millie is celebrated for all her legacy but millie is also described as being beloved our beloved millie and i want you all to think how often have we talked about a colleague a role model as being beloved maybe this is a gender specific word but i think not we look to see accomplishments we look to see where there are pioneers who venture boldly into new areas but we don't often think about scientists role models engineers our colleagues as being beloved and in fact that is an incredibly difficult um uh characteristic to aspire to but i think you know if you think about what beloved means it means a degree of trust it means a degree of um willingness to to follow to believe to listen to and we all know particularly with the lessons of the past eight months or maybe the past four years that for a scientist and engineer to be beloved in that way and to have trust in that way makes um the difference between i think effectiveness and the ability to affect change so again thank you all for being here um to allow me to express my gratitude publicly to millie um and thank you vladimir finis all of you for um sharing and mit for sharing millie with the world um and um for sharing her legacy in so many aspects thank you thank you evelyn uh i'm gonna clap and i'm sure many many people around uh the participants would do it exactly the same indeed it has been an inspiring lecture you've given us and thank you very much for the echoes of melee that you have indeed concluded your lecture with um there are many questions uh that has indeed arrived please keep sending them through the q a tab if you have additional ones and you also are welcome to raise your hand and we will do our very best uh to call you um so let me start by asking you a few questions and i will choose in this case to read them um but sometimes i might actually call upon our colleagues to uh ask them themselves uh from nick what thing uh question uh dear evelyn the example of uh pre-sale enhancement on silicon vacancies is very exciting what can we expect as the ultimate limit of such purcell effect and what are the limiting factors in this case um that's an outstanding question and it's one of those grand challenge questions um nick if you mean by what do you think of the limit in the perfection of the cavity in terms of the purcell quality or what we are able to achieve in what we call strong coupling um it's a wonderful question and i want to say the following for those of you who have even seen what i've i've tried to show here obviously i showed you the cavity and you could um identify are there imperfections in the fabrication of the cavity itself um is that um the sculptor's tools fall short are there defects that we introduce by way of um creating the structure or is there roughness is there imprecision in defining um the measurements there is all of that and yet fundamentally and we're not yet at the limit at what i showed you ultimately when we talk about purcell enhancement and and defects when we talk about optical loss we talk about anything that takes the energy that we put into that cavity and absconds it for its own and that includes the very structures themselves that we want to further study and so in a sense what is the limit and nick i'll sidestep that but i would love to have a profound discussion with you at some time but to say this is the perfect tool for us to begin these explorations particularly when we're looking at atomic scale defects because the sensitivity to defects and the interrelationship with the performance of the cavity are so tightly intercoupled um that we learn about one by even if we give up on a parameter by um looking at the other evelyn continuing on that indeed the defects themselves are could be generated um the question from dorsal harvest is can you comment on the scalability of defect engineering can we count on their collective ensemble anytime soon what oppression question and it's always an issue of scalability um i want to answer in two ways and and um i have to say that with this issue of defects and there is a sophisticated audience i'm sure that realizes that these are not the only examples of defects there's something called the nitrogen vacancy and diamond that is actually the poster child and has had a long history um in terms of scalability that is the i don't know three billion dollar question whatever for all these quantum technologies and i have to say the following that they've been a variety of approaches that people have used by trying to use precision instruments to form the defects by using precision masking through nanolithography techniques um but i also want to say that in many ways um the formation even with all that precision um instrumentation is nevertheless stochastic and that's why i believe what we understand from the fine-tuning if indeed we can use the cavities themselves and introduce a post-processing step if we understand that enough even though that may not be scalable i don't know if we go back in and introduce a fine tuning to each component um i think that we need the means to fine-tune after the introduction of the defects but like millie i'm an optimist and that is the reason for science and engineering to proceed and i believe that there are techniques that we don't yet we're not yet aware of um in non-linear ways to fine-tune perhaps use the cavity itself to tune into to resonance if i can maybe add to that since you mentioned that clearly beyond silicon vacancies there are other types of vacancies we could also examine i would also imagine that you can also come up with a doping process where you might use molecules as active spin states has that been significantly investigated then what are the challenges as compared to using the crystalline semiconductors with their own vacancies that's a wonderful question vladimir and the answer is yes in certain ways um for example there's uh work uh you know to hesitate to um there's a variety of work going on that introduce for example rare earths into um glass-like material and i think that the field is um is waiting for innovation rare earths have certain capabilities because they have uh they carry their own natural sort of um they're the introverts of the uh of the atomic world which means that they're relatively insensitive to the environment around them but i i think what you're suggesting vladimir is um that that wonderful possibility at the nanoscale where the the original ideas that you have that interfaces are bad that heterogeneity is bad i believe that there are ways to perhaps engineer around that and there have been examples already that people are trying um a more straightforward question on you mentioned during your talk that you are able to tune the cavity by nitrogen absorption uh the question is can you explain exactly how that happens um why does the cavity get detuned so basically i think all of you know um basically it changes if you want changes the mass or effective index of the material so um any of particularly with a wind instrument but with all instruments you know that um the tones that you get from your instrument um depend very much on the if it's wind or or string the veneer the tuning um the thickness of the components um and so in a sense take a wind instrument and you're absorbing you're changing but you're doing this at the level of atomic layers that's the difference in sensitivity so you're fine-tuning um the response and it goes back basically to um the basic physics you do you're changing the resonant response but you're changing the resonant response at far higher frequencies than we're used to and so model layers of adsorb material shift the resonant response of our cavities the purple effect as you demonstrated it there indeed you're able to achieve at room temperature this significantly leads us to say well maybe quantum computing will achieve room temperature operation if that is one day what we truly aim to do with this idea is that is that visible so i will say is it feasible i uh you know i'm a school of people who believe that there is that possibility um and um you know it is because so will it happen tomorrow i i don't think so but the the tantalizing prospect is you know when i described the glassful to look at the components um within a structure as not being an absence whether it's defects or you add a molecule but it is within this wide bandgap semiconductor and the wide bandgap semiconductor has its own band structures and where electrons are allowed to live it doesn't buy the components absolute immunity but it's a different way of thinking of creating your structure begin with the package understand the electronic structure of the package and all the manifestations including strain and and um electrical changes and um how you can change the package and then embed your atoms or your vacancies within that package so the another question that came up is mathematical modeling of the phenomena that you observe in many ways the coupling for sale effect those are well understood mathematically are there needs for additional mathematical models to describe properly what happens down on the naming skill absolutely and and many of you in the audience know that that um the um the seminal work the seminal computational tools and even today the more sophisticated tools are being done at mit um absolutely more mathematical modeling there some of you in the audience may be aware of something which we now call although it's been in existence for a while um inverse design or inverse modeling which is to take um just to um rather than go and design forward thinking you know exactly what you want and how to optimize it take the factors that you really want to optimize out of a fairly complex system focus on that and then carry out the design process and that is actually um providing tremendous insights because the geometrical designs that come out of it are completely um non not to be expected they're they're um and and so the short answer vladimir is absolutely yes more modeling tools wonderful evelyn evelyn uh you know i know we can keep on asking you questions but i want to at this point thank you one more time i'm actually going to one repeat the words that peter fisher the head of physics just related in the q a thanking you for using the word beloved as a way of describing milli indeed it is rare we find an individual that we are able to relate in that way i think you epitomize many many many of those qualities and we very much appreciate you in so many ways for echoing millie uh by the lecture you have just given us we have a small uh and just a small memento of uh this particular experience so that as you look around your office one day you're able to indeed remember this particular event and i will go ahead and hide my own image so you can look at it more properly here we go and tell you just a little bit about this particular object uh this is a hand blown glass pumpkin uh creation of the artisans of the mit glass lab which sits adjacent to mit nato in the heart of campus and it borders with its windows just like mit nano the improbability walk which is a garden passageway that we named after millie and her love for well uh walking and her love for uh well recognition that her journey led uh that led her to mit uh was a set of improbable experiences well the uh just as you have described in your own book the frequency and spatial location of retwining the intertwining in this particular object is the interest binding of the institute's maroon and gray colors with delicate precision this culture embodies the glassblower's creativity and understanding of the fundamental properties of matter a reminder of the insight that you have shared with us and indeed milling hasn't been done throughout her life mit nano and mit community at large offered this unique momentum of mit creativity to you in sincere gratitude for the multitudes of your contributions to science and for this presentation you just share with us with the dress house lecture today thank you so much everyone really appreciate you thank you vladimir it is i who should thank all of you i shall treasure it truly well uh with that uh we will conclude the dress house lecture for year 2020 and thank you so much all for attending take care thank you you
