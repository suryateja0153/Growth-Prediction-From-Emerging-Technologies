 hello everyone I'm Vikram and almost all our lives in this room depends on making predictions whether we make predictions on spam detection stock prediction toxic language as my previous big speakers spoke about and so on what if I tell you does one critical area where our prediction could save millions of lives and that my friends is predicting earthquakes or earthquakes even possible to predict predicting the earth unpredictable this is actually a title of a book written by Topsy small richest as the book title suggests predicting the earthquakes is very difficult and almost impossible one of the biggest reasons is it's not the question of whether an earthquake will occur or not some this is a similar scenario that we most frequently encounter in machine learning these days rather it's the question of when it will occur as soon as I say the time into this so we made the first thing that triggers our mind is a list here models and other time sequence models but it is not that easy over the past four decades have been several failed predictions but since 2012 we made tremendous progress in the area of deep learning now how can we leverage the power of deep learning to understand and predict this complex phenomenon thankfully nature communicates with us in several ways before a big event occurs for instance in case of a tsunami the water recedes from the shore before the tsunami occurs animals can sense the ground motions well in advance and they start panicking and behaving erratically hinting that something big earthquake occurs about to happen likewise this one underappreciated earthquake precursor called the four shocks four shocks are individual or a sequence of events that occur before the main event also known as the main shock they have a timeframe between somewhere around two hours to 30 days before the main shock unfortunately scientists have deemed that these four shocks are indistinguishable from the main shock and the aftershock and that they are currently identified only after the entire sequence is completed I mean but what's the use nature's trying to communicate with us hinting that some big event is about to occur and we are not able we don't have the right tools to capture that useful information and this is where deep learning comes into play as you can see the highlighter takes the indistinguishable data we have indistinguishable data the full shock main shock and the aftershock and the planning can help us protect them to higher dimensional space where they can be actually separable this is the framework which I used to make this prediction so I have a time series data which is nothing but the seismic wave form and in order to extract useful information I converted this time series wave form data into a spectrogram and I created it deep neural network which takes this as an input data well the deep learning our model does is outputs whether this particular spectrogram before belongs to a foreshock main shock or an aftershock and due to a limited time I'm not going into the details of the model but I'll give you a quick preview of my test results and so about 19 out of 24 shocks were predicted correctly and even though the number looks small actually I did patch voice training so the actual test set is super large and these 20 or the individual number of the full shock main shock and aftershock events and I would like to emphasis why identifying for shocks could be really useful back in 2011 there was a powerful earth for earthquake of magnitude 9.0 that triggered a tsunami in the Tokyo prefecture this tsunami attacked the power supply of the Fukushima nuclear power plant and as a result the coolants weren't able to perform and there was a eventually there was a radioactive leakage how are two days prior to this mammoth earthquake there was a powerful for shock of magnitude 7.3 back then had we identified that this event was a for shock we could have alerted the authorities that a bigger event is likely to occur in a very short timeframe and we could have prevented the radioactive leakage and saved a lot of lives before I conclude almost everyone should be aware that there's a big earthquake pending in the California region the last I hope there's not a breaking news like if you read to the Bay Area like you can see a lot of stuff going on there and the thing is the last major earthquake was in 1906 and then there's a lot of stress accumulation and almost all the top seismologist all the scientists agreed that the magnitude will be somewhere between 8 and 9 which is super huge yeah not kidding like you can check it up but the the thing is it's not my wish either it's just a stressor accumulation so with that much amount of stress being accumulated and it is and with this much big progress in deep learning so we can actually by using the methods that I proposed today we can actually predict these big events well in advance in a shorter time frame and save a lot of flies in addition there have been publications in nature and others publications confirming that almost all the big earthquakes are preceded by a foreshock which is actually a good news so if we identify the four shocks in my method in real time we can foresee the big earthquakes so and thank you [Music]
