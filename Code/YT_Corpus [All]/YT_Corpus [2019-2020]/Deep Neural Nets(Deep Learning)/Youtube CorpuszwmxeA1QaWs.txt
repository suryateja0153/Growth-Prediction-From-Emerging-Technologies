 deep-learning toolbox provides algorithms and tools for creating training and analyzing deep networks you can use deep learning with CNN's for image classification and deep learning with LST M networks for time series and sequence data deep learning tool box comes with numerous pre-built examples you can leverage including classify and moving objects in a scene and detecting facial features with regression you can also build advanced network architectures like gams and siamese networks using custom training loops shared weights in automatic differentiation release 2020 a introduces experiment manager app to manage multiple deep learning experiments you can keep track of training parameters analyze results they compare code from different experiments you can evaluate train models using visualization tools such as training plots and confusion matrices if you're building a model using transfer learning deep network designer app has been updated for easy selection of existing pre train models you can also design a network from scratch using the drag-and-drop interface that allows you to visualize the layers and connections and Adler Nobile layer parameters after designing and analyzing your network you can import your data inspect your data set training options like learning rate and number of epochs and train your network all within the app itself afterwards export your network to the workspace or generate its corresponding MATLAB code so your colleagues can easily reproduce and refine your work deep learning toolbox supports interoperability with other frameworks including tensorflow pi torch and MX net you can also import networks and network architectures from tensorflow Kerris and cafe and since deep learning toolbox supports the onyx model format you can import models leverage MATLAB for tasks like visualizing and optimizing your network then export your model for use in other deep learning frameworks you can speed up training on a single or multiple GPU workstation or scale to clusters and clouds including NVIDIA GPU cloud and Amazon ec2 GPU instances deep learning tool box can be used in conjunction with code generation tools enabling you to deploy deep learning algorithms to targets like NVIDIA GPUs and Intel and ARM processors this auto-generated code provides a significant performance boost in inference applications if you want a smaller footprint for your network such as for embedded deployment Tony a enables you to perform into eight quantization on the model and target NVIDIA GPUs for more information about deep learning toolbox please check out the deep learning toolbox product page and don't hesitate to contact us with any questions
