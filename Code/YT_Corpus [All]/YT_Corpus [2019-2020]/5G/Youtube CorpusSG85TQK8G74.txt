 this video sponsored by we VPN gaming phones are always some of the coolest phones on the market always pushing limits and this phone is slightly cooler than most because of its built-in internal cooling fan today we'll be finding out if that extra internal hardware affects the durability of the red magic 5g huge thanks to we VPN for sponsoring this video we VPN is a virtual private network

gaming phone let's get started [Applause] [Music] novia has a history of making super unique phones like that dual front and back screen phone we took a look at last year and the internal cooling fan and will of course be much more interesting to see from the inside but you know if the phone snaps in half we might get to see it sooner than we think inside the box we get the phone itself along with a super cool sim removal tool I'm definitely keeping this guy it's also got an 18 watt charger and the normal USBC cable this phone is currently sitting at just under $600 which makes it one of the better price gaming phones on the market right now this is the Eclipse black version and no fancy metal exoskeleton like we saw in the black shark 3 but still a pretty cool design under the glass let's get into the scratch test after a few hundred of these you probably know the drill already level 3 would be plastic and that's what we're seeing here on this screen projector [Music] it's nice of nubia to include this extra protection remember these durability tests are all about consistency I test as many phones as I can so we can have a baseline so when a phone does deviate or have flaws or you know snap in half we have something to compare it to this red magic 5g scratches at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7 pretty normal these days we haven't seen a sapphire display in a while the front-facing 8 megapixel selfie camera is tucked up underneath this top bezel right next to the earpiece the earpiece is made from plastic but glued in very tightly and will be falling out on its own Nubia says this does have stereo speakers but the bottom speaker is not front firing which might be important to some gamers one thing that is definitely important to gamers however is extra buttons this phone does have dual built-in capacitive triggers up in the top shoulders these don't pop out of the phone with motors like we saw in the Black Shark but they do exist the metal power button and metal volume rockers are also on this side the air vent though is what we're all here for there are vent openings on either side of the phone regular air comes in one side and hot air comes out the other kind of like Trump's Corona briefings I'll flip the dedicated switch to get into game remote they're calling it a game boost switch and from here I can toggle on and off the rear LEDs because what's a gaming phone without Samar jeebies I can also turn on and off the fan it's incredibly quiet when it's in its low powered state but if you listen close you can hear it spin up and then blow gently while the phone isn't under any loads however for the ultimate blowing experience I found the rapid cooling toggle which boosts our little fan buddy up to full speed it's much louder than you can definitely tell it's moving some air now at 15,000 rpms it has a 30% boost in air volume from last year and apparently there are some heat pipes inside to assist with the active cool but I'll have to see those during the teardown there are some gaming pins on the side for accessories and up here at the top we have the headphone jack thumbs up for that having wired headphones is just one less battery to worry about now down at the bottom of the phone I've got more metal a USB C port and the bottom loudspeaker port along with the SIM card tray no expandable memory though and no official IP rating but we can check the internal openings for water resistance when we get inside the back panel and even with all its cool designs is just one solid slab of glass which covers the bottom 2 megapixel macro camera the middle 8 megapixel ultra-white camera and the 64 megapixel main camera both have their own super tiny glass lens covering and there's one singular flash up top phones are getting crazier with their screen refresh rates remember the oneplus 8 has a 98 refresh rate and the oneplus 8 pro has a 120 Hertz but this guy the red magic 5g is the first mass-produced phone with a 144 Hertz refresh rate it's six point six inch AMOLED display lasted about 25 seconds under the heat from my lighter then the screen got a little weird but only briefly it took a while to cool off before deciding to work again the last thing I want to try it before the bin test is the under screen fingerprint scanner but unfortunately even after attempting three times with two different fingers I was not able to get the scanner to read my fingerprint so it failed this test before we could even scratch it the level 6 and 7 scratches from my screen scratch tests are more in the middle of the phone and not so much down here at the bottom so those had no effect finally the bin test this is an extremely heavy phone the red magic 5g weighs almost an ounce more than my note 10 Plus which has a larger screen and a stylus the beefy and heavy build pays off though when it comes to structural rigidity with no flex from the front or at the back and no damage to the frame the red magic 5g passes my durability task even with a built-in fan and crossed through air vent the phone is a rock if you want to see how it all works from the inside hit that subscribe button if you haven't already I am curious though would you have to be a gamer to own a gaming phone for less than 600 bucks it's probably catching more eyes than just the fortnight guys let me know down in the comments come hang out with me on Instagram and Twitter and thanks a ton for watching I'll see you around [Music]
