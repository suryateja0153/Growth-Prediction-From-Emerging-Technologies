 hey guys it's Justine and today I'm doing a very quick unboxing for you this is the BTS samsung galaxy s 25 G phone this is such a beautiful phone I cannot believe how amazing it is this is the color that I had wanted them to launch initially when they first came out with this phone in addition to the phone I also have the galaxies BTS buds as well I was just reading about this phone so the pre-orders went live and may sold out within an hour in South Korea that's crazy Samsung sent me this to check out I do have to send it back so unfortunately it is not mine to keep but at least I get to show it to you guys also before we get into this I just want to say I'm thankful that Samsung came out with his phone because for whatever reason I had never listened to BTS before everyone in the entire world will be talking about how incredible they are and for some reason I never listened but I decided I was gonna check out the phone I should probably take a listen to BTS and I was absolutely blown away the first time I really had listened to them was last week when my sister and I were doing our podcast and I was telling to her about this phone and I thought I should probably do some research about beauty s because I already know a lot about the samsung s xx girl what are you doing to me LinkedIn I've a LinkedIn notification back to BTS now if you're a BTS fan you already know that they're incredible but me as a person who did not know I now know and I am so here for it I don't want to say what any of my favorite songs are yet because I'm still learning I'm still researching you guys had sent me a bunch of videos that was like a crash course to learning about BTS I'm so sorry I wish that I knew more but all I have to say is I am here now and I wish that I had found out sooner better late than never now let me show you this awesome phone to reveal those little hearts were actually right over the s20 logo I don't normally look at paperwork but I think there might be some exciting BTS themed items in here oh yeah we have stickers so it has all of the band members names it also has some little emoji icons here I believe in your Galaxy so it comes with the stickers what else is in here so do you think that when I have to send this back to Samsung that I I'm sorry I talked about this person oops I forgot to put this back Shh just kidding out I'll give them back it's a very important part of this phone these they look like little business cards but they're for each band member I would guess me you call them fan cards or something I'm not really sure what the term would be they also have a little heart on the back too like a little holographic embossed heart don't mind my injury all right so here's the phone this color is so beautiful it's like a hazy purple and what I like about this is it's more of a matte finish so a lot of phones tend to get smudgy when they have like the glossy finish but this is a really nice matte finish and it's kind of like an iridescent rainbowy color as well and you guys see that oh and did we point out that there is a heart right here featured by the cameras I mean it's so let's turn it on I hope it's charged yes what else is in here we've got the standard earbuds power charger I believe in your galaxy look look me being a new fan I'm excited I mean I've been a fan for what a week and a half at this point imagine being someone who is a huge fan of BTS and this would be for me like being a really huge cool fan so if the tool came out with a custom Samsung phone you better believe it I would be there in a second I love it I love the purple theme this is like one of my favorite colors so all the custom icons everything I absolutely love it let's check out the galaxy buds as well also a nice custom box oh wow laughs this looks so great and here's how they look next to each other this also has a little heart over here at the front of it so when you open it see that there's a lot of stuff in here this looks like it's a smart buds cover oh this is cool you can wear this like around your neck or even like a keychain or something so we have more little cards I think we might I love this so it has each one of them wearing the galaxy buds [Music] these never happen I don't know it's a charging cable and some extra little tips for the ear buds but I feel like the only way to end this video to make it just all come around full circle is to put the ear buds in and listen to BTS this is I'm actually watching a youtube video this is bts's newest music video that premiered I guess over a week ago at this point but this is stay gold I've listened to this one a few times I can't let you guys hear what I'm listening to because it's copy written but these sound really good I feel like I'm yelling yeah I'm yelling a little bit this is all I feel a lot of streaming games cuz I have headphones on so I can't hear myself why I talk louder so that I can hear myself it's a beautifully shot music video I'll put a link in the description although it has so many views that I feel like everyone in the world has already seen it so here they are I think a view out of what they look like I think they look good I saw them on on the band members and they look incredible I also just love the purple eye this is like one of my favorite colors I actually have a computer that is a purple camo you guys might remember that I got a very long time ago logo in the buds and everything Oh vixx me wants an update oh okay do you guys have any suggestions for songs that I should listen to videos to watch anything at all please leave them in the comments below or feel free to send me a tweet because I am currently doing a lot of BTS research thank you guys for watching and we also have a new
