 [Music] all right good morning everybody there we go thank you more coffee is required this is awesome welcome to day three of Google i/o what I believe will be the best day of Google i/o although they've all been great my name is Bob Borchers I lead marketing for Android Chrome Google Play few other things along the way but I'm super excited today to spend some time with you and to bring all of you together to think about the future which is 5g um and before I get started I want to acknowledge that 5g like many technologies requires a vibrant ecosystem and cooperation across all of the elements including of course you as a developer community but in particular I want to thank Qualcomm for joining us today and spending some time talking about the technology and then we've had great partnership with a number of our OEMs and carrier partners including Verizon and Sprint as well as Ericsson and then from the handset side Motorola Samsung LG Oppo Xiaomi oneplus all these folks have come together to put on an amazing demonstration of 5g over in the android area and then also to present the technology to you guys here today so it's really an ecosystem that's coming together and frankly what we want to do today is help you become part of that vibrant ecosystem and kind of move things forward we're super excited about 5g because it's not just a step change and not just a you know incremental change in wireless technology but we really believe it is a fundamental kind of step change and it's because it's going to provide multi gigabit speeds low latency high reliability and frankly the opportunity to do brand-new things for users and for the ecosystem and that's where you and your creativity come in and we hope to tap into that this morning when we talk about 5g we think about it as really the future of mobile it's not like I said just the you know the next incremental step but it really is a step change in a number of ways and it's you hi gigabit speeds it's latency it's a number of things it's edge compute and we think it'll unlock some really interesting things like for example this AR image where you can imagine having you know very low latency access to the Google knowledge graph and be able to bring it up in visually compelling ways so suddenly you have this visual search metaphor to the rest of the world to the physical world using your phone and google lens and ARR you know just pieces of the pie pieces of the opportunity but that but there are many many more and if we think about 4G and go back you know ten years to win that technology was just coming in imagine all of the things that have in fact been unlocked and created by being able to bring together LTE networks devices platforms and creating all of these new use cases whether it's you know uber Airbnb twitch Netflix all these things that could only become possible as you got to 4G 5g is going to unlock even more and that's where you guys come in your creativity your energy all of that is going to what's is going to be what fuels kind of 5g for consumers and this is an opportunity for you to tap into probably one of the most exciting areas within Wireless and one which operators and handset OMS and all sorts of people are just dying to make use of so you've got a great opportunity to come in and help invent the future with five gene so today's session is maybe going to be a little different than what normal IO sessions are in terms of being you know kind of a sit back experience this is going to be a lean forward experience and we want you guys to get engaged and hopefully create the future right here or at least start to do it right here this morning so we're gonna spend a little bit of time talking about what is 5g and getting everybody up to it up to the same level of understanding in terms of what it is why it is how it's rolling out we're also going to talk a little bit about how to build for 5 G's some of the api's that we're opening up within Android Q to be able to allow you to access and understand what's happening from a network perspective will then talk a little bit about how we Google are thinking about five gee maybe just to stimulate a little bit of thinking on your part but then most importantly we're gonna spend a lot of time talking about and helping you think about how do you make use of 5g within your domain within your set of applications and maybe it's games maybe it's AR maybe it's messaging maybe it's something completely brand new um and we want to help you explore that and today we've got the privilege of having somebody who was at Google fairly recently but has now gone off and become an expert on design thinking and he's gonna be the moderator for the rest of the morning and it's gonna help us think about how to apply 5g in new and interesting ways using a design thinking process so hopefully today you get not only a better understanding of 5g get excited about developing for it but you also get to access these amazing design thinking tools and be able to apply them in your own work and in what you do everyday so without further ado thank you for coming to i/o thank you for coming this session and let me hand it off to Xander all right thanks Bob so as Bob mentioned today's gonna be a little bit different we're gonna be practicing activities from a book called sprint sprint was invented not far from here at Google Ventures and it's a five-day workshop that they used to help their investments like uber slack Flatiron health build better products and test new ideas it was so successful they they wrote this book outlining the process and now teams in consultancies all over the world use this process the big idea is to build a prototype as fast as you can and get feedback from users before you invest a lot of time and energy into building it so a design sprint is five days we only have the morning together so we're gonna be using a selection of those methods from the book to help you think in 5g and figure out how to apply all this new technology to your applications your apps and experiences so here's what its gonna look like we're going to first inspire ideas with lightning talks we'll look at five examples of apps and features that do really really well on 5g your job is to jot down or sketch anything that stands out to you next we're gonna spend time drawing ideas you'll have time to sit with a pen and paper and apply what you've learned to your own app we're basically going to be drawing user interface flows and you learn a fast effective easy way to do that and finally we're gonna share the best ideas as a group now I I've been a consultant the last three years I work with companies like Fitbit Cisco I've worked with Google a bunch before and I always say that execution is everything so you really shouldn't be worried about sharing your ideas at this point we're still pretty early in this ecosystem and we're gonna get a lot more benefit from sharing than we will holding on tight I know that I learned how to be a great designer and entrepreneur from other people who shared share their ideas with me so I hope we can do that this morning now if if you don't want to share your idea that's totally fine too but the last part of the workshop will be to to share so we can all learn and grow together to help along the way there's going to be Google 5g team members will be roaming during each of the activities so you can ask them questions and and get their feedback and get some help so before we get into the workshop part let's get our feet on the ground by starting with an overview of 5g here's the Sun hi everybody welcome so let's just start off with what is 5 g 5g is the next generation of cellular technology it's a new set of standards it's an entirely new set of capabilities accompanied by network equipment device chipsets and capabilities and we break it down into kind of three fundamental aspects that give you an idea of what five years about first and foremost it's more speed and it does it provides this increased speed by liberating new swaths of spectrum and what you find is there are different types of deployments some of the which happen in really high bandwidth or in high frequency spectrum so that tends to come out in high speeds in localized areas usually refer to as millimeter wave and there are other swathes of spectrum that are referred to as mid band which provide high speeds over somewhat larger distances and these in combination lets you run a lot more throughput for a given user but the fundamental aspects of the technology also mean that it's more efficient in terms of how it transports bits over the air for a given amount of spectrum as well so it's more spectrally efficient across the board in different parts of the radio frequency spectrum the second aspect of 5g is that it's more robust so there are many improvements on the underlying radio technology itself that mean that in a given coverage area more users have access to peak speeds more of the time we'll talk a bit more about how that happens but it means that when you're connected to a 5g network you have a much more consistent experience while you're connected and finally it's more responsive so again many optimizations have been made into the standards and technology that mean that the latency is substantially lower on a 5g network which is particularly relevant to applications that are intensive in terms of bandwidth and content but it's also it also has a lot more flexibility built into the network core itself that allows programmability of how applications and networks interact with one another so that's kind of a super high level view of the kind of main tenants of 5g but to put it in perspective it's actually here and alive in right now what you what you'll find is many operators are going to be launching this in 2019 across the globe and its first on Android we have operators part operator partners launching in the US Europe Southeast Asia in Asia Pacific with a large set of OEM partners were also going to be launching with Android this year now with that I'm gonna actually hand over to Francesco who's one of the foremost experts in the field to tell us more okay thank you I'm Francesco Greenlee I work at Qualcomm where I am an sponsible for the modern technology product management so essentially it's a it's my job to for example to forecast the well is the new generation of cellular technology is going to happen as you can see that part of the job is pretty easy because every 10 years almost like clockwork we have a new generation of technology now why is everything here sir well there are two main factors that are pushing the generations to appear every 10 years new spectrum becomes available typically every 10 years and also technology the low-power processing gets a good enough for a new transition and so so that's why we see that from 3G to 4G we went from hundred of kilobits per second to megabit per second and when a megabit per second with a 4G which by the way kept evolving after the initial launch in 2010 and and now we are having devices that are one gigabit per second of key Cray 5g with bring the peak rate in the order of 10 5 to 10 DB per second however text this evolution of the technology now we have not only a lot of new spectrum that is available now that was not available before but we also have advanced the antenna technologies that allow the spectrum to be used more efficiently so the reason why 5g as has been explained before it's an inflection point it's it's not just a linear improvement with respect to previous generation is that with the new antenna technologies allowed to use the full spectrum on on a single on a narrow beam at over the one user so for example on a regular cellular system of 4G and before you have a base station where you have three sector antenna each sector covers one third of the area around the base station right every user inside that cell has to share the spectrum with everybody else in that cell with the 5g and you will ever on each sector you will have a hundreds of antenna elements which can be can be used to focus a beam directed toward a particular user and then can track the movement of that user dynamically and if another user is present in the same sector a separate beam can be focused on that user as well and both users can access the full spectrum so essentially imagine now you have new hundreds of megahertz of new spectrum and each user can use all of them so to make an example on on a speed test on a 4G and before typically you never get more than ten twenty percent of the peak rate that the device is capable of instead with 5g you are going to get forty to sixty percent of the data rate that the device is capable of thanks to this beamforming techniques that become available only on 4G so essentially this is one of the key innovations of edgy that is made available by the announcement in in processing technologies now if you have to remember anything about Fiji you just have to remember three things lot of spectrum as I said which is not available before these new antenna techniques that are used to fall beams and the third thing we have to remember is that valuable lower latency so what is the lower latency coming from so essentially given the new processing power that we can have in a little device we can now transmit the data in a much smaller chunks so each transmission can be less than a millisecond which means that not only you can just meet more more data in less amount of time but also you can get the feedback on the recipient that the data is Archer has been received or not so that allows much faster protocol that that we reduce the end-to-end delay so the latency as we said is going to be much lower from let's say LT you get a typically 40 milliseconds round-trip time when you do a being for example T on 5g once the network of mais you can expect always less than 10 millisecond round-trip time thanks to this new so essentially remember for Fuji not a spectrum new antenna techniques to do beams and low latency because now the transmissions are very very short okay so okay but when do we get all that well we are getting it starting right now actually this is quite exciting because in the past in the past transition from 3G to 4G the first year there were four operators that were about to launch the technology for 5g we have already more than 20 operators all launching in this year 2019 and some operators are not even listed like sunrise in Switzerland that just launched the ferry as well last week so from G's commercial here in u.s. is becoming commercial in Korea in commercial in Korea it will be commercial in September 3 commercial in Japan it will be commercial next week in China in Europe Israeli commercial so essentially all the advanced markets have now deployed 5g and that is that means that users the user community will be able to enjoy these benefits really really fast however we we don't know what what are the typical users for for 5g essentially when we were developing when we are developing the 4G network 10 years ago we didn't have a clue that the Facebook and YouTube would be the large as the data users or 4G networks today right so the same way today we cannot know exactly what who's going to take advantage of this so for example these are speed tests run on an Android device and you can see that already within early launches of the phalgu already seen speeds which are very basically off the scale respected to the speed test application speed fast application goes up to 300 right at least on the indicator but we are already double off the scale so that means that we need we need new ways to use this technology which currently cannot can just be dreamed of and it's up to you guys to figure out how to make it or make it possible now how can Qualcomm help in this so Qualcomm is had been very closely with the Google to make available to expand an existing API that we read the authority to allow the up the developer to take advantage of the throughput estimation so essentially the modern will do an analysis of the current radio conditions and based on its own internal angle it will provide to the Android API the best estimate of the downlink throughput to be expected in the immediate future okay so this is available already available today in Android and this API will be extended in android q2 also include true to test emission for 5g network now on 5g by the way you are going to see throughput which is 10 times or more than the troop that you experience in NLT that means that for example if you see something above 300 degree per second it's most likely going to be a 5 3 5 3 connection right so family awareness for us means that you are going to have a data rate is so high that it's basically impossible to have that in previous generations and you are going to take advantage of that in your application now this is what we are making available today Android q as soon as a cue will be available we are also working with Google to make available additional enhancement to this API so for example we are working on the estimate for the uplink throughput which of course as an application care more about a blinker than then darling or both so right now the downlink throughput is provided update will also be provided in a future evolution of this API and we are also working to make available the latency estimation because for example if you have an application that can behave differently in low latency mode versus regular latency mode then you would be able to take advantage of data so those are not a still in working progress so I cannot promise that it will be in the first release of android q but for sure the 5g basic throughput estimation will be included in android q and i think now we can go into the specific details of this API thank you thanks Jessica so the throughput estimation API is especially helpful right now because 5g networks will roll out over time and performance will be drastically better than LTE and in many cases if we see hundreds of megabits per second that can even be faster than wired broadband for many users so it breaks the paradigm that Wi-Fi is always faster than cellular and the application should always prefer Wi-Fi over cellular so to make decisions about resolution a our asset quality or other parameters in a game etc and so we want users to use the real-time bandwidth estimate API to make decisions there a fact based on the actual throughput of the network rather than relying on is the cellular or is it Wi-Fi because you can have great net LTE networks and you get loyalty networks you can have great Wi-Fi and you can app or Wi-Fi this gives you a true objective estimate of what the real-time bandwidth is available and make decisions based on that secondly we added another API our network meet earnest that tells you whether or not the cellular network is metered so we're working with carriers either to integrate from a cloud point of view or on device via the carrier app to indicate if they that particular users mobile data plan is metered or not meter and this can help you take advantage of the cellular network more proactively so for instance if you know a users has a hundreds of megabits of connectivity and you know that the network is currently unmetered and perhaps our users opted in then if you're a movie app you can automatically download the next episode of the TV series or the move series all behind the scenes proactively so that was a quick overview of 5g to get it we got a sense of what the whole Lots going to look like how the technology works and what the opportunity is for the next part want to invite Sano up back on stage so we can help bring some some of the ways we could use this Thanks Bhavan okay so this is the workshop part the first thing we're gonna do is inspire you with some ideas so Barbara and I are gonna review a bunch of great experiences to inspire you then you're gonna have some time to draw ideas could be for an existing app could be for a new app idea that you have the goal is to take what you find inspiring and apply it there and then again we're gonna share the ideas as a group before we start are there any questions about the the format of the workshop or what we're going to be doing it's it's different this is the first workshop that they've done at Google i/o so this is a test for us so if you have any questions let me know otherwise we'll just get started great perfect job so you'll need pens and you'll need paper because the demos are gonna go kind of fast in order to capture it you're gonna want you know you're gonna have your paper and pen in front of you love and how was your morning good good good today was bike to work day yeah so that was good you're biking I did takes me 15 minutes I don't work at Google so doesn't really matter my wife works here though she likes it up she kind of likes it but alright she's looking for a new team if anybody okay alright so lightning talks we're gonna go through some demos they're not quite demo demos they're like pictures of demos and and you're gonna write or draw what you find inspiring so this was an example from when I worked with Fitbit you can see we drew all the Lightning demos up on the board everybody took notes about them this is your private kind of okay here's all the here's all the things that I can work with so bobbins gonna help us out as we talk through each example so first the first example of a great experience on 5g is so a key area where 5g is making mobile user experiences more seamless as an era where 5g can help improve the quality and fidelity of the error experiences the higher bandwidth and lower latency that 5g provides really means two things for users and developers first you'll have low lower reduced load times for AR assets and a our experiences so they can be more seamless and frictionless as an analogy if you think back to YouTube and if worked well on DSL connections I worked well on three 4G networks like HSDPA but it really excelled on LTE and once LT was broadly available to most users we using YouTube on-the-go became second nature rather than just using it at home and we hope to see similar things when it comes to AR the second thing is when we talk back to those network throughput ApS F Francesco described you can use those API to improve AR by delivering higher quality assets to users with higher band connections so you can imagine users differentiating between users that have hundreds of megabytes per second of connectivity giving them a hundred megabyte a asset versus other users giving them a 10 megabyte a asset and serving similar type of load times similar type of experience within the application itself so to get a idea of what the faster speeds mean in terms of load times let's take a look at air and search and switch to a quick demo so let's say we were to do a air and search for a brown bear we see the result we can learn about the barn bear and then we can visit and meet a bomb barrel up close so we load the arrow asset we ask to view it in our space and it loads immediately oh cool ok so let's switch back to the slides that demo was made possible because of 5g and you're on fine G now yep we're on 5g so we actually worked with Sprint and LG to provide a 5g network live at i/o the network is actually all the way by the Android sandbox but because of the mid band spectrum we're actually able to reach and get the signal all the way over here observe hundreds of megabits per second of connectivity and load those air experiences in an instant next if we go into gaming we also see that air can mean have important implications for gaming so first game clay can be shifted from on device compute more and more to the cloud this can look at like a hybrid solution initially where specific algorithms it could be some GPU rendering it could be some ml rendering or maybe some aspects of multiplayer gaming they could be pushed to the cloud so you're no longer constrained by the on device CPU or the on device GPU and you can provide more most of appearances of course the ultimate realization of this is experiences such as stadia and cloud gaming where 100% the computer is done in the cloud and you can deliver a console of level quality on a mobile device second we also see that it has tremendous benefits for competitive online gaming like eSports the low latency can help make games even more responsive and finally many applications on Android especially Triple A games the file sizes can reach from hundreds of megabytes even to multiple gigabytes so games such as pub G or asphalt 9 there are 2 plus gigabytes and that can take quite a bit of time to download especially on LTE connection and if you're trying to acquire more users that could be relatively imposing especially if those users are on the go because it's going to take quite a bit of time to download and before you can start enjoying that experience whereas on LTE whereas 1 5g you can download that experience and begin enjoying it all under a minute or two Wow so two other quick examples sender one is YouTube YouTube we've seen that bandwidth get substantially better so we're showing this in the Android sandbox we are downloading an 8k video which is a YouTube 360 video the four hemisphere downloads at once and even then the video loads in an instant if you turn on that stats four nodes feature was in YouTube you can see the peak data rates spiking well over 100 or 200 Mbps which helps the buffer feel fill up immediately and then you can start enjoying your content and it's live streaming is way more possible yeah way more possible with live streaming even in 4k or 8k and then the last quick example is around Google Photos where I'm personally excited I have a toddler and often times I will take quick videos of him doing funny things I want to share with my parents or my siblings and what I've noticed is with the modern smart phones we have today even if you take a one minute video that can often be 300 to 400 megabytes which gets kind of frustrating if you're then trying to send it to a family immediately for them to consume it immediately and we have to and so well I'm excited about the palm of applications being able to take advantage of that to deliver easier sharing and ease your continuous backup and more instant access and all of these experiences are live at our sandbox so welcome you to come on by if you haven't already experienced it over the last two days and see it for yourself great so with that let me hand off to Xander all right so those were some ideas those are all experiences that are working really well on 5g it's a little bit about how Google is thinking about utilizing 5g it is now time for your turn to think about that thank you I just heard a thank you from that from the back so here's what you're gonna be doing solutions sketches this is a really quick way to get an idea out on paper it's from the Sprint process it's three post-its on one piece of paper and it's a section of a UI flow and it's a way to go from abstract like I have these ideas in my head to something very concrete that you can show other people so for example in this solution sketch this was with Fitbit we're thinking about a new onboarding flow they have an exercise app called fitstar and it starts out the the concept was using gifts instead of video because gifts were you didn't have to hit play you don't have to download so much you just kick off the onboarding and you can see here that it starts by saying fit start gets you to your goal fast and personalized tell us about yourself to get started you in turn a bunch of personal information then it's an example of how fitstar helps people like you so it looks at your age your weight your goal and then it shows a gif or a testimonial of somebody like you and then it shows a gif of them working out so it's personalized whatever you put in the first screen and then lastly is like the upsell so it says great one star one year of this product is cheaper than one one month in a gym here's the premium pitch and you can buy one year for 39.99 one month for $7.99 or you can do a 7-day trial so you can see that this solution sketch it's it's really like crudely drawn it's really messy but it gets the idea across and the big idea there is to use personal like gifts that are personalized to the person and this is actually kind of a cool 5g use case too because you could download videos before knowing anything about or you would download the video after you know something about them and you'd customize the onboarding experience to that person with like super high quality graphics so this is actually pretty applicable but anyway this is a solution sketch this is the format that we're going to be drawing in I want to show you another example this is augmented reality directions so has anybody here seen that experience on Google Maps basically you get your directions and you switch into AR so you hit start AR and then you hold up your phone and you can see the directions on the in the real world so arrows are pointing this way and there's dots on the ground and then as you walk the dots will like move into the road that you need to follow this is another example of a solution sketch that idea of AR directions is it's kind of complicated it's kind of new but you can see in just three screens it gets the idea across it gets the idea out now it's missing a lot of a lot of information but that's okay a solution to sketches just a single concept um you also notice there's you can write notes on the side you can give it a title that explains what it is and you know you do whatever you need to do to explain what it is so the goal is that these are all self explanatory because when we share there's no pitching you just leave it on your table and walk away and then other people will walk up and look at it so the goal is that it could be understood on itself that way the best ideas win rather than the best like salesperson like I bet if Bob came back and pitched his idea then everybody would vote for it because Bob is super convincing and compelling but with this format you don't know who drew it and it's more about the evaluating the concept so the goal is its self-explanatory and it's does that make sense great so it's okay if it's ugly it's okay if it's rough it just has to be clear any questions before we start so here are the rules ugly is okay the words really matter you have to write out all the words in your app or your experience and it should be self-explanatory meaning somebody who has no context for what you do should be able to understand it I'm gonna leave this example up here so you remember what it looks like three post-its notes title and we're gonna spend some time sketching the five G team and I will be walking around to help you think through some of these concepts but this is time to apply everything you've seen and start to make progress on thinking about how to use 5g the goal today is that everybody in this room leaves with three ideas about how they might use 5g in the future so at the end after we share you should be able to pick up at least three concepts and you'll this will put you dramatically ahead of competitors and other companies so with that we will start our solutions sketch I'm gonna put we'll start with twenty five minutes on the clock feel free to spread out we'll be walking around and this is your time to think [Music] all right team that brings us to the conclusion of solution sketching how is it great this is a really helpful activity if you design software for a lot of reasons it lets you go from abstract to concrete really quickly just a few post-its here if you screw up you can rip off a post-it throw it away and do a new one without scrapping everything um and I think as you'll as you walk around the room you'll see how easy it is to explain a pretty complex idea and this is a wonderful example I don't know who you guys are but these were really good ideas I'm I'm excited for our next session which is to share our ideas to do some heat map so thank you for doing solution sketches hopefully it was it was a fun and helpful the next activity is heat map voting so heat map voting is a voting activity that will help us see which concepts are the best the way it works is you silently walk around the room and you spend time looking at each idea you're gonna place a red dot on the concepts that you like so if you like a specific piece of a concept you put the dot right on it or if you like the whole idea you put it in the corner um and then when you're done have a seat and what we'll see is the the solutions with the most dots will will rise to the top and we'll get a heat map of which concepts are resonating with people so I guess the way we'll do this is um if you want to share your idea put it on the opposite side of the table and lay it out in a row and then put all the supplies and papers on the further side of the table does that make sense okay and then we'll have time and you can just you know you can just walk around and look at each idea and put a dot there if you don't want to share it turn it over and keep it you know keep it to yourself if you do want to share know exactly hey you guys already did it yeah just like a table - well you table for all okay great again this is our first time doing this so we're seeing how how it runs yes great so we're gonna do the same thing you can walk around evaluate them take people but you have unlimited stickies so if you really like us if you really like a concept put a bunch of dots there feel free to move from table to table the goal here is that you leave with about three concepts that you you really you really love okay all right when the gong when the gong rings we will return to our seats and then I'm gonna ask the top some of the top concepts here to share their ideas [Music] okay team that concludes heatmap voting thank you for your time and energy heat map voting is great my favorite part is you don't know who drew what and there's no pitching I hate pitching you really just want the best idea to win and it was cool to see everybody just silently walk around and evaluate them and again really impressive ideas like really really impressive I'm so glad that we're we're doing this work together the last activity is to share so we're gonna look at like three or five of the top concepts you guys individually walked around but this is the time to share so what I want you to do is take your solution and raise your hand if you got more than one vote on your solution raise your hand if you got more than one vote yes a round of applause that's awesome as somebody who does this often I have to admit even some of my ideas get zero votes at times so getting one vote is is huge please tote like count up your number of votes I want to try and find the top three or five so count how many votes you'll have and then we'll go through you know 5 10 15 20 see that whole thing okay if you have more than five votes raise your hand oh my gosh that's great ten votes what 15 votes 20 votes 25 votes 25 votes we have 203 3 with 25 or more votes for I'll we have 4 is he listening to music no oh I'm gonna said okay 25 remark 30 votes gonna be in more than 30 30 votes right here well what's your name what is it you're on congratulations there's really no winner in this exercise though because you know we don't really know what the best concept is we don't know we don't have our decider here you know we don't know what's gonna move forward know what's feasible but getting that many votes is a feat and but in my book really getting more than one vote is a feat so what I want to do now is if you guys are open to sharing we have the team here they have some microphones if you just wanted to share your concept with the group I think that would be really cool will get about like three maybe three here and and then we'll wrap up the session for today so I'm you're on do you want to share your your concept because you had the most votes sure okay great awesome Buffon's gonna bring you microphone so what was your concept hi I'm from Japan and okay it's great I'm going to pitch my idea this is a I love football and I love watching football and in but in this state still I can only watch the game from my side of you one angle yeah you're in a stadium huh and you right now today you can only see it from that one end yeah yeah so my idea is there's many camera in the studium for the all the players so and I can select which one to watch so so that item if I love some player i watch the player every third time and now yeah so you're in the stadium mm-hm and you have your phone and you can watch a specific player yeah right in real time yeah yeah during the game yeah that's awesome that's my idea wonderful Mark Cuban would give you a thumbs up awesome thank you all right anybody else want to share any of our 25 and up club anybody in there want to share sure let's hear it hi everyone I'm swathi from India I'm also a musician so my concept revolves around music we always have a pain point of actually collaborating with other musicians across the globe in real time so trying to leverage that using 5g so this is more like a mobile app where I could just like say start collaborating and I've invited participants or musicians with whom I want to collaborate and I can have a screen share moment where there's no latency or there's no lag we can actually collaborate in real time and we can also have this open to audience who can actually watch us perform life so this is my concept thank you [Music] [Applause] so to recap it was you could play music live yep so you can finally play music together with somebody's not with you exactly yeah so today today the way we do it is we kind of record it and then send it over yeah send it over but we want to actually do it real time so I'm jamming with someone we can actually have a third party or third person users actually viewing our performance in real time without lag issues or latency issues yeah it's cool awesome thank you swathi um uno mas one more who would like to share anybody who got one or more vote is also is free to share if you have a concept alright so I come from South Korea where there's a culture of leaving notes when you visit a restaurant and you really like the food on the walls and I thought maybe it'd be great if you can use AR to view the notes that people I mean these virtual notes that people leave up on the walls of restaurants and places that you visit with like a selfie or the picture of a food so it's kind of like a Yelp transformed in a location-based AR based platform that you know I thought it would be really interesting so thank you cool [Applause] [Music] great that was a great that was a great set of three I think well in there you guys also got to look at everybody's so you got to evaluate the ideas on your own my hope again is that you leave here with three concrete ideas about how 5g can impact your app experience or inspire a totally new app because as we saw the ecosystem is gonna be really big and growing much faster than 4G so we've a lot to look forward to in summary first ever Google i/o workshop I started by inspiring ideas with lightning talks you drew ideas in a format called solution sketches and then we shared ideas using a process called heat map where we saw which ideas kind of bubbled up to the top and got the most got the most heat so in summary we've given you some background in context on 5g we've talked a little bit about the AP is and how eventually you can build for it we've shared how Google is thinking in 5g and we've done we've workshop how to help you think in 5g so thank you so much for your time thank you so much for your energy this was a wonderful workshop a wonderful session um have a great rest of your day [Applause] [Music] you [Music]
