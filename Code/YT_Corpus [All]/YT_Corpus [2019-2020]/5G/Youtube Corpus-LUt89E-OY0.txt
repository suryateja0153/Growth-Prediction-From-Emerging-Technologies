 the Nubia red magic 5g is one of the cheaper gaming phones on the market right now and also has a built-in mechanical active cooling system there is a literal fan inside of this phone which I'm a fan of now normally I'd like to do my tear downs where the phone is turned off so nothing shorts out and the phone stays safe but today we're gonna do this operation live while the phone is awake so we can see that fan in action so without powering down let's get started [Applause] [Music] this phone is built in the same way as a lot of other glass backed phones while use a bit of heat to soften the adhesive under the glass and a thin pry tool or razor to cut through that adhesive you know being careful cos glasses glass and glass can break there is definitely no water resistance to this foam since it has giant fan grille openings on either side but the adhesive underneath that glass is just as strong as it normally is after carefully slicing through that last bit of glue we get our first look at the internal cooling fan as long as the screen stays unlocked the fan stays on in game mode at least it looks like it pulls in air from the right side of the phone through this black channel and then pushed out the other side by the fan the channel itself is made from metal and could be also acting like a heatsink for whatever's below it just like we would see a normal desktop computer the van itself is rather gutless but I mean it is the size of a large and so my screwdriver poke isn't exactly an accurate assessment of its power Nubia does say this fan has a tested lifespan of 30,000 hours that's a lot of gaming let's go deeper by removing these 14 Phillips head screws and popping out the top black panel so we can see the underside of that air channel below that black shield we can now more clearly see the fan and hear how it struggles when I cut off its airflow most phones have passive cooling systems built-in you know no moving parts just copper plates and heat pipes that stuff so this active cooling system with a fan is super unique and if I position the phone just right it couldn't blow all the little pieces of paper away so it's definitely moving air at least now thermal paste is connecting that metal portion of the air channel to what I assume is the processor for the red magic 5g it's good to see that the channel is made from metal because metal conducts heat away much better than plastic would there's some other pretty weird stuff in here but first I got to turn the phone off and remove the long rear LED ribbon cable for the RGB x' the LEDs just shine into white plastic for that glow effect the rest of this phone is kind of an unorganized mess the battery actually has two connectors I assume one is to power the fan and the others for the phone but that's just a guess I'll pop off the additional extension ribbons and the screen ribbon cable just like little Legos then I can unclip the headphone jack and front-facing camera this is an 8 megapixel little guy that can film in 1080p then there's this guy some of you young uns might not remember but this is a headphone jack it can instantly play sound through wires that never need recharging pretty crazy I know there is one screw on the motherboard along with a few more signal wires then another little ribbon up top for the front firing earpiece speaker then the whole board can shift down and fold up out of the phone with one additional ribbon cable on the backside and here's the motherboard we've actually never seen anything quite like this with random splotches of copper tape all over the metal shields I'll explain why this is weird in a second the top of the three cameras is a 2 megapixel macro camera the center unit is a 64 megapixel main camera and the bottom is an 8 megapixel ultra wide camera none of which have optical image stabilization now the interesting part about this copper tape thing is that it actually covers up little vents from the metal plates underneath if I stab through the copper it shows the chips right below it and even weirder is that this copper here at the bottom of the board which presses right up against the metal air channel above it is actually covering a thermal foam it goes circuit board foam then copper then thermal paste then aluminum then air channel it's quite a unique order of heat dissipating materials but if it works it works the processor is on the other side of that complex cooling sandwich and it also has its own copper sticker that touches a heat pipe that rests below the phone frame so there's cooling all over the place even if it is all over the place let's take apart the bottom of the phone before we try and remove that fan down here we have eight more screws once the plastic is removed we can see a small circular rotating vibrator along with the SIM card tray and one screw that's holding everything down then the little SIM card and microphone board can come out at the same time with the you specie charging port which is all by itself on its own little ribbon it's also got a rubber ring around the tip but remember with a fan inside of this phone it's definitely the least water-resistant device we've seen in a long time and finally the loudspeaker no foam balls but the speaker does have water-resistant mesh over the opening at the base of the phone so at least some holes are protecting now unfortunately the battery is very much glued into the phone body which is disappointing one big thing manufacturers can do to make their phones easier to repair and easier to recycle is adding battery pull tabs like we saw inside of the new iPhone se permanent batteries are completely unnecessary bending the battery like you see here destroys it once those internal layers touch it's curtains for the battery if it doesn't explode immediately the 4500 milliamp hour capacity will slowly start to expand over the next few months like a balloon which also eventually kills the phone you might be thinking well Jerry just don't take out the battery then but for this fault and all phone's batteries don't last forever just a few years and this phone in particular requires the battery to be removed to access the screen ribbon cable so for every single screen replacement it'll require a new battery which adds unnecessary cost all of which could be avoided with the magic pull tabs now for the fan Nubia says this guy has 30% more air volume increase over last year's red magic 3 and can spend at 15,000 rpms it's very securely adhered to the phone though it only comes out in pieces let's just say it'll be a miracle if this pump turns on again there is no waterproofing mesh over the air vents which makes sense because that would restrict the air flow quite a lot negating all the benefits overall I'm still a fan of this fan inside of a phone concept the phone is not very repairable though so if that's important to you I'd buy something else it's definitely less complicated than the black sharp 3 though I'm not sure why all gaming phones have to be nightmares to take apart getting everything put back together again is easy enough if you like thousand beast puzzles I'll get the headphone jack and front-facing camera back into place then I can plug in the back glass panel LEDs and set the back metal air channel into place with this 14 screws and insanely enough the red magic 5g still works even after all that in a world where most phone are boring rectangles I think Nubia deserves a thumbs up for making something new and interesting and check that out the fan is still spinning not too shabby do you think all phones should have built-in cooling fans let me know down in the comments hit that subscribe button if you haven't already and coming out me on Instagram and Twitter thanks stuff for watching I'll see you around
