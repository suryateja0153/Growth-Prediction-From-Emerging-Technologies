 it's on one edge but close to another center [Music] edge computing refers to data processing at the periphery or edge of a network as close to the original data source as possible it's a distributed it architecture often compared against a centralized cloud computing architecture for instance a typical smart speaker command usually needs to be processed in the cloud that's why users experience a noticeable lag between when they ask the smart speaker something and when they receive a reply now that can be frustrating but similar lag in a self-driving car can be fatal in an enterprise by placing computing power closer to the sources of data aka routers wide area network devices and iot devices edge computing makes it so the data has less distance to travel and more places to travel to than in a monolithic and distant cloud infrastructure edge computing eases strain on resources by processing data close to its source and only sending valuable data to a remote data center for instance a smart thermostat will only transmit data if the temperature rises or falls outside set limits similarly a security camera will only transmit data if it detects motion edge computing improves time to action reduces response time down to milliseconds conserves network resources reduces data bottlenecks and enables 5g connectivity among many other benefits edge computing won't completely replace cloud computing though some notable cons of edge computing include security challenges as its distributed architecture means more possible attack vectors licensing costs which may negate edge computing's initially low ticket price and configuration challenges as administrators may inadvertently create security holes across each individual edge device or create configuration drift edge computing is being primarily driven by the expansion of iot and is necessary for 5g since 5g relies on a multitude of network nodes with weaker frequency bands that can only travel short distances learn more about what happens when edge computing in 5g meet iot in the link above how does your organization benefit from edge computing what edge devices do you regularly rely on let us know in the comments below and please hit that like button [Music] you
