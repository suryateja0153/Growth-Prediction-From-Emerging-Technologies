 Hey guys, so I'm going you how to  insert a SIM card or Micro SD card   into your Galaxy S20. Now first get  the box your phone shipped in, and   if you don't have this I'll explain in a  second what to do. Now at the top of the   box you guys should see this pamphlet,  so just grab it out. Now right here is   the SIM card ejector, so go slide it  out. Ok so once you slide this out,   then grab your S20. Now towards the  top here you guys should see a hole,   right here. That's where you put the  SIM card ejector. So yeah just put   it in and then push down a bit,  and it's just going to put up so   drag it out. Ok first for the Micro  SD card. Now, this is the front of   the Micro SD card with the logo.  You want it facing towards you   and just place it right here. Now you  should hear it kind of snap in. Yeah,   just like that. For the SIM card,  once again this is the front of it,   so you just want it like that. And once  again just place it right here. Just   like that. Here's a look at the back.  Ok, so once you're done just pick up   your S20 and slide it back in. Alright  guys, so hopefully this helped out!
