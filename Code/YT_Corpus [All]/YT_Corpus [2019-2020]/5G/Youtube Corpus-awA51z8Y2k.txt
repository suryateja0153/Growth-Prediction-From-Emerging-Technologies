 hi everyone Aaron here for ZolloTech and this is the Samsung Galaxy S 20 Ultra 5g and this is a pretty expensive phone it comes in at one thousand three hundred and ninety nine dollars for 128 gigabytes of storage and one thousand five hundred and ninety nine dollars for 512 gigabytes of storage it only comes in two different colors it comes in a cosmic grey and a cosmic black and this is the cosmic grey color I also got the Samsung Galaxy buds plus for free along with this LED back cover we'll take a look at later in the video so let's go ahead and open this up and we'll talk about the specs and everything else so let's go ahead and cut the tape on the back here there we go set that aside and let's unbox this the tops pretty loose and inside here it looks like we've got our typical Samsung box set up so here we have a box with a SIM card removal tool let's open the top here and see what we've got in here no case or anything like that and it just says this device is packaged with a screen protector if you remove it and want to use a different screen protector make sure it allows for use of that all the touch screen features you've got a quick reference guide samsung care and your terms and conditions warranty pamphlet so let me set that aside now here's the phone itself and we'll do a size comparison and everything else but let me put this down we'll see what's in the box and we'll come back to the phone so we've just got a little cover here and then we have our 25 watt USB C charger and so this is the charger it should charge pretty fast there's also a 45 watt charger available but tests online are showing that that really doesn't make much of a difference and it isn't really worth it so here we have this is our USB c2 USBC cable that's included in the box and then we've got some AKG headphones so these headphones seems like what they've been packaging with the Galaxy Z flip there USB C headphones you some different sized earbud tips there along with the earbuds themselves so we'll set that aside and one thing that they don't include with the s20 ultra and they ask you when you buy one is do you want the adapter so that you can switch from a different phone so inside here is the USB a two USBC adapter that allows you to switch to maybe or switch from maybe an iPhone or a pixel or something like that so it's not included they do include it for free though you just have to specify that you want it so let me set this aside and we'll take a closer look at the phone itself now the phone is made of aluminum let's take this cover off it here and I'm not sure if there's stickers all the way around I don't think there is this time on the s10 there was now the phone has an aluminum frame with glass front and back and it looks pretty good and on the right side we have our power sleep/wake button with our volume button on the top we have a microphone it looks like there might be a covering here that could be peeled off then we have our SIM card tray we'll take a closer look at that in a moment on the left side of the phone there's no buttons or no openings and then on the bottom we have a speaker USB C port and then another microphone we no longer have a headphone jack so they've removed that now on the back of course we have our camera bump this is a pretty large camera bump but has some pretty impressive specs for the cameras we'll cover those in just a moment but let's first go over the specs of the device overall now inside the samsung galaxy s 20 Ultra 5g which is a mouthful to say it has a qualcomm snapdragon 865 with an Adreno 650 GPU it's available with 12 gigabytes of RAM or 16 gigabytes of RAM if you have the 512 gigabyte of storage version you can also add a micro SD card up to one terabyte through the SIM card slot I'll show you in a little bit it supports Wi-Fi 6 and then 5g including millimeter-wave and sub 6 so that means it will be on t-mobile in the United States or Verizon with millimeter-wave in specific cities on specific street corners now the phone has Gorilla Glass 6 on it it has a dynamic AMOLED 6.9 inch display 3200 1440 pixels it's got a 22-9 ratio and it's 509 pixels per inch it also has 120 Hertz smooth display and supports HDR 10 plus it has an under the screen fingerprint sensor just like the s10 plus and also has reverse wireless charging now when we're talking about the specs of the front-facing camera it's a 40 megapixel camera that should be really impressive and also records in 4k now when it comes to the cameras on the rear we have a 108 megapixel optical image stabilized camera we also have a 48 megapixel telephoto zoom camera then we have a 12 megapixel ultra wide camera and then a point three megapixel vga time-of-flight camera the cameras on this or the main camera can record up to 8k video at 24 frames per second however this year there is no dual aperture on the camera and there's no dual pixel autofocus and we'll talk more about that a little bit later now it comes with Android 10 with one UI - now it also has a five thousand milliamp hour battery which is huge and then also supports fast wireless charging along with regular fast charging up to forty five watts like I mentioned before it also has ip68 dust and water resistance now before I turn on the s20 ultra and set it up let's go ahead and do a quick size comparison with the s10 plus of last year so these are the largest phones available at least at launch from both years so you'll see the s20 Ultra is a little bit taller it is a little bit wider and it's also slightly thicker it's definitely thicker with the camera bump as well so there is a big difference there and then if you were considering maybe the Z flip from this year this will give you a quick size comparison as well so here is the Z flip next to the s20 ultra and as far as the height of both of them they're very similar but the Z flip is a little bit taller so this gives you an idea of overall size now finally if you're an iPhone user and maybe you're considering switching to an S20 Ultra there's a size difference from the 11pro max so you'll see those side-by-side and again from the top the s20 plus is a giant foam now let's go ahead and turn it on there we go it says Samsung Galaxy S 20 ultra 5g secured by Knox powered by Android and there should be an update for this with the camera initially there were some problems with the camera's autofocus supposedly they'll be able to fix that with an update we'll see them now Samsung will walk you through audibly as well so let's go ahead and go through this so you have to accept at least two of the terms and then hit next so we'll set up the network now before I go ahead and connect to my Wi-Fi network one thing I noticed is it has a randomized MAC address which is really nice because it's harder to track you that way with a randomized Mac usually a MAC address is assigned to the hardware itself and is not something that you can change normally so it's going to check for some updates first now here's where you can copy apps and data from your existing phone now normally I would do this but you have to actually charge the phone up to about 80 percent in order to do that so right now I'll just go to next but I can come back to this later and then move my information over and it can be moved over from any phone that you have so we'll go ahead and hit next it says do you want to use your old device next to an iPhone or iPad we'll just go ahead and hit next for now now I hit don't copy we'll wait for it to check info and then I'll have to sign in so I'll go ahead and do that now I've signed in through Google now I need to set up either my fingerprint or face recognition the face recognition on samsung device is 2d and not as secure so I'll go ahead and setup my fingerprint so we'll go ahead and hit continue you'll need to make a pin or a pattern and then we'll scan our fingerprint and set it up I tried to press a little bit quicker but it wouldn't let me do that I had a lot more problems with the s10 plus so than I am with this one so it seems like this one may be improved I know some people say it is others say it is not but it looks like it's it's actually improved some so it's almost set up it's nice and fast and it says adding finishing touches so I'll log in to my Samsung Account now I'm logged into my Samsung Account so I'll go ahead and hit finish so I'll want to change those notification sounds to something a little bit more custom but you can see here is the home screen now let's go ahead and take a look at the SIM card slot I didn't take a look at this earlier and you can see it has room for not only your SIM card but also a micro SD card up to one terabyte of storage so you've got that and it's got a little rubber gasket around it but this is plastic so just be careful when you slide it back into place and I'll put my sim card in it a little bit later now this is the home screen and this should have 120 Hertz as far as the actual speed of the display so it should be really smooth but you actually have to turn on the fast speed so we'll go ahead and do that now one of the things that's kind of interesting in the settings is this is a high resolution display but it only shows at 1080p if you have motion smoothness on so if you bump this up to 120 Hertz you can have smoother scrolling but you also don't get the higher resolution you get one or the other so you'll see screen resolution is 2400 by 1080 if I switch to wqhd and hit apply it says high refresh rate isn't supported in wqhd so I would like to be able to do both although technically I would take the faster scrolling since you can't really see the pixels anyway and make everything nice and smooth now I did buy this directly from Samsung so I thought we'd take a look at what apps are actually pre-installed so we have our typical Google Apps installed we have some Microsoft apps installed and then if we go into the app switcher we've got some same Samsung Apps and then also Facebook but you can only disable this this is pretty typical lately with Sam and it was the same last year as well you can't uninstall it easily but you can disable it and then there's one other feature I thought was pretty neat now this thing is packed with features but one other feature I thought was pretty interesting is if we go into the app switcher here and tap on the app at the top we can keep it open for quick launching meaning it will keep it open in memory in the background because this has so much memory we can just keep it open so that's a pretty interesting feature now let's take a look at the camera settings and then we'll take a look at the buds plus here so let's go ahead and look at the camera so we've got photo mode video mode of course and let's see what we've got here so we've got our different camera widths so we've got wide ultra wide 5x zoom I don't know if it's going to be able to do let's see if we can go to here we can do 20x zoom kind of interesting here that we have all these options so it's really interesting to see all of these different options and then we've got different ratios we can do 8 K which is just nuts on a smart phone and then let's go back in let's spin the camera around and you'll see this is a 40 megapixel camera now I will turn off the smoothing since it does smooth your face and like I said before some people have had issues with autofocus but I'll take a closer look at that when I'm using this and let's see what we've got for our settings so in here we have seen optimizer and all sorts of things but rear video size 7680 by 4320 that's pretty nuts for a smartphone and then of course front-facing video you have some different resolutions as well so let's turn it on to 4k 64 the forward facing camera so that should be pretty interesting I'll try all these different features out now if we swipe to the left we have Samsung Daly and we do still technically have Bixby if you hold the home or the power sleep/wake button now one other thing before we take a look at the Galaxy buds plus is we'll go to software update so what we've got we do have a new update it's downloading and installing so I'll take a look at that but it says the device stability has device stability improvements and bug X's newer enhanced features so hopefully that's the fix for the camera and it's nice that it will be there so it will also have I think the March security patch it looks like so that came out yesterday so it's nice to see Samsung keeping up with the security patches as well so I'll let this install and then we'll take a look at the Galaxy buds plus you'll see the phone has updated its on the March 1st 2020 security patch so that's good to go so let's go ahead and take a look at the Galaxy buds plus well unbox these and like I said I got these free with the purchase so it's nice that they were able to include those and this should be a little bit nicer than last year's Galaxy buds they're noise cancelling and I picked the black color this year since I had the white ones from last year's so this will allow you to charge these on the back of the phone let's see what this little pamphlet is here before we look at everything else so you'll see us as QuickStart guide and then terms and conditions I'll set these aside and inside here we have a couple more things we get a cable so we can charge it it's USB a 2 USB C and then you've got different size earbuds and bands on here as well so that's pretty nice all of those things are included now let's take a look at this these should be a little bit nicer than last year like I said they should have better sound they have individual woofers and tweeters so let's go ahead and open this up and see if we can get this paired with this phone so immediately it popped up we'll hit connect we'll hit allow allow again and right away it tells me the charge levels left and right very different and then allow all the time and allow so we've got galaxy buds it's setting them up and if you want to use your contacts and calendars and information through them you need to allow these otherwise you don't have to and then we'll report diagnostic info to make it better now it says stay in touch with your surroundings start Spotify from your earbuds and we'll hit got it so here's the earbuds says you're all set and then you've got ambient sound you can allow sound through just like you could be for or it can cancel the sound and then you've got an equalizer here notifications touch pads find my earbuds and you even have software updates here apparently I have one and so that's really nice these should sound pretty good this is what they look like so if you haven't seen these they charge inside and then they look pretty good they do fit pretty comfortably I've used the other ones and so they should be pretty nice now if you want to charge the galaxy buds plus you can do that by using wireless power share on the s20 ultra you can use other galaxy phones as well you just need to turn it on from your Quick Menu your wireless power share put it on the back it vibrates to let you know it's charging and then the status light turns on so it's a really nice feature just to have it and then we'll hit cancel for that now let's take a quick look at the LED back cover as I was also able to get this free with them as well so we'll take this off open it up and if you haven't seen one of these this is pretty nice it's not only a case but it has LEDs in it and this one is much nicer than last year's this is a matte finish so if you don't like the glossy back and I'm not a big fan of it to be honest let's go ahead and remove this you've got a Quick Start Guide and that's it now the case itself before we put it on has sort of a microfiber lining but the rest of it is plastic but it has LEDs that you can't see in the back so let's go home on here put the case on it's nice and thin there we go it pops open the app when you first place it on and it says LED cover is attached open LED cover app and set the functions will hit start you have to agree to these so now it's downloading content for the LED cover in the back so we'll give it a moment so now it applied a theme to the front of the phone if we look at the back let's see if we can take a look at that we'll go into the the cover and now we have different options so on the back we have different themes so you've got themes LED cover so now that I have a theme applied let me go ahead and set the phone down it does have a screen protector on it and you'll see the LEDs come up on the back now if you get a notification these will these will change but they can do all sorts of different things for notifications and and things like that that's really all the back cover does it's more for notifications but it's a nice matte finish makes the phone less slippery and I'll change the wallpaper and things to let me change it back here and we'll change it here I actually like the stock wallpaper quite a bit so we'll set it on lock screen and let's set this one as well to the home screen so now that should use the least amount of power since most of it is black pixels I'll turn the screen off turn it back on and then they're moving so we can get in nice and quick so that's it for the s20 ultra I'll have to use it for a little while before I do any sort of review and if you'd like to see anything specifically that I haven't mentioned already let me know in the comments below if you'd like to get your hands on the s20 wallpapers I'll link one in the description like I normally do and if you haven't subscribed already please
