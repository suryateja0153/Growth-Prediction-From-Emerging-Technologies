 what's up guys Safia on super south TV and here we have the most affordable 5g samsung device and it's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset big thanks to Qualcomm for partnering with me in this video it is of course the Samsung Galaxy a 95 G let's go ahead and get it unboxed and see what it has to offer so on the box we have a picture of the a 95 G and at the back we have some of the key specifications as well as a gold qualcomm snapdragon 5 g logo now this gold logo signifies that we have the qualcomm snapdragon 855 chipset combined with the ex 55 g modem we're going to be talking about both of these a little bit later let's get it open and there it is so inside the box as well as the a 95 G we do get a USB type-c two USB type-c cable some USB type-c earphones with some spare ear tips a fast charger this does have support for 25 watt fast charging we've got some paperwork as well as a SIM card tool let's get rid of the plastic at the back and here it is we've got a premium build so there's a metal frame with a glass panels both on the front and back the back glass panel is actually curved on the edges to make it a little more comfortable to hold and as mentioned this is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon a 55 chipset a chipset that is in a lot of flagship devices this year and it's great to see it on a mid-range device like this but as well as that we have the Snapdragon X 50 modem and that is what's gonna enable 5g now with the combination of the 855 and the X 50 this is going to bring support for sub 6 gigahertz frequency bands what that basically means is you're going to get two blazing fast speeds with low latency so if you want to stream movies on here if you want to play some games everything is gonna run very very smooth and this is gonna be even better with this display we do have a six point seven inch Super AMOLED display with a full HD plus resolution we've got minimal bezels with a notch this notch has a 32 megapixel front-facing camera with an f of 2 points or aperture and we've also got a fingerprint scanner embedded within the display which works really well now if we move over onto the back we can see the camera set up now the a55 has support for more or cameras on the a 95g we have a triple rear facing camera setup so the primary camera is 48 megapixels it has an F 2.0 aperture then we have an 8 megapixel ultra wide camera within a 2.2 aperture this has roughly about a 123 degree angle of view so you're gonna be able to get loads more into your shot do you guys know I'm a huge fan of ultra wide cameras and finally we have a 5 megapixel depth camera so this depth camera along with the qualcomm snapdragon 855 is gonna enable live focus for both images as well as video so this is the blurry background bokeh effect that you may have seen now in addition to that you do get sixy bytes of ram with 128 gigabyte of storage however there is a micro SD card slot so you can expand the storage on the a 95 G now all of that along with the audrina 640 GPU is gonna mean that you're gonna get 20% faster graphics compared to the previous generation so if you're a gamer I'm not that much of a gamer but I have been playing a lot of Call of Duty on this recently things gonna look at a few super super smooth beam 55 also features Qualcomm's fourth-generation AI engine with a dedicated tensor ai accelerator this is going to give you improvements across gaming camera as well as voice so a 95 G users will experience more advanced on device voice assistance through echo cancellation as well as noise suppression better faster more secure mobile payments and drastically better photos in tough conditions such as low-light where you do have a dedicated night mode now let's take a quick look around the device on the bottom we do have a USB type-c port there's a speaker on the right hand side there is a power button as well as the volume rocker nothing on the left hand side at the top we do have the SIM card tray which has space for the micro SD card for the battery we've got a 4500 mAh battery so that's gonna last you a long time and as mentioned we do have a 25 watt fast charger included out of the box finally for software we do have Android Pi with the 1 UI skin and that is the Samsung Galaxy a 95 G quite an impressive device with some great spot Suffocation's coming in at a reasonable price point if you are somebody that's in a 5g enable area and you want to make the most of it then this might be a good option for you a lot of you guys may already know that traditionally Samsung flagship devices in the UK and Europe come with the in-house chipset not the Qualcomm Snapdragon 55 and if you did want to experience the 855 traditionally you would have to ship in a Samsung device from abroad the a 95 G does come out of the box powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 here in UK and Europe what do you guys think of it definitely drop me a comment below and let me know your
