 exactly ten years ago this summer I bought my first 4G smartphone the HTC EVO and the experience was less than perfect amazing network was too new too thin and deployed it too high of frequency to penetrate buildings very well so the end result was I couldn't use that new 4t network indoors you might remember a few months back I tested Verizon's 5g network in Chicago and found many of the same issues all 5g networks are new and the first bands Verizon is using for its rollout are many times higher frequency than even those already high bands that gave me such trouble back in o.9 that means they penetrate buildings even more poorly even if they do provide incredible data speeds so what I wanted to find out was how much difference do a few months and a much smaller City make if you want to make 5g work in real life to find out I took the train to Providence Rhode Island test up Verizon's new 5g network there I did the filming the editing some of the writing on a galaxy note 10 just to see if I could [Music] [Music] the first step in testing a 5g network of course is moving into a 5g phone so my fellow testers and I met up with our Verizon contact and Providence to temporarily trial Samsung's Galaxy Note 10.1 paintjob is nowhere to be found our coffee shop staging area was located in the heart of Providence's College Hill a charming neighborhood nestled between brown and RISD by no coincidence whatsoever this coffee shop was less than 200 feet from one of those shiny new 5g antenna nodes so no sooner had we slipped our Sims into those new notes then we were off sidewalk speed testing and getting the predictably outrageous download speeds you can see my buddy Neerav from TechnoBuffalo getting nearly 20 times the download speed on 5g than the 4G Galaxy Note 10 to it which was impressive enough that we totally didn't realize there was a cute dog right there hey Doge now I wouldn't have expected anything less from a brand new 5g network with no customer load but I also wouldn't have agreed to cover this launch if it was just gonna be Chicago all over again one of the complaints you may recall from my time in the Windy City is that Chicago's 5g network still uses 4G for uploads and that's a bummer for those of us who need to push high-res video to YouTube or a hosts high quality of live streams so you'll be happy to know that Providence is using 5g in both directions it's not symmetrical but it is about twice as fast as a 4G uplink on average so kudos to Verizon on a big win there another thing I couldn't do in Chicago was maintain a stable 5g connection indoors and in Providence well I barely managed to make it happen just inside the window of our coffee shop the trouble is the connection was only usable long enough for one speed test it's dropped back down to 4G as soon as I walked away from the window was nice well last of them in another test across the street I had a strong 5g connection while standing on the sidewalk but when I took a seat on a staircase with my back to the network node I lost him 4G LTE almost immediately the city may be smaller folks but the basic physics remain the same the millimeter waves that Verizon is using for 5g are hypersensitive to any obstacles that come between you and the antenna in our four-hour trek across Providence we visited a half-dozen 5g nodes and sometimes staying connected was literally a matter of which direction I was pointing because your body blocks the waves or even how many leaves were on the trees above my head two bars and not enough service to even complete a speed test when the site is within spitting distance on the top of that pole honestly it's quite familiar because yeah the network has built a little more densely here you have coverage in more places and the speeds are a little faster on the whole but you can be cruising along at max speed one second in the next glitch town USA back down to 4G I tried an Instagram live on 5g and it was a disaster the viewers complained of audio sync issues and poor video quality now network upgrades like implementing beamforming and just generally expanding the footprint will help with all of this but it's gonna take time when the connection does hold its tremendous I downloaded five and a half hours of music on Spotify maximum quality setting in one minute I downloaded this 125 megabyte game that I've never heard of in two seconds it took more than four times that long for the phone to actually install it and battery life seemed to hold out a bit better on the note 10 5g than on the galaxy s 10 5g I used in Chicago after four hours of aggressive usage I had about a half a charge left but taking it back to something else I couldn't use in Chicago one of 5 G's true killer apps is mobile hotspot at least it's going to be C improvidence I could connect my macbook to a 5g connected Note 10 but I couldn't get speeds anywhere close to where they should have been I asked Sascha Segan from PC Mag about this since he's also spent time testing this network and his take is that this is likely a network of miss configuration problem he goes more in depth than a recent piece of PC Mag and I'll link it below in some though it's what I've been saying this whole video and the video before it it's just too early too early for these nascent 5g networks to be relied upon and unless you live right next to a node and don't mind opening your window to use it too early for you to pony up a premium for phones that support it this video is sponsored by D brand whether your Galaxy Note is 5 G or not it's a fingerprint magnet so protect it with the best vinyl skins in the business get your D brand at the link in the description below and finally a word on editing this sucker for you video fans out there this was shot voice over and edited entirely on the Galaxy Note tended OB rush not as part of a sponsored to campaign or anything I just wanted to see if I could you've probably noticed it's less elaborate than my usual fair Samsung's decision to ditch the headphone jack and not include a dongle in the box meant I couldn't use a lav mic so that explains the audio difference who probably here and I had to switch to Wired earbuds while editing because there was just too much lag on Bluetooth but those complaints aside after three years of needing a computer to build every video it was so liberating to do everything on a phone let me know if you'd watch more videos like this or if the quality sacrifice is just too big an adjustment and if you want to hear more about editing on mobile or want to suggest the next 5g City I should try out hit me up on Twitter at knee mr. mobile until next time thanks for watching and stay mobile my friends
