 sponsored by surf shark for the third year running qualcomm flew me to Hawaii for the annual Snapdragon summit where for the third year running the next generation smart phone and laptop chips were announced and a parade of executives proclaimed that 5g is here but this year is different because it's actually true on December 6th t-mobile made it official by flipping the switch on a nationwide deployment of 5g that covers 200 million people but what does that really mean and more importantly should you care enough to spend money on it well I took a 5g phone for a Maui test-drive to find out [Music] five G can be confusing because it's not a single technology it can mean different things depending mostly on what carrier you use take Verizon the 5g network that it's pushing the hardest is built brand new from the ground up and it delivers the kind of incredible data speeds that let you download the whole season of a TV show in minutes you can learn more about that network in my Chicago and Providence 5g test drive videos which will also show you just how unimpressed I was with them the reason to reach those crazy data speeds network and phone need to operate at very high frequencies called hi Ben or millimeter wave and those waves can't penetrate obstacles very well let me illustrate what that means with a real world example remember when Verizon said this week that it was the first carrier to deploy 5g on a beach to have 5g on a beach just go right outside our search for millimeter wave reception has brought us to the kiddie pool I'm not happy about it I went to that beach with the unlock errs David Cogan whose borrowed samsung review unit did indeed latch on to the signal from one of the two 5g nodes on the roof of the resort here and did we get amazing speeds absolutely but to get them we had to hold still putting anything between us and that node palm trees umbrellas our own bodies would interrupt the signal millimeter wave ever better a team all had some fun with that reality with the coverage Nats at handing out with our phones here on Maui this is t-mobile's asserted 5g coverage in Hawaii and this is Verizon's corporate shade got a lemon so then why was the US as second smallest nationwide carrier able to flip a switch suddenly claim 5g coverage over two hundred million people well because again 5g isn't just one thing while Verizon emphasizes its 5g build-out way up in the millimeter wave spectrum at twenty eight to thirty nine gigahertz t-mobile's nationwide focus is way down the scale at six hundred megahertz in terms of cellular communications that's some of the lowest down real-estate you can get which is great for penetrating walls keeping you connected even indoors the minute I powered up my oneplus 70 Pro McLaren review device I had a solid 5g connection that barely wavered as I me and heard all over the resort 5g hello see just like Verizon t-mobile had a 5g cell site right on the roof so I took an uber to the neighboring town of Kihei a little ways up the coast to see how the signal held up in as close to the real world as I could get and while the McLaren did occasionally fall back to 4G as it connected to cell sites that haven't yet been upgraded more often than not when I looked up at the status bar it was a 5g indicator glowing back at me so what's the catch well the same six hundred megahertz radio waves that are so great at penetrating walls are not so great at giving you fast data speeds even t-mobile itself estimates only an average of twenty percent faster download speeds on it slow band 5g it compared to its 4G network and in my testing alongside Andrew Martin x4 GT mobile phone well sometimes 5g was faster then sometimes not I put the phone to some real-world use tests like downloading Spotify playlist and sure enough it didn't really feel all that different these are just download speeds by the way upload speeds were always lower than on a comparable 4G phone and due to a firmware issue that won't be addressed until 2020 mobile hotspot still works over 4G so if you're like me and you have visions of pairing your laptop to your super fast 5g and uploading big files from the road well and give it some time my initial conclusion on t-mobile 5g and the McLaren oneplus 70 Pro after a quick word from my sponsor if you use free public Wi-Fi a lot your data bill is probably in good shape but your security might not be that's why you should encrypt your connection with a VPN like today's sponsor surf shark VPN protects you while you're sharing a public network and it also helps when traveling to countries with internet censorship which can limit access to tools like Google and YouTube just open surf shark hit the Quick Connect button and presto you can

incredible speed in a handful of tiny areas while lobe and offers great coverage but speeds that kind of feel like 40 now this doesn't mean that 5g is vaporware when it's ready it really is going to enable a whole new generation of connected devices and it'll help solve many of the congestion and speed issues were seeing on today's networks but getting to that future is going to be immensely complicated it's one of the biggest reasons t-mobile has so aggressively pursued a merger with Sprint only by combining their spectrum holdings can they build out the necessary coverage across low mid and high bands to give us a real 5g experience that matters I'm generally against mergers that decrease competition and I fully expect prices to go up once this one inevitably goes through but I can kind of see their argument I'm speaking of money while you don't have to pay more per month to use t-mobile 5g you'll need to drop $900 on this McLaren Edition 1 plus 70 Pro or $1,300 on the galaxy note 10.1 each represents about a two to three hundred dollar premium over its non 5g equivalent I'll be doing some more testing on t-mobile's 5g network in New York next week and sharing impressions on my Instagram and Twitter channels stay tuned for that but from what I've seen so far in Maui my conclusion seems unlikely to change 5g might technically be here but it's not worth you spending more money on it not yet this video was produced to the 2019 Snapdragon Summit in Maui and Qualcomm provided travel lodging and meals to some members of the media including mr. mobile a t-mobile also provided that oneplus 70 pro McLaren edition review sample on a one-week loan basis and neither company was offered an early look at this content or a copy approval though that means they're seeing it for the first time right alongside you please subscribe to the mr. mobile on YouTube if that's the kind of video you'd like to see more of until next time thanks for watching and stay mobile my
