 hey everyone this is Dom from tech advisor here with Lenovo at CES 2020 where I am here with the yoga 5g which is not quite the world's first 5g laptop but it's the first 5g laptop for consumers so yeah Lenovo was the first company to announce a 5g laptop when they showed this thing off together with Qualcomm at Computex 2019 but with six months on and now it's finally actually here proper product proper name proper specs ready to hit the market in the spring it's not quite the first laptop to pull off the 5g trick because just a couple days ago Dell reveal the latitude 9510 which also has 5g baked in but that's with Intel rather than with Qualcomm or rather it's an Intel processor and Qualcomm modem this is all Qualcomm all the way through the difference is the latitude is Dells business brand so the latitude 9510 they're really pushing it to a business audience Yoga is Lenovo's consumer line so this is a consumer laptop through and through I'm sure some people will buy them for professional reasons but the push here is going to be for the average person or sort of the individual creator to buy for themselves to use on the go rather than through business stuff so what are we looking at it is a Qualcomm laptop it's on the Snapdragon 8cx chipset basically what that means if you haven't used a Qualcomm laptop Qualcomm Windows laptop before is it's gonna be a little bit lighter on processing power compared to a lot of the Intel stuff though actually it's getting there but you'll have always on connectivity 5g obviously though it will also work with 4G and in terms of 5g it covers both millimeter-wave and sub 6 so that's one big benefit of using a Qualcomm laptop you get that connectivity that you don't always get with standard Intel processors on a Windows laptop so the other big benefit is battery life so most of these windows on Snapdragon computers have amazing battery lives this one is no different than with the 5g they should last up to 24 hours of use which is a full day but obviously you're not going to use your laptop all day every day so what you're probably looking at the best part of a week's use between charges which is really fantastic and if you haven't used one of these before they do actually live up to that like it's not just the kind of a big bit of marketing hype these things will run for days and that's really ideal there are downsides it's a different processing platform its arm as opposed to x86 that means there are some software compatibility issues it is getting better more more apps are compatible helped by Microsoft waiting in with a surface on the same architecture but you will still find some things run a little bit differently to how you used to some apps may not be available or you've got to run them through a compatibility mode which affects the performance ever-so-slightly it also means this isn't like a high-end super powerful machine this isn't a creative device you're not gonna use it for like video editing and stuff like that but if what you want is a laptop that covers you know internet browsing email any sort of online work unit especially through a browser this will do it this will do it fast it will do it for days and it will do it at 5g speeds which is really great the rest of specs are basically solid 8GB of ram 256 or 512GB of storage it's a 14 inch IPS screen so it's nice but you know it's not OLED or anything like that but it should look good it's a yoga so you can fold it back use it as a 2-in-1 fold it all the way if you want that kind of thing and the whole thing is also pretty light is 1.35 kilos that's somewhere between two and three pounds it's you know it's a big issue laptops it's a 14-inch there's still it's very lightweight I'm kind of happy juggling around like that it's not a problem yeah so it's gonna cost one and a half grand USD when it comes out in the spring so not super super cheap which is maybe going to be the challenge for it compared to some of the other windows on Snapdragon devices the question is are you gonna are you willing to pay that much extra for the 5g support especially considering that may then involve a pricier data plan as well I'm not sure if it will end up being worth it from that perspective but we when we get in at the office we'll test it out more thoroughly and we'll see what we think and see what kind of actual data speed you're gonna get out the 5g on this thing yeah so stay tuned this week for more CES coverage like subscribe all of that they're going around showing everything else we see at the shows so far that we think you guys are gonna like thanks very much
