 Therapist: Keith is gonna transfer from his wheelchair into the ReWalk. Ideally what's going to happen is he's going to transfer onto the right leg of the device and then another scoot to transfer all the way in. Okay and I'm just here guarding the device and maybe assisting Keith a little bit if he needs needs any but he's pretty good. Lift up, there you go very good, great transfer. Push down on that knee. They did oh yes she made the strap longer. So when Keith is ready he's gonna do a sit to stand, okay, he's gonna press the controller on the watch to change it from the sitting position to the stand position. He's going to take both crutches, he's going to bring them behind him and tuck them in. Lean forward and the device is going to help him stand up as he leans forward. Keep coming forward, bring the crutches forward. Good, how do you feel? Okay let's go right over into walking, yeah whenever you're ready. Good look up, look up over my head. Keep your head up, good. Try to shift with the hips coming first. Good. Very nice. Keep the head up, good and scuff to stop. Nice. Good, find home. Patient: Okay, getting to home. Therapist: Good so we'll turn. Which side do you want to go? Patient: Yeah I have neglected a lot, guess I'll try left. Therapist: Okay, sounds good. Okay, so the turn Keith is going to put bring both crutches to the side, weight shift to offset one of his legs, and then use the crutches to pivot and turn. So you only shift as little as you need to lift up the opposite leg.  That's it, look up. Good, look up, keep your chest up, you're gonna shift over with the hips leading. Better. Nice. Look up. You decide when to stop. Patient: One, two, three. Therapist: Very nice. All right let's sit. Good, throw the crutches back, good. Try to lean forward as it goes down that's it. Nice.
