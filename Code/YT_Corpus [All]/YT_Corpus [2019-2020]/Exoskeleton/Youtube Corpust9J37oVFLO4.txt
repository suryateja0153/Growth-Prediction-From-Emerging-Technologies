 hi i'm junior shida from the university of chicago today i'd like to present our work hand move passive exoskeleton that miniaturizes grasp this work has done with sochiro matsuda hiroshi matsui shang yantan jiwiru kenji suzuki and pedro lopez i have been interested in how we can understand the embodied experience of a smaller person such as a smaller hand in this case and applied for supporting people who needs to understand this embodied knowledge such as designing products for smaller persons to this end we developed a participant exoskeleton that meteorizes a user's hand into that of a smaller person our exoskeleton allows congruent and real-time haptic feedback using passive mechanisms this allows product designers to evaluate the usability of products with their own hands also interior designers can improve the accessibility of classrooms where most of occupants might have a shorter leech it consists of a glove link mechanism and smaller level fingers we designed four vale linkages with pin slots that miniaturize grasping motion we also design some linkage that meteorizes grasping motion while preserving unconstrained movements in combination these features recreate a smaller grasp furthermore this wire restricts the user's arm reach this recreates a shorter reach let me explain how hand move is different there have been several attempts to reproduce the sense of being a smaller person such as transferring one's ownership to a small doll by using the technique of level hand illusion or having a smaller avatar in a virtual environment these change users size and distance perception and even attitude but only in vr recently a wearable device that lowers the height of visual perspective in real time has proposed for assisting education and design process in our case we focus on recreating the experience of having a smaller hand in the real world while preserving interaction capability to explore the effect of using hand move on our perception we conducted a preliminary size perception study in this study participants interact with five different diameters of bowls then report their first shape size while blindfolded the wizard suggested that objects were perceived to be larger than they were when wearing hand move summer sensory feedback and reduced action ability could affect the perception next and more importantly we tested hand move in a setup closer to its intended users where designer is working on a product to be used by children in this study we observed the experience of using hand move for evaluating and improving ergonomics of the toy trumpet participants were asked to improve the design of the toy trumpet for children we provided a hundred dimension sheet and hand move british were allowed to use both tools as often as they wanted we observed that some participants used hand move not only for testing ergonomics but even to model the clay directory participants stated that small sensory feedback helped them to understand the usability of their design a post questionnaire revealed that the confidence in their final design and the understanding of the usability has improved by the use of hand move exhibition visitors were able to quickly learn how to use and to interact through the exoskeleton thanks to its passive mechanism form factor taking these results together we believe that hand move affords a wider range of applications that promotes more embodied design process this also raises an open question which is that changing bodies also change our own perspective i have been tackling this question through sharing kinesthetic perspective of a patient by sharing muscle activities shifting visual perspective to lower position for nursing school teachers and now moving haptic perspective into smaller hands our future works include miniaturizing other parts of limbs and investigating the changes in perception action and interaction thanks for watching
