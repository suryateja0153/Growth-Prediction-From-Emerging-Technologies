 HandMorph: a Passive Exoskeleton that Miniaturizes Grasp Our exoskeleton allows congruent and realtime haptic feedback These four-bar linkages with pin slots miniaturize grasping motion Thumb linkage miniaturizes while preserving unconstrained movements In combination, these features recreate a smaller grasp Furthermore, this wire restricts the user’s arm reach This recreates a shorter reach These allow product designers to evaluate the usability of products with their own hands Also, architectural designers are able to feel the accessibility in classrooms with the shorter reach Participants perceived objects to be larger when using HandMorph We also investigated whether HandMorph can assist in designing a product for children In this study, we observed the experience of using HandMorph for evaluating ergonomics of a toy trumpet Participants were asked to improve the design of a toy trumpet for children We provided a hand dimension sheet and HandMorph Participants were allowed to use both tools as often as they wanted Some used HandMorph not only for testing ergonomics but even to model the clay Confidence in their final design and the understanding of the usability has improved by the use of HandMorph
