 do the ciak C: you can't eat while you are filming M: I need to think a bit the last time that we made a video we tried a full exoskeleton but since as soon as I tried it I have found a lot of problems I decided that the best thing to do was to start back from the beginning the worst thing was the passive part of the shoulder this part isolating that part we are able to easily fix the problem it tooks a week of regulations but since we are on youtube we can make it in a 10 second montage easy! this is the result easy to wear keep calm in normal situation like hammering nails in the wood, let's try to understand if I get some advantage C: my shoulders already hurt for holding the camera this actually is one of the application of the exo, hold a little camera or some tools I'm going to get the drill and we try with some screw C: did you eat some nails? M: I ate some nails more than be use for heavy loads, it only has to support passively the shoulder exo arm that weighs more or less 2 kg it seems a good idea for who has to repeat this operation 1 millon times a day to be able to support the weight without effort, it's life changing because it's tiring to keep this position did you make some artistic shots? I'm talking about this symbol, that keep return in our life I have to find out where it comes from, it must be aliens
