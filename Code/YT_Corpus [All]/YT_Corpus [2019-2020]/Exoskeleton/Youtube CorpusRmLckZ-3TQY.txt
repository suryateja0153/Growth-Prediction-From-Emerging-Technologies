 [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] good afternoon today my topic of my lecture is on robotic exoskeletons and introduction the organization of today's lecture will be as follows so first we have the definition of exoskeletons then you move on to the definition of robotic exoskeletons then we come to the historic perspectives of exoskeletons still today and then we see the classification of exoskeletons based on power mobility and which part of the body saturated accordingly we have classified the exoskeletons then the application of exoskeletons and finally we come to the conclusion involving the future requirements of robotic exoskeletons coming to the exoskeleton definition what is an exoskeleton humans and animals have skeletons for the sake of for the purpose of protection support structuring and movement of their body parts here the muscles in their bodies acts as actuators for facilitating movement of their body parts the muscles are connected to the skeletons through tendons and thereby the movement of the skeletons happen now coming to the definition of endoskeleton the skeleton part which is present inside the body is called endoskeleton these end of skeletons are the living structures which grow along with the growth of the body and what are all the living beings which have endoskeleton all vertebrates will have the endoskeleton now coming to the definition of exoskeleton the skeleton part which is lying outside the body is called exoskeleton and it is a nonliving structure and it will not grow along with the body and after some growth it sheds off from the body and all arthropods have the exoskeleton as you can see in the schematic we have the human being or the animal have the endoskeleton that the crab and the insect have the exoskeleton alone whereas the turtle is the only living being which has both the endoskeleton and the exoskeleton as you can see in the schematic which is the exoskeleton and we have the endoskeleton the bony structure inside the turtle body now coming to the definition of robotic exoskeleton it's a mechanical structural frame to be worn by the human being for the sake of protection and support or power augmentation purpose it must provide the exoskeleton structure must provide the attachment for actuators senses and for power transmission and also must be comfortable for the users body interface with the environment it must conform to the shape of the body and also the function of the human body and the exoskeleton has been first initially developed for the purpose of military applications what are the benefits of exoskeleton it is meant for the enhancement of strength and durability of the human Vader and it also provides additional support and protection from mobility issues if the human being is not able to walk with the heavy weight the exoskeleton must be worn by this human operator so that he can easily walk with that heavyweight in an upslope as well or in an uneven terrain as well now coming to the main four functions of the exoskeleton the first one being the support it is supporting the physical physically disabled patients in the field of rehabilitation in the field of treatment it is helpful for the supporting purpose next comes protection protecting the human operator in hazardous environments such as the battlefield or a nuclear power plant and then the enhancement it is meant for augmenting the human operative strength by acting as an assistive equipment and finally the fourth main function is on sensing and data fusion it acts as the interface between the human operator and the environment and also makes data fusion from the information received from the human operator now coming to the historical perspectives of the exoskeleton the first exoskeleton has been patented by Nikola C on in the year 1890 and it was basically the conceptual of exoskeleton so this is for augmenting running and jogging this is basically to bow leaf spring attached on the lateral surfaces or on the lateral sides of the legs two legs so that in the stands face the exoskeleton spring is helpful to transfer the body weight to the ground so that the user cannot have to wait have to undergo the weight of the body and in the swing face the exoskeleton concept helps to flex effortlessly that is in the stands face it is helpful to transfer the body weight to the ground and in the swing face the swinging leg will be flexed naturally without any effort by this spring based or leaf spring based exoskeleton concept by Yan and the very first practical exhaust kiloton has been developed by the general Electric GE in the year between 1965 to 1971 it is the first powered exoskeleton and it is done by a group of engineers led by the engineer Ralph Moser with the intention to lift up to six hundred eighty kilogram by this exoskeleton but this task was unsuccessful by this hajiman exoskeleton and later on they have focused to one arm exoskeleton that could able to successfully lift 340 kilogram but the weight of that arm alone is three times the weight it was lifting and hence this Hardiman exoskeleton was not applicable for practical usage it has become impractical then mihaylo pupae exoskeleton has been developed by my Amir Oh Cobra vertic I repeat it has been developed by my Amir who Cobra Tuvok and it is basically started as the kinematic Walker with hydraulic actuator in order to activate both hip and knees later on it has been developed as a partial active exoskeleton with pneumatic actuator so that all the three joints of the legs for example that is the hip knees and the ankles are actuated finally from the partial active exoskeleton it has been developed into a complete active exoskeleton so that it can support the torso as well and later on they have changed the pneumatic actuator into DC motors to have a smooth performance and they have attached four sensors three census on the sole of the foot of the exoskeleton in order to track the desired or actual or the given force and hence force feedback control has has been performed in this exoskeleton this that is mihaylo pupae exoskeleton this i repeat back and this has been developed in the year 1972 that is Mihailo poopin exoskeleton has been developed in the year nineteen sixty seventy two and now coming to the Bleek's exoskeleton which has been developed in the year 2004 and this is one of the prominent exoskeletons under the DARPA program of the US government Darfur means the Defense Advanced Research Project agency of the US government they have been associated with a couple of universities or institutions in the u.s. one is Berkeley University UC Berkeley and MIT and this Bleek's which is nothing but the Berkeley's Lake extremity exoskeleton or lower extremity exoskeleton it is basically Berkeley's lower extremity exoskeleton Bleek's and it is one of the prominent exoskeletons under DARPA program and it is a for actuated degrees-of-freedom exoskeleton meant for hip flexion extension and abduction adduction two degrees of freedom actuated at the hip joint and one degrees of freedom for the knee flexion extension and one degrees of freedom actuated at the ankle flexion extension and it can support up to 75 kilogram with the speed of 0.9 meter per second and it weighs the exoskeleton weighs only 14 kilogram and the current generation focuses on lightweight comput exoskeleton in order to enhance agility of the human operator now coming to the classification of exoskeleton first the classification is based on which part of the body is actuated accordingly it can be classified further into whole body exoskeleton if the full body is actuated and if the upper body if the torso the neck and arm are actuated then it is called upper extremity exoskeleton and if the leg is actuated then it is called lower extremity exoskeleton the leg means it is denoting all the three joints that is hip knee and the ankle so in the lower extremity exoskeletons the actuation can be for hip and knee or for the knee and the ankle or for the hip and the ankle alone or individually the hip alone or the knee alone or the ankle alone or the combination of all these three joints will be coming under the actuation part of the lower extremity exoskeletons now the another major classification is on powering of the exoskeleton whether the accessibility is powered or not accordingly it has been classified into powered exoskeletons passive exoskeletons pseudo passive exoskeletons and finally hybrid exoskeletons now powered exoskeletons generally use batteries or electric cables in order to run the synthesis and the actuators they are further broken into or classified further into powered exoskeletons are classified further into static exoskeleton and dynamic exoskeleton in the static exoskeletons the actuators are turned on all the times in order to have the functional the exoskeleton in order to maintain its shapes whereas in the dynamic exoskeleton the power of the actuators are not on at all the times and it is quite energy efficient exoskeleton and coming to the passive exoskeleton it doesn't require a power source for its operation and they are further classified according to their usage one meant for weight redistribution and the another one for energy capture and another one for locking the user and the next one will be for acting as a shock absorber now coming to the pseudo passive exoskeletons they have the batteries sensors and the electronics but are not meant to provide actuation as in the case of powered exoskeletons so the pseudo passive exoskeletons will have the batteries sensors and actuators sorry batteries sensors and other electronics but they know they do not provide actuation now finally coming to the hybrid exoskeletons they do have all the controllers and sensors of a powered exoskeleton but they use functional electrical stimulation technique of the muscles as actuators this functional electrical stimulation of the muscles means it uses the low electric power pulses in order to artificially generate movement of the limbs that is what getting used in the hybrid exoskeletons then finally the major classification is on mobility the exoskeletons classified based on mobility definitely it will be one will be they fixed the one which is fixed either on the wall or on to the hook part and the another one is supported that is a exoskeleton is attached to your overhead rail and it is supported by a moving frame or it is supported by an adjacent mobile robotics system so that the heavy controller actuator and sensor part will be kept in the adjacent moving robotic system so that it can provide granted mobility to the exoskeleton wearer and finally the last subdivision of the mobility based excess collection is mobile EXO skeleton which allows the user and the extra exoskeleton to move freely around that's all now coming to the applications of exoskeleton the exoskeletons major applications are in the field of military medical field industrial field and civilian or consumer application field now coming to the first application which is the military application they are meant to be useful in the military application in order to enhance the strength agility and endurance of the soldiers in order to perform deep squats lifting heavy objects and running up to 10 miles per hour in uneven upslope terrains and for reducing soldier's response time and finally do you protect from strain injuries of the soldiers we see the first exoskeleton here under the military applications concept is the Hulk that is human Universal load carrier which is developed by ESCO bionics in the year 2008 in the year 2009 it has been publicly demonstrated by Lockheed Martin in the army winter symposium held in the US and this exoskeleton the Hulk exoskeleton can support 20 kilometer range and also it suppose the back and front payloads and it provides a maximum speed up to 16 kilometers per hour with the range varying from 11 to 16 kilometer per hour and the design is compact and customizable and it weighs up to 24 kg it weighs roughly 24 kg approximately and it is helpful and it is suitable for the soldiers who are having the Heights varying from five feet four inches to six feet two inches and it is used as a load lifter for the army and naval dry dock workers and it can lift up to ninety one kilogram roughly 200 pounds and it is powered by a fuel cell and it can support a continual continuous 72 hour extended mission now coming to the second X is created under the military application is Sarcos exo's to suit it is a second-generation suit of the sarcos exoskeleton company and it is publicly demonstrated in the year 2010 the operator who is lifting the weight with sarcos exoskeleton will feel the weight lifted in the ratio of 17 is to 1 that means the actual weight is 17 times more than the perceived weight and also it allows the repeated lifting and it weighs nearly 795 kilogram and it has high-strength steel and aluminum body controllers and actuators and sensors and electronics associated in the compact system and the wearer can perform the work done which is up to the work done by three soldiers and the lifting of up to 90 kilogram is possible with this exoskeleton very smoothly and very easily and now coming to the power walk exoskeleton which is basically focusing on the knee exascale trivet is here passive exoskeleton and developed by Bionic power incorporation and it is here walk recharge capability based exoskeleton that means you recharge while walk and it reduces the need of carrying backup batteries and battery resupply in the field because those batteries lithium batteries can be recharged by the system itself and it does the intelligent analysis to analyze when to generate high power with less effort by this exoskeleton and it does here the working principle has an inboard microprocessor to analyze the virus gate or the walking style to determine precisely when to generate maximum power with the least amount of effort it is average on an average it produces 10 to 12 watt of electricity which over an hour can supply can charge up to four smartphones that means it is quite efficient to generate power in a passive manner we walk thereby we could able to recharge the batteries of the exoskeleton and it has a gearbox in order to increase the speed of the knee rotational speed for efficient power generation and I generated incorporated in the system can convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy and this electricity is converted into the electricity for battery charging by a state-of-the-art power conversion circuit then the soldier who's varying this exoskeleton can recharge is lithium-ion batteries with the electricity converted by the power conversion circuit in the exoskeleton now coming to the next application which is the medical application we have several exoskeletons developed in order to assist the elderly people or the patients who lost the control of their motor abilities due to stroke and other disorders one is Phoenix Medical exoskeleton another one is Hartmann third ported prototype exoskeleton and Capua exoskeleton EXO GT exoskeleton an army of spring arm and hand exoskeleton then we have the ReWalk exoskeleton to discuss about it but precisely we focus in the Phoenix medical exoskeleton and the ReWalk exoskeleton in this lecture coming to the Phoenix excess keratin this command the picture is shown here with the bearer and it weighs only 12.25 kg kilogram and it enables the wearer to stand up walk and have it have an eye-to-eye contact to the peers and it provides 0.5 meter per second speed and for our continuous walking support with one time charging and it can be worn by the patient while he was sitting on the wheelchair itself and we discuss about now the ReWalk exoskeleton the schematic is tuned here and it aids the spinal cord injury patients to stand upright walk turn climb and descend stairs they can walk down in the steps in the space and it is the first exoskeleton in the u.s. to receive FDA clearance for personal use and to be used with patients and it weighs only 23.3 kilogram now coming to the industrial applications the exoskeletons are developed for the industry purpose in order to expand workers capabilities by relieving the stress and pressure in his neck knees and back first we see about the few days charli's exoskeleton the Hoonah is tireless exoskeleton is a one that is weighing one Li 1.6 kilogram it decreases the use of waste and lower body muscles by 80 percentage by reducing the thereby reducing the fatigue that results from being in the same position for a long time or sitting in the same position for a long time on the chair that's why this exoskeleton has been developed and it is only 1.6 kilogram width which can withstand the weight of 150 kilogram person and next is the fatso exoskeleton which is weighing less than two kilogram and it transfers it is meant for above the shoulder work that means the work in order to relieve the stress of the workers who is having raised arm work as can be shown in the schematic so that the weight of the East Arms has been transferred to the hip joint by a mechanical cabling system technology used in this exoskeleton so that it results in much relief of the workers who are having raised arm work then finally the Sarcos garden exoskeleton is a powered exoskeleton which improves the human strength and endurance without affecting the freedom of movement of the operator it can lift up to 90 kilogram as can be shown in the schematic finally the civilian applications there are these exoskeletons are developed in order to assist humans in performing activities of daily living like lifting walking and performing personal tasks such as writing and opening the knobs etc the first one is the Hall exoskeleton which is nothing but the hybrid assistive limb exoskeleton developed by a Japanese company Cyberdyne and next we have the Panasonic exoskeleton then we have the walking assistant varible robot developed by the Hyundai Motor Group of the South Korean company these are meant to assist the wearers in order to enhance their work towards the activities of daily living now the requirements from this study is that the exoskeleton in the future must be developed in order to ensure safety as a first and foremost requirement and it must be light it must be of light weight nearly less than 15 kilogram in the term of military applications and it must be affordable yes because most of the exoskeletons are marketed but are not widely used by the public must be durable but the self recharging capability as in the case of needs of skeletons and it will be in future the replacement of wheelchairs and will be used as a standard in the industrial usage and these are the cited resources cited sources which I have utilized in order to present this lecture thank you so much [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
