  Music  The latest hip exosuit developed at the Wyss Institute and  Harvard SEAS can now assist with both walking and running. This is a new milestone in wearable robotics. During walking, a person's center of mass moves like an inverted pendulum. It is highest at mid-stance where the leg is relatively straight. During running, the center of mass moves like a spring-mass system. It is lowest at mid-stance when the hip, knee, and ankle are flexed. The onboard microprocessor detects changes between inverted pendulum and spring-mass behavior to adjust the assistance. With each step, the cable actuation works in concert with the biological function of the glute muscles. Biomechanical and physiological measurements were used to evaluate the exosuit's impact on human performance. Results show that the exosuit reduced the energy required for level-ground and incline walking as well as at a range of different running speeds. The exosuit's simplified, versatile, and nonrestrictive design allows users to move naturally. The team has demonstrated that the suit maintains these new capabilities in complex environments. They are now developing a new generation of exosuit that is lighter, smaller, and quieter, paving the way for real-world applications.
