 The exo itself is special in that it's a robotic gait trainer but it lets people walk over ground and it really feels like actual walking. The exoskeleton has done a lot for our patients and for this program specifically I've seen our patients be able to get up and do gait training in ways that they have never thought possible before. Instead of having me just you know walk with braces it teaches me and lets me do the work along with helping me through it. It's able to move your feet and your legs and it brings back good memories and it's something to be hopeful for I just feel great I feel like I'm up and walking again it's just a nice feeling it's more of giving you back your self-confidence and again you always move forward because there's always that hope that's great to kind of see that a patient can go from relying on the therapist to also being able to do something a little bit more independent and and freely on their own you know the first time you get someone in the exoskeleton after maybe 10 or more years they haven't even stood or walked like they're tearful their families are tearful they're taking videos so there's also that huge component as well just beyond the physical gains that we see losing your ability to stand and walk and finally I got to walk and so I remember somebody asked me for the first time I said how does it feel I said remember the astronaut that landed the moon I landed my feet on the ground so I could be the equivalent just feels like that same sensation when I was walking one before I was injured and it's just an amazing feeling
