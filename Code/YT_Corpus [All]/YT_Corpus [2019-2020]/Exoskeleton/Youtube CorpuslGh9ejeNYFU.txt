 for the past couple of videos i've been teasing you guys about trying on the autoboxy brace but i actually haven't been able to try one on so today i'm going to the clinic to get fitted for the trial version of the autobox zbrace [Music] you guys know i've been hyped about this and i am so excited to finally be able to try on the trial version of the brace and see if it's actually even worth pursuing any further because i might go try it on today and it might be super uncomfortable and not what i thought it was but my hopes are high and we'll see what happens [Music] there's really really three main components of the seat brace there's an accelerometer a gyroscope and hydraulics so your hydraulics are replacing some of those quad muscles into those hamstring and some of your glutes so when those muscles are lacking and you take a step and you go through swing and if you were to stumble and come down while your knees bent you're not nothing nearly they're going to hold you up so when you have a normal k-fo knee ankle orthosis it works during stance so when you're in full stance you're locked up you're not going to go down but if you're going downhill downstairs where your knees are never really locked there's nothing really keeping you up if you stumble so it's just wide open that joint just can be wide open so you can fall but the biggest thing to remember is not going to pull you up out of the chair okay it'll help you you'll feel it when you sit down you'll feel those hydraulics but it's a single hydraulic the valve is basically open and closing and we can set it for different you know size of the hole so if the hole is bigger the faster it'll go down the smaller the more resistance you have so there's a couple of new features on the the 2.0 there's stumble recovery so basically that's where that gyroscope comes in an accelerometer so it's telling you when you're walking in normal gate if you start to move too fast in one direction or it doesn't feel like it's upright it's going to ramp up that resistance so it thinks you're stumbling so it'll allow you to get your sound leg out in front of you or your hand out if you're bilateral so that's what's really nice but you can still trip just like here i could trip over a branch you'll still go down it's not going to stop you from falling but what it's trying to do is replace those muscles where if i were to stumble i can seize up and i'm going to stop myself from going now if you do sit on the sea brace like this you can't sink into it so if you're able to keep yourself up and if you're able to hold yourself two degrees and hold it for three seconds it'll lock so there's a few main things we're looking for when we look for a seat brakes we're looking for cognitive ability can you understand commands do you have some upper body can you advance the limb can you get to full extension so we talked about the hydraulics the cell the accelerometer is basically taking a picture of your knee in space a hundred times a second so that's sort of where that stumble recovery comes in and time telling are we into normal gait are we starting to stumble or are we not operating the joint correctly so when we want to get in to your knee straight up and down and you're going to hear a beep when you start walking it says okay the joint has reached full extension it's ready to release so you can finger and swing your leg through right there it went right into my tailbone so i think we've got this really planner flex right now yeah it looks like this bar needs to slide back a little how does that feel yeah that's right um [Music] so these um these right here will be sort of what the brace is this roll pre-craig it's really nice durable yeah does the foot maybe you want to actually like it that it's not longer because the longer one might stick out it'll catch okay i usually just start with the smaller foot plate [Music] nobody i like don't know what to expect and i'm like half excited half nervous now you're going to be a true cyborg as if i wasn't already i'm like half metal i know wolverine style this is jerry stark he's the head of our pcs hey jerry well we've got a bunch of people here we got richard in his brace um i'll come closer so you can see we think we're pretty centered up okay so we're going to stand nice and tall we're going to stand kind of on your toes so stand nice and tall and stand up and then just kind of more on your toes and if i could kind of see from the side that would help me so there you go so we want you to stand straight up nice and tall both legs next to each other and get this up even weight on either leg i mean it feels like it's pushing me way forward okay so you got gotta get your legs straight as possible it looks like it's bending a little bit we call that the frog and mill show the uh milkmaid shoe so what i want you to do is nose over toes fanny back and then i want you to sit down but i want you to load the overdoses too so this is kind of different so now you're just going to go ahead and sit down to ride that knee down so look it's a stance control on there mark god now let's try that again i want you to have nose over toes so nose over toes stick your fanny back and then sit down and load both sides equally and then sit down you feel that resistance uh i mean yeah yeah yeah let's see if he likes this i keep going until he says that's a little too much all right all right nose over toes fanning back and then sit down i'm just [Applause] okay so just go ahead and start walking just walk normally and try not to drive it and we want to see if we can make this thing release okay take a step forward with your right leg and just start walking perfect good keep going [Music] good keep going remembering to roll all the way to your toes when you take that step leave that left leg back longer i mean you're doing it perfect with your that one you need a little flex you can't do that perfect and some of that external rotation is just the weight of the child yeah and it's just sitting way out so it's just not yeah yeah and yeah and this blue shoe thing is so weird so by the way you're already passed you've already passed by the way do you feel like a robot i feel like a really eventually does this beeping turn off yeah we can turn around you can turn my home would explode if i was beeping it's just a trial to make sure to tell you that you're looking at it some people keep it on there because they want to know that it's doing it oh he's going away he's walking without the parallel button the robot has gained sentience he's leaving him [Music] to be honest the knee pain that i normally get from the hyper extension isn't there that's good however you want a new acquired chin pain [Laughter] so i think gary was about to say that you overwhelmingly passed uh we can probably let him run if you want to keep you know messing with it but um sure no you got any more you could try stairs or ramps if you wanted but you passed the you passed the trial so the question you have to ask yourself you know is it giving you the speed you are up the symmetry of gates is it giving you the support you desire and then uneven terrain so that's so as far as the mechanical part of that test that you you've done great all right thank you jerry thank you jerry yeah all right hey good to meet you guys you did great thanks so much thank you all right thanks bye-bye bye-bye we don't have any slopes in here we have it out front i was gonna say it has railings and we're gonna go run outside and try some obstacles that's perfect yes it's not super [Music] a railing please [Applause] that's why the resistance is up because those are going downhill remember that gyroscope [Music] going down i wasn't a huge fan where that setting where you're going down like the sitting that's where this comes into play yeah it's just really really high so it may be one of those it's too it felt good with sitting but it's too much when you feel like you're going down the slope that could be a factor or just that this weighs so much i'm having a hard time lifting it up yeah he's like already on like somebody has had one for three months yeah this is where the now this isn't really a whole lot of a decline yes it's pretty flat this is what it's doing that gyroscopes are hard we're going down so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna release this joint so whatever you set that resistance which is what 185 yeah so you're at 185 when you're stepping so it's going to feel like you're bending a really thick rubber band or trying to squat yeah and that's and it it's so it's like this part's fine it's clear in the toe yep it's it's like good good good good good not good good good good good good not good you don't have to release it yep and no just take another go just like that a little bit over so just like that yeah so your resistance again is really high right now it's gonna be hard for you to get up there all right [Music] [Music] so heavy it's heavy it's cool how's your knee feeling right now good really really he's part man half microwave [Laughter] [Music] [Music] so first impressions on the trial is well it's a trial it's precisely made for no one so it's not going to be fitting exactly the way that my actual brace is going to be fitting me i'm excited about it i think it's really going to do what i think it's going to do the trial version is twice as heavy and definitely clunky and you know kind of makes my toe roll out a little bit but i don't really know how to describe the way it feels other than it feels like a big stretchy rubber band or maybe an extra tendon in my leg that i never really knew was there and the way that you deploy it is almost intentionally falling or at least in my case where if i buckle my knee i fall but in this case i have to buckle my knee in order for the c brace to actually activate and that is a really strange pattern that i'm gonna have to get used to but all in all just some from the trial perspective um i'm thrilled at the possibilities of what this is gonna look like and what the next stages are all right and that wraps it up and i am so tired i have not walked around that much in such a long time and honestly i'm a little bit scared to see what my pain levels are tonight and how much my back is killing me but if you enjoyed this video so far and want to see more please be sure to leave a like if you haven't subscribed please be sure to subscribe and finally if you haven't seen the podcast
