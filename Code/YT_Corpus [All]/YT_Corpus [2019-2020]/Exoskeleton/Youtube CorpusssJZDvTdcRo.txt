 It came up in my ultrasound and they said that she could die within hours or she could have a mild version and live a fairly normal life or anything in between and they said we won't know until she's born. It's one in three thousand live births it has some form of arthrogryposis and there's close to 400 different types of arthrogryposis and that does not include kids like Sarah who are undiagnosed so they don't know what form she has it's some genetic form but it hasn't been discovered yet. The whole goal of my lab is to design intervention activities and intervention devices that are going to make people more independent and improve their quality of life the kids that we work with can't lift their arms up against gravity so their arms are down here all the time in an exoskeleton is something that you can put on that helps the kids to lift their arms and move against gravity the really nice thing about for instance the exoskeletons is that you can put them on a child and see an immediate change in their ability this DIY model is one that we've embraced it's the idea that we can make something and then put out a parts list materials list and instructions so that people can access those we put it on instantly her arm went up the first time she can draw she can feed herself you know she could brush her hair that's that's huge and I know it doesn't seem like a big deal to you know normal people but that's huge to be able to lift your hand up and to brush your hair the more that she moves and the more that she's independent she's definitely happier all of that started because she was able to build muscles through that suit so I don't know where we would be without it I really don't you
