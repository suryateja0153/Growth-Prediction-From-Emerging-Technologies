 one way I've described running with the exoskeletons is you imagine someone was running behind you and holding little ropes that were attached to your heels and every time you pushed off the ground instead of having to do all the work someone else lifted your foot for you feels very springy and very bouncy compared to normal running you know anybody can go for a run you just need it throw on a pair of shoes and head out the door but a lot of people don't only twenty percent of Americans have gone for a jog in the last year that's often because people don't feel very athletic or they don't perceive themselves to be very good at the activity so we want to see if we could use our exoskeletons to make running easier and more fun which might promote activity the people who need to run for work for like first responders and anything that we can do to help like we'd use the energy cost on activities like running getting around they can they then have more energy to do other more important things a lot of the energy that we use in running is actually associated with pushing off the ground and the work that our calf muscles are doing taking over some of that work the exoskeleton is able to give us really large reductions in energy cost so our runners put on an exoskeleton on their ankle there's this carbon fiber frame that goes along their shank from just below their knees down to about their ankle joint and then there's this metal lever that sticks out the back of the ankle that's connected to their shoe and that lever has a rope that's connected through this long cable to big motors and when the motors pull the rope then that pulls up on the lever and it pushes the person that's toes down that helps you to extend your ankle at the end of a running step these are the largest improvements in energy economy that we've seen with any device used to assist run we did see about a 15% improvement in energy cost over running a normal shoe speaking from experience that feels really good it feels much easier than normal running just being able to do that from a scientific perspective I think is really exciting you're probably not gonna be able to use this for a qualifying time for the Boston Marathon but it may allow you to keep up with your friends that are a little bit faster runners for example my younger brother ran the Boston and I would love to be able to keep pace with him we imagine this could play a similar role as an electric assist bike if you think of the first last mile problem this can be a very useful tool if people could like get off the bus and their shoes just never been through an exoskeleton that they can then use the cover that last one to two miles to work and like just couple of minutes without breaking a sweat based on this research and the results that we obtained with power and assistance which appeared very helpful to users it would be really cool if we could take some of that work and move it into the real world for more please visit us at stanford.edu
