 SOLEDAD O'BRIEN:   Scientist Hugh Herr developed  some of the most advanced  prosthetics in the world.  He makes them  not just for others.  The double amputee uses his own technology for himself. I imagined a future without disability and began striving towards it. O'BRIEN: Herr designed the legs  he wears today,  which are powered  not by muscles and tendons, but by computers and batteries. You literally have an on/off switch. Right. Most people, when you push their buttons, they get angry. With me, I get energized. O'BRIEN: But Herr and his team  aren't just concerned  with repairing damaged bodies.  They've also begun  trying to figure out  how to improve the potential  of able-bodied people.  How to turn humans  into superhumans. SCIENTIST: It's like a little extra spring in your step. O'BRIEN: Yep. Now I got 'em both firing. I tried out  these lower leg exoskeletons  designed to give the wearer  superpowered strength. Do you start to feel like you're working less hard? Yeah. Definitely. Herr says this kind  of technology  will one day allow athletes  to jump higher and run faster  than they ever have before,  which will change the game.  Literally. There's gonna be new sports of people running really fast. And there'll be, you know, power basketball, power swimming, and power climbing, and there'll just be this... reinvention of sport, and it'll be so much fun.   ("REAL SPORTS" THEME PLAYS)
