 every innovation begins with an idea I had an idea I had an idea I had an idea no matter what your role is here I'm a Child Life Specialist I'm an art therapist I work in the office of diversity and inclusion if your idea aligns with our care priorities they wanted to foster attachment between micki babies and their families we wanted to create a program for youth to learn about nutrition and increase physical activity I wanted to help terminal patients create legacy art projects I wanted to study how the exoskeleton could help people with multiple sclerosis you could receive up to $100,000 to begin to turn your idea into the next innovation they're called caregiver catalyst grants and they use donor funds to jumpstart our caregivers great ideas the catalyst award was the spark to cut our whole project off the ground it means so much to have the support of our donors to make programs like this possible apply online and if you don't get accepted don't get discouraged every year the more donations that come in the more programs we can fund apply for it because you just never know I was so excited when we got the email and we were one of the project's chosen if your idea is chosen you'll have one year to show that your project has truly made a difference it was so worth it it was one day's work four years worth of programming our years just beginning but I'm really looking forward to seeing how we can make a difference by the end of the year we hope to be able to use the exoskeleton in our clinic and to get more funding to continue with the research now's your chance everyone has an idea bring yours to life you
