 [Music] the Mellon Center was founded on the concept of team care for multiple sclerosis patients this is central to everything that we do our mission is to transform the MS patient journey and lead the search for a cure that really incorporates taking care of the individual patient using a team approach in a way that nobody else can and also advance the science of the disease hoping to lead to a cure the team is composed of caregivers devoted specifically to MS care neurologists physiatrist or rehabilitation medicine doctors we take care of patients using physical therapy occupational therapy health psychology Social Work and many other sub specialists and we're all co-located under the same roof patients come to us from very closeby and from far and wide around the world we really believe that taking care of the whole person is important to MS care we emphasize wellness behaviors and integrate that into the care of every patient care starts with a one-to-one relationship between a provider and their patient what we try to add to that interaction is the latest in technology such as gait assessment tools like the Karen virtual reality immersive rehabilitation system which is about as high-tech a system as you can see in an MS Center we believe very strongly in acquiring structured monitoring of patients with something called multiple sclerosis performance tests which is an iPad series of neural performance tests we can really get an objective assessment of how patients are doing over time in addition to that we're now leveraging technology so that we can contact patients face to face by a virtual visit platform to discuss their care and make treatment decisions the Mellon Center has been involved in some of the most technologically advanced types of therapies including things like stem cell therapies small molecule type pills or even infusions or injectables for MS patients who come to the Mellon Center for care are often interested in participating in clinical trials and therapies we want to work towards restoring function in patients with MS and the latest development in this is the availability of a research trial of an exoskeleton which is a robotic assisted walking device Mellon Center physicians and scientists have been Lee or senior author on almost every single new medication that's been approved to treat MS truely on the cutting edge of the science of multiple sclerosis I truly believe there's a major difference in the way that we take care of patients with MS this is core to what we do and when you put people together with an ability to be in the same place and communicate with each other around cases it provides that team environment where patients truly benefit you [Music]
