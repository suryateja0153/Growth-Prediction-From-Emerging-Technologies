 the futuristic Tesla cyber truck was designed for function with the utility of a truck and sports car like performance his durable vehicle was built to be capable both on-road and offroad the render of the cyber truck in the great outdoors with a pop-up camper and grill positions Elon Musk's polygonal cyber truck as the ultimate camping expedition vehicle for the post-apocalyptic wasteland what the cyber truck needs is a versatile equally high-tech trailer camper to perfectly complement it and the australian-made brooder exp for offroad expedition trailer with a fully engineered suspension chassis and body construction is a match made on Mars the idea of the cyber truck as a self-reliant overland travel vehicle to reach remote destinations where the journey is the principal goal adds an entirely new dimension to Tesla's fleet combined with an advanced trailer like the exp for this high-tech refuge from the elements would be equally capable in the desert the forest or just for being the coolest nerd at the tailgate party [Music] the monochrome stainless steel exoskeleton of the cyber truck is perfectly complemented by the epoxy bonded closed-cell composite of the brooder that was tested for durability and 120 degree fahrenheit ambient heat and it performed exceptionally well the special material it's made of being 60 millimeters thick and being able to handle 10 times its own weight it seems that these two do not only work perfectly together on a functional level but they're also equally indestructible and well built [Music] with a tri-motor all-wheel-drive powertrain that generates an estimated 800 horsepower on 1,000 pound feet of torque the cyber truck is able to pull pretty much anything you can imagine having a whopping towing capability of 14,000 pounds what this means to us is that you can attach an awesome trailer to use when you go camping and exp for from brooder fits the cyber truck like a glove this rugged camper packs advanced technology that won't hinder the cyber trucks natural abilities exp 4 doesn't buck jolt or bounce around off-road its advanced suspension soaks up undulation 's and remains in complete control made from 450 grade high tensile circular hollow section steel the self leveling capabilities of the brooder trailer matched perfectly with the adjustable air suspension of the tesla cyber truck [Music] the Tesla cyber truck is made out of ultra hard 30x cold-rolled stainless steel and equipped with the immensely controversial Tesla bulletproof glass this electric pickup truck is not easy to ignore in traffic with the cyber truck lacks in grace it makes up for in sturdiness and performance sporting a powerful drivetrain and low center of gravity that not only gives it amazing traction control but also enables the mind-bending acceleration that can take this truck from zero to 60 in as little as 2.9 seconds these specs are available in the top-level $70,000 version which also has an immense 500 mile range the exp 4 has yet another special trait the R value insulation of over five point one which makes it the most insulated trailer in its class this means that anything you store inside the trailer will be kept at an ideal temperature and will also stay safe from damage including the internal 100 liter water supply tank that's usually placed somewhere on the outside of other campers similarly the cyber truck has a secure lockable covered cargo area where you could even fit an ATV as we can see from their reveal videos the sliding metal tunnel that covers it being a genius mechanism designed in the same minimalist style as the cyber truck this trailer sports an incredibly spacious 6 foot wide and 7 foot 2 long sleeping area with a 1.8 meter long bed that needs no setup because it's always ready and level regardless of the terrain as incredible as it might seem this compact camper includes three immense storage shelves and even a dedicated hanging space for clothing besides these awesome features you can also find internal USB charging outlets placed in convenient places so you can always stay connected all these functions will be perfectly matched with the incredible adaptability of the cyber truck that can turn into a fully utilitarian vehicle with onboard power and compressed air included the 14,000 pound towing capacity of the cyber truck is unrivaled but no matter how powerful a truck may be its performance is only as good as the trailer it drags behind and we already know the EXP 4 is the absolute king of campers with a wheelbase and drawbar designed with the utmost of precision this trailer can achieve 90 degree turning angles without even a slight jolt you can take any sharp turn and the brooder will loyally follow you without jackknifing this awesome performance can be achieved thanks to the patented suspension that can lean away lower arise up to 12 inches to avoid obstacles such as boulders or even overhanging trees built with performance aerodynamics and versatility in mind both the cyber truck and the exp 4 can be successfully paired together for an off-road camping experience from the future with this setup you will benefit from Tesla's state of the art technology while traveling safely and comfortably in a sturdy and secure trailer that doesn't just give you a mere sleeping place but can be considered an entire high-tech home on wheels with a fully equipped kitchen and more this combination is perfect but Tesla's thinking about making an RV of their own CEO Elon Musk was quoted as saying that Tesla's planning on producing a sick attachment for the cyber truck and Tesla released this render [Music] with a confirmed solar roof option on the cyber truck potential to add additional solar panels on an Overland trailer teases the idea of a self powered mobile home we apologize if you were expecting some real footage of the cyber truck with the exp 4 trailer but it doesn't exist yet when we saw the matte black cyber truck we just had to make a mock-up image with the equally matte black trailer it just looks so cool we had to make a video about the potential combination if you enjoyed this video please
