 you can skip to the skin you'd like to know more about using the time codes in this video's description the featured chronologically throughout this video is part of Dupree see you story the mac-10 pipe down skin released late last year as part of the danger zone case was a clever concept at first glance it looks like it's made of 3d pipes but it's an illusion skin makers cannot reshape the weapons these pipes were many painted on in a way that looked 3d this is how the skin compares with the default mac-10 model so you can see which bits are actually there and which bits are painted on this year addy : the Prisma case featured the same 3d effect again it helps to compare it with the default vehicle skins that you can see what shape the weapon model actually is both of these skins were made by de pusi you and a part of his exoskeleton collection he kindly provided me with some of the other skins he's made with the same effect which I'll be showcasing in this video as he can probably tell I'm a big fan of these skins even when I know they're not 3d I can't help to see them as that I begin to question what the skin looked like originally and how somebody could possibly make a 2d surface appear so 3d he already explained this in a previous skin showcase video of mine about how he draws the design that makes it in proper 3d then captures 2d versions from the viewpoints that the player will typically see these parts of the weapon from the illusion doesn't hold up from all angles so he prioritizes the viewpoints that you'll see when holding and inspecting the skin then relies on the newest gunsmith finish to give it a 3d appearance with help from a normal map before he experimented with 3d pipes he made a series called leaded glass this is the tech 9 that was made in that style it looks like a smashed stained glass window with the fragments appearing to stick out beyond the tec-9s model next he made this p90 leaded glass skin and while it's still similar to the tech 9 of the design he spots the darker black and red color scheme that his 3d designs would later be known for he shattered the whole main grip in a 3d program then when he accidentally deleted a few of these he realized how cool it would be to see inside the gun which he then elaborated on in later skins this baizen skin was next and was the first where he deliberately tried hollering it inwards instead of making it appear to pop out he was surprised by how well it worked in game even when you should have been able to see right through the design which of course isn't possible however he feels the illusion breaks when inspecting the weapon and thinks people won't like the skin as much because of it but it was an experiment that he felt was worth doing and ultimately paved the way for future designs he then created the mac-10 and you'd likely already know it since it's the one that was featured in the danger zone case last year he considers this the first real EXO success having smaller holes in the design made the illusion stand up much better the Matins model and texture shape turned out to be perfect for 3d it even holds up during the inspect animation he then made this sword off skin using the 3d trick to make it appear as though the two front pipes extend all the way back along the weapon after he had done this and looked like a bent exhaust pipe and someone suggested to him that it wasn't badass enough so we added some ventilation holes to make it look angrier he even added some flames to the design like he'd see on a hot rod next he returns the mac-10s pipe style only this time with the mag-7 this one proved to be a huge challenge and it took many iterations before he was happy with it he also provided me with this early sketch to show how much it changed during its development the handle appears to have a mash which disguises the original grip texture again in a similar style he worked on this mp9 he gave the frame an organic looking shape and placed the pipes more chaotically it's all about taking advantage of the guns shape he particularly likes the little box part on the side and he used it to overlap the front pipes giving it an increased illusion of depth a side-by-side comparison really helps to highlight what's been done here as like I said before when the illusion is done this well it's easy to forget what shaped the models were originally this m3 for sports a different color scheme and style to the rest its created from an older design of his where he had previously dabbled with exposing the inner workings of the gun it was all based on a CAD model of the m4a4 which sadly didn't quite match up with the csgo version so some parts had to be manually adjusted in order to line up properly he also developed a v2 for this weapon sporting more detail and the classic red and black color scheme this USPS is a bolder more cartoony take on the exoskeleton concept he questioned whether the series was living up to its name so really focused on making a design that appeared more externally attached he deliberately gave her a more sketched look giving the shape black outlines as you'd expect to see in a cartoon of sorts he then made this for mass if you're anything like me then you're thinking there's a nice waves near the front of the model but those were there previously instead he looked at the 3d carrying handle over the top of the gun and extended this style back through the design he felt this internal rib like structure work similarly to his earlier bison skin but the smaller gaps sold the illusion of depth far better the latest of the pipe design is this UMP which sticks with the tried and tested formula but this time pushes it as far as he could to see how much he could get away with there's very little frame his mostly pipes and holes and they required a lot of fiddling to make it come together but he's pleased with the final result and I think he should be these skins have all been released in the last six months and he have come so far he hasn't been afraid to experiment with new styles it has also regularly returned to what worked previously developing it further in the process he has since worked on other styles one of which was the steagle moving away from pipes again towards slits and a new color scheme this is to date the latest in the collection was officially included in the prisoner case earlier this year though I wonder how many people would have noticed that this and the mac-10 were part of the same collection his 3d designs have been deemed worthy by valve and have proven popular with the community I can't wait to see where he goes from here thanks again to Dupree Co for showing me his collection and for sharing with me his story you can check out the exoskeleton collection in this video's description
