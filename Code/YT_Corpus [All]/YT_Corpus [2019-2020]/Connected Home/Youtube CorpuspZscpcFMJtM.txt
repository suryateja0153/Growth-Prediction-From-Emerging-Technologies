 hey I'm Julian Harris and I want to show you how Telus smart home security has made our family's life easier more connected and obviously safer as you know I'm all about creating an inviting and functional space when I'm designing and that includes how we've incorporated technology into our home as a family of four well six if you count the dogs we have a lot on the go so we need a system that we can control from anywhere whether we're snuggled up on the couch on a road trip on set or at work it is a control panel which is simple and sleek but the best part is I can control everything right from my phone we are constantly coming and going so I don't want to be heating the house or leaving the lights on on the ones home as a family we are trying so hard to be more conscious of our energy use so all you have to do is set up your preferences and you'll save energy and money every month so say you had to rush out the door which is really me every day now it's easy to check the Telus smart home app or to set the system automatically to lock your doors and shut off the lights it's really just one less thing you have to worry about another thing that I love is that I have the ability to control everything in my home remotely so for example I can open up the garage door when a package gets delivered so it's not sitting on the porch or I can open up the front door and let my friends and family in if they beat me home I'll just unlock the door for you you guys know that our dogs are just like our kids so this next feature is one of my faves we have a couple cameras set up inside so even if I'm traveling from work I can see what's going on at home sure it's also a great security feature but nothing is better than fusty not to impeach is sleeping in places that they shouldn't be hey nacho peaches get off the goat so there you have it those are just a few of the ways that tell us of our own security has made our lives way easier and I hope you two get to enjoy your own connected and secure home [Music]
