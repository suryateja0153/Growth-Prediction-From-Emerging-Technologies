 Hi it's Wendy Benson from 2x2 Health and today we're going to share a few tips with you on how we are trying to stay safe at home as we do distance learning and working from home. We try to go on a couple of walks outside and play a little bit of volleyball out in the yard. We have also been playing with our dog Murphy. We've tried some really great yoga videos and we really try to stay connected with our friends, neighbors and family members doing video conference calls and phone calls and from all of us at 2x2 Health, we wish you great confidence and health.
