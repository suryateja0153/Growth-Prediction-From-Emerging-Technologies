Holmes I've had to change the way they keep their residents connected to their families 516 ones Gabby Molina has this story so how you doing Debbie nice to see you keeping in touch without physical touch for families with loved ones at Glastonbury health care center visits look like this these days did you eat your breakfast today yes what was it it's not the same but window visits give both sides a sense of security since concerns about covin 19 have stopped visitors from being allowed inside at least she doesn't feel that she's left alone you know that we're still around and everything the idea for window visits started with one family who came to visit their loved one and it took off from there it's overwhelming they are very appreciative and I'm loving the fact that we're getting a great response from the public visits are now scheduled every day and some families say they visit multiple times a day even if it's just a check-in you got to do everything they tell you to so you can get strong and get home we want you home as soon as possible in addition to the window visits the staff uses technology to keep families connected facetiming we've done email blasts we've done conference calls but their love is felt most strongly in moments like these Steve are you press those pulls on a motor no no me like shiny no baby lovey nada oh no no no no in Glastonbury Gaby Melina Fox 61 news
