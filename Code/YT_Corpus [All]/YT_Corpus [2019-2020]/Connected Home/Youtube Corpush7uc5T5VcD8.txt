 right at the end of the year smart home enthusiasts got an early Christmas present with a massive announcement from Apple Google and Amazon they're working together on a single smart home standard called the project connected home over IP or chip after reading the news this was my initial reaction but what is chip and why is it such a big deal for the future of smart homes and why should you even care I'm Matt Farrell welcome to undecided If you've watched my channel with any regularity you know two things about me I like to dig into the how and the why of technologies that can impact our lives and two I'm a big fan of smart homes because they're far more than eye candy and smart phone parlor tricks they can add secured accessibility and help with energy conservation in any home but recommending smart home gadgets and setups is tricky I've often referred to the current state of smart home technology as being a bit of the Wild West every company is out for themselves creating systems that often don't talk to a competitor system which means consumers can often get left holding the bag it's why I'm very selective in the gear that I recommend on this channel the number one requirement is that it's easy to use and setup the second requirement is that it's safe and secure and the third is that it's cross-platform as it possibly can be and sometimes you have to make trade-offs on that last one to ensure the first two well with the announcement of chip it's looking like there may be a light at the end of the tunnel if it plays out like I hope it does we may have all three of those items addressed going forward the wild west may finally be tamed today we have several competing standards with protocols like ZigBee, thread, z-wave, bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi, works with nest, apple homekit, x10, Lutron ... you get the idea each of them have their pros and their cons start building out your smart home with one of these technologies but you need to branch out to another you're going to need to use some kind of bridge device or service and most often we're talking about like smart things or habitat or services like ifttt which is if this than that and like I said before it's the Wild West this makes for a very challenging user experience chip is aiming to put all of that behind us things like ZigBee thread Bluetooth Wi-Fi aren't going anywhere but there'll be a standard smart home communications protocol that operates amongst all of that so the devices can seamlessly talk to each other in theory if you buy a chip certified device from one company it'll be able to work with another chip certified device from a competitor for instance a smart thermostat would have a standard way to communicate temperature humidity and fan speed as well as to receive commands to adjust temperature or turn the fan on or off nest ecobee or honeywell shouldn't matter as long as they're all chip certified one of the most interesting things to me is that the heart of the effort is coming from the ZigBee Alliance Apple Google and Amazon those are some of the biggest players in smart homes today other partners include IKEA Legrand smart things and silicon labs the last one is even more interesting because Silicon Labs owns z-wave which is one of the other major smart home wireless standards today z-wave in theory is open sourced but Silicon Labs is the only company allowed to produce the z-wave wireless chips needed to make it work it's not exactly open a couple of days after the announcement of chip silicon labs announced that they were opening up z-wave to allow competitors to manufacture z-wave chips that move alone shows how massive chips impact on the industry may end up being Apple also has open source aspects of home kits ADK which is an assessment deployment kit which will make it easier for accessory makers to test out and experiment with home kit without needing to pay upfront and to quote Apple from their blog post about chip by open sourcing its home kit technology Apple will be helping to jumpstart the initiative and ultimately deliver an even better experience to customers starting today developers can use the home kit open source ADK to prototype non-commercial smart home accessories Apple will also contribute its home kit accessory protocol to the working group the siloed nature of current smart home technology has been holding it back I hear from a lot of people that they just don't get the appeal of smart home technology advertisers tend to focus heavily on the hey look I can turn my lights red by using my phone and that gives the perception that spark home technology is just eye candy and doesn't provide real value others have been burned by buying something that requires a specific app and setup to use and it can't talk to anything else in their house nobody wants to have to jump between a half-dozen different apps to configure things and the industry has finally woken up to the user experience challenges and is attempting to fix it they'll get a lot further working together instead of trying to maintain such strict silos this is the first smart home standard I've actually gotten excited about because of all the major players that are involved the system is abstracting and unifying the underlying communications between the devices that means companies like Apple Google Amazon can focus on creating engaging software experiences on top of that communications layer devices will just work and users will have a cohesive user experience using whatever software platform they're happiest with whether that's Amazon Apple Google smart things fill in your favorite platform here you know the gadget side of things it should simplify development and manufacturing a company doesn't have to design their own light bulb or smart thermostat to work specifically with Alexa Google Amazon or even smart things and they don't have to necessarily create their own app just to get things up and running they can focus on creating well-built smart home products this in theory should help to commoditize those products and drive down prices lowering development costs will lower final product cost and in the end we should hopefully see a wider variety of products in the market with a lower cost and a far better user experience and set up and use but what's the downside I see two possible issues first groups like this can get bogged down in corporate politics and infighting can slow down agreement on a final standard so while this sounds like it's a great concept on paper there's still a lot of details for the group to iron out they're hoping to have a finalized chip specification out by late 2020 which is great if they can stick to that timeline the world wide web consortium took years to finalize HTML five specification for websites it's not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison but standards bodies aren't known for their speed the second problem could be that it just adds to the mess of standards that are already out there instead of one specification to rule them all we just end up adding yet another this could manifest through half-hearted adoption of the standard and since the standardization will commoditize many smart home products like lights some manufacturers may want to hold back certain features and functions for their proprietary systems of software otherwise they could risk not standing out from the crowd and we've seen similar issues and web standards and browsers browser makers want to iterate and roll out new features that are part of the standard yet and developers start creating websites targeted at those browsers with non-standard HTML and CSS which makes other browsers not appear to be fully functional and you end up seeing websites that say things like best viewed in Chrome well that happened with this I hope not but will most likely see some non-standard half-hearted implementations along the way those potential pitfalls are far outweighed by the upside of this announcement the smart home industry has needed a shake-up something to pull the major players together in order to take Smart Homes truly mainstream it'll take a year or so for the standard to be agreed upon in a few more years to see a lot of chips certified products hitting the market but it's a start the timing of this announcement couldn't be better Wi-Fi 6 is a major leap over Wi-Fi 5 which is what we're all using today and one of the big reasons I tend not to recommend Wi-Fi smart home gear over ZigBee or z-wave is that most Wi-Fi routers can't handle a lot of devices connected at once most routers start to choke when they hit around 50 devices which is pretty easy when you start adding in things like lightbulbs and thermostats and door locks and even more to your home Wi-Fi 6 changes that by being able to handle 4 times the number of devices requiring less power from each device maintaining connection and it's also able to communicate with a dozen devices at the same time chip and Wi-Fi 6 strikes me as the perfect pairing it's the chocolate and peanut butter combo that could accelerate adopt and improve the smart-home experience does that mean we should hold off on buying gear until this stuff gets finalized no well there's still no information on upgrade ability of current devices to the new standard Apple Amazon and Google have all said they're not deprecating old devices everything that works today will continue to work into the future the chip announcement makes me even more bullish on smart home technology in general I'm looking forward to the day when I have a smart TV charger that can coordinate with my home's battery and solar panels to optimize my charging schedule to save me money all without me having to do anything other than plugging the car into the charger there are so many possibilities for how these devices can coordinate to save us energy money and make us safer now are any of you
