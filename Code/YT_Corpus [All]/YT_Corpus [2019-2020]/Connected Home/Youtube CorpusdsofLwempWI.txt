 Welcome to KinderTEK! KinderTEK is an iPad-based math program designed to teach young children the math skills they need to be successful in early elementary and beyond. This guide will help you get started using the classroom version of KinderTEK at home. If your child's teacher is using the app in the classroom and recommends home use, download KinderTEK Pro Connected from the app store. For home play families will need access to a working email address, an apple iPad, and reliable wi-fi. You must have a home account created by your child's teacher prior to first use. Once your child's teacher creates your account you will receive an email from KinderTEK with sign-up instructions. Once your account has been created, set your parent password using the email instructions. Then open the KinderTEK app on your iPad and touch Manage Users to view the login screen. Enter your username, your email, and your password to log in. Once logged in you will be able to see your student's three animal passcode for student login, as well as your student's progress in KinderTEK. To return to the home screen touch the Home button at the top left of your screen. Now your child is ready to play KinderTEK at home. They will use the three animal passcode to follow the student login process and KinderTEK play will begin where they left off in the classroom.
