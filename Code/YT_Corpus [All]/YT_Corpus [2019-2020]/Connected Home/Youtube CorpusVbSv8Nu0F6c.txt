 welcome to real living this is the 2020 Yale Asher SL it can lock automatically you can unlock it with the code it'll even talk to you how cool is that there's a Wi-Fi version and a z-wave plus version stay tuned hey smart homers Johnstone the DIY smart home guy here with another video in my smart door lock series all test results are available on my website DIY smart home guy comm or ACH be calm the air ball at the same place and below there is a link to playlists for all of my door-lock reviews Yale did send me the store log for a free but I ain't getting paid thanks for that yell by the way I do appreciate it I am gonna tell you what I really think and there are affiliate links down below so let's get into it we are here to talk about the Yale uh Sherlock SL smart door lock model y r-d 256 and it is the consumer version of the Yale pro SL model y r-d 156 that i reviewed a few weeks ago I'll point out some of the differences in this video first things first let's clear up some of the differences between the various y r-d 256 models because there are three of them actually there's four but I'll cover that in a second the first model that we are going to talk about is the wire D 256 - CBA which is the connected by August version it's a Wi-Fi lock that is compatible with exa Google home assistant and apple homekit the CBA model comes with the August connect puck and a Wi-Fi stick that plugs into this lock housing the connected by August version also supports virtual keys Airbnb and home away it also supports a door sense and Auto unlock on arrival that's what I'm excited about next up is the wired e 256 - I am one this is meant for the true Apple enthusiast that really doesn't care about getting the lock into the August app while it does have Bluetooth built in it doesn't support Auto unlock on arrival according to the Yale website and the third one that we're going to cover is the y r-d - five six - zw2 model which is a z-wave only model this is intended to be used with a z-wave hub like habitat wink and smart things amongst others this model is not compatible with home kit and also does not support Auto unlock on arrival would have been so easy I don't know why they didn't do it come on you're killing me what's the main difference between these locks the plug-in module the forth lock that I was talking about is a wired e 256 - in our that NR stands for no radio which means it is a keyless lock that supports the keypad entry so you'll be able to have most of these features available to you if you want to go radio s to the fun and that the yellow shirt SL comes in three finishes and according to my wife they are very sexy locks I've also seen literature stating that this is the thinnest smart lock on the market I mean it's pretty thin but it misses being the thinnest by a fraction of an edge come on it's close enough right the keypad is very sturdy and has this nice rubber gasket on the back to help prevent water from leaking in the interior plate has these guide pins to help align everything when you're installing the bolt itself is of the standard smart lock variety sporting the chamfered in four highly reliable locking with that let's cover the main features of the lock itself just like the y r-d 156 the yale assure SL is a keyless lock which means it provides an extra layer of security there's a 9-volt battery backup port on the bottom of the keypad in the event of internal battery failure which means you don't need a key the lock can hold up to 250 codes which is great for those Airbnb and HomeAway crowds now I only verified the 250 user codes on the z-wave side if you're using the connected by auguste model you'll have virtual keys Airbnb and home away integration there's a built-in auto relock option which can be disabled or set to a duration of several minutes in that connected by auguste app I see you can set it all the way up to 30 minutes if you wanted to a feature that's unique to the y r-d 256 when compared to that y r-d 156 is the privacy mode function which allows you to lock out all of the pin codes hold the privacy button for four seconds and none of the pin codes on work your hair is beautiful you can undo this by holding the button again for four seconds you can also disable OneTouch locking just like you can on that Y or D 156 there is also a keypad shutdown mode which disables the lock for 60 seconds if the wrong pin code was used or attempted five times in a row and what is the cost well the CBA models run between 250 and 300 dollars depending on the finish the zw2 and the IM ones come in around two hundred dollars but as always your mileage may vary let's get this thing installed the first thing to notice that you do not want to put the batteries in until after the lock is fully installed you've installed the radio module and you've ensured that the lock has free movement in the door and into the strike plate [Music] [Music] real [Music] after it's all together the first thing you'll need is a master passcode on the new lock do not and I mean do not try to pair this with the August app or your z-wave up until after you put in that master pin code as I always do I ran several tests on this lock in hopes of determining lock reliability here's how that went due to some constraints some of these tests were only performed with my z-wave network using both of ITAT and smart things but before I tell you the results I did notice that the lock didn't always send back the correct status it took me a while to figure out what was causing this I found that if you gently locked the lock the lock doesn't always fire back the lock status a jiggling of the thumbscrew trips the internal sensor and then the law correctly reports that status I'm pointing that out because there are certain times where this thing did not send the status back and my guess is that the motor wasn't driving it far enough to make contact with that sensor so some of these missed status reports are probably due to this the cycle test the lock I created this awesome rule in habitat that automatically cycles the lock it then tests the lock to see if the command was completed and compares that to if the lock actually responded with the correct stay then I can monitor the results in this dashboard and I'll explain a little bit better on my website how the reliability was actually calculated so what I get on the dashboard is the following the cycle testing through both habitat and smart things was consistently between 95.5 and 98.5 percent with the plus or minus range between 0.8 and 1.5 percent margin of error in all cases the lock did as commanded so I attribute the errors to the problem with the lock actually making contact with that internal micro switch to test out the keypad what I did is I set up ten different user codes and then I used the keypad to lock and unlock that lock 100 times here are those results from the keypad the results were essentially the same as through the hub since the motor is driving the bolt it's not surprising that it ran into the same problem at the same rate for both smart things and habitat if this is indeed a manufacturing problem you run into the same issue with the connected by August and im1 modules installed when activating from the thumb screw everything was 100% again no surprise there since I was actuated the thumb screw through the full cycle as always your mileage may vary this could just be something that's going on with my lock or it could be something systemic there's no way I can tell to test Jam alerts I simply block the bolt as it was trying to lock it tried to power through and then it gave this audible warning that it didn't lock it waited a second and that it tried again now if you have the audio feedback turned off you will not get that alarm as previously mentioned the auto unlock feature is only available on the connected by August version so you z-wave and im1 users are out of luck but since I have a CBA module let's check that out to test this feature I drove down to my local park which is about a half a mile away and I wanted to make sure that I can control the lock through the app so now we are going to lock it it shows right now to ask me how I'm enjoying the app I get sick and tired of you asked me if I'm joining your shirt right in the middle of you trying to use it stop doing that don't ask again okay so now I've got the message that says it's locked and there you got it same camera you can see that it's locked there's the kovat apocalypse warriors [Music] [Music] now remember the zw2 and the im1 do not have that Auto unlock feature but if you are running a z-wave hub or you're running an apple homekit there are going to be ways that you can get that type of capability working through your hub with a little magic I will cover that in a different video the yellow shirt SL has a relatively quiet locking motor this is the comparison with the Schlage connect series lock for powerful testing I removed one of the batteries and then I checked it with this 9-volt battery no she's there it was actually pretty simple and pretty cool overall I have to say I was very impressed with the Yale usher SL there were those problems with the status coming back but I'm not yeah I got a subscriber there who are the problems with the hose coming those status is coming back to the hub but I'm willing to look past that on this one just keep that stuff in mind for an ongoing comparison to other locks I've tested be sure to check out my law comparison page on my website as always I'll tell you everything that I know and don't forget to check out the DIY smart home guy Facebook group it's an ever-growing great place to ask questions for your particular situation lots of smart people are hanging out there you should too until next time Cheers [Music]
