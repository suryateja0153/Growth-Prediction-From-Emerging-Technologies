 holy Sh just happened JC somebody just drove into the house laptop I'm Anthony Carrino I've built and renovated hundreds of homes over the last decade my next project though is something very personal I'm taking an old firehouse in Jersey City and I'm converting it into a home my home this is the big TV the firehouse project all right guys so we've made some absolutely incredible progress here we are in the final week getting everything prepped for all the final inspections fine electrical final plumbing final fire and finally final building so while the guys are finishing up everything I am starting to get all my smart home stuff set up now I am a massive lover of tech more importantly I am a massive lover of tech that makes your life more efficient and with the advancements in home technology over the last five years I am so excited to integrate a number of these things into the firehouse so where do I start I start with my Wi-Fi network and I use arrow for that I'm gonna have over 40 devices on this network so I want it to not blink so what do we do we take for example I have Verizon FiOS I go into the router and I shut off the Wi-Fi connectivity from that router you take your arrow you plug it into the Verizon modem and then in the arrow app you go through the steps just set up your network it's very easy it I think I did it in about five minutes flat is a mesh network which means the devices overlap and it blankets your home in strong Wi-Fi so that you don't have any dead spots so that you don't have any weak signal spots so quite simply this is one of the Eero devices the nice thing about these guys is they plug directly into the wall so basically you just plug it in the lights gonna come on as soon as there's power to it go up here and now I'm gonna go ahead and get that connected to the network okay so now that we've got the ero Wi-Fi network set up it's time to install the devices that will make up my connected home so first things we are gonna get set up on the network are ring cameras I knew I was going to ring because I am an Amazon Alexa home ring works very well with the echos and the alexis and then I went and found a smart lock that works with the ring ecosystem as well and that was Schlage I am basing my home platform off of Amazon Alexa I am a big believer that voice is the future so everything that I've chosen to work in my home has some level of functionality through Amazon Alexa most of it has total functionality through Amazon Alexa so camera you can talk and listen also the siren comes out of that and then these here two LED lights and this is your motion sensor from the beginning Anton had talked about his house being Alexa ready specific outlets in specific areas to cover for his alexis for his echo screens it is as easy as that it is on the app so I'm just gonna run through hook up the rest of the cameras and I'll have everything online so when this all gets hooked up correctly the ring cams should show up directly on this screen first shade added to the system boom open Oh baby alright so we got the ring video doorbell elite we're gonna get that installed now great great looking doorbell when somebody rings this doorbell I'll get a video feed and then I'll be able to push one button within the ring app and it will unlock the Schlage lock to let people in this device is powered over an Ethernet cable so I had my electricians rung a cat6 cable from where I have my modems up in my office down to the doorbell location I knew I was was using this product from the beginning so I was able to design for it during the rough stages and the last but not least I'll get this introduced to the Amazon echo upstairs so that I can get the video feed directly on that device thank you back to the ring app your device doorbell this times that camera we see in our code front door so I do not have any doorbell that will ring in my house like a normal standard chime but if you do this will work with it so the only thing that will ring in my house is the echo upstairs and my phone and I'm good with that it's the wide-open door bell spinning yes done like that's ridiculously fast that is awesome oh that's sick leg order just came in and I had a little issue figuring out which one exactly worked with the ring system chatted with the folks at ring chatted with the folks ish leg and I think I got it figured out so gonna get these installed this is the flag in code Marbois which works with their app and should integrate nicely with the ring doorbells on the other side time we are secure so what you do is you download the key by Amazon app and you set up the flag lock through that app not through this leg home app what that does is because ring is owned by Amazon when you go into the ring app locks are listed within set up a device and then you can connect via key by Amazon you allow permission into the app and then you can control all locks on your property through the ring app ring and Schlage very happy with both of those choices all right so from the very beginning of this process I wanted to make sure I had a connected home the basis of everything is Amazon Alexa Alexa cancel so every light switch in this entire property our casita by Lutra they are Wi-Fi enabled light switches with caseta everything works like a normal light switch but I can also say Alexa run turn off upstairs lights and everything goes off at one time but the Tsarina shades by Lutron are connected by voice are connected by app not only can you control each and every individual switch but you can also create scenes so you can group a number of items together for example when we want to watch TV we say hey Alexa turn on TV lights it drops the window shades turns off a number of lights dims other lights and the scene is complete from there we've got temperature control so being as I selected trained to be my air handler in the space I went with the Trane thermostats because they have connectivity both to Amazon voice and through the Trane app next security followeth ring for my security cameras and for my door belt and then I worked with Schlage for all my door hardware throughout the entire property and specifically the schlagen code smart locks for access control and also on the access control front we've got the garage door opener from lift master it's the 8500 W it's got Wi-Fi built-in it's also got a battery backup built in so if you do lose power if there's a storm what-have-you you're gonna be able to open and close that garage door a few times on battery power which either allows you to get your car back into your residence or get out in an emergency one time I got locked out and I couldn't get in I'd only option I had was to call Anthony and he's got no problem go through the garage I said I can't I'll have a clicker and all of a sudden it was like the door opened next ring they are the security cameras we've got cameras around the property and I am so glad I installed these cuz look at what happened just a few weeks later [Applause] so at the end of the day I was able to share this video with my insurance company as proof for my claim and I was able to get this video over to the police department for me having a connected home means a lot more convenience and it needs to be that it's not technology just for technology's sake it is adding convenience to everyday life thinking about your connect at home during the design phase is a great way to approach it because it allows you to place any specialty outlets or additional electrical components that you want but don't forget you can always build your system over time this is all internet-based and you can continue to add products as your budget allows and before you know it you will have a fully connected home so absolutely every part of this home is connected and I love it coming up this season on the build TV we go room by room to show you
