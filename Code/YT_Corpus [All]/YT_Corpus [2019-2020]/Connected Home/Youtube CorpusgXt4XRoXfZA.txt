 Hi. Good day, everybody. Welcome to the Schneider Electric Wiser Smart Home! Come. Let me show you what we have. I'm home. Yeah, so welcome to Schneider Electric Wiser Smart Home. Alright, alright. I get it. I received an alarm. It's called a water leakage alarm. Okay, so when you detect water, this water leakage alarm will tell you: yes that's a water leakage. It's time to rectify the issue. We have one switch called the Free-locate, which is wirelessly controlled on your device. So let me see what I can do with this device. Check it out - this machine over there. I can control the light freely. The Wiser Hub. So this is the one that is controlling all your switches at home and all your sensors at home. And this is the reason why we can control all our devices using smart devices and voice control.
