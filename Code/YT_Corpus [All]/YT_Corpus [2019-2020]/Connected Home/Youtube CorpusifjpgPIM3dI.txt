 People say ‘Home is where the heart is’. It is a place to return to after a hard day at work, a busy morning in school, a place to rest from the buzz of the city. It is a place where families come together to share the best moments of life. These moments, made up of bright smiles, dreary tears and warm hugs, are what matter to me. And in life, I give my time to those that matter. I spend my time wisely, I make my daily activities easier, and I build my home the smarter way. A smart, connected home helps us to stay connected with each other, from the first step in. My smart home gives me the time to create more memories, to show that I care, to provide comfort and security to the people I love. Home is where I grow with the people I love, home is where I keep them safe. Home is where my heart is.
