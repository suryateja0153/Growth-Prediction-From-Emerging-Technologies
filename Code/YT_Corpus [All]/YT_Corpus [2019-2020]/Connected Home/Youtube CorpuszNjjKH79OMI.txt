 Let's talk about Audio Entertainment from Google. This is Nest Audio. It's a smart speaker that's all   about sound. "Hey Google, play my classical playlist."  It works in big rooms, kitchen rooms, rooms you're   not in. "Hey Google, turn it up." Or whatever room this  is. Ah, Beethoven just the way Beethoven intended.   And when you connect two Nest Audio speakers,  you get stereo sound. That's like two Beethovens! All right, say you're in the shower and you're  listening to something like that and you want   to keep listening while you're getting dressed.  "Hey Google, move the music to the bedroom speaker."   But let's say you really want to get the party  started. "Hey Google, play music on all my speakers."   You'd think a sound system for your whole home  would cost an arm and a leg, but with Google   it doesn't. Okay, this is getting a little loud.  Let's pause here for now. Boom. I know, cool right?   Google also lets you pick up where you left  off in your podcast, perfect for when you're   listening in the car and want to move things  to the living room when you get home. "Hey Google,   resume my podcast." "The hummingbird typically eats  about two to three times its own weight and food   every day." Wow! So yeah, listen to anything in  any room. That's Audio Entertainment from Google.
