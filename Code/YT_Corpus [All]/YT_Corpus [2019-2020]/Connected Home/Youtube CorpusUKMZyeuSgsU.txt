 we start right now with breaking updates on a terrifying case where a man is accused of coming into a home through an unlocked window and then sexually assaulting a woman beating and stabbing her and police think this morning's attack was random and they believe it's the same man wanted in a string of home break-ins from six weeks ago our veteran crime reporter Marc Becker just got new information on these cases in the past hour mark yeah police just held a briefing here Scott they tell us they're concerned and the public should be concerned too these are those five cases from back in May now they say there was a sixth one at a home in East Charlotte just this morning he came in police say through an unlocked window of the home on Briar Hill just after 4:00 this morning and tried to sexually assault a 38 year-old woman living there punching kicking and stabbing her in the arm before disappearing into the night and they believe he may be the same suspect who struck several times before we have someone out here that is going into houses where people are asleep captain Rob dance told us late this afternoon that this morning's attack look very much like five break-ins two homes in one Charlotte neighborhood back in the middle of May in those cases the suspect broke in but didn't try to assault any of the victims captain Dan says they're afraid now that this morning's attack took the violence to a new level this is a very serious offense and we're taking it that way and the community out there should take it that way too I didn't know anything about that because it's quiet over here for Angela Johnson and neighbors here on Briar Hill the chilling reality of what happened is still setting in she doesn't know the woman who was attacked but it doesn't matter she's a neighbor so sorry that that happened to her some need to be done about that you know like I said we don't have that on this we don't have any problems on the street I hope she gets better soon and I'm praying for her and her family and police are asking for information to help him find that suspect all they have though frankly is that he's a black male slender-billed he was wearing a mask in the attack last night and he's they say he matches the description of that attacker back in May as well Alison all right mark we hope someone comes forward with more clues police are also checking to see if the man in this attack is behind any other recent sexual assaults there have been five that police believe were random attacks just this month this map shows where each happened including this morning police have identified a suspect in one but the others are still unsolved sexual assaults involving strangers are extremely rare making this string of cases even more unsettling
