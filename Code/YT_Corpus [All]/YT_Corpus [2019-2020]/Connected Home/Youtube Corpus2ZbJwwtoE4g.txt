 YEARS AGO.  I CAN TELL YOU THAT NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND IN CONNECTION WITH THAT CASE. ANDY: THE LATEST CHAPTER IN THE SEARCH HAS LED TO ANOTHER DEAD END. STATE POLICE AND THE FBI DUG UP THE FLOOR OF A HOUSE ON ROUTE 12 IN HAVERHILL BUT FOUND NO EVIDENCE TIED TO HER MISSING PERSON’S CASE. MURRAY DISAPPEARED IN FEBRUARY 2004 AFTER CRASHING HER CAR NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT OF TODAY’S SEARCH. SHE MANAGED AND HAS NOT BEEN HEARD FROM SINCE.  SOME PRIVATE CITIZENS STATED THERE WAS A BODY IN FACT IN THAT HOME IN THE BASEMENT. ANDY: THE ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS THOSE PRIVATE CITIZENS-BASED THOSE THEORIES ON EVIDENCE FROM CADAVER DOGS AND GROUND PENETRATING RADAR. INVESTIGATORS HAD SEARCH THAT AREA BEFORE. -- SEARCHED THE AREA BEFORE. THEY FOUND WHAT HE CALLED DISTURBED GROUND.  WHAT HAPPENED TODAY IS A TEAM OF OVER A DOZEN AGENTS AND DETECTIVES WENT INTO THE BASEMENT, CUT THE AREA, REMOVED THE CONCRETE AND SEARCHED SEVERAL FEET DOWN AND COVERED THE ENTIRE AREA AND BEYOND. THEY LOCATED NOTHING OTHER THAN A SMALL PIECE OF WHAT LOOKS TO BE POTENTIALLY POTTERY OR PIPING. ANDY: DESPITE THE RESULTS, OFFICIALS WILL FOLLOW LEADS AND TRY TO SOLVE THIS 15-YEAR-OLD MYSTERY.  MESSAGE IS THE SAME, EVERYBODY INVOLVED REMAINS COMMITTED TO FOLLOWING EVERY LEAD THAT IS OUT THERE TO GET ANSWERS. ANDY: AUTHORITIES SAY THIS HAS BEEN HARD ON FAMILY AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AND FOLLOW ALL OF THE LEADS TO GET THE ANSWERS THEY NEED. REPORTING LIVE, ANDY HERSHBERGER, WMUR NEWS 9. JENNIFER: THIS IS THE LATEST CHAPTER IN A LONG AND TERRIBLE ORDEAL FOR THE MURRAY FAMILY. BUT THEY DO SAY TONIGHT, THEY WILL NOT GIVE UP HOPE. WMUR’S JENNIFER CROMPTON SPOKE WITH MAURA’S BROTHER AND FATHER TODAY. JENNIFER C.: LOVED ONES HAVE BEEN HERE ALL DAY. THEY ARRIVED EARLY THIS MORNING. ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT IN A LONG AND VERY PAINFUL JOURNEY FOR HER FAMILY. FAMILY WAITED ALONG ROUTE 112 IN NORTH HAVERHILL, AN AREA THEY KNOW TOO WELL, YET AGAIN HOPING FOR CLOSURE. FEBRUARY 9, 2004, SHE WENT MISSING.  IT IS TOUGH BECAUSE THE ANSWERS ARE HARD TO COME BY. YOU CAN ONLY BE TOLD SO MUCH. JENNIFER C.: THEY SEARCHED NEAR WHERE HER CRASHED CAR WAS FOUND THAT NIGHT. THE FATHER SAYS INFORMANTS TOLD HIM 14 YEARS AGO A BODY WAS BURIED INSIDE THIS HOUSE. ITS NEW OWNERS, LETTING HIS OWN INVESTIGATORS AND AUTHORITIES INSIDE.  DIG UNTIL YOU FIND HER, THAT IS MY ATTITUDE. THERE ARE THREE DOG HITS IN THE SAME SPOT AND RADAR HERE, SO THERE IS SOMETHING THERE. I THINK IT IS MY DAUGHTER. JENNIFER C.: AND THIS AFTERNOON, INVESTIGATORS FOUND NOTHING. NOT WITH THE FAMILY HOPED TO HEAR.  I THOUGHT WE FINALLY HAD IT. THIS ONE IS WORSE THAN THE OTHER FALSE ALARMS AND DEAD ENDS. JENNIFER C.: HE SAID THIS WHEN ASKED WHAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER.  SHE WANTS TO COME HOME AND BE BURIED IN HER HOMETOWN, AND SHE CAN’T BE BURIED UP HERE. AND I NEED HELP. JENNIFER C.: FRED MURRAY HAS ASKED THE FBI TO TAKE THIS ON FULL TIME. HE KNOWS IT WON’T HAPPEN BUT HE IS NOT GIVING UP ON HIS DAUGHTER. THE STR
