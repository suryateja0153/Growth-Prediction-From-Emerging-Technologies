 if your smart home device or system is on this list today then it is about to die or I believe it will disappear in 2020 hello Automators thanks for tuning in again I'm Brian from automate your life and today I'm going to take the frustration out of automation or in some cases add to the frustration but I'm also going to tell you what I believe is the best path forward with any of these products that are at end-of-life so let's go Philips Hue and their Gen 1 Hub is the easy one that people get upset about because they are ending support for their V1 bridge on April 30th 2020 now that means that you need a V2 bridge in order to continue forward with the platform for ever basically now there are some specifics about this that I think you should understand and then we'll talk about what I recommend for you what's interesting is the v1 will stop receiving updates and it will stop being able to connect remotely but it will still be able to complete localized control with most of your existing Philips Hue product the v2 bridge Philips has said basically they learn from their mistakes with the v1 bridge and the v2 is essentially future-proof now this is one of the reasons that I recommend the v2 bridge they've been talking about this in different ways for a little while about how ready that bridge was for going forward in your smart home now there are some promotions out there for basically buying the bridge or getting the bridge for free if you're a v1 user so look for that if you have that because my recommendation is that you can continue to use that v1 bridge but you will lose some of those remote functions and I think that will become frustrating the other component to this is older versions of bulbs and ZigBee and not getting your updates through that could leave you open to security risks and we have seen recently some of those bulbs being vulnerable to security risks to getting into your overall home network now this one hit the news very quickly and a lot of people got upset and then the company reversed but there's still some other component to this that are very important now the Sonos bricking whatever this was called the whole idea where they were going to ask you to brick a Sonos device which starts their e-cycling program and then you send it in you get 30% off a new Sonos device the intention behind this was essentially what Philips just did because some of their existing speakers are not future proof they're not ready for the new operating system they're not ready for the Sonos as to application that is coming out so what you are going to see is actually a breakup I think of this system now all the details aren't available yet but this is affecting speakers that went all the way from 2006 to 2015 lots of those are not going to be able to continue in the new framework the new capabilities and the new features that we're seeing come out from Sonos my advice is that you only start the upgrade path to the new s2 application or start trading in your speakers for that 30% discount if you're ready to move your entire sonu system because this will essentially split your Sonos speakers the works with nest program is still ending guys no matter what Google says they are slowly phasing that out and moving on to works with Google Assistant now I've been committed to guiding you through the end of this program as best we can here on automate your life and so my advice for this as it ends as this program comes to its end still we are not seeing any reason to really move on other than the additional security that you get with Google accounts over the Nest accounts now Nest accounts now have two-factor authentication so I'm not too worried about the security behind your nest account but there are additional reasons to move on to the Google accounts now still I am not recommending that you go and update your Nest account to a Google account and Google has actually relaxed some of the rules around this I recently did an installation of a Nest thermostat it didn't require the changing of the account for the person into a Google account so they have actually relaxed some of those initial conditions that they had around changing your account to Google home account so hold on for dear life if you are one of the three or four people on the planet using Cortana to actually control your smart home through your PC that is about to go away entirely they are going to focus Cortana entirely on things like office 365 what is the supposedly placement for this is Amazon's voice assistant on your Windows 10 PC but unfortunately that is not going to be available in many countries or it's not yet available in many countries so you probably won't have a replacement there are a lot of indicators around the wink platform that say it is near its and now they have had cash problems they have had ownership changes a lot of times and really if you just go onto their website they haven't posted a blog post since August of 2019 and they don't have any of the wink to hub and haven't for a long time on their store page now my recommendation around you folks who own a Wink or a Wink 2 hub that is basically you know it's probably time to move on but you don't have to and I think the reason behind that is it's not a big target for security or kind of those network related issues that we've seen with other larger platforms there's just not that many users out there so it's not as big a target but I do think it is probably getting close to time to move on if you do decide to make the jump my recommendations are always smart things and habitats and I'll leave links down below to those too smart home hubs you will need to exclude all of your z-wave devices if you've used those before you move over here Osram light if I is shutting down their service as of August 2021 so we have a lot of time here before those go away but this is their cloud service that they're talking about so for all intents and purposes those bulbs at that time that are connected directly to their hub done for but the good news with this is these are ZigBee bulbs that you're mostly talking about and so they can be connected to other platforms so I would start the process of actually migrating those across to a different system so you don't even feel this bump in the road and you don't even need to be notified so you can directly connect those now instead to other hubs for your own personal security and privacy this might be the most important update I give today now Android seven devices anything Android seven and older at this point they are not receiving any new security patches they are not being upgraded in any way and at least not from Google now what you can have a look at is whether or not your ISP or whoever provided or manufactured the device whether or not they have an upgrade beyond Android seven if they do go do that right now because there are a number of different softwares and malware's out there that can pull a lot of data and a lot of your personal information out of those devices now there you go guys that's all of the devices that I've been able to pull together there might be one that you've seen that is appearing to be dying or is dead already and you want to talk about that leave that down in the comments below otherwise go check out our smart home news here as we do that every week on Sunday we give you the latest updates and features from your favorite smart home products otherwise guys thanks for watching and of course don't hate
