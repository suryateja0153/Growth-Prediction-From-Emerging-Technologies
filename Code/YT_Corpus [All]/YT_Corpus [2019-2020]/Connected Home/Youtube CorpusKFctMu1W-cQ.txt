 What does "home" mean to me? It's where I want to be after a long day at work ... ... a sanctuary from all the noise and the stress. It's a place where the people who matter most to me ... ... are all under the same roof ... ... in an environment we can all control. It's where I know they're looked after ... ... protected ... ... even if it's from themselves. I need my home to be accommodating ... ... to be smarter ... ... to make life easier and more connected for everyone. Where we all feel safe and secure. Home ... ... it's a lot of things ... ... but for me, it really is... ... where the heart is.
