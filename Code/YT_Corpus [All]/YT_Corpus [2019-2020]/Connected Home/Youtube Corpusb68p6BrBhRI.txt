 Hello, I am Dr. Jeff Gold, and I have the honor of serving as the chancellor of the Med Center and UNO. And I am with you today to say stay home, stay healthy and stay connected with others. As this COVID virus spreads across the United States through our rural and urban communities, we all have the responsibliity to not only protect ourselves, our families, our friends, our loved ones, to protect those that we do not know as well. This has to do with social distancing, handwashing, maintaining the six-foot limits and, of course, staying home if you feel ill. Call your health care professional if you need to. But the most important thing to remember is that we are going to get through this together, but we will get through it better, safer and faster if we all follow these rules. Thanks so much.
