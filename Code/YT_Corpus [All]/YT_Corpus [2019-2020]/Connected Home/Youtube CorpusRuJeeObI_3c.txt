 Welcome to your FightCamp—a fully equipped studio boxing gym combined with a growing library of powerful and motivating workouts, led by the best trainers in the U.S., brought directly into your home, on your schedule. Your FightCamp is outfitted with everything you will need, and includes the same high-tech training technology used by many of the world's elite fighters. The FightCamp Punch Trackers measure and display all of your punch stats in real time, and these stats are core to your fight camp experience. Simply connect the Punch Trackers to the FightCamp app to gain access to a growing library of interactive workouts ranging from 15 to 45 minutes in length. When you start a FightCamp workout, you're transported into the center of a world-class studio boxing experience. Every workout includes three-minute rounds with one-minute rest periods in between rounds. Your trainer will introduce the punch combos and exercises at the beginning of every round, and this information is also displayed on screen for you to reference during the workout. Real-time punch stats are also visible on screen, and with every round you're encouraged to hit a minimum punch goal. Your trainers are not shy about reminding you — " punch count is 60, y'all." After your workout has been completed, these stats are saved on the FightCamp app so that you can benchmark yourself and push towards new personal bests. With multiple new workouts added every week, ranging from beginner level to advanced, FightCamp's library offers something for everyone. If you're coming into FightCamp with little-to-no boxing experience, our 10-week Prospect Path will walk you through a number of tutorial videos and beginner-level workouts designed to teach you the basics, while making you sweat. For those coming in with prior experience, FightCamp's intermediate and advanced-level workouts include fun and challenging punch combinations put together by our experts— —all former competitive fighters with decades of combined group fitness experience. So what are you waiting for? Thousands of home fighters are already loving FightCamp, we know you will, too.
