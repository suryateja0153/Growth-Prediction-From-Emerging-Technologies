 hi I'm William Seymour and today I'm going to be presenting our paper on informing the design of privacy empowering tools for the connected home when we think about conceptualizations of the home we often see it as a refuge that we can retreat to you and be ourselves a personal castle amongst other things the home serves is an important space in which to decompress somewhere where no one is watching or judging you indeed when you invite someone into your home there's still usually a demarcation between public and private guests don't have the run of the house of to be invited through the front door however slowly but surely that's beginning to change and I don't mean that people are going to start wandering into your house well at least not natural persons increasingly popular smart devices of brilliant in that they allow us to automate tasks around the house access information with little effort and can entertain us some of Alexis jokes are even funny but in order to get access to this you need to accept devices and their turns into your home this often involves capturing interactions analyzing what you say mapping your house or having access to your smartphone part of the issue is that people aren't aware of what's going on and to this end there's a lot of media coverage about devices that capture and sometimes also leaked private and intimate information studies that observe and show disclosures from people's apps usually find that the initial response is feeling creeped out or outright shocked even though there's a background awareness of privacy and security problems seeing what's happening to you in your home is powerful but quickly this shock turns into a dejected acceptance it's the same for everyone I have nothing to hide it's too late to do anything about it or I can't do anything about it when we consider the reasons why this is a hard problem to navigate and reason about there are three main issues that need to be addressed firstly you need to have detailed specific knowledge about what the devices in your home are doing and the companies that they're talking with you can't do much about what you don't know secondly you need an understanding the bigger picture why do companies make devices that do this are all disclosures equally bad what about data that goes to different jurisdictions this kind of education is something that doesn't come up very often although here in the UK at least we're beginning to see educational resources and schools that talk about the architectures and infrastructures that enable connected devices okay so you know what your devices are doing you have a pretty good understanding of why things are happening and you find something you don't like if you want to be able to do something about your privacy then you need to have effective levers you can pull either to tell devices to stop collecting and sharing or to make them and need all three of these together it's not enough to only give people powerful tools or to educate them without the tools to make changes in fact this is exactly what leads to the dejected and downtrodden mindset that we saw earlier I bet what's happening is bad and even if I knew I wouldn't be able to change it with this in mind we set out to explore potential solutions using what we call privacy empowering technologies through the use of a technology probe technology probes are artifacts that are sent out into the unknown in order to see how people engage with the topic during everyday life our probe was created to answer a social science questions about how people think about their connected privacy and what concerns they have engineering questions regarding the data you need to do this and the feasibility of doing so with today's devices and design questions about what features and representations work in this context the probe called aretha like our ESP ECT nevermind the Aretha probe combines each of these three pillars to see how they might impact the ways that families engage with privacy and connected homes the Aretha software is run on a mini PC attached to a keyboard a mouse this is unsaturated somewhere prominent in the home and connected to the Internet devices can be connected to ethers Wi-Fi hotspot and traffic to and from those devices is analyzed before being forwarded to the Internet the Arista software is open source and you can find it on github with this in mind our first design goal was to make are--this visualizations of homework net home network traffic clear and easy to interpret we wanted to give users facts about how their devices were communicating over time as seen here in terms of traffic volume per device and per external company but also in aggregate a view which was intended to present a sort of privacy risk profile for the household this view also shows the geographic location of data destinations to back up this specific knowledge about what devices are doing aretha also needed to help give context about how and why their devices operate as they do we combined existing resources from organizations such as the BBC with our own content to create a curriculum that participants completed during the study and these were illustrated with examples dynamically taken from each participants network traffic finally the probe needed to give people accessible and effective controls to manage their information flows we elected to include a firewall style rule system whereby aretha would translate high-level directives such as block all traffic from my iphone to facebook into lower-level directives that the system could enforce on the traffic passing through it to test the profile permit software we conducted a pilot deployment at the UK's Building Research Establishment in a fully equipped smart home 14 members of the public were invited to try aretha and give feedback which informed the final version of the software after a period of recruitment we selected three participant households with a variety of inhabitants devices and technical knowledge we deployed the probe in these participants households for six weeks initial visits included an entry interview to establish what participants currently thought about online privacy what devices they had as well as a discussion about what data the probe would be collecting we then installed the equipment and helped participants to connect their devices for the first two weeks the probe operated passively only showing visualizations of network traffic after two weeks we enabled the educational curriculum and asked participants to complete a short session every other day we also conducted a brief check-in interview to capture responses that might otherwise be forgotten by the end of the study after another two weeks the firewalk control was no board along with another check-in finally at the end of the study we visited the households again to conduct an exit interview here we asked about participants experiences during the study how they thought that perceptions and practices had changed and what their responses were their initial statements about privacy and smart devices we also asked them what additional features they wanted to see on subsequent iterations of the probe to researchers independently performed thematic analysis on the interview transcripts meeting to review and merge themes to arrive at the final analysis when analyzing the data we also triangulated events from the interviews with Network traces collected by the probe all of the materials of the study can be found on the Open Science framework all three of our households participated in the entirety of the study during which the probe collected Network traces each time devices connected to the Internet four main themes arose during the analysis shown on the left here which I'll now go over in depth over the six weeks of the study we saw how our participants in their families developed their conceptions of what privacy was beginning with vague references to abstract threats by the time of the exit interview they'd begun to use concepts in vocabulary learned from the curriculum to describe the context that their household might face online the increased awareness of data flow is given by the probe combined with underlying knowledge from the curriculum highlight the decisions that would previously have been ignored this in turn changed the way that the probe visualizations were interpreted such as how P 2 came to realize that over half the data from his devices were sent outside the EU raising questions about how this might affect legal protections given under the ge PR we also saw how the concerns of participants became much more personalized during the study P 1 used knowledge and information from the probe to devise an in-depth strategy for investigating the companies appearing on the display including corporate structure and connections and this helped him to align his device usage with his values the curriculum content as well as the background theme of data disclosures generated by the visualizations prompted p3 to review other aspects of our online privacy measures such as preventing account details being shared outside of the family turned out to be easy steps that could take as a household that would otherwise have gone unnoticed indeed as the story progressed other members of our participants households began to express an interest in the probe and we found that it became a common feature so a common frame of reference for discussions about privacy and security sometimes this involved building mental models through immediate feedback offered by the probe and using the visualizations to associate online activities with data disclosures other times members of the household would use the probe to hold each other to account over what was happening on the home network finally conducting a home deployment for grounded a number of issues around the privacy the use of privacy empowering tools in a busy home environment participants were extremely hesitant to use the firewall controls offered by the probe worried that it might break things in ways that weren't understandable or there wouldn't become apparent until hours or days after entering a new rule when they might not have time to fix it amongst the hectic reality of family life this was made worse by the perceived interconnectedness of many surfaces it wasn't clear of disabling traffic to one company would break online experiences with others that use their services Sarah visiting the design goals of the study there was good evidence to suggest that participant households gained significant awareness of data disclosures by their devices in fact they began to request additional features that would allow them to learn more such as indications about the content of disclosures despite the fact that 74% of the traffic from our participants households was concentrated in the top three companies there was a clear bias towards concerns about breadth of disclosure over depth this highlights familiarity as an important factor in our participants threat analysis with the top traffic destinations largely considered known quantities the curriculum content did help to make this data more intelligible for our participants but other factors prevented success in some of the households such as p3s decision to delegate part of the learning process to their partner it was usually responsible for managing technology in the house finally it was clear that the firewall controls offered by Aretha failed to help participants action their newly formed privacy preferences but participants did take this opportunity to develop their own means of control such as p1s research strategy or help III started conversations about family accounts and who they should be shared with in terms of limitations the exploratory nature of the pro made us up for a smaller number of in-depth case studies in order to give a more holistic understanding of how similar privacy empowering technologies might be used in the wild but being self selecting early adopters they were clearly not representative I also want to point out that this configuration of the probe is not the only one and given the responses to the firewall it clearly wasn't the best in the spirit of technology of the technology probe methodology I'd suggest that it serve instead is inspiration for future for privacy empowering tools so to sum up Aretha was successful in helping us understand how people can understand and interact with their connected devices in the context of privacy empowering technologies even though it didn't meet all of the design goals the shortcomings of the firewall were instructive in their own way Aretha also serves as a reminder that there are other ways to engineer the connected home and even if devices do behave themselves users might want their own way of verifying this the results of the probe study are also cause for encouragement showing that provided with the right tools and scaffolding people can engage and formulate their own privacy preferences and strategies so thank you for listening if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them via email
