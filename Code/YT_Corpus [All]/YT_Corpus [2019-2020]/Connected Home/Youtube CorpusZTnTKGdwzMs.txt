 hello Automators, thanks for tuning in again. Every week I get questions about which wireless protocol to use in your smart home or to basically start your smart home and if you already have some in your smart home how to continue to move forward and what's the best technology that we use now obviously for new home kind of new smart home people you're going to struggle with what these are in general so today what I'm answering is basically z-wave versus ZigBee versus Wi-Fi and I'm going to give you a breakdown of those technologies and what I think is the best use case going forward for your home before we go too far forward I want to tell you about a new thing we've started here on the channel now in case you don't know I'm now full time as a content creator what that means is I have more time and space and ability to create more and deeper content for you this video is an example of how deep and how detailed we can get and also how easy we can make for you to go ahead and make purchasing decisions so what we've done is we've created a patreon channel so if you don't know what patreon is you can basically pledge to creators on a monthly basis at a number of different levels and I've set up a number of different levels over on patreon and that means you can basically pledge to us but what I'll tell you is I'm not just looking for your donations I want to give you something back and I want to start to share basically my knowledge at a deeper level for those people who want it and for those people who are just getting into it this is a really great tool and set of resources for you so check the link below and let's move on to the comparison here the first thing to talk about is what these protocols are so z-wave and ZigBee are specially created protocols are standards basically for smart home communication so they're intended to be wireless communication and they allow our smart home devices to pass information back and forth so when you ask for a smart light to turn on it will using one of those protocols and it could be using Wi-Fi z-wave or ZigBee at this point to go ahead and cause that action to occur and it uses the same protocol to feedback the status essentially okay I'm on at this percent that you asked for so that's what these protocols all do now there's a bit of a difference inherently to how we've been using Wi-Fi versus ZigBee and z-wave z-wave and ZigBee are both what are called mesh networks now that means that different devices within that network can actually be hoppers to send communication down so on a ZigBee or a z-wave that network basically if you have a device that is a repeater it can send those messages on and send the messages back and so these networks tend to be relatively robust when we compared to the original ways we used Wi-Fi and if you remember the early days of Wi-Fi if you're old like me then you'll remember basically one router and out to all of your devices and the coverage essentially was based on that routers transmission power so you know that's what the old Wi-Fi is now we have Wi-Fi mesh network so you can see the Google home Wi-Fi mesh setups you know those are a great example where you'll have three devices in a home and they will be mesh networked essentially to all of your different Wi-Fi devices giving you in the case of Google's where they sell you the 3-pack you'd have three different routers essentially all on the same network where we start to see additional differences is in what's called the carrier frequency now the carrier frequency is the speed of the wave that travels through the air that will carry the signal so the ones in the zeros essentially that are being transmitted back and forth in a z-wave network we're in the 800 to 900 megahertz band and what you might might remember then again this is kind of if you're as old as me lots of the cordless phones early on where in that 900 megahertz band so those can actually interfere with a z-wave although generally when you hear people talk about smart home and and smart home communication z-wave is less interfered with because there are less of those cordless phones around but if you do have that that's an important piece for you to keep in mind ZigBee on the other hand is in what's called a 2.4 gigahertz range and that means when you look at Wi-Fi which has traditionally been in the 2.4 gigahertz range as well those two can interfere with each other now we'll talk about that in more detail as we get further and further but what also happens is Wi-Fi now has the ability to be in the 5 gigahertz band so you have lots of dual band routers out there they give you the opportunity to be at two point four or five gigahertz if you're having trouble at that 2.4 gigahertz range as we talked about these three wireless protocols then we need to talk about a comparison in terms of security what I'll tell you without getting really really deep into the details is all of these protocols have at least 128 bit encryption on them so you can go above and beyond in some cases and especially in the world of Wi-Fi there's lots of different encryption protocols and things that you can use to increase your security passwords are obviously the most important piece of that security because honestly as humans we're a little bit easier to crack than the average 128 bit encryption key set so you know on the ZigBee side there's one thing that generally people talk about about it being less secure than z-wave and that's a physical button press so essentially you know if you've used the easy setup process on your wireless routers where you press a button and then you press a button on your router and then the to pair and you never had to put in a password that's kind of what I'm talking about when I talk about ZigBee not requiring that they don't require a physical connection so time's that's accepted as being less secure than what z-wave requires and in general what your wireless signal requires as well being that these are wireless protocols we still have to talk about a few more things now number one how far can they transmit z-wave is generally accepted to transmit up to 100 meters so that's an incredible distance and I think if you're talking about a rural situation where you want to get a connected device out in say a barn or an external garage and I have lots of those around kind of where I live lots of people have those and so getting a sensor a motion sensor or a water sensor out that far could be a challenge with ZigBee which is generally accepted to be 10 to 30 meters now 10 to 30 meters again you have to remember these are mesh networks so if you have a mesh device or a mesh repeating device that towards the end of your home and you want to go 30 meters across to your garage you should be good to do that the the range tends to shorten when there's more physical walls in the way or heavier kind of thicker walls as well so you know that's generally accepted for that transmission distance z-wave is obviously a much further distance and that's get that's because of the lower frequency range that it uses actually continuing on there's a massive massive differential in terms of how many devices you can comfortably put on these networks and so z-wave this is where we start to see the tide turn a little bit for z-wave they can get up to a maximum of 232 z-wave connected devices now right now you'd think that's that's a ton like forget it why would I ever have 232 z-wave devices I'll talk about that a little bit later now on on the flip side ZigBee is capable of 65,000 devices being on the network and I'll tell you by the time you're getting anywhere near that you have bandwidth problems as is you have network problems as is there's just too much traffic going on so we're not going to get to that on the flip side Wi-Fi can be a very high differential between high end routers and low end routers so you really have to think about that what I mean by that is you know a low end router having 10 to 20 devices like a Google home hub laptops computers and you know other devices that use high bandwidth like iPads and iPhones 10 to 20 devices on that network at any given time for a lower-end router is probably going to be your maximum it starts to extend when we talk about a Wi-Fi light bulb because of Wi-Fi light bulb is not constantly needing to broadcast or receive transmissions they're not always going through an update process so those don't necessarily count I treat them as kind of a third or a quarter of a device in general but having so many can be a struggle for some of those earlier or cheaper routers out there as you get more expensive and we talked about the mesh Wi-Fi router systems and I'll get to a new technology that really changes this as well but as we get to that those those higher-end mesh router systems I'm thinking sixty to a hundred Wi-Fi products is not out of the realm of prop of possibility here with current day technology now as I said I'm going to get to a new technology that changes that number as well towards the end of the video here there's a major difference in how these different standards are being basically managed throughout the industry so wireless or Wi-Fi and ZigBee are both managed more like what I'd say standards are managed but like in the industry so Wireless is obviously a standard the 802 dot 11 all the different versions of 802 dot 11 that standard has been managed for many many years and again I can think way back to when we were starting with like a and minh aliy we had the G protocols and the B protocols and those were those were big big news back then but those have evolved over time and we're now at a protocol called a tow 2.11 8x and that's the new technology that i'm going to talk to you about in a minute but ZigBee has also managed a lot like a standard so you can you can go look at their standard for how to implement a ZigBee device it's very open and this allows some companies like Philips has done to create proprietary versions to keep you within their system and again we're gonna talk about that but what it does also is it leaves ZigBee protocol in the hands of many and the difference with z-wave is that is a proprietary owned protocol and standard so on their website literally if you have gone through the wrong steps or you've used their standard or their protocol without getting certification they will say if it's tantamount to IP theft intellectual property theft so you actually have to work with that company and the z-wave Alliance to make sure that your device meets their specifications and you have a certification from them now ZigBee requires certification as well to be called as a B device but again having it proprietary on that z-wave protocol to me what that means is that protocol is in the hands of the few whereas Wireless and ZigBee are constantly evolving and are in the hands of many and that's a big differential for me as we go forward in terms of picking a protocol as we talk about these wireless standards we have to talk about what those different frequencies mean so at 2.4 gigahertz what you have is a higher frequency which means more capability to transmit data and the lower frequency of z-wave that means it can transfer less data and how does this impact you well as we go forward if we think about the connected home and really creating automation that's smart you know today I can't necessarily get something like current every second or every half second from my smart home devices so if I want to use the current going through a light bulb or say my oven or say whatever appliance I have in my home right now I probably couldn't get that fast and accurate data from z-wave and you know ZigBee is probably going to be able to do that and because it's at that higher frequency it's going to be able to provide you a little more data but what's that what that is going to do is utilize that ZigBee Network more and more as we get more constantly on or consistently on data sources here in the smart home so the only protocol that's really being built to manage this is Wireless so over time and this is part of that new technology discussion that 802 11 a X protocol is specifically built to increase the number of streams and the number of essentially on connections that they can use the number of channels that they have so the number of different connections that they can create and utilize and not be interfered with on the wireless band so what this means is Wireless is being set up your Wi-Fi standard is being set up specifically for the connected home and over time here what we're going to see is that continue to get better and better so let me give you an example of the upgrades from 802 11 AC to 802 11 ax so one of the upgrades here and this is specifically intended to help people who are in hotels have you ever been in the hotel where they had where they say they have wireless you get there in the evening you're sitting down you go nothing's working because basically you've run out of connected streams or you're not able to maintain a connected stream because the router having to constantly switch who and what it's connected to now the new ax protocol is intended to create longer packets so that means more information is transferred in a single packet that's very important because then it's one handshake to exchange more information on top of that it is now capable of up to eight streams of connection per essentially a toe 2.11 ax transmitter receiver so that's up from I believe it's four in AC and so they basically doubled that what they've also been able to do is increase the the capability or the bandwidth of each of those streams by a factor of four so that's an incredible amount of throughput increase just on essentially one upgrade of the wireless network standard now how does that translate to you well that means that you're going to be able to have say today we talked about kind of that ten to twenty those high bandwidth or high utilizing products you're going to be comfortable with a factor of I would say anywhere from two to 16 times more products depending on how much bandwidth you're using all the time on your wireless network so that gives you a factor of two - I can't even do the math in my head but it's somewhere near 600 different devices just on that protocol jump alone so again that's 600 devices what I'm talking about there is devices like bulbs if you really wanted to put that many bulbs in your home that many smart home bulbs you could probably do that with an ax system and 802 dot eleven ax system on a mesh router system you could probably get to that level now so with all of this said where does that leave you as the smart home owner or the smart home builder so you're building your new system let's talk about that situation right now ZigBee and z-wave are still ahead in terms of devices like these sensors here so these are Samsung smartthings sensors and this gives you the ability to use z-wave or ZigBee protocol so the Samsung smartthings hub and the wink hub - for that matter those are dual protocol capable hubs so you're going to need a hub with a z-wave or a ZigBee device and with Samsung smartthings what I like about them is they have lots of these battery devices and they connect to lots of external vendors that you ZigBee protocol so here's an example mice angled element light bulbs here and these are the the classic bulbs they're a ZigBee protocol bulb that means they connect to Samsung smartthings directly I don't need another hubs so I still think it's worth it and I will talk to you about that interference that we talked about here between ZigBee and wireless protocols but what I'm saying in general is that having a ZigBee hub in your home is very beneficial still today and I think it's still worth it I wouldn't go spending thousands and thousands of dollars in the ZigBee protocol necessarily but I think to go and you know spend 300 to $500 to get a security system in your home to get a lot of connected bulbs in your home I think that's worth it under Samsung smartthings the wink hub - or another ZigBee hub like the Amazon echo plus - and the echo plus is a very important device to talk about when we talk about wireless versus ZigBee and how that interference all goes so the echo plus both the first and the second generation devices have a ZigBee hub onboard and and for that matter so does the echo show the new echo show here they have a ZigBee hub onboard so they're able to directly connect to these Samsung smartthings sensors the single bulbs that I talked to you about lots of ZigBee products they can connect directly to now what also important to notice this is a wireless receiving and the the device is capable of putting out a wireless network we know because it creates a wireless network during setup so they have both a wireless transmitter and a ZigBee transmitter onboard the echo plus so how bad can that interference be if Amazon can utilize both of those networks on the same device because in a lot of cases when we're talking about network interference we're talking about devices being too close to each other broadcasting at the same time and the waves essentially cancelling each other out so what I'm telling you is it's not that bad ZigBee and wireless can coexist and they do in my house on over it's almost a hundred devices now in my home that I have for ZigBee and wireless protocols going at the same time when we talk about this what I'm telling you ultimately is that ziwei ZigBee sorry and wireless protocols they're not that bad together if they can do it on this device and I have upwards of a hundred devices now in my home between ZigBee and wireless devices there in my smart home then it's not that bad guys and you can go ahead and comfortably do that so what am i recommending if you're starting out I'm saying start with wireless and ZigBee so make sure you get yourself a ZigBee hub it's nice to have the dual protocol one so that if you want to use some z-wave products and and you want to go far in terms of transmission range you can do that so it's great to have a Samsung smartthings hub there or a wink hub too as well I in general like Samsung's hub and their system and how they're they're kind of setting up automation there on their side of things and I'm sure Bixby is going to be integrated they also have access to appliances and things as well so you know there's a lot of benefit with still going with Samsung smartthings the eko plus again with that ZigBee hub is capable of a ton as well so ultimately I think you could go with either and that would be a fine way to start your smart home so now what if you're one of those people that already has a z-wave system I'm going to tell you a very similar thing go get a Samsung smartthings hub and begin your transition process you can utilize all of those different devices that you have or most of them they're not all going to upgrade seamlessly with smart things but in general go get one of those hubs and start your transition process Samsung will allow you to transition very easily because they also can connect through your network to some of your wireless devices that's how they connect some of their appliances so they have that capability worked out they know how to do it and they're forging forward on that capability with their third version of the hub so in general just a recap utilize Wi-Fi for your bigger items as you're building out your smart home plan 10 to 20 devices if you have kind of an older router so smart hubs devices like that a thermostat generally tends to be Wi-Fi although it's not a big bandwidth device appliances as you're upgrading appliances to smart home things kind of plan those to be Wi-Fi based devices they're not going to be high bandwidth either but they will on occasion download you know download updates your TVs things like that those are all going to be Wi-Fi devices so plan around that now in terms of that protocol I've kind of mentioned go ahead get a ZigBee device to create this other functionality that's what I tell you a Samsung smartthings a wink hub 2 or an echo Plus or an echo show would do the trick in that regard and you know personally what I'll tell you is there's still additional capabilities here with Samsung smartthings that are over and above what the echo plus can do in turn of ZigBee hub and the automation these guys are catching up Amazon is catching up very very quickly and they've done great work with that here in in 2018 and I'm sure it will continue in 2019 but ultimately Samsung still ahead this is a little more of a technical setup but not not anything that's too difficult and of course you're here watching automate your life we're gonna show you how to do those things now on that note guys I talked about a little bit earlier in the video a new opportunity for you to get additional content here from automate your life I know you've been listening for a while here but I want to tell you this is the kind of content that I'm going to be building within my patreon site so I want to really get down into details give you guys a really strong breakdown and help you make those decisions in your smart home so that you're set up for success quite frankly I'm telling you I don't think z-wave is future proof enough right now they can do the work to catch up I worry about the proprietary nature and I worry about the bandwidth capability of the z-wave protocol so they can do work to catch up we've seen ZigBee do work and we've seen Wireless or the Wi-Fi standard do work to make their protocols better over time so I know z-wave can do it but right now what I'm recommending to you is what I've given you here in the video so of course head over to that patreon if you love this content head over there the link is down below join us not only will you help me as a full time content creator here in the smart home and home automation space but I told you I want to give you something back for that so thanks again everyone for watching and we'll see you next time you
