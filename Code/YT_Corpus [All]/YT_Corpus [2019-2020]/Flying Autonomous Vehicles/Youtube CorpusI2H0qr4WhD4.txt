 now earlier this year South Korea became the first country in the world to test drive a 5g driverless car on busy city streets local developers have now introduced newer and smarter features that will make driverless vehicles much safer in the future our Oh Sooyoung has more getting your car out of the parking lot can be a daily hassle living in the city but running on Korea's 5g mobile network a driverless car can pick you up at your doorstep saving precious minutes in the morning korean telecom firms like LG U+ are developing 5g v2x or vehicle to everything technology which enables driverless cars to communicate with other vehicles gadgets networks and even traffic lights to make your journey as smooth and safe as possible LG plus test drove a driverless car on an open road for 15 minutes using new safety solutions the vehicle managed to detect jaywalking pedestrians and slow down when an ambulance passed using geo fencing and notice sudden accidents on the road and switched lanes the many sensors in driveless cars can only detect and collect data about its nearby surroundings however using a 5g cloud system the car can receive and exchange information about other vehicles road conditions sudden obstacles and other variables ahead in real time very quickly working with Hanyang University's eighth lab LG U+ was the first in the world to successfully test the 5g vehicle on city streets this past March but to stay ahead of the competition professors Honolulu says South Korea needs to get rid of the red tape that hinders research and development currently Korea has only about 80 driverless cars that have been approved for test driving this compares to the thousands being tested in China and the United States more cars need to be tested in order to collect data which is critically needed in order to optimize technology as well as enhance trust in their safety also there should be a central control tower between government bodies such as the ministries of science land and industry as well as the police to efficiently manage and grow the sector over the last decade a slap has been developing state-of-the-art technologies to enhance precise localization map generation environment perception past generation as well as vehicle control its aim is to develop zero emission and zero accident cars in the world where some 1.3 million people die each year from careless driving autonomous cars are also part of the government's a hundred and fifty eight billion dollar investment plan to grow the industries of the future by the year 2030 but many experts say without removing regulatory obstacles Korea could fall behind in developing core sensor technologies also young Arirang news
