 why I was hard for this job it was my passion for it and it's not a secret so everybody on the team knows that in some way I talked my way into this job because I was really really so obsessed with the product and I'm still every time I see Wayne my ice cream with excitement [Music] I will say that I feel like way Mo's kind of like the most supportive place I've ever been at before I was that way my I was doing my PhD at Carnegie Mellon and just like most of my classes I was the girl in the room or you know there was some cases three of us in like a 20-person classroom I know there's still a lot of issues but I just feel like there's much more support here but you feel like you can improve because you feel supported and in order to make their changing proposed those changes right so that's amazing position to be in actually yeah yes we're making huge strides but people's mentality doesn't even or some people don't think that we actually have a problem there's two sides of it there's the in the room side where you're maybe outnumbered but then there's the other side where the actual system that decides whomever moves up when how you're judged how you're performing kind of the system that judges people is made by the same kind of people still and I think until that those rules are changed it might feel the same even if theoretically would have fifty fifty percent the good news is we're changing it and because our leadership recognizes wow that's a problem and so we have this whole big push for equity inclusion and diversity that's company-wide and it's not just on recruiters and sorcerer's to have the onus to make our company more diverse it's gonna be for everyone we're slowly progressing with like yeah woman can lead a company a woman can do this or I'm the first woman on the first african-american woman to do this it's still a progression so you're gonna still see a lot of firsts and it's gonna be a lot of mindset shifts to say like oh wow they can do that the more women are surrounding each other with the positive mindset I think it will really help us and as I mentioned if the system will change over time yes I think that will help a lot and also I think we learned how to do with the system very well over time that's a combination I do think we'll get there for the first year I was here I'm like why am i a software engineer I can't code this isn't what I do but you play such an important role on your team right you're no seriously you're an egg pretty prominent and sulfur engineer I would say a dream oh that takes quite a lot of courage to say I'm afraid I don't have the right skills and I think we've all thought that but then speaking up about it and saying that in front of your managers feels vulnerable we're all on the same side we all have the same goal but sometimes it is hard to be you have to be that one person who doesn't look like everyone else or doesn't think like everyone else and still get them to believe what I'm saying but the other Finnick some days you really need a limited level of confidence and I don't have it at some point you know what I mean like you really need some unlimited source of confidence my team helps me a lot in this they tell me every day that we hired you for a reason and I think having a supportive environment helps a lot with it like with new women that join women or just people that I meet in general both men and women I always just want to provide a space like where people can feel like they can be themselves and that they can come to me specifically and tell me what they need to tell me and not be judged and just feel like they can be their true selves I tried to to mentor and support other women on the team Daphne keeps seeing saying I'm senior I don't feel like I am that senior but I do try and and similarly set an example and so support others I actively try and be as involved as I can with recruiting and interviewing it takes a lot of people and education to actually tell girls that they there are resources there are ways that they can achieve anything they want I just truly believe it's about changing people's mindsets and then educating people so that they have awareness of the issues themselves so that they can actually contribute in a positive way they've come from an aerospace backgrounds and I think having worked in a very kind of all procedural industry where you just follow a process and I've started challenging the status quo and in certain industries I have not felt like I could be doing that because things are there for a reason but no one could explain me the reason right and here I feel like I can question why are we doing the things we are doing this way so what I like is when people step up and take part of the burden instead of saying this is what I would like to see and then put their hands up I would love for everyone to be part of the solution actually I'm excited because I feel like we're on the cusp of a transformation that's gonna blow people's minds because I just think self-driving cars are going to be a game-changer for so many people at Burt literally trying to find people to do things no one has ever done before so it's having to do something brand new and this is really cool and exciting but it takes the right type of person with the right type of mentality to want to come in and face challenges that they haven't seen before way mo has an opportunity to like help here like you will have like a 2-ton vehicle surrounding you safely transporting you to your destination and I think we can do a lot to help I think that's over like we can empower people to go places and do the things they want to do positive experience for me it's important for me to work harder like I thought well I work at Wayne winds I actually have some ability to solve this problem and I think one of the things I'm so question about when it comes to weight now is you for focus on a general public on everybody and it's not a special product for a niche right of the population that has the money to afford it or work or lives in a right area right ik preferably you want to be able to provide the safest transportation to absolutely everyone and that really motivates me for sure you [Music]
