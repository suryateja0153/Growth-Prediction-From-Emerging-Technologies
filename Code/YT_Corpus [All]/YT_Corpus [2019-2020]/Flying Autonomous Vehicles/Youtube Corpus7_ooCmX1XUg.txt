 this video is sponsored by squarespace the  all-in-one platform to build your beautiful online   presence and run your business hey hey marcus  house with you here well what else can we say   about this week other than it has been constant  anticipation excitement disappointment excitement   again and yeah you get the idea a lot today to  cover with all news starship flight related but   also the incredible crs 21 mission as it played  out the hayabusa 2 capsule re-entry over australia   and the current updates on china's moon sample  return mission this week has been a massive one kicking straight off with the starship news this  week we saw a final test of sn8 being another wet   dress rehearsal test where the team went through  all necessary milestones that would occur before a   flight the road was closed with tank farm venting  there soon after then propellant loading with the   liquid oxygen tank being filled and pressurized  again with liquid nitrogen while the methane   tank was oddly being filled with liquid oxygen  this was done as a safety measure to avoid an   accidental mishap and explosion before the actual  flight so yes all local residents were ordered   to evacuate on monday afternoon and were provided  with accommodation by spacex in a hotel for three   nights with elon then tweeting that spacex will  be attempting to launch on tuesday with a one in   three chance of completing all objectives sn8's  suborbital flight is designed to test a number   of objectives including how the vehicle's three  wrapped engines perform as well as the overall   aerodynamic capabilities of the vehicle a primary  component of that of course involved seeing how   its body flaps work and also how the vehicle  manages that propellant transition now after what   seemed like an impatient weight early in the week  on tuesday the 10th of december during spacex's   first attempt at the 12.5 kilometer flight the  terminal count was trending well for a lift-off   time of 4 32 pm however at t-minus 1.3 seconds a  single raptor called an auto abort scrubbing the   attempt for the day now yes that was disappointing  at the time but even having the raptors go through   that sequence is yet another test that allows  spacex to further validate many of the systems   failed attempts are almost as useful as successful  ones as finding out what does not work as expected   in a non-critical failure allows quick iteration  and further data and testing always remember that   this is a test program and it's actually positive  that they got as far as t minus one seconds only   holding due to a raptor auto abort all the  same there was sn8 still standing to survive   for yet another day speaking of testing i was  super happy to see spacex reveal that they have   completed over 16 000 seconds of raptor run time  during 330 separate ground engine starts that is   over four and a half hours of raptor thrust power  right there it would be amazing to see more sample   footage of all that the pickings for raptor  engine footage can be just a little bit slim   when we're trying to show what raptor is all  about the following day of course the next   attempt was underway the big one now spacex's live  stream kicked off with only a few minutes to the   countdown at t-minus two minutes and six seconds  and abort was triggered causing confusion until we   learned why it had occurred minutes later we saw  that it was actually caused by a range violation   by a boat or aircraft after the dust settled on  that issue spacex quickly reset the countdown   targeting 4 45 pm central time again the wait was  on this was the moment that we've all been waiting   for and it finally occurred on wednesday the 9th  of december the 9 meter wide and 50 meter high   starship sn8 vehicle was the very first of this  class of rockets to fly to a significant altitude   and complete that flip maneuver at 12.5 kilometers  and then belly flop back to the landing pad   this flight proves once again that the spacex team  can push beyond what any other space agency can do   right now this is a milestone that will go down  in history a first that will be improved upon   over the next decade or two which makes a very  exciting future ahead the official spacex youtube   channel was the incredible source for this footage  of course and these views here blow my mind every   time i re-watch it there we see the vessel take  off riding those three pillars of fire slowly and   gently into the much higher altitudes it certainly  seemed like spacex intentionally throttled down   the raptors to have a nice long low thrust to  weight ratio flight allowing them to collect   a huge amount of data while the vessel was  in flight for a much longer period of time   than we had predicted now we had assumed that it  would accelerate much faster almost similar to the   initial minute of a falcon 9 launch cutting off  engines and coasting upwards for longer before   beginning to fall instead spacex gently reduced  thrust by switching off one engine at a time   so that sn8 began to fall immediately after  that final raptor engine cut off that was all   done on purpose of course and we believe this was  just to limit as much aerodynamic stress on the   vehicle for this initial flight added speeds and  pressures will come in future starship iterations   as that last raptor engine cut off it did so at  4 minutes and 40 seconds making it the longest   firing of a raptor in flight by a large margin  now it is almost uncanny how similar the flip   maneuver and the footage appears comparing  it to cory's earlier animations with sn8 now   laying down horizontally it then performed  a controlled belly flop back to the landing   site right at that critical moment as sn8 was  approaching the ground at terminal velocity two   of the three raptors successfully fired up again  flipping sn8 back to its vertical position over   the past couple of days we now have more  solid speculation as to what went wrong   during the landing burn the landing burn itself  was fine for about five seconds until the methane   header tank lost pressure due to the tank  possibly collapsing which then caused raptor   sn39 to shut down due to fuel starvation sn36 then  proceeded to overthrottle in order to compensate   but it did not do so fast enough and also began  to damage itself in the process we believe that   when the right engine there unexpectedly  shut down it didn't gimbal out of the way   and instead when the left engine had to  gimble to correct the off-center thrust   it possibly struck the other engine damaging the  engine belt the engine belt of course is comprised   of machined copper channels sandwiched between  in-canal sheets now this possible impact damaged   that bell introducing a lot of copper causing  the green flame regardless of that hiccup just   on landing spacex were thrilled with the result  saying that starship had a successful ascent   along with the switch over to the header tanks  and precise flat control to the landing point also   stating that the engines did great and summing  up the day with a victorious tweet saying that   sn8 did great so controlling the starship all the  way down to putting the crater in the right spot   was epic the next day of course spacex were very  keen to get out there on site and sift through   the wreckage of sn8 just beautiful shots here  by espadre thanks a lot there mate for sharing   these in this shot here we can see the wreckage of  the liquid methane header tank this is the top of   the tank which is normally covered assuming  there that the explosion popped the central   section of that out the down camera of course  connects to the opposite side which we can't see   from this angle components here are everywhere  of course here we see a lot of the plumbing   that feeds the fuel down through that thrust puck  structure here is the wreckage of the nose cone   itself and over here we see parts of the liquid  oxygen header tank with that down comer still   connected which would be running right down to the  engines as well the community out there are really   hoping that the nose cone here will end up forming  some sort of monument to the very first full-scale   starship to fly a significant flight that is a  very cool idea and this is all incredible insight   into the starship we don't get to see detail  like this every day people and thanks s padre   for sharing these now in the lead up to sn8  successful 12.5 km flight we witnessed a number of   interesting developments over at the construction  site basics are finally making a move to dismantle   the mark one nose cone which has been sitting here  at the construction site for over a year now both   flaps had been removed early in the week and then  grinding started with the top portion of the nose   being removed by a crane then the more exciting  part of this episode we now have the starship   serial number nine now taking focus as the next  major milestone for spacex behind the scenes   spacex have been finalizing its preparations a  set of road closures popped up the day after the   flights with an email from spacex suggesting  that starship serial number 9 as well as that   large crane that will place it on the stand are  moving to the launch pad as soon as monday the   14th spacex are getting very serious about flight  frequency here sadly more breaking news sn9 had   then tipped over in the high bay so there is now  news evolving

with minimal   damage could we be seeing another amazing flight  in just weeks let me know what you think now i   know i talk about this almost every week but there  is no way that any of us could cover the goings-on   without the openness of spacex the camerawork  by bogo chicago with nasa spaceflight along with   others this week such as jack out there as well  that is incredibly awesome the amazing 24 7 live   stream cameras by lab padre as well we spent a lot  of time watching these streams trying to get clues   on what was going on at any one time rgv aerial  photography of course this week has been largely   grounded due to restrictions but wonderful views  from the elevated perspective are so incredibly   helpful as well please do support all of these  channels where you can links are all in the   description so yes it has been another big week  of starship news and if you enjoy my updates here   please do consider subscribing here to keep up to  date we summarize everything going on every week   now it was more big news for spacex this week  with the first launch of the new cargo dragon   version 2. beautiful footage here of the vehicle  standing tall on the launch pad there awaiting   the time to light that candle spacex's commercial  resupply service mission 21 to the international   space station lifted off on december 6th  from pad 39a at kennedy space center florida   the upgraded dragon cargo capsule flew its first  operational mission with approximately 6400 pounds   or 2 900 kilograms of supplies and science on  board this variant of the capsule is modeled on   the crew dragon but it's got an extra 20 of usable  volume due to the removal of seats and the display   panels other notable differences include  only two fins on the expendable trunk section   and no super dracos that are normally used for  the launch abort systems with a crude launch   we also see here a great view of the nanoracks  bishops belgia designed airlock the first   long-term commercial addition to the space station  structure this airlock will dramatically enhance   operations from experiments to spacewalks and it's  going to be very interesting to see how quickly   this will be removed from the dragon and installed  let me know in the comments if you think that this   will be a quick process or whether it's going  to take a week or two shortly after liftoff we   saw the successful first stage separation with the  booster on its fourth flight making a safe landing   on the drone ship of course i still love you  this made it the 68th successful booster recovery   around 26 hours later the autonomous  approach systems housed in the capsule's nose   slowly guided dragon to a soft capture and docking  instead of the robotic arm capture and birthing as   was seen in the first 20 cargo resupply missions  with the old version of the dragon spacecraft   this is a significant milestone as well because  it's the first time that two dragon capsules have   been seen docked with the international space  station simultaneously during 2021 it's planned   for at least one dragon capsule to be docked at  all times the booster recovery was all returned   well and amazing shots here from greg scott  of that booster returning into port just super   dedicated work there as always chasing down these  photo opportunities for the entire space community   i mean just take a look at the incredible library  of images here at scotphotomedia.com that is quite   the collection now seeing as it's that time of  year i've been talking to greg and we are going   to give away three prints randomly selected from  all of you on twitter all you need to do is find   your favorite photo from the site here and send  out a tweet tagging greg scott photo with a copy   of the image that you'd like sent to you include  the reason why it's your favorite and that is   it we will run through all of the tweets randomly  select the winners and get in touch with you over   twitter just make sure that you are following  greg there so that we can easily message you   once we find those lucky few once selected we'll  publicly announce the winners and your photos will   be delivered to your address at the size you  want they could be 8 by 10 inch 11 by 14 or 12   by 18 inch that is all up to you of course  you can always order any of these amazing   photos here at any time which supports what greg  does just by following the directions on screen   those few shots there of the delta iv heavy  of course lead us into the next mission yep   united launch alliance finally and successfully  launched the 12th delta iv heavy mission on   thursday december 10th that massive beast lifted  off from space launch complex 37 and was sending   up the classified nrol44 spacecraft for the united  states national reconnaissance office this mission   has been plagued with delays from ground support  equipment and launch platform related problems   so it is super awesome to see it take off finally  the flight itself went off without a hitch as far   as we know just after the always amazing stage  separation and ignition of that rl10 extending   its nozzle the feed ended due to the classified  nature of the payload i always like to talk more   about the mission itself but with these classified  payloads there is really nothing to talk about so   on to the next topic now super exciting news  at the start of the week with japan's hayabusa2   spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere  after spending six years in space launched of   course back in december of 2014. the probe  reached the asteroid on june of 2018 where   it spent the next year and a half surveilling  and eventually taking surface samples leaving   for home on november 2019 the capsule landed back  on earth last saturday december 5th 2020. this   incredible spacecraft from jaxa has done something  quite amazing this all culminated in the sample   capsule from hayabusa 2 being released to re-enter  the atmosphere with the main craft continuing on   for its next adventure we see the capsule itself  here re-entering the atmosphere and landing in the   south australian desert only once before have we  ever had the opportunity to research the materials   that are sampled directly from an asteroid so  i'm sure there's plenty more to learn with this   second research project the entire mission in  fact has been an incredibly rewarding journey   with hayabusa 2 having come into contact with the  asteroid ryugu back in 2018 that is an asteroid   about one kilometer in diameter it was launched  six years ago of course on the h2a rocket and the   ambitious project spent about a year exploring and  experimenting with the asteroid itself after the   hayabusa 2 spacecraft picked up its samples and  left the asteroid late last year it fired up those   thrusters to intercept with earth for the capsule  drop-off it has been very cool seeing the return   this week shortly after dropping the capsule at  the correct trajectory to re-enter the earth's   atmosphere the minecraft performed trajectory  correction maneuver number five which sent it   on a precise gravity assist to fling it out to  a trajectory for its next mission another much   smaller asteroid designated 1998 ky-26 we're going  to need to be patient for that one however because   it isn't going to arrive at the destination  until 2031. hopefully we'll continue to hear a   lot more about this mission as it continues to  unfold as tweeted by nasa's osiris-rex a huge   congratulations and of course lots of praise to  this mission as also eloquently stated they are   patiently awaiting 2023 when they can compare the  samples of asteroid bennu and ryugu it is always   so wonderful to see international collaboration  and i think that this is something that we should   all be inspired by we can do so much more together  than we can alone an update on china's changi 5   lunar mission as well this week obviously we  talked about the launch and the initial phase   of the mission two weeks ago there is a link to  that in the description if you want to check out   more detail on that one since then of course the  lander has touched down on the surface of the moon   collected the samples and launched itself back  into a lunar orbit to meet up with the orbiter   now i've just got to shout out scott manley here  for this ai processed footage sample taken from   the original landing sequence by china's national  space administration the original footage is like   this about one or two frames per second scott's  done some magic processing to interpolate the   sequence using some form of ai so check out  the full video when you get a chance anyway   the touchdown is old news at this point having  completed that phase of the mission on december   1st but the rest of the mission has been exciting  to watch over the last week as well after the   touchdown around 2 kilograms of lunar samples  were collected by the lander and soon after on   december 3rd the ascent vehicle now containing the  samples staged fired up and took off to orbit on   december 5th the vessel completed the rendezvous  and the docking in lunar orbit and we can see it   here approaching the docking mechanism it kind  of has these claw-like mechanisms that grasp the   three rods there before it is slowly pulled into  place quite a unique design for that i will say   we even got to see the following undocking of  the ascent vehicle which was then commanded   to crash into the moon after that stage of the  mission was complete the ascent vehicle itself   impacted the moon's surface on monday the 7th  of december now the lunar ejection burn for the   vessel should i believe be happening the day this  video goes live so we should be soon hearing news   of the vessel heading back to earth very soon now  i just wanted to say a massive thank you to my
