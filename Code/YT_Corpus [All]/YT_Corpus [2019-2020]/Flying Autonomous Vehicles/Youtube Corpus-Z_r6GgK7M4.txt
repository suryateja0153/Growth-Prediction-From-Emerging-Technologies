 At NASA we do have to answer very hard questions and hopefully help industry but in this particular area there's lots and lots of questions lots of interesting questions the urban air mobility it's really the wild wild west there's all kinds of different configurations being proposed right now it's a fantastic area of aeronautics to be in every generation has its new thing and now there's electric flight because of electric propulsion and the ability to put these propulsion units anywhere on the vehicle a lot of companies immediately realized wow if we can do electric propulsion vehicles maybe we could create a new industry of this new transportation industry and relieve some of the traffic congestion on the ground by having short hop vehicles in urban areas that's what urban air mobility is a short hop of maybe 20 or 30 or 40 miles some people are saying this could happen and maybe five to ten years which it's possible the technologies are there but the bigger issues are in airspace control and then establishing air worthiness NASA is starting to look at these concepts and how you would help all of these companies that are working on them get their vehicle certified and air worthy and safe to fly so we're building these technology test beds to investigate those things the LA eight is a test bed where he could try lots of different technologies and it's a flying laboratory for urban air mobility this is all about getting the data and getting the process down so that we can help the private sector will be working with flight control companies with airframe designers with the FAA to help them develop regulations and air worthiness certification for these vehicles the project is supposed to help a broad variety of different customers and accelerate the whole urban air mobility effort VTOL stands for vertical takeoff and landing they have been built before back in the 50s and 60s NASA was really doing a lot of VTOL research those were all fossil fuel powered so they had turbine engines gas engines and now we've shifted over to electric flight which in some ways is a lot easier because you can put the electric motor wherever you need it it can be along the wing it can be on the tail and each motor can be powered by a central battery pack or generator and you don't have to have a turbine engine at every propulsion location there's literally dozens and dozens of concepts being fielded out there there's tilt wing there's tilt ducr tilt rotor lift plus cruise there's tail-sitters so there's all kinds of variation on what you can do this series of testbeds that we're gonna be building this first one is a tandem wing but it's truly a modular testbed where you can change the configuration easily you could remove just one of the wings and put a tail where the other wing was the fuselage though has the data recording system and the power system in it so it is kind of a common piece we're just beginning now to figure out how to set up a test process and flight test procedure you fly at different air speeds you fly in different conditions like turning conditions different power levels so descending climbing you try to expand the envelope so that you understand how the vehicle behaves in all different conditions NASA is really focusing on how do you make these types of vehicles safer how do you look at off nominal conditions off phenomenal meaning what if you lost a propeller and or motor could you still control the vehicle and get it on the ground safely can you fly this in gusty winds and prove that you can do that trust public trust in the technology is really important everybody involved from NASA FAA and all of the private companies developing this they are very cognizant of that and trying to approach this and help accelerate the whole urban air mobility effort
