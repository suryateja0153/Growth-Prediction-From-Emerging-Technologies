 consider major aeronautical revolutions a few may come to mind for example the first flight at Kitty Hawk or breaking the sound barrier at Edwards or perhaps the massive build-up that led to humans leaving Earth to explore other planetary bodies while these achievements are extraordinary one key aeronautical revolution that is often overlooked is the standardization of commercial flights into the National Airspace or NAS it may seem simple enough and often not widely understood by the flying public but our national airspace infrastructure is huge it comprises the navigation facilities and airports of the United States and all the services, rules, regulations, policies, procedures, personnel and equipment everyday more than 44,000 flights safely takeoff and land here in the US totaling more than 16 million flights per year this process is seamless to most of us due to the dedication of millions of professionals who work to provide safe flights in and out of the national airspace when a complex system this big works so seamlessly, great care must be taken when new advancements are added into it over the years there have been incremental changes to the system but one major advancement that is happening now is the integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace that may sound innocuous enough but updating our current national airspace to include millions of unmanned aircraft is a Herculean task that has required years of research, study and countless hours of design and analysis to move this task forward this integration needs to be seamless keeping the flying public safe while also allowing new vehicles to perform their assigned tasks on this episode of NASAX we'll follow researchers from NASA and Industry to better understand how unmanned aircraft systems will be integrated into the National Airspace System we will also shadow a unique flight test that joins pilots, engineers and researchers together to help establish standards for piloted and unmanned aircraft flying in the NAS join us as we uncover this complex endeavor andfind out what the future of flight looks like for UAS consumers in the flying public [ music ] on this cold morning in California's high desert a group of researchers from NASA and from industry are preparing for another fact-finding flight using the NAVMAR Applied Sciences TigerShark XP NASA Armstrong located at Edwards Air Force Base has seen many important test flights over the years but this flight and the others performed by this group are being used as building blocks for research that is enabling a paradigm shift in flight as we know it this round of testing known as flight test series six or FT6 is assisting the Federal Aviation Administration as they develop regulations to allow the integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the National Airspace System so the work that we're doing will contribute for others to come after us and know how to safely integrate this type of airplane into the national airspace so a lot has gone on to integrate manned airplane into different parts of the airspace so the same level of effort or perhaps more needs to go into integrated non unmanned airplanes there's different options on how you do that, there could be a pilot on the ground just what we're doing right now or the airplane could be doing things on its own before you let the airplane go do things on its own we would need to be able to anticipate all the sorts of things it can see and you know how it would safely respond to those things so the work that we're doing will eventually help get us there whether we have a pilot on the ground either monitoring or actively controlling the unmanned airplane or if the unmanned airplane can do something on its own that, whatever it does, will be safe to the traffic around it and to the people under it unmanned aircraft have come a long way over the past several decades once they were relegated to toy status and for military use but now there are many different applications for UAS use being studied like package delivery helping with crop production disaster relief and even transporting people with this increase in UAS numbers, the FAA realized that integrating these remote controlled and autonomous aircraft needs to be prioritized well NASA has a dual purpose in this one is to do the basic research that is required to understand what is needed to integrate the UAS into the NAS and to help us do the early research to determine what are the regulations that are needed the policies, the guidelines, those types of things and what's the information we need in order to issue waivers and certifications and those things at the same time they also have a responsibility or a goal to assist industry and letting them know what's necessary for them to produce and operate UAS's is in the national airspace so with the help of NASA and the aviation industry new small, lightweight and low powered sensors to help conventional aircraft and UAVs detect and avoid one another are being evaluated the FAA it has a mandate obviously to to make sure that we have air space that's safe, but also that they enable the utilization of aircraft and technologies that really benefit the American public and it's clear there's a lot of industry pull for the FAA to come up with rulemaking and some standards that would enable some of these newer platforms these newer use cases and so if there...turns out there's a use case for delivering a pizza we want to make sure that the FAA has come up with a way to do that safely if there's a use case to get your birthday present delivered to your front door by an unmanned vehicle we want to make sure that the FAA has enough information to to really be able to allow a company to do that safely and so these demonstrations were really meant to look at those enabling technologies figure out maybe what the pitfalls and what some of the limitations are but ultimately to inform the FAA so that they can do the rulemaking that's needed that will really open up some of these markets so detect and avoid in particular manned pilots have a responsibility to see and avoid other aircraft when they're flying in the airspace and when you take the pilot and put them remotely in a ground control station we still have that responsibility and so pilots need to, we need to use other sensors to detect other aircraft and then develop algorithms to help them determine how to avoid those over aircraft as Jay mentioned, one of the primary safety concerns with integrating these new systems is the inability of remote operators to see and avoid other aircraft on all flights with pilots on board the FAA requires the crew to be aware of all other surrounding aircraft either visually or using onboard instrumentation in addition to instruments, the pilot physically looks out the window to help safely avoid other aircraft because unmanned aircraft literally don't have a pilot on board NASA and its partners have been working on concepts and designs that will allow safe operation within the national airspace that is where ft6 comes in since 2011, NASA has incrementally been evaluating how to help remote pilots safely detect and avoid other aircraft by systematically testing and developing new concepts and standards from the very beginning, of course, the first thing was to essentially integrate the payload which is the detect and avoid system into the aircraft once we did that, then we go through a series of system checkout flights just to make sure everything is working whatever we learn from that in terms of from a safety standpoint also from a functionality standpoint that we make corrections and basically improve on that once we verify that the system is working then the next step is to essentially introduce intruder aircraft to verify that the displays and the alerting guidance systems work and get feedback from the pilots as well and those rehearsals basically are to set up for what we call the full mission which is where we are right now, in that phase in this final phase of FT6 NASA and its partners will be working to support development of minimum operational performance standards or MOPS for detect and avoid for medium-sized UAS's is utilizing small lightweight and low power sensors from our side we're pushing the boundaries for for these small aircraft we're trying to fly a radar that's small, tiny... and trying to pick up aircraft and they're trying to define what that is... again it's a brand new radar state-of-the-art systems, they don't really exist out there, low soft systems don't really exist for aircraft...when you're dealing with smaller aircraft a lot of its hobby-grade type of systems...avionics...a lot of it is not conducted to flying real aircraft but now that we actually trying to fly in the National Airspace we need to put real avionics on there, things that are tested to FAA certification and that's pushing the boundary that I think that's what we're doing here with this low swap system so how is the NASA team pushing the boundaries by using a number of unique control centers, piloted aircraft and a UAS with a large number of flight hours to supply the needed information for integration FT6 is a multi-dimensional test with many different groups of researchers and pilots working together to make sure the test goes according to plan during each flight there are several different researchers in different control rooms monitoring the flight and there are also at least three layers of pilots in the air and on the ground to better understand this complex dance let's first look at the UAS that is being used for this round of testing, NASA decided to use the NAVMAR Applied Sciences Tigershark XP UAS this is a medium-sized aircraft with a wingspan of nearly 22 feet and can stay aloft for 12 hours it's controlled remotely using a ground-based cockpit and has been equipped with a smoke generating system to assist the intruder pilot with visibility and an early developmental low swap nose mounted radar built by Honeywell, that will use a fixed phase array to steer the radar beam electronically the tiger shark is a group three, unmanned aerial vehicle 500 pound weight class and it has been used as basically an R&D platform to enable NASA and NASA's partners to test various pieces of software and hardware to help develop standard operating procedures for integrating UAS into the National Airspace relative to detect and avoid technology component because this UAS platform has such a long and stable track record the FT6 team felt that its reliability would allow them to focus their expertise on testing rather than worrying about building their own UAS one of the most intriguing aspects of this test is the different roles and assignments performed by the team flying the UAS the NAVMAR team pilots the aircraft during the initial takeoff and landing phase, but after the craft is airborne control of the UAS is handed off to NASA pilots the subject pilots that take over the flight are not aware of when intrusions into the airspace would occur making it realistic to what pilots in the NAS would experience [ traffic management radio ] Operator: Open center NASA01 clear conflict heading 030 they must be able to react quickly without anticipating a solution to a scenario before the encounter has even occurred this is a subject pilot station so what they're observing is the the own ship aircraft and they'll see intruder aircraft...the aircraft are generated by either virtually from Ames and that's just to add it background traffic, but to kind of create a real airspace system and then you have a real traffic that's picked up by the aircraft systems and that's injected through the payload and it comes into the system too so they're getting a mix of both real traffic and virtual traffic and all they're doing is essentially flying this mission, they'll get intruders coming in and causing traffic alerts, that's a yellow alert...they'll either talk to ATC and move, but if it's a red alert they'll move immediately then talk to ATC and coordinate on the way back...this is all done in Oakland airspace in a virtual environment...from their side even though they're flying the real aircraft with real intruders we were actually able to gather a lot of the metrics that you would normally gather in a lab but in this case a real atmospheric flight and that's what we call live, virtual and constructive, we had the live component which is the live UAS and the live intruder; the constructive, which were traffic simulated aircraft that we're moving in the airspace and in virtual which were actually people who were flying a simulated aircraft and talking over the radio and all those things combined to create a really immersive test environment so this is the mobile operations facility, MOF 5 so this is the NASA ground control station... this is where we execute all the flight testing all the missions conducted from this, so the systems interface to the NAVMAR ground station it's interfaced to the LBC environment and its interfaced to the comm system here at Armstrong...uh, so interfaces to all the systems and it allows us to communicate with everything so from here once the aircraft's airborne our pilots take control of the aircraft move it into the airspace and then after that control is transferred to the subject pilot that's on this side of the station and that's where we conduct the mission, the full mission for the flight test so the subject pilot is not familiar with the system to try...and that's done on purpose as a human factors research we need trained pilots to actually monitor the airspace and in an and make sure that there's some room... we're still flying in real airspace and actual Edwards Air Force Base there's actually other missions going on in the background so we need our pilots has to manage that part of the test and call it off if they need to or or take control of the aircraft if there's an actual emergency up in the air or there's another mission that's intruding these piloted aircraft are not only employed as chase planes but are used to intrude in the airspace around the UAS to test the detect and avoid system during these flights intruder aircraft intentionally fly very close passing encounters to the UAS which trigger the DAA, a landing and guidance these encounters test the detect and avoid procedures helping researchers develop performance standards to address such scenarios a typical test day starts off in the early morning hours, the team starts with a T0 briefing during this time all team members go over all the test parameters for the day once that briefing is complete everyone goes to their respective locations such as control rooms or to the aircraft when everyone is ready there is a comm check over a specific frequency meanwhile the TigerShark is towed out to the lake bed for launch while the intruder aircraft are preparing for takeoff once on the lakebed, a series of tests are performed on the aircraft to ensure it is safe and ready to fly when all these tests are complete the ready call is given and the aircraft is set for takeoff Radio call: ...and, we've got good RPM's, good systems, fresh off on this cold clear morning the aircraft takes flight without a problem, to begin the day's test once airborne the NAVMAR team hands over control to the test pilots to fly the mission for the day Radio call: Pilot, this is AVP on mission ready for handover Pilot: pilot ready for handover Pilot: pilot has the aircraft In the various control rooms, teams of researchers are monitoring the system while intruder aircrafts begin the incursions into the UAS airspace [ radio communication ] on this day each pilot sees the incursions and properly guides the aircraft away from the intruders this test continued for several hours with numerous intrusions occurring, as the test winds down flight control is given back to the NAVMAR team who then brings the TigerShark back for a perfect landing when I first started, quadcopters or large UAS weren't really a thing and now we've flown a large UAS in the national airspace for the first time and now we're working towards integrating smaller class UAS into the national airspace as well eventually everybody wants to jump in a taxi and have it airlift you from building to building this technology, this detect avoid technology will really help...help that and conduct it safely over the course of this comprehensive testing, NASA and the FAA have amassed an enormous amount of data allowing safe efficient integration of these systems into the National Airspace this type of result is not unusual for NASA and its partners over the past 60 years this organization has continued to push the boundaries in science, engineering and technology while the presence of drones and unmanned aircraft begins to populate the skies, NASA will continue to test, evaluate and pursue a safe and efficient air space that will coexist with commercial and private aircraft what many thought was science fiction will soon become science fact as these aircraft become a part of our everyday lives
