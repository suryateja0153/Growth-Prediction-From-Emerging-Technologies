 dr. Chong yuan is the founder and CEO of foresight AI an AI startup that develops a global scale data platform to empower emerging mobile robots such as Robo taxis delivery trucks and flying cars prior he was a senior research manager of Apple's a special project group welcome to roughly AI talk Romilly is a video content platform which will help researchers and engineers to have a better understanding of a leadership entrepreneurship as well as business insight we aim to prepare you to become the next generation of leaders and entrepreneurs in this episode we have the pleasure to have dr. Ewen to join us - sure with us his journey in computer vision as well as his expertise in the field you did your undergrad in my university and then either your PhD in the u.s. yes thousand University yeah you know Southern California so yeah I did the math throughout this years I've been studying come to the science and my specialty is in the composition so chem division is a science and few that we try to infer the cementing information out of the images and videos and recently of course the lidar sequences so all these things are basically is trying to mimic how what humans can do we observe things and then we use our brain to infer what's in there and what we infer we infer 3d geometry at how far the things are away from us how things are moving and also we infer the cement information what is this object was that object is it what does human look like is it the same human the same person another person so they see come division is a tech science and technology for understanding the world in the geometry way in the scientist in Mantic way and from the visual media which year was it then you started your PhD I'm so started my PhD in 2003 and then I graduated in four years and there were went on were kind of quite a few companies you in the industry side I myself am very excited to see the tremendous progress that have been made by the industry I was happy to contribute to some of those as well I know in 2003 I'm guessing that's that's even before the 3p movies are like a one-point popular in the theater like not even mentioned a 3d imaging without the glasses yeah yes so what I'm saying the computer vision wasn't receiving as much as attention as they if they do right now No so what makes you choose computer vision as the field us to study yes I think from a my undergrad I went to a digital image processing course as a soap intrigued that there's such technology can really be smart that infer and understand the images I can't stand the human faces and I understand we kind of just reconstruct the world from the videos all those are really kind of very it was it was very those were very intriguing for me and I've decided to take that as my specialty so I've been doing that ever since for like 20 years reconstruct the world that reminds me of it reminds me of the author of The Lord of the Rings like like you creating a entire new world was our vision when you started what was her eagle so my ego was that I want to have this new technology so that we can just use that to understand the world better so that the machines can do a lot of things for us so take the previous example a long time ago for example for face detection for those kind of things you can use it for detect whether there's a person in front of you or you can recognize the human bodies those movement and also of course recent examples are mobile robots others over they are have the they have the vision capabilities just like humans they decide to do some tasks for us so we actually just gain our life back so when I why everybody is so happy or excited about some striving is because it's not just about safety also liberating us from the mundane transportation hassle either the car can drive you or you bring stuff to you so you can use your time to other things you you this time to do Facebook as you you can show the time right so I think that's all this technology enable our this canoe applications in a welcome to computer vision will make our life better will make the world better place so I think that's a person I feel very excited have been excited for the past decades about that it's true it's true that's all of the things he was like it was we was only imagining it in the movies and now we're doing is actually really really cool so after the ph.d program you joined sharp you know us and working on the 3d discipline about sensing it was a big thing it was only news right yeah and then after that you window for a UN a join Amazon they amaz all awesome Emma's all start a project one of the project was Amazon go by I really liked it they I tried a new Scout all like a of store with my house ID and then I grabbed four chocolate bars and then after I walk out of the store my Amazon account was ultimately charged this exact amount of any chocolate bars and I had no idea how did they recognize to me right in the exact four chocolate bars it was a really cool yeah that was the matching experience that we enabled with the computer vision machine learning sensor fusion and also combined with a highly optimized hardware a 3d camera those kind of things yeah so I think yeah so to share a little more about that so basically in the amazon co experience what was hard technically was that we want to make sure that we recognize the the product event when it's a problem and prada was taken off the shelf then we associate that you been with the person so we have a lot of cameras on the top and the capture tracked that person so i want to make sure that the products associated with the right customer so we had the both from the user experience at the front financial side we're not making mistakes also enable a new thing so again through this experience you're happier your saves time you don't have to you don't have to wake in the line so other things are the technology making our life better yeah that's like billions of dollars investment in that 70 level xtour yeah definitely yeah yeah yeah so after Amazon you spend some time with Lenovo in Hong Kong sort of three the friend facing 3d imaging yeah and which was kind of unique like living in Hong Kong for a couple years and then and then you join Apple for a special project group you know what's that my wife and I we kind of made a little venture so we went back to Hong Kong to just test it out like how they'd like to work in China and those kind of things but you know then I got kind of contact from Apple and then they really kind of excited me about a changing project so I after some interaction I joined I decide to come back to the u.s. join that project is the special project work on autonomous systems so basically we are building the autumn system to enable new applications and over there I think is a great experience for me too as a comm division scientist and learned a lot about autonomous mobile robot system and then how how is kind of how is behaving how is what are the things to be done and what are the bottlenecks I think over there I learned a lot but one specific thing I learned is that for robot the making decision-making this how the robot can move her robot can react is actually very hard it is not come division is actually pure or like a greedy general artificial intelligence problem computer vision while it is evolving is actually moving around is quite predictable it's actually well the general term is that we can predict that where we can get to 99% but even with that let's just tell you what the world is about how the things moving then robot has to make decision so I think this is the hardest the most challenging problem in the atoms vehicles in the mobile robots or the other things and that's actually where I think that you know I think I have a better way to solve that problem so that's why I kind of start doing something new I see ya until this point that I think that you are entire career journey until this point isn't like you you keep doing and cutting edge technology cents for leading teams and doing a really cool stuff so I was thinking maybe will be really cool to share with our audience even like some milestones of new divisions sure yeah so there are a few things along the development nakum division that are really big milestones of course this is incomplete list but let's say start from 2001 that's pretty early that we only have webcams of those kind of crappy webcam those kind of videos that we can get at that time we already have a real-time face detection method which is called add a post so basically this method can detect the human faces from just like single camera and it can run real time I was I was not at the original conference they released this paper but the presenter the speaker is it by the way they're very famous of yahwah viola and the jones they showed a live demo there's an adult timer is pretty rare you can show lifetime or your point a a money I approached the US dollar in front of camera and then it can detect the faces on that dollar at the real time it read accurately so that's like a life-changing moment I was like very motivating moti very expiring to me so that's even like Co obvious like 18 years ago as is is crazy and then after that that there are a few other important things that release into consumer space and there's really kinda big deal so one is actually the Microsoft Kinect camera so have the 3d camera that can recognize humans and then bring you into the interactive 3d gaming experience and also another thing is is a customized hardware allows you to have the real time interaction so moving along there's also obviously there's a topper grants challenge and then there's imagenet that's basically developed a deep learning method to solve a really hard image recognition problem and then there's Amazon Co which is another kind of great milestone this is a in the define the environment how you how can you use communication machine technologies to enable new user experience which is core of Amazon that a better shopping experience recently I think I'm also proud to share that I contributed to the app of face ID project so with the the really tiny 3d cameras you can enable the natural frictionless a 3d face recognition you can use it also you can use it to generate emoji all those kind of things so along this line these are the few kind of major things I want to mention if you look at this well what-what happened over there is all combined is all generated by the combination of technology breakthrough this special software acronym breakthrough and also the customized hardware so that you can actually make it run faster at the real time and also just a pride in technology to enable better user experience without better user you spend all these technology they don't help how why do we work on that thank you so much for sharing that sure one of the thing that really curious is that as we mission done while you working at Apple you learned so much why did you leave Apple and 2017 it was so I think of course Apple is a big company with almost on-demand their resources is actually great a great place to work look at the problem we're trying to solve with you don't have the 100% certain answer about how to make self-driving cars work so is a complex system with our known answers to some scientific questions so in this case I think the big are big corporations like Apple and other many other company they're great they build very solid technology but there are maybe a little bit too big to tackling and adjusting to this all different very different unknown uncertain questions soul is a little bit like your your writing on a big cruise ship you're on the Carnival cruise ship is great is very comfy is driving smoothly you you're going to the right direction maybe you don't know and then but sometimes we have to do fast experimentation so I think I observed that I felt that I can do something in a separate in a different way hopefully better and then basically it's also open to the fast experimentation then continue the metaphor of writing on the boat then we jump up into the water we found our own hand a little Dragon Boat Dragon Boat that the benefit is really fast as I'm blowing the whistle and cheering match team's hey let's go this way and if it doesn't work okay let's check quickly change to another direction what besides of trying new things that trying exciting things I don't know like one of the things that it's very different compared to join a a company is that you have to take charge of this company now I know that you'd like to take challenges yeah I know right you you love this exciting and challenging things but still be difficult for you is through your entrepreneur sure is you know some hardship that you experienced yeah sure so of course I have a many years of a techno leadership experience I only led team and a team so for those part and mostly I was able to do that I think several things that are kind of new one is that selling our vision to investors basically takes time to find the best narrative how do we convey that message in ten seconds so that has been the part that I've seen practicing the second challenging part which is new is that working with the customers so now our customer they're big oh yeah I totally am dirty one tier two they're bigger big companies and then how do i navigate you within this big company and find the right team so that the team will become an advocate to help us to drive the project and then then contracts I wouldn't say that we have wonder-percent perfect the product cost the product market fit yet because things that keep changing both so I know that for sanity is a a high platform for outcomes driving vehicles companies let's tackle those things that one by one so when you were selling to investors what would be your like one sentence page we are using come division technologies to generate such 3d data and 3d driving data and use 3d driving data to solve motion planning problem that is how can this happen some vehicles drive safely and naturally and how do we know which is the most challenging one in the atoms driving industry you know from a technical point of view is that we regenerate we capture all the driving behaviors on the road bring all the drive we have behaviors around the world into the simulator and the letters customer make of Drive in there in the world in the realistic environment and then you can drive around and you can carefully test it yeah probably later we can provide a certification so that you think there are many many kind of providers of a full staff driving system or terms of vehicles you claim you're safe how do how do I know you're really safe how about I test you with a one minute left turn one p.m. a right turn are those tricky situations and see if your vehicle can handle that you want to set a rule later setting the rule is really hard in the sense that there's no I don't think there's providing certificate it's like you're buying a golden standard or improvising golden ticket but I mean honestly it's too early to mention that I think right now we are working with a group of players or sports play a sports player who are running a marathon we don't know when we can get an ending point but work we provide we're providing Red Bulls to these players here's a Red Bull you drink it with our data your is a basic move faster that I can guarantee you you you can see the ending point faster yeah and I won't get you a no like I also tell you I use my stuff timer safe hey how long have you how fast have you move here how safe are you you know a real humble cells were facilitator we are boosters will help all these companies using our data help these companies to make them develop their system faster and then get to the endpoint faster let's talk about a second thing image which was market fit so the idea I'm getting is that or today I am technical focusing is simulation we pretty much really kind of focus on that data and the data derived the software simulation itself is also a big effort that you have to create a lot of large-scale graphics engine and the distributed way so as a we with the limited resources we're not working on that so we bring all the data and the related intelligence software as a plugin into simulator so I was thinking that maybe your field is is competing with way most craft sure yeah so I think Remo has been the leader and we learned a lot from their public blog post at the car craft so yeah I think always a we whatever things is similar to what we - doing so basically we go out to collect lots of driving scene or data and just bring out those kind of pieces together and put input into simulators I can fully test in between the car I think our specialty is that the way we capture data is kind of special on Forte I couldn't talk too much about that but this is a special that we can capture millions of driving scenarios in a very cost-effective and a very highly accurate way is we can spread out faster than way mo and just capture many many areas that how people drive how people move in those different areas so that's our kind of really special sauce and really kinda our focus to move fast cherry lots of such scenarios and then bring those data into the simulator any other simulator as a start up how do you get a figure we collect ourselves our specialty is that even with the low cost of sensor data we can get the same 5 to 10 centimeter accurate data that is needed for Thomas driving so that's a we basically have to definitely has a techno technical advantage if any other team was do the same thing they can probably build in a one or two years that's totally impossible but with this real-time can build the data barrier and a custom apparel these are the really valuable things so another thing down to the customer knees is that our customers yeah the real customers are the R&D engineers in these customer companies they are crying for data every day I need to drive in data all those things so we want to enable this frictionless process so that they can go to our website select the day that they want and just some payment process in the in the place and they get a data in half an hour so that's our Union robots are just robots who developed and are the engineers they need a lot of love so we'll keep them data so they can get more love yeah so I know that you all have your company have collaborated with city of Sacramento to capturing HTML madmapper outs of other autonomous driving companies that are operating in the Sacramento so I also know that you have clients of both in China and the US so my wonder just wondering that will would it be any different like trends in terms of technology about lives in the two countries there are three things to other kind of common between both countries one is of course the big investment in the level four or five because it's hard is unknown problem a lot of people are developing that deployment is also following the similar kind of procedure have a shuttle buses a nickel for château robot taxi and then really robot taxi then a passenger vehicles whole process can take a decade or even more than that so that's a pretty common between China and in the US the second part is also common is that from the city government from the state government they actually they want to understand what's happening there's a lot of proposals from submit to usdot that department transportation they want to study how the shuttle buses advanced vehicles are coming to the city and how the city reacted up so this is a second market general color intelligent transportation and the third part is actually quite a difference so in the u.s. in Europe the ADA system has been pretty common right many many cars have that but that was that's not the case in China in China there's a big bringing up of ADA system but so China recent passed a regulation that all the commercial vehicles they need to have since driving they have need to have a driver monitoring system so that actually the big opportunity there for others people developing basically they are competing against mobile to kind of get into the system that's really interesting as a Tier one company if I were you I would be really considering about the commercialization of the entire industry yeah I'm guessing like the bottleneck in China will be different compared to the bottleneck so we're facing in the u.s. so one thing that I know about the US market is that is that there there will be lots of powers to stop the the you know what I mean the car is going commercializing because it affects a lot of people yes job yeah yeah what would be some different taxing to countries that's really really humble in Akron so we are striving to be a Tier two company the automotives is quite hierarchical we provide a data component which provides part of the simulation capability to this Tier one to this audience I think it's just the regulatory dynamics in different kind discount is very different so in u.s. I think people tend to be more conservative there's the list under that and there's a like big like a great example would be trucking industry so people want to do automated tracking and a claim that is easier problem Saab they are going to face bigger kind of pushback from the driver unions yeah for me honestly I right now what I focus on technology part how can we educate people about expectation of safety in such using such system either this is driving our automated driving so ulamas he's made very controversial comments that we don't agree with his comment that all of the car is fully self-driving it's actually very dangerous so we need to have a certain way to clearly define was the safety capability of each vehicle and whether we can trust that so we have to participate in that too so in China is also similar but also lots of City command they have a more kind of privilege or more capability to push things or you want to do a vehicle to infrastructure education sure let's restriped the road with the sensors advocate Italian amount so that's totally doable in China I think people are general what I've seen is like they're more tolerant to start experimenting on the road right so they're trying more things situation is more complicated yeah definitely I mean the other other driving behavior so the driving today we have we capture us is not applicable in China because say it just is a it's more crowded at they're more offensive things so yeah yeah we need to capture we're going to capture data in China as well so yeah yeah what will be your solution like focusing both market means that you need the data from both I think so we probably will be in the u.s. because we have all the things figure out so that we're busy will collect data where process data serve our customer of their in China we but pretty much will work with the partners partners of probably will collect data for us or with us and then we have the software as a service to generate a basically take their data process them generate the the real words at driving scenarios and use those to tween the between the vehicles in China so I mean we gotta have a different data packages one for us one for China one for Europe or Japan Korea certain places I also put it in a good spot so we're a global company we have two web business every company we have to generate a lot of local data all of them yeah definitely yeah so speaking of that and we were thinking that L four and a five vehicles will probably not be commercialized until 2020 yeah so one of my concern is that how do you buy that much time for your company because you're relying on them to make profit and they'll be like you know what what's your plan the biggest challenge is time to market how fast you can really deploy a trustable a global taxi fleet or shuttle bus fleet to the real world you're being more like you succeed in a business so it's unfortunate that way more promise oh we're gonna have fully like driverless fleet last December did not happens which means there are a lot of problems mm our challenges so we want you number we want to be facilitator we often help them we also kind of making revenue along that way but at the same time back ship we also gain a lot of intelligence about autonomous systems so we have other kind of things that can be offered so it's basically no obviously not just data but also the intelligence that's actually eventually will be more valuable so where my last question will be where do you see yourself and more side AI jobs next three to five years yes so I think in five years I hope we get to miss a place that all the automotive company there are customers Tier one tier twos and also all the public sector entities like city government the state government they want to use our data intelligence platform so that they can use as between the terms of vehicles they can use that to analyze and then we get a basis almost like we we provide data to California DMV and say if you want to deploy a car into California me please run the 4-sided AI data and the software so get like a safety rating right so how safe is it how well can I handle the traffic information here and then and then this is just one piece of a pie the other big piece of I also want to contribute to the intelligent transportation system how the cars are driving on the road how at a city level which part is the most crowded area how do you improve that how to adjust a red light duration how do you design the parking spot so other things we hope they use us to so have a great a model company is called ESRI ESRI they're the world number one geographical information system company they started 50 years ago and their annual revenue is 1.1 billion that the founders are husband and wife couple Jack Dangermond and his wife they start a company we actually without VC funding the bootstrap and really build up so that now every US government entity is using their product so that's how powerful it is we want to be this open data platform software platform the a lot many people to use our capability and then just users to improve the automotive transportation logistics and the government public sector others kind of industries so that's our vision that's our go-to to moving along as a builder more customers have more sustainable business and then just also you invite more people to work with that so we are very kind of open to work with people work with different companies we're talking to HD mapping company at the earth they filled their map are great we import their maps we're working with a submission company great we want to port our data into your simulator and they will serve our common customer who are developing the real-time driving systems so we take we basically become one become the most important most unique data provider in this industry and work with the whole ecosystem wow you really have a big vision thank you and I think you will be doing great because I feel I feel like you do have them the entrepreneur spirit and you and you're afraid of tagging chicken challenges and also that you have the personality to sail yeah yeah I think I threw this one a half years I think I'm doing better at the sales yeah so but also still you know I must thank my wife she's a professor in marketing so is this between me a lot with a solicited or unsolicited advice so that has been pretty good yeah where are you mentioning your professional skills you know in the industry yeah I wish you all the best thank you thank you for the great opportunity [Music]
