 hey I'm Zack on this episode we're gonna address all the problems that people think are going to happen when our autonomous driving future arrives next on I you know [Music] [Music] yes you in the front yeah so if we have autonomous cars the government or giant corporations are gonna know where we are and where we're going all the time I don't want the government to know where I am all the time privacy is an important concern unfortunately the cat is out of the bag with that one already do you carry a cell phone with you yeah of course well then you can already be tracked if someone wants to know where you are badly enough next problem so you want to trust autonomous computer cars to decide who to kill in an eminent accident ah the moral dilemma question the age-old question of what to do if my brakes stop working do I Drive into a couple crossing the road or a mother with a baby carriage yeah how's the computer gonna decide well first of all you have to understand that autonomous cars are going to get into far less accidents than humans there were over 1.3 million people killed worldwide in road accidents last year alone autonomous cars will be safer by many orders of magnitude they don't drink they don't get sleepy they don't text etc but if an accident is imminent we people will program the cars to make the best moral choice for instance we can program the car to hurt the least number of people based on the data that it has and the cars will learn from past accidents which course of action should lead to the least harm will it be perfect no nothing in life is perfect but it will be many orders of magnitude safer than what we live with today I own a car dealership and in your previous episode you said there will be 90% less cars on the roads and that people may not even own cars anymore so what's gonna happen to me and my employees in this autonomous driving future we're all gonna lose our jobs yeah I work at a car assembly plant making Chevy drugs yeah driver Michael lose my job yes you probably will but that is true throughout human history whenever a new technology is invented and gets adopted and disrupts the old technology in the 1700s for instance rope makers used to make all the Rope by beating it with wooden clubs all day then Along Came the Industrial Revolution and machines made rope the rope makers lost their jobs and they were forced to adapt to survive did you really expect that you could do the same job for your entire life those days are pretty much over no matter what field you're in you either adapt or you get replaced but if people are gonna lose their jobs because of autonomous cars then we just won't stand for it yeah screw autonomous cars I won't buy one that's an important point the adoption of Technology does not depend on whether people will lose their jobs because of it if that were true then the automobile would never have caught on the Ford Model T was first introduced in 1908 by 1912 the number of cars and horses on roads were equal and by 1917 there were no more horses on roads less than ten years and didn't all those people in the horse economy lose their jobs yes they did but we still adopted the automobile because it was much better cheaper faster and what happened to those people that had worked in the horse economy they either adapted and found new jobs or they kept trying to produce horseshoes and went out of business and you won't need to buy an autonomous car because in our autonomous driving future people won't own cars but I want to own my own car I don't want to use a network car well in the future you could buy your own car but keep in mind that each time you arrive at your destination you're gonna have to pay quite a premium for a parking space the good news is that your car will go find the space and park by itself but you'll have to pay for that privilege and you'll have to pay for the insurance taxes and maintenance in addition to the cost of the car while everyone else who uses autonomous driving networks will be saving a lot of money by sharing the cost I love to drive I don't want a computer driving me around you won't be able to drive on most roads but the good news is that there will be areas where you can drive kind of like amusement parks for driving fun roads with no traffic where you can drive fast without the fear of crashing because the car you're in will be constantly watching out for you protecting you from getting into accidents while you drive to your heart's content cuz let's face it when we see cars and car commercials they're almost always on closed courses and that's what we dream of doing not sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic I will never trust a car to drive me no way I know it seems like we could never give up that trust to a computer but that's only because up to this point in history computers haven't had the ability to think fast enough to do all the things that humans do when we drive and we didn't grow up experiencing this new reality but now we can we're just not used to it but we will adapt you just might not be an early adopter but I promise that when you see enough people do it you'll try it one day and then it will become routine even for you when automobiles first came out many people said the same thing they would never trust a machine over a horse but now a hundred years later there are many people on the planet that don't drive in cars but I like to leave stuff in my car how do you do that with autonomous cars what kind of stuff do you like to leave in your car well how about if I'm going bowling after work I like to leave my bowling ball and my bowling shoes in the car say I don't have to carry them back and forth from work with autonomous self-driving cars you could have your bowling ball and shoes transport it to the bowling alley and brought in by autonomous robots to be waiting for you when you get there what did he just say autonomous robots yeah why not if we can make an autonomous vehicle you'll be able to make autonomous robots so better yet a robot at work could carry your bowling ball and shoes into work for you but I like to leave my makeup in my car now I won't be able to do that hmm I can think of a possible solution maybe the car that drops you off at work can coordinate with the car that will be driving you home later and can transfer belongings between cars or maybe storage locker stations like what you find at train stations will become popular and autonomous robots can temporarily store belongings in it or maybe autonomous drones will transfer items for what if the autonomous car you're driving in breaks down or like gets a flat tire well this will be a lot better than it is now today if this happens to you you call triple-a or a tow truck and have to go with your car to a service center and wait for your car to get fixed which could take a long time in the future another autonomous car will get you almost immediately because it will be dispatched by a supercomputer that can send the car that is able to get to you the fastest and the car that needs repairing can be picked up separately by an autonomous tow truck and oh yes because these will be electric autonomous cars it will break down very infrequently compared to internal combustion cars because there are far fewer moving parts and the cars will be able to predict when they need maintenance what if I need to pick up lumber at the lumberyard I can't fit two by fours in a car there will be autonomous box trucks vans flatbed trucks even 18-wheel semi tractor-trailers all different types of vehicles for different purposes and the cool part is you won't even need to go to the store to get those two-by-fours if you don't want to you can have them brought to you autonomous lee what about security I mean if someone hacks into your autonomous car they can drive you off the road or drive you into some remote location and then people could be waiting there rob you security is important but it's important to understand that your car can be hacked right now most cars today in fact are drive-by-wire meaning that the brake pedal and/or the accelerator pedal send digital signals they no longer connect with physical cables so a hacker could remotely unlock your car or tamper with the car's controls and crash your car so security will always be an issue we'll need to make sure that these computers are secure just like we need to make sure that your bank's computers are safe or the airline are up there can't be hacked you're supposed to be so scientific and yet you don't seem to have any hard facts to back up your arguments so why should we believe you you're right throughout history when a major technological change was about to occur that would change the direction of humankind as we know it there was no proof that it was coming usually only a few people understood what was about to happen and even they usually got the big picture wrong we humans have been very bad at predicting change we usually either overestimate the time it will take heck the founding fathers of the United States very smart people thought it would take a thousand years for this country to be settled from coast to coast they were off by a factor of 10 or we underestimate the effect it will have on society gunpowder the light bulb the atomic bomb horseless carriages the list is endless when we are taught history most often we are taught facts who invented what when we rarely go deep into how new technology changed society how quickly it was adopted who fought it and why what were the unintended consequences we throw around terms like out-of-the-box thinking but most people are still thinking inside the box even when they think they are outside the box describing ideas too far outside the box begins to sound crazy like how could that happen and yet throughout human history they did happen and that's why visionaries are so important to humankind to move us forward without them you get long dry periods in history where humans don't move forward technologically in fact they move backwards the dark ages are such a period where new ideas were stifled I think it's important at this point to reflect for a moment on what humans have done throughout our history on this planet we have continually developed new technologies new tools new ways to do things not that every new invention is a good one but when an invention comes along that does a job better and it gets general acceptance by people then you can either learn how to use the new tool or risk getting left behind there are countless examples of people in history who chose not to adapt and they perished we are generally quick to embrace new medicines and new weapons maybe too quick before we really take the time to investigate these improvements but there are many people leery of new objects that they did not grow up with personal computers are any of you old enough to remember when personal computers started popping up in the 1980s I was a kid when they started showing up but I remember that my grandparents never got one even after a couple more decades my grandparents never got one he never used one why because they didn't grow up with them they didn't see the need to learn to use them a similar thing happened with cell phones do you remember many business people started using cell phones many were provided them from their companies because it made communication between employees even more efficient but it took years before the average Joe got a cell phone and then smart phones came along and the same thing happened it took years before your grandmother or grandfather finally got a smartphone right some still don't have one we all used to go to the video store and rent movies on VHS tapes right and then one day Blockbuster disappeared and we were all watching Netflix but most people never saw it coming in fact here is a quote from the CEO of blockbuster Jim Keyes in December of 2008 quote neither Redbox nor Netflix are even on the radar screen in terms of competition in 2010 blockbuster went bankrupt mark my words the same exact thing will happen with electric cars and with autonomous cars at first nobody even knows when an electric car is and then the next thing you know electric autonomous self-driving cars are everywhere and before you know it your Ford Focus is sitting in the Smithsonian Museum in the transportation exhibit next to the other antiquities maybe the real problem is that so many people see change as a problem instead of the opportunity for a better future that it is ending slavery was a change equal rights was a change the transition to sustainable energy is a transporting humanity off of the earth will be a change I guess it's just a question of what side of history you'd like to be on now you know [Music] you [Music]
