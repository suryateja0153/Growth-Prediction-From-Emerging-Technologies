 earlier this year South Korea became the first country in the world to test drive a 5g driverless car on city streets and local developers have now introduced newer and smarter features that will make driverless vehicles much safer in the future our Oh Sooyoung has the story getting your car out of the parking lot can be a daily hassle living in the city but running on Korea's 5g mobile network a driverless car can pick you up at your doorstep saving precious minutes in the morning Korean telecom firms like LG U+ are developing 5g feet or X or vehicle to everything technology which enables driverless cars to communicate with other vehicles gadgets networks and even traffic lights to make your journey as smooth and safe as possible LG plus test drove a driverless car on an open road for 15 minutes using new safety solutions the vehicle managed to detect jaywalking pedestrians and slow down when an ambulance passed using geo fencing it noticed sudden accidents on the road and switched lanes so many sensors in driverless cars can only detect and collect data about its nearby surroundings however using a 5g cloud system the car can receive and exchange information about other vehicles road conditions certain obstacles and other variables ahead in real time very quickly our solution optimizes such sensors based on deep learning and cameras to detects diverse situations on the road LG U+ was the first in the world to successfully test the 5g vehicle on city streets this past March working with Hanyang universities a slab but to stay ahead of the competition professors Honolulu Yonghwa says South Korea nice get rid of the red tape that hinders research and development currently Korea has only about 80 driverless cars that have been approved for test driving this compares to the thousands being tested in China and the United States more cars need to be tested in order to collect that out which is critically needed in order to optimize technology as well as enhanced trust in their safety also there should be a central control tower between government bodies such as the ministries of science land and industry as as the police to efficiently manage and grow the sector autonomous cars are also part of the government's a hundred and fifty eight billion dollar investment plan to grow the industries of the future by the year 2030 but many experts say without removing regulatory obstacles Korea could fall behind in developing core sensor technologies also Jung Arirang news
