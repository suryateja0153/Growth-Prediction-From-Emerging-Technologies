 ingenuity represents the most remarkable things that humanity is capable of these achievements are not just the product of pure determination their combination of human perseverance ingenuity hi Vanessa my name is Mimi um I work at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL and my job there is a project manager for marcella copter Mars helicopter is a technology demonstration flight experiment that Mars 2020 perseverance rover is hosting and we're going for the attempt at flying the first ever flight on another planet so I've been really excited about this phone call to talk to you because I'm getting to share with you the news that your proposed name has been chosen as the name for Mars helicopter well that's amazing so on behalf of our entire Mars helicopter team I'd like to thank you for our name for a Mars helicopter engine unity it's the perfect name for us we really we love the name so thank you thank you guys ingenuity is what allows people to accomplish amazing things and it allows us to expand our horizons to the edges of the universe [Music] hi I'm Eric Evan with a with the News team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California hitching a ride on the perseverance Rover launched into Mars this summer is the Mars helicopter which now has a name ingenuity and we want to give you a chance to learn more about this experiment as ingenuity will try to be the first powered flight on another planet and we are following social distancing rules that's why me me young the Mars helicopter project manager joins me from the Mars helicopter test lab at JPL she's the only person there the helicopter is in Florida awaiting launch and I have a couple questions to get us started and then will be asking me questions submitted with the ask NASA hashtag me thanks for answering our questions today you're welcome thanks for having me here of course so to get started how does a helicopter work on Mars I see you have a model behind you can you kind of explain it using that sure this is a full-scale model behind me the helicopter has a solar panel on top with the communication antenna right underneath this a rotor system it's a pair of counter-rotating blades that will spin up to about 2400 revolutions per minute very fast and underneath is the fuselage containing the battery and special electronic boards thermal components sensors tremors and at the very bottom is the landing gear the entire vehicle weights about 1.8 kilograms just about four pounds Wow and can you talk about the teamwork and innovation that took place to get this project off the ground yes building for the first time a helicopter that can fly in the very thin atmosphere of Mars was considered to be almost impossible definitely really challenging so to have a helicopter that can fly in the thin atmosphere autonomously and survive autonomously on the surface of Mars and to be operable you know all the way back from Earth that took in Genuity hard work and really true teamwork teamwork from many disciplines we there is a significant team behind the making of the Mars helicopter I really wish everybody on our team is here today to share our stories with you but I'm really proud to be representing the team here from you know all the way from the mathematical equations that represent the helicopter to software electronics mechanical structures thermal power materials special fixtures special facilities that it takes to test it's a very long list of technical specialty that it took and to meet these challenges we work together really tightly both technically in each discipline and as the system together to make this work and we're really tight team we are really happy to be where we are today ready integrated onto perseverance Rover for launch to Mars for a bit very first test flight at Mars and you were just touching on this now the Mars helicopter is riding on the perseverance rover so how does the idea of perseverance work with the idea of ingenuity for your team a marcella copter call ingenuity on aerobic or perseverance how much more perfect can I get you know Mars helicopter is a first of a kind system that's going to attempt the very first flight of a helicopter on another planet right very much like a Wright brothers first test flight moment and it took ingenuity hard work and definitely perseverance to get to where we are today and here we are ingenuity helicopter integrated on perseverance Rover or launch to Mars for the very first flight tests on the surface of Mars and I heard that the team found out about the name this morning how did it all go oh it was incredible a big part of our team a subset of our team got together and we got to have the name shared very shortly you know before the announcement we had it shared by the student of venice' that wrote the essay that inspired the name and it was an incredible experience we it's an extraordinary moment for our team really it's been a very tough challenging journey our team has been just inspired by this opportunity this chance to build the first of a kind system that will introduce the aerial dimension to the way we do deep-space exploration today right ability to fly in the atmosphere of another planet or another planetary target and so we've been really driven by all of this over the past five or six years and this is definitely one of those extremely special moments where we have a name you know for this helicopter that we've been working so hard on I kept saying throughout the whole event the meeting though that I one thing i really wish was that i could have been in the room in person with everyone in the team you know but with the current situation it was done through remote meeting but i can't I really wish I really really wish that I could have been in the room with everybody else we're just such a tight team and I really wish we could have been all together nevertheless it was a great event very I'll never forget this day oh that's so great to hear now thanks for answering my questions I have some ask NASA questions to ask now the first one it's very similar Kwan AJ want to ask what Daniel is asking what are some of the difficulties when designing airborne machines for use in other atmospheres when compared to Earth's and is there a way the NASA team can simulate Mars like environments on earth for testing yes definitely flying a helicopter for Mars in this very thin atmosphere you know with a different mark number and Reynolds number combination just a different atmospheric composition and very different atmospheric density turns out to be quite different from designing a helicopter for us and so we really a team had to go back all the way to the fundamentals of modeling the lift and the drag of a blade really optimize it and then develop a helicopter around there it has to be very light you know as you know it has our helicopter weighs about 1.8 kilograms it has Systrom it has to spin extremely fast about 2400 RPM so the very first challenge was to meet that stringent mass constraint to fit all of the autonomous capability autonomous flight autonomous survival staying warm through the cold night being able to communicate being able to charge itself you know through the Sun and storing the energy and having enough energy to survive the cold ice and flying coming up with a design with those constraints that was the first challenge we overcame and then second is to build and test it in terms of the environment to test on earth we utilize a special facility called the space simulator facility a chamber is a special chamber at JPL I said 25 foot diameter chamber that can be pumped down to vacuum and what we did was we pumped that vacuum down to near vacuum bag filled with carbon dioxide to represent the Martian atmosphere and you know and and performed our test flights there one thing that we can't compensate on on earth it's the gravity the gravity on Mars is significantly less than on earth right like about 40% compared to Earth's so we did add a gravity offload just to offload the helicopter at a consistent you know difference to make up for the different gravity that's the question everyone wanted to know and now I have one from Brian and Malloy from Facebook who asks how long can ingenuity sustain flight does it solar charge or return to the rover to dock and recharge yes so ingenuity can fly up to about 90 seconds there how we've designed it for this first of a kind vehicle this is a small proof of concept vehicle so for this vehicle we have decided to fly up to 90 seconds we can in that distance we can do up to about 300 meters round-trip in bed and if the vehicle has a solar panel and it it will be recharged to this color panel and will be storing the energy in the batteries and supplying the energy so it's the ultimate ultimate green machine it's powered by solar energy we store the energy and we you know we kind of supply we apply the energy for flying and surviving at night so we will not be going back to the rover to recharge in fact once perseverance Rover delivers us to the surface and drives away we never will be returning to the rover instead we'll be communicating wirelessly the helicopter will communicate wirelessly to the base station that we have left on the rover and the base station will talk to the rover which will relay the messages back and forth to the helicopter and we have another question about survival and that bumble on Twitter actually asks what about the storms on Mars will the helicopter blades survive this yes so this helicopter is designed to be able to fight the winds up to nine ten meters per second during flight and those are lower speeds then those are let's see our vehicle is designed to fight the worst predicted wind level okay so definitely the way the controllability of the blades that the way we have structured the rotor system matches the worst predicted win and with margin on top of that okay so it will be flying during the well known conditions and then while is sitting on the surface with the lakes feet firmly planted on the ground it can take even much higher winds because the dynamic on in the atmosphere of Mars will actually be much less so you'll be able to take much higher level of winds so yes we very carefully designed the helicopter to take on the winds that we expect to encounter in that regard what steps will happen once it lands on Mars are there going to be certain milestones it has to hit yes so ingenuity is the very first flight test on Mars remember so very analogous to the think of the Wright brothers very first flight on earth except we're gonna do it at Mars so on earth we have tested the Marcela copter all that we can in the simulated environment that we just discussed and the next step it's now to perform this test test the helicopter in the environment that we've designed it for in space and at Mars so with that the high risk but very high reward flight experiment that we're going for at Mars and we have a checklist of milestones that we will be looking for checking off and learning every step of the way so the first step will start with surviving the launch in the trip to Mars and getting to the surface and getting deployed to the surface of Mars in confirming our first communication from the helicopter to the base station on the rover and then surviving the first coal night autonomously you know the temperatures are very cold minus ninety degrees Celsius in the nighttime at Mars surviving the helicopter standing on its own surviving their first night it's a major milestone a big checkmark will get confirming that we're charging through the solar panel and garnering the energy a big checkmark then the very first spin on Mars and then the very first lift and then the very first flight in the very first landing and then after that we'll be repeating the flights within the 30 Martian souls that we have available to us for our flight experiments so we are really looking forward to learning every step of the way going across our checklists in mentally and medically we're really looking forward to learning from every single step that's great and Allah star on Twitter has a question kind of looking into the future if this is a proven method of exploration could it be used more and in greater numbers oh absolutely this is the first of a kind proof of concept proof of concept technology demonstration flight to show that we can fly and operate a helicopter at Mars from Earth right and like you say it is just the Pathfinder and our team has been working really hard over the five years because of the motivation to introduce aerial to mention what's once we proven it our dream is the future larger more capable vehicles that are more autonomous much longer flight times carrying larger payloads you know we're imagining this is a 1.8 kilogram system we can imagine 10 kilogram plus systems carrying you know one to two kilograms of payload very specialized payload to service Scouts for you know Rovers getting high-definition images before the long traverses and reconnaissance for astronauts for exploration at Mars when humans start to explore in person over there at Mars right in addition Ariel to mesh areola vehicles will allow us to get to X areas that we simply cannot access today you know Rovers cannot get to sites are very steep cliffs that are areas of interest to us or very steep volcanoes that we cannot get into being able to fly about will you enable us to extend our exploration through the aerial dimension complementary to how we explore on the surface with Rovers and spacecraft in orbit today and you can imagine the audience can imagine the next generation you must imagine so our team is simply introducing the aerial dimension where we are really externally proud and really grateful for this opportunity to get a chance to show how we would fly but it's really up to future generations to take flight literally in the aerial dimension that's great thank you so much Mimi for answering our questions and thank you for all the as NASA questions thanks again thank you now perseverance with ingenuity on board is set to launch from Cape Canaveral Florida this summer and it will land on Mars February 18 20 21 and in the learning space section of the JPL website we have some fun hands-on projects to share with you now if you have kids at home you can make your own paper helicopter and you know what it actually works check this out you can fly just like they can at home and you can explore the Red Planet like the Mars ingenuity helicopter will by learning to program a video game now all the projects are available at JPL NASA gov
