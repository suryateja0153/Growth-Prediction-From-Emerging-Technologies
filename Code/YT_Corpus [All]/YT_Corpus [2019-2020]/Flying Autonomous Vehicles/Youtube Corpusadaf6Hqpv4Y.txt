 thank you here it is the future truck 2025 from Daimler. Thanks to a so called highway pilot this truck drives autonomously on the freeway. The concept vehicle gives a technologically accurate idea about commercial trucking of tomorrow. Aerodynamic design and modern LED lighting that replaces conventional headlights bring the face of this concept vehicle to life. It convincingly combines functionality, efficiency and emotion. Comparable to an autopilot in a plane that radar sensors and dual camera system of the highway pilot makes autonomous driving possible without relying on other vehicles or any kind of guiding infrastructure. This highly intelligent system relieves the driver from tedious driving as he gains time for other tasks and communication. The intelligent highway pilot reacts to a wide range of traffic situations such as moving over for approaching emergency vehicle. In spite of all the sophisticated technology it is the driver who remains in charge and in no way will the highway pilot replace the driver it simply makes this job easier while increasing the overall safety. Due to this increased safety, lower fuel consumption and overall reduction of costs the future truck 2025 fundamentally changes commercial traffic the job of the truck driver and the business of commercial trucker. But the question remains when will you see this truck on the road near you Unity's and gives our customers new opportunities
