 technology is making our cars smarter that's why Denver's testing out a new program meant to improve your drive Joe Hill and got a first-hand look at the technology joins us now to talk more about it so Joe how does it work well Carinae uses specialized equipment like we see here at the inter fact intersection of Colfax in Bannack do you see it up there it's got the antennas but what it does is collects data from enabled cars and sends it back to Denver Public Works once it gets back there they can use that data to trust drastically change your commute where all this is heading is this traffic intersection would know that there's 20 cars coming from this direction 15 cars from that direction that there's an ambulance three minutes away and that there's a pedestrian he needs 10 more seconds to cross and it would dynamically load balance all of that Mathieu McAllister has been working with the city of Denver to make our transportation system smarter to do that they need data a lot of what we're doing out here is basically like turning on every single switch and making sure we're getting the maximum a federal grant is helping equip city vehicles with devices that will turn on a flow of data from the vehicle is establishing that two-way communication between the person us and the infrastructure of the signal michael finocchio is an engineer with Denver Public Works he says this technology could help them make our commute smoother anything from a bridge freezing over to an accident taking place will know instantly we can send that message out this includes snowplows they're gonna say yeah I'm coming through the plow is down and the light will be able to say okay I'm going to give you a green light to accommodate that snow plow activity or for an emergency vehicle I'm going to cut away right now make sure that the emergency vehicle can clear through intersections safely pretty cool technology huh Jim Karen we've all been there it's 11 o'clock at night we're finally off work we pull up to a red light and we stop for absolutely no-one if our car has this technology in it it will be able to announce to the intersection we're coming before we even get there and the light will stay green live in Denver Joel Hilla covering Colorado first oh boy can't get here fast enough Jill thanks so much
