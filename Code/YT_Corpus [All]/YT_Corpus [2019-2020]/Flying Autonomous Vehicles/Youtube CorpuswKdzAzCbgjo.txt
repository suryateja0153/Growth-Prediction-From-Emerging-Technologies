 With our vehicle here we want to demo concepts like ride-hailing robo-taxis. Where you pool people in one car, reducing traffic on the streets and help saving the environment and reducing the pollution. It's a level 4 and level 5 vehicle which can drive autonomously. The special thing on that vehicle is: it doesn't have any steering wheel anymore. It doesn't have any pedals. We have integrated a complete ZF autonomous system. Our system contains of three main parts. It's the "see" part, the "think " part and the "act " part. On the ''see'' side, we use camera, radar and lidar - all from ZF. On the ''think'' part, we have the ProAI which is the most powerful computer you can get in the vehicle. And on the ''act'' part, we have the braking system, steering system and drivetrain system all from ZF and all those in our autonomous system. We want to deliver a complete package for the customer who can bought that product package and build it in his car and have a full autonomous car. It doesn't matter if it's logistic or it's ride-hailing or robo-taxis, things like that. So the OEMs can come to us and get the complete package.
