 six months ago the City of Grand Rapids started using for electric driverless vehicles to shuttle passengers around downtown well the one year test period is about halfway over tonight thirteen on your side's Elena Holland looks at how things are going so far we're riding fear in the AVG are the autonomous vehicle here in Grand Rapids it's about halfway through it's a year-long pilot program and we met up with the fleet technician and the city to see how it was going how you doing today pearl in Monroe that's awesome please make sure you buckle your seatbelt so we got to make sure you're safe Paul Holloman gears up for another rider in his vehicle but don't call him a driver he's a fleet technician that's because this shuttle is driving itself it feels like a ghost is driving because the steering wheel will move the brakes will apply the turn signal will come on he's operating one of the autonomous vehicles around Grand Rapids today the roads are a bit wet so he's actually doing most of the driving but he wipes off the sensors once the rain stops that could cause potentially a problem and lets a car take over ran Rapids partnered with the shuttles parent company called may mobility in July of last year we are seeing you know about 400 people a day ride the vehicle it only seats six people at a time and you know if only a couple vehicles and service throughout the day that's a tremendous amount of response we've seen from from the community and there have been some updates to the program since it first launched just this month May mobility introduced a new on-demand vehicle with wheelchair access that complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Holliman says he's seen changes to the rounds we had some issues where the vehicle would pull into the stop will either a little too little too or a little too late so they made that a lot smoother they've slowed down the speeds Ottawa - to make it a lot safer and these shuttles have proven to be fairly safe there have been like a couple little crashes along the way but nothing that is there have been no injuries though the one that I was aware of was you know it's manual mode and it was somebody that just wasn't like a fender bender and for Holloman he says being at the ground level of this technology is frankly pretty neat this was things that I was watching as I was a kid like I'm the Jetsons and things so it's kind of interesting to see it start to happen right in front of me in Grand Rapids I'm Elena Holland 13 on your side
