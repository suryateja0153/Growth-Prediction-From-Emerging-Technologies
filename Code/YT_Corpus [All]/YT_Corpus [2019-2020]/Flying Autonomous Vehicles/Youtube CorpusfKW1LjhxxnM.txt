 welcome to TTI welcome to a whole new world of science fun and machines but before we begin subscribe now and don't miss anything fly ride the fly ride is a fun water vehicle designed by French company Zapata to be an innovative addition to the water vehicle market some like other water vehicles however the fly ride can literally fly thanks to its elegant design operating the fly ride is as simple as riding a bicycle a motorcycle or a jet ski and one of its most remarkable features are the built in sensors which maintain the balance of the vehicle regardless of the skill of the ride this makes the fly ride extremely easy to ride even if you have no prior experience and maybe part of the reason why it's proving to be extremely popular in the recreational vehicle market when you activate a special safety mode you can use a remote control to guide the vehicle to perform stunts which is an amazing feat to witness as the fly ride has a maximum travel speed of 35 kilometres an hour a battery capacity which powers seven hours of operation and the capacity to see two people i Gress ng the world is in the middle of a food scarcity crisis and farmers have been trying their very best to develop modern technologies that can help make up the difference the a gross energy is a drone developed in China to help boost food production and assist millions of farmers around the world in their quest to be more effective in their farming processes it makes use of unmanned aerial vehicle technology to assist with the delivery and distribution processes of fertilizer and weed control substances in order to make use of this amazing machine the farmer first has to map out the area to be worked on activate the drone so that it stores this field in the memory base and then treasure the drone to fly around and deploy fertilizer and pesticides carrying out processes that would take the equivalent of 50 humans in less than a quarter of the time the a gross energy can carry up to ten kilograms of fertilizer or pesticides with the intensity of spraying depending on your adjustments and sensors giving the drone information on the best practices for deployment to help make sure that they get the best crops and the world gets the food it needs to survive Stan parking is often one of the most annoying problems associated with driving in recognition of this prevalent problem Stan was developed by French company Stanley robotics to make all of our lives easier designed specifically for crowded parking near large airports the stand can be used in a number of urban sites to help take passenger cars from crowded garages and park them much closer and more efficiently than humanly possible this works because the robots have the advantage of an ultra precise orientation system and because there's typically no need to open the doors working with a special wheeled platform the Stan has the ability to move under cars clamp the wheels and move the vehicles to precisely the right spots to conserve space when the car is required the robot moves it to the outermost row to make it more convenient to collect and making your parking experience ultimately stress-free as time goes on the Stan will be available in airports in Lyon and Gatwick great news if you hate personal parking tighten shoe cover dispenser at a time when diseases are rampant the tighten shoe dispenser comes to help protect the world from transmitted diseases this device has proven to be popular in hospitals and beauty shops basically every location where hygiene is paramount this dispenser contains up to 50 pairs of disposable shoe covers and it has a display that shows you just how many shoe covers remain to ensure that you are never out when you least expect it aside from just dispensing shoe covers this machine can also help you put them on all you have to do is place your foot on the special rest for a couple of seconds and the machine does the rest regardless of the type of shoes you're wearing drastically reducing the risk of infection transmission in your workplace Vigo clean streets are the hallmark of a functioning society with a Vigo you can rest assured that your streets are kept clean all the time with no regard for time and weather conditions usually an effort intensive exercise the Vigo was developed in China to help ease the stress associated with street sweeping it is an automatic street sweeper machine that was developed to function without the need for human input the Vigo can maneuver past major obstacles function in all manners of weather conditions and functions regardless of the temperature and time of day it has been demonstrated to be able to function in temperatures ranging from minus 20 to plus 40 degrees for six to eight hours and it can clean up to 40 kilometres of road on one charge Bumba manually lifting roofing supplies the heights during construction is one of the most effort intensive activities you can think of previously done by hand nowadays these materials can be delivered with the use of a machine that functions as a compact in mobile lift this machine can be used to transport a wide variety of materials such as bricks or stone blocks and it has been demonstrated to help cut down on the time and effort used in material transportation by as much as 75% this ingenious machine can be operated by just two people and can lift enough tiles to cover 300 square meters the lift is also capable of both raising and lowering building materials from as high as 9 meters making it an indispensable part of any construction operation elf we all love bicycles they are a fun transportation option that don't pollute our environment and gives us the opportunity for exercise the one disadvantage they have is the fact that they often cannot be used in poor weather at least they couldn't until now the elf created by American company organic transit integrates the best features of both cars and bicycles it is a three-wheeled solar-powered vehicle which is both environmentally friendly and operable in poor weather made for people under the weight limit of 250 kilograms and capable of speeds of up to 32 km/h in the electric mode and 48 km/h with the help of pedal traction it has been determined that one battery charge is enough to cover 77 kilometers swag roller the last vehicle we want to show you is relatively cheap but still packed full with utility even though it is priced at an affordable 300 US dollars the swag roller lives up to its name by providing a compact completely environmentally friendly vehicle with a self balancing system that guarantees an easy ride it can be ridden by complete novices and can travel up to 20 kilometers on a three-hour charge designed to be driven on footpaths with a large number of people the swag roller can be used when there is a need to overcome small obstacles and drive at a 15 degree angle
