 The 2019 Unmanned System World Congress kicked off today in Seoul,... showcasing a number of future technologies... from drones to self-driving cars and more. Our Yoon Jung-min reports. Drones, self-driving vehicles, robots, and unmanned weaponry are promising technologies,... and a potential boon for the local economy as well. To promote future technology and connect businesses to buyers,... the 2019 Unmanned System World Congress kicked off on Wednesday in Seoul... with some 132 firms, universities and government institutions taking part. Drones represent one of the most promising future technologies at the expo. Unmanned flying objects can conduct a variety of missions,... whether they be military operations, delivery or aerial filming... in remote places that are difficult for people to access. "The ROK built the drone-bot combat system some 20 years ago. Drones are used not only for reconnaissance but to strike targets and provide operational support. Future combat will rely on unmanned weapons based on both manned and unmanned systems. Among them, drone-bots are one of the most effective ones." Autonomous vehicles are also under the spotlight. The private sector and the government have been working together to develop and commercialize self-driving vehicles to nurture this future industry. "As for the autonomous vehicles, demand is currently high from public institutions in Seoul and Sejong City especially, for public service use. We plan to further develop these cars and mass produce them so that ordinary people can also access them in five years." "For those who wish to learn more about autonomous moving systems and see these products on display, the expo runs until this Friday. Yoon Jung-min, Arirang News."
