 we promised the world a five-seater jet today we are delivering on that promise it takes off and lands vertically it's fully electric this is the lilium jet [Music] this is first time that we have a full-scale full-weight prototype of that five seater version this is the next step in mobility as we perceive it what we're trying to achieve here is an air mobility revolution we look at what is possible by the laws of physics [Music] our principle of maximum simplicity combined with a level of safety it is really something that makes us unique this is the product there's nothing like this there's always a risk if you do something you [Music] at some point you have to say we have tested everything now let's fly this aircraft [Music] there's this one moment where everything comes together and where it's make-or-break this is the everything defining moment for all of us taking off in three [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] first flights are always crucial but the launch of course for us is just a small piece in this whole process the testing will go on the refinements the engineering will will continue [Music] you
