 [Music] Tesla's gonna win level 5 they really are so let's talk about it you think you're focused on level 2 currently currently we're gonna be one to two years behind Tesla getting to level five okay we're interested right we're enjoying it you're in I'm just saying once Tesla gets it we're one to two years behind I'm not making any timeline on when Tesla's that's right you did that's brilliant so that what do you think about this the most level four companies are kind of just doing their usual safety driver during full time and kind of testing and then Tesla does basically trying to go from lane-keeping to full autonomy what do you think about that approach how successful would it be a ton better approach because Tesla is gathering data on a scale that none of them are they're putting real users behind the behind the wheel the cars it's I think the only strategy that works the incremental well so there's a few components to test approach that's that's more than just incrementally you spoke with is the ones the software so over-the-air software updates necessity I mean way more ease have those - those aren't but those differentiate from the automakers right no link keeping assist systems have no cars a link keeping system have that except Tesla yeah and the other one is the data the other direction which is the ability to query the data I don't think they're actually collecting as much days people think but the ability to turn on collection and turn it off you
