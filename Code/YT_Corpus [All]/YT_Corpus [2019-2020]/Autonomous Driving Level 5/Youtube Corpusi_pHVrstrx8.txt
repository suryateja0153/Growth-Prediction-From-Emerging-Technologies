 a self-driving car also known as a robot car autonomous car or driverless car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving with little or no human input autonomous cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings such as radar litter sonar GPS odometry and inertial measurement units advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths as well as obstacles and relevant signage long-distance trucks are seen as being in the forefront of adopting and implementing the technology you topic history experiments have been conducted on automated driving systems ads since at least the 1920s trials began in the 1950s the first truly automated car was developed in 1977 by Japan's Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory the vehicle tracked white street markers which were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle using an analog computer for signal processing the vehicle reached speeds up to 30 km/h 19 miles per hour with the support of an elevated rail autonomous prototype cars appeared in the 1980s with Carnegie Mellon University's nav lab and ALV projects funded by DARPA starting in 1984 and mercedes-benz and Bundeswehr University Munich Surekha Prometheus project in 1987 by 1985 the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of 31 km/h 19 miles per hour with obstacle avoidance added in 1986 and off-road driving in day and nighttime conditions by 1987 from the 1960s through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005 automated vehicle research in the US was primarily funded by DARPA the US Army and the US Navy yielding incremental advances in speeds driving competence in more complex conditions controls and sensor systems companies and research organizations have developed prototypes the u.s. allocated 650 million dollars in 1991 for research on the National automated highway system which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure the program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale partly funded by the National automated highway system and DARPA the Carnegie Mellon University navlab drove 4584 kilometers 2848 miles across America in 1995 4,500 one kilometers 2797 miles or 98% of it autonomously Navin stood unmatched for two decades until 2015 when Delphi improved it by piloting an audi augmented with Delphi technology over 5,400 72 kilometers 3400 miles through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time in 2015 the US states of Nevada Florida California Virginia and Michigan together with Washington DC allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads in 2017 od stated that its latest a eight would be automated at speeds of up to 60 km/h 37 miles per hour using its LD AI the driver would not have to do safety checks such as frequently gripping the steering wheel the Audi a8 was claimed to be the first production car to reach level three automated driving an Audi would be the first manufacturer to use laser scanners in addition to cameras and ultrasonic sensors for their system in November 2017 wham-o announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position however there was still an employee in the car in October 2018 wham-o announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10 million miles 16 million kilometers increasing by about 1 million miles 1 million six hundred thousand kilometers per month in December 2018 wham-o was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the US you topic definitions there is some inconsistency in terminology used in the self-driving car industry various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary such confusion has been documented in sage a 301 six which states that some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation level 5 while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any adds at our above level 3 or to any vehicle equipped with such an adze you topic words definition and safety considerations modern vehicles provide partly automated features such as keeping the car within its lane speed controls or emergency braking nonetheless differences remain between a fully autonomous self-driving car on one hand and driver assistance technologies on the other hand according to the BBC confusion between those concepts leads to deaths Association of British Insurers considers the usage of the word autonomous in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous because car ads make motorists think autonomous and autopilot means a vehicle can drive itself when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety technology alone still is not able to drive the car when some car makers suggest or claim vehicles are self-driving when they are only partly automated drivers risk becoming excessively confident leading to crashes while fully self-driving cars are still a long way off in the UK you topic autonomous versus automated autonomous means self-governing many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been automated made automatic subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment such as magnetic strips autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention one approach as to implement communication networks both in the immediate vicinity for collision avoidance and farther away for congestion management such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicles autonomy while still not requiring human intervention would at all 2012 wrote this article generally uses the term autonomous instead of the term automated the term autonomous was chosen because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use and thus is more familiar to the general public however the latter term is arguably more accurate automated connotes control or operation by a machine while autonomous connotes acting alone or independently most of the vehicle concepts that we are currently aware of have a person in the driver's seat utilize a communication connection to the cloud or other vehicles and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them thus the term automated would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts as of 2017 most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles are with an enveloping management regime EuroNCAP defines autonomous in autonomous emergency braking as the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident which implies the autonomous system is not the driver you topic autonomous versus cooperative to make a car travel without any driver embedded within the vehicle some system makers used a remote driver but according to sage a 301 6 some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous you topic self-driving car emerg says the self-driving car timeline predictions from the top 11 global automakers PC Mag definition as a computer-controlled car that drives itself also called an autonomous vehicle and driverless car self-driving cars date back to the 1939 New York World's Fair when General Motors predicted the development of self-driving radio-controlled electric cars you see s us a definition as self-driving vehicles are cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle also known as autonomous or driverless cars they combine sensors and software to control navigate and drive the vehicle currently there are no legally operating fully autonomous vehicles in the United States nhtsa definition as these self-driving vehicles ultimately will integrate unto us roadways by progressing through six levels of driver assistance technology advancements in the coming years this includes everything from no automation we're a fully engaged driver is required at all times to full autonomy we're an automated vehicle operates independently without a human driver NHTSA definition Asst let's be clear fully automated or self-driving vehicles aren't arriving in showrooms tomorrow they're likely years maybe even decades away what we're experiencing is an evolution in vehicle safety that is leading toward cars and trucks that help us drive more safely according to Emory this means the vehicle can safely drive itself under specific conditions but the driver will need to quickly intervene when called on this is a car that could drive itself on the highway while you watch a movie but would need you to take control when you get off the highway some may view this is only partially self driving according to Emory it will be useful to understand that most executives referring to self-driving are referring to levels 3 & 4 you topic classification a classification system based on six different levels ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems was published in 2014 by say international an automotive standardization body as J 301 6 taxonomy and definitions for terms related to unload more vehicle automated driving systems this classification system is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required rather than the vehicle capabilities although these are very loosely related in the United States in 2013 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA released a formal classification system but abandoned this system in favor of the SE standard in 2016 also in 2016 se updated its classification called je 301 6 underscore 200 1609 you topic levels of driving automation in SAEs automation level definitions driving mode means a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements eg expressway merging high speed cruising low speed traffic jam closed campus operations etc level zero automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control level one hands on the driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle examples are systems where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls engine power to maintain a set speed cruise control or engine and brake power to maintain and vary speed adaptive cruise control or ACC and parking assistance where steering is automated while speed as under manual control the driver must be ready to retake full control at any time lane-keeping assistance lk a type ii as a further example of level one self driving level two hands off the automated system takes full control of the vehicle accelerating braking and steering the driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly the short hand hands off is not meant to be taken literally in fact contact between hand and wheel as often mandatory during se - driving to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene level 3 eyes off the driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks eg the driver can text or watch a movie the vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response like emergency braking the driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time specified by the manufacturer when called upon by the vehicle to do so level 4 mind off as level 3 but no driver attention as ever required for safety eg the driver may safely go to bleep or leave the driver's seat self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas geo-fenced or under special circumstances like traffic jams outside of these areas are circumstances the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip eg parked the car if the driver does not retake control level-5 steering wheel optional no human intervention is required at all an example would be a robotic taxi in the formal se definition below note in particular what happens in the shift from say two to say three the human driver no longer has to monitor the environment this is the final aspect of the dynamic driving task that is now passed over from the human to the automated system at say 3:00 the human driver still has the responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system at safe or the human driver is relieved of that responsibility and at safe five the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention you topic legal definition in the District of Columbia DC code autonomous vehicle means a vehicle capable of navigating district roadways and interpreting traffic control devices without a driver actively operating any of the vehicles control systems the term autonomous vehicle excludes a motor vehicle enabled with active safety systems or driver assistance systems including systems to provide electronic blind-spot assistance crash avoidance emergency braking parking assistance adaptive cruise control lane keep assistance lane departure warning or traffic jam and cueing assistance unless the system alone or in combination with other systems enables the vehicle on which the technology is installed to drive without active control or monitoring by a human operator in the same district code it is considered that an autonomous vehicle may operate on a public roadway provided that the vehicle one has a manual override feature that allows a driver to assume control of the autonomous vehicle at any time two has a driver seated in the control seat of the vehicle while in operation who is prepared to take control of the autonomous vehicle at any moment and three is capable of operating in compliance with the district's applicable traffic laws and motor vehicle laws and traffic control devices you topic semi-automated vehicles between manually driven vehicles say level zero and fully autonomous vehicles say level five there are a variety of vehicle types that can be described to have some degree of automation these are collectively known as semi automated vehicles as it could be a while before the technology and infrastructure is developed for full automation it is likely that vehicles will have increasing levels of automation these semi automated vehicles could potentially harness many of the advantages of fully automated vehicles while still keeping the driver in charge of the vehicle you topic technical challenges there are different systems that help the self-driving car control the car systems that currently need improvement include the car navigation system the location system the electronic map the map matching the global path planning the environment perception the laser perception the radar perception the visual perception the vehicle control the perception of vehicle speed and direction the vehicle control method the challenge for driverless car designers as to produce control systems capable of analyzing sensory data in order to provide accurate detection of other vehicles in the road ahead modern self-driving cars generally use Bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping slam algorithms which fuse data from multiple sensors and an offline map into current location estimates and map updates wham-o has developed a variant of slam with detection and tracking of other moving objects dat mo which also handles obstacles such as cars and pedestrians simpler systems may use roadside real-time locating system RTLS technologies to aid localization typical sensors include litter stereo vision GPS and IMU control systems on automated cars may use sensor fusion which is an approach that integrates information from a variety of sensors on the car to produce a more consistent accurate and useful view of the environment driverless vehicles require some form of machine vision for the purpose of visual object recognition automated cars are being developed with deep neural networks a type of deep learning architecture with many computational stages or levels in which neurons are simulated from the environment that activate the network the neural network depends on an extensive amount of data extracted from real-life driving scenarios enabling the neural network to learn how to execute the best course of action in May 2018 researchers from MIT announced that they had built an automated car that can navigate unmapped roads researchers at their computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory CSA il have developed a new system called map light which allows self-driving cars to drive on roads that they have never been on before without using 3d maps the system combines the GPS position of the vehicle a sparse topological map such as OpenStreetMap ie having to defeat years of the roads only and a series of sensors that observe the road conditions heavy rainfall hail or snow could impede the car sensors you topic nature of the digital technology autonomous vehicles as a digital technology have certain characteristics that distinguishes them from other types of technologies and vehicles due to these characteristics autonomous vehicles are able to be more transformative and agile to possible changes the characteristics will be explained based on the following subjects homogeneous Asian and decoupling connectivity reprogrammable and smart digital traces and modularity you topic homogeneous ation and decoupling homogenous Asian comes from the fact that all digital information assumes the same form during the ongoing evolution of the digital era certain industry standards have been developed on how to store digital information and in what type of format this concept of homogenous Asian also implies two autonomous vehicles in order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information eg radar GPS motion sensors and computer vision due to homogeneous ation the digital information from these different techniques is stored in a homogeneous way this implies that all digital information comes in the same form which means their differences are decoupled and digital information can be transmitted stored and computed in a way that the vehicles and its operating system can better understand and act upon it homogeneous a ssin also helps to exponentially increase the computing power of hard and software Moore's law which also supports the autonomous vehicles to understand and act upon the digital information in a more cost-effective way therefore lowering the marginal costs you topic connectivity connectivity means that users of a certain digital technology can connect easily with other users other applications or even other enterprises in the case of autonomous vehicles it is essential for them to connect with other devices in order to function most effectively autonomous vehicles are equipped with communication systems which allow them to communicate with other autonomous vehicles and roadside units to provide them amongst other things with information about roadwork or traffic congestion in addition scientists believe that the future will have computer programs that connect and manage each individual autonomous vehicle as it navigates through an intersection this type of connectivity must replace traffic lights and stop signs these types of characteristics drive and further develop the ability of autonomous vehicles to understand and cooperate with other products and services such as intersection computer systems in the autonomous vehicles market this could lead to a network of autonomous vehicles all using the same network and information available on that network eventually this can lead to more autonomous vehicles using the network because the information has been validated through the usage of other autonomous vehicles such movements will strengthen the value of the network and is called Network externalities you topic reprogrammable another characteristic of autonomous vehicles is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities instead of the chassis and its engine this is because autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner eg update in better distinguishing blind person versus non blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person a characteristic of this reprogrammable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier because through machine learning smart autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly eg new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems these reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software this also implies that autonomous vehicles are never finished because the product can be continuously be improved you topic digital traces autonomous vehicles are equipped with different sorts of sensors and radars as said this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other autonomous vehicles and or roadside units this implies that autonomous vehicles leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate the data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new to be determined products or updates to enhance autonomous vehicles driving ability or safety you topic modularity traditional vehicles and their accompanying traditional technologies are manufactured as a product that will be complete and unlike autonomous vehicles they can only be improved if they are redesigned or reproduced as said autonomous vehicles are produced but due to their digital characteristics never finished this is because autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a layered modular architecture the layered modular architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices networks services and contents into autonomous vehicles these loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces one the first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer this layer consists of the following two parts logical capability and physical machinery the physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself eg chassis and Karis arey when it comes to digital technologies the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous the logical capability provides the control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers to on top of the device layer comes the network layer this layer also consists of two different parts physical transport and logical transmission the physical transport layer refers to the radars sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information next to that the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms are between layers this increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables computational power of a network or platform 3 the service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle and its owners as they extract create store and consume content with regards to their own driving history traffic congestion roads or parking abilities for example and for the final layer of the model as the contents layer this layer contains the sounds images and videos the autonomous vehicles store extract and used to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment the contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the contents origin ownership copyright encoding methods content tags geo timestamps and so on you at Owl 2010 the consequence of layered modular architecture of autonomous vehicles and other digital technologies is that it enables the emergence and development of platforms and ecosystems around a product and or certain modules of that product traditionally automotive vehicles were developed manufactured and maintained by traditional manufacturers nowadays app developers and content creators can help to develop more comprehensive product experience for the consumers which creates a platform around the product of autonomous vehicles you topic human factor challenges self-driving cars are already exploring the difficulties of determining the intentions of pedestrians bicyclists and animals and models of behavior must be programmed into driving algorithms human road users also have the challenge of determining the intentions of autonomous vehicles where there is no driver with which to make eye contact or exchange hand signals dr dot AI is testing a solution to this problem that involves LED signs mounted on the outside of the vehicle announcing status such as going now don't cross versus waiting for you to cross to human factor challenges are important for safety one is the handoff from automated driving to manual driving which may become necessary due to unfavorable or unusual road conditions or if the vehicle has limited capabilities a sudden handoff could leave a human driver dangerously unprepared in the moment in the long term humans who have less practice at driving might have a lower skill level and thus be more dangerous in manual mode the second challenge is known as risk compensation as a system is perceived to be safer instead of benefiting entirely from all of the increased safety people engage in riskier behavior and enjoy other benefits semi automated cars have been shown to suffer from this problem for example with users of Tesla autopilot ignoring the road and using electronic devices or other activities against the advice of the company that the car is not capable of being completely autonomous in the near future pedestrians and bicyclists may travel in the street in a riskier fashion if they believe self-driving cars are capable of avoiding them in order for people to buy self-driving cars and vote for the government to allow them on roads the technology to be trusted as safe self-driving elevators were invented in 1900 but the high number of people refusing to use them slowed adoption for several decades until operator strikes increased demand and Trust was built with advertising and features like the emergency stop button you topic testing testing vehicles with varying degrees of automation can be done physically in closed environments on public roads where permitted typically with a license or permit or adhering to a specific set of operating principles or virtually ie in computer simulations when driven on public roads automated vehicles require a person to monitor their proper operation and take over when needed for example New York State has strict requirements for the test driver so that at all times the vehicle can be corrected by a licensed driver highlighted by cardian cube company's application and discussions with New York State officials and the NYS DMV Apple is currently testing self driven cars and has increased the number of test vehicles from 3 to 27 in January 2018 and to 45 in March 2018 Russian internet company Yandex started to develop self driven cars in 2016 in February 2018 they tested the prototype of an unmanned taxi on the streets of Moscow in June 2018 Yandex self-driving vehicle completed a 485 mile 780 kilometers trip on a federal highway from Moscow to Kazan staying in autonomous mode 99% of the time Yandex taxi in August 2018 start working with self driven cars in a Napoles Republic of Tatarstan on the territory of innopolis they will operate two unmanned vehicles with five stops for the first time the testing of an unmanned vehicle yandex outside russia was held in Las Vegas in January 2019 testing continued during the International Consumer Electronics Show CES 8 to 11 January Yandex received permission from the Ministry of Transport of Israel to test a company's unmanned vehicle on public roads in 2019 one way to assess the progress of automated vehicles as to compute the average distance driven between dis engagements when the automated system is turned off typically by a human driver in 2017 wham-o reported 63 dis engagements over 350 2545 miles five hundred sixty seven thousand three hundred sixty-six kilometers of testing or five thousand five hundred ninety six miles nine thousand six kilometers on average the highest among companies reporting such figures way moe also traveled more distance in total than any other their 2017 rate of 0.18 dis engagements per 1,000 miles 1600 kilometers was an improvement from 0.2 dis engagements per 1,000 miles 1,600 kilometers in 2016 and 0.8 in 2015 in March 2017 uber reported an average of 0.67 miles 1.08 kilometers per disengagement in the final three months of 2017 cruise automation now owned by GM averaged 5224 miles 8400 7 km/h 62 thousand six hundred eighty nine miles 100 thousand eight hundred eighty eight kilometers in July 2018 the first electric driverless racing car robocar completed 1.8 kilometers track using its navigation system and artificial intelligence you topic fields of application you topic automated trucks several companies are said to be testing automated technology in semi trucks Auto a self-driving trucking company that was acquired by uber in August 2016 demonstrated their trucks on the highway before being acquired in May 2017 San francisco-based startup embarked announced a partnership with truck manufacturer Peterbilt to test and deploy automated technology in Peterbilts vehicles wham-o has also said to be testing automated technology in trucks however no timeline has been given for the project in 2016 anheuser-busch Inc in uber Technologies Inc joined together and successfully made the first commercial delivery of beer using a self-driving truck no human action had involved in the driving process and the truck traveled 120 miles in March 2018 starsky robotics the San francisco-based automated truck company completed a seven mile 11 kilometers fully driverless trip in Florida without a single human in the truck Starsky robotics became the first player in the self-driving truck game to drive in fully automated mode on a public road without a person in the cab in Europe truck platooning is being considered with the safe road trains for the environment approached Lockheed Martin with funding from the US Army developed an automated truck convoying system that uses a lead truck operated by a human driver with a number of trucks following autonomously developed as part of the Army's autonomous mobility application AMA s the system consists of an automated driving package that has been installed on more than nine types of vehicles and has completed more than 55,000 hours of driving at speeds up to 64 km/h 40 miles per hour as of 2014 as of 2017 the army was planning to field 100 to 200 trucks as part of a rapid fielding program you topic transport systems in Europe cities in Belgium France Italy in the UK are planning to operate transport systems for automated cars and Germany the Netherlands and Spain have allowed public testing in traffic in 2015 the UK launched public trials of the Luntz Pathfinder automated pod in Milton Keynes beginning in summer 2015 the French government allowed PSA Peugeot Citroen to make trials in real conditions in the Paris Area the experiments were planned to be extended to other cities such as Bordeaux and Strasbourg by 2016 the alliance between French companies staleys and Valeo provider of the first self-parking car system that equips OD and Mercedes primi is testing its own system New Zealand is planning to use automated vehicles for public transport in Tauranga and Christchurch in China Baidu and Qing long produce automated minibus a vehicle with 14 seats but without driving seat with 100 vehicles produced 2018 will be the first year with commercial automated service in China those mini buses should be at level 4 that is driverless enclosed roads you topic potential advantages topic safety driving safety experts predict that once driverless technology has been fully developed traffic collisions and resulting deaths and injuries and costs caused by human error such as delayed reaction time tailgating rubbernecking and other forms of distracted or aggressive driving should be substantially reduced consulting firm McKinsey and company estimated that widespread use of autonomous vehicles could eliminate 90% of all auto accidents in the United States prevent up to 190 billion dollars in damages and health costs annually and save thousands of lives according to motorists website the dr.com operated by Time magazine none of the driving safety experts they were able to contact were able to rank driving under an autopilot system at the time 2017 as having achieved a greater level of safety than traditional fully hands-on driving so the degree to which these benefits asserted by proponents will manifest in practice cannot be assessed confounding factors that could reduce the net effect on safety may include unexpected interactions between humans and partly or fully automated vehicles or between different types of vehicle system complications at the boundaries of functionality at each automation level such as hand over when the vehicle reaches the limit of its capacity the effect of the bugs and flaws that inevitably occur in complex interdependent software systems sensor or data shortcomings and successful compromise by malicious intervenors to help reduce the possibility of these confounding factors some companies have begun to open-source parts of their driverless systems Udacity for instance is developing an open-source software stack and some companies are having similar approaches you topic welfare automated cars could reduce labor costs relieve travellers from driving and navigation chores thereby replacing behind the wheel commuting hours with more time for leisure or work and also would lift constraints on occupant ability to drive distracted and texting while driving intoxicated prone to seizures or otherwise impaired for the young the elderly people with disabilities and low-income citizens automated cars could provide enhanced mobility the removal of the steering wheel along with the remaining driver interface and the requirement for any occupant to assume a forward-facing position would give the interior of the cabin greater economic flexibility large vehicles such as motor homes would attain appreciably enhanced ease of use you topic traffic additional advantages could include higher speed limits smoother rides and increased roadway capacity and minimized traffic congestion due to decreased need for safety gaps and higher speeds currently maximum controlled-access highway throughput or capacity according to the u.s. highway capacity manual as about 2200 passenger vehicles per hour per Lane with about five percent of the available road space as taken up by cars one study estimated that automated cars could increase capacity by 273 percent approximately 8200 cars per hour per Lane the study also estimated that with 100 percent connected vehicles using vehicle to vehicle communication capacity could reach 12,000 passenger vehicles per hour up 545 percent from 2000 200 percent per hour per Lane traveling safely at 120 km/h 75 miles per hour with a following gap of about 6 meters 20 feet of each other currently at highway speeds drivers keep between 40 to 50 meters 130 to 160 feet away from the car in front these increases in highway capacity could have a significant impact in traffic congestion particularly in urban areas and even effectively end highway congestion in some places the ability for authorities to manage traffic flow would increase given the extra data and driving behavior predictability combined with less need for traffic police and even road signage you topic lower costs safer driving is expected to reduce the costs of vehicle insurance you topic energy and environmental impacts you vehicle automation can improve fuel economy of the car by optimizing the drive cycle reduced traffic congestion and the improvements in traffic flow due to widespread use of automated cars will translate into higher fuel efficiency additionally self-driving cars will be able to accelerate and brake more efficiently meaning higher fuel economy from reducing wasted energy typically associated with inefficient changes to speed however the improvement in vehicle energy efficiency does not necessarily translate to net reduction in energy consumption and positive environmental outcomes it is expected that convenience of the automated vehicles encourages the consumers to travel more and this induced demand may partially or fully offset the fuel efficiency improvement brought by automation over all the consequences of vehicle automation on global energy demand and emissions are highly uncertain and heavily depends on the combined effect of changes in consumer behavior policy intervention technological progress and vehicle technology you topic parking space manually driven vehicles are reported to be used only four to five percent of the time and being parked and unused for the remaining 95 to 96 percent of the time autonomous vehicles could on the other hand be used continuously after it has reached its destination this could dramatically reduce the need for parking space for example in Los Angeles 14 percent of the land is used for parking alone equivalent to some seventeen million twenty thousand five hundred ninety-four square meters this combined with the potential reduced need for road space due to improved traffic flow could free up tremendous amounts of land in urban areas which could then be used for parks recreational areas buildings among other uses making cities more livable you topic related effects by reducing the labor and other cost of mobility as a service automated cars could reduce the number of cars that are individually owned replaced by taxi pooling and other car sharing services this would also dramatically reduce the size of the automotive production industry with corresponding environmental and economic effects assuming the increased efficiency is not fully offset by increases in demand more efficient traffic flow could free roadway space for other uses such as better support for pedestrians and cyclists the vehicles increased awareness could aid the police by reporting on illegal passenger behavior while possibly enabling other crimes such as deliberately crashing into another vehicle or a pedestrian however this may also lead to much expanded mass surveillance if there is white access granted to third parties to the large datasets generated the future of passenger rail transport in the era of automated cars is not clear you topic potential limits or obstacles the sort of hoped for potential benefits from increased vehicle automation described may be limited by foreseeable challenges such as disputes over liability will each company operating a vehicle except that they are its driver and thus responsible for what their car does or will some try to project this liability onto others who are not in control the time needed to turn over the existing stock of vehicles from non automated to automated and thus a long period of humans and autonomous vehicles sharing the roads resistance by individuals to having to forfeit control of their cars concerns about the safety of driverless in practice and the implementation of a legal framework and consistent global government regulations for self-driving cars other obstacles could include de-skilling and lower levels of driver experience for dealing with potentially dangerous situations and anomalies ethical problems where an automated vehicle software is forced during an unavoidable crash to choose between multiple harmful courses of action the trolley problem concerns about making large numbers of people currently employed as drivers unemployed at the same time as many other alternate blue-collar occupations may be undermined by automation the potential for more intrusive mass surveillance of location association and travel as a result of police and intelligence agency access to large datasets generated by sensors and pattern recognition AI making anonymous travel difficult and possibly insufficient understanding of verbal sounds gestures and nonverbal cues by police other drivers or pedestrians possible technological obstacles for automated cars are artificial intelligence is still not able to function properly in chaotic inner-city environments a car's computer could potentially be compromised as could a communication system between cars susceptibility of the cars sensing and navigation systems to different types of weather such as snow or deliberate interference including jamming and spoofing avoidance of large animals requires recognition and tracking and Volvo found that software suited to caribou deer and elk was ineffective with kangaroos autonomous cars may require very high quality specialised maps to operate properly where these maps may be out of date they would need to be able to fall back to reasonable behaviors competition for the radio spectrum desired for the cars communication field program ability for the systems will require careful evaluation of product development and the component supply chain current road infrastructure may need changes for automated cars to function optimally social challenges include government over-regulation or even uncertainty about potential future regulation may delay deployment of automated cars on the road employment companies working on the technology have an increasing recruitment problem in that the available talent pool has not grown with demand as such education and training by third-party organizations such as providers of online courses and self-taught community driven projects such as DIY Robo cars and formula pie have quickly grown in popularity while university level extracurricular programs such as Formula Student driverless have bolstered Graduate experience industry is steadily increasing freely available information sources such as code data sets and glossaries to widen the recruitment pool you topic potential disadvantages a direct impact of widespread adoption of automated vehicles as the loss of driving related jobs in the road transport industry there could be resistance from professional drivers and unions who are threatened by job losses in addition there could be job losses in public transit services and crash repair shops the automobile insurance industry might suffer as the technology makes certain aspects of these occupations obsolete a frequently cited paper by Michael Osborne and Karl Benedict Frey found that automated cars would make many jobs redundant privacy could be an issue when having the vehicles location and position integrated into an interface in which other people have access to in addition there is the risk of automotive hacking through the sharing of information through v2v vehicle to vehicle and v2i vehicle to infrastructure protocols there is also the risk of terrorist attacks self-driving cars could potentially be loaded with explosives and used as bombs the lack of stressful driving more productive time during the trip and the potential savings in travel time and cost could become an incentive to live far away from cities where land is cheaper and work in the city's core thus increasing travel distances and inducing more urban sprawl more fuel consumption and an increase in the carbon footprint of urban travel there is also the risk that traffic congestion might increase rather than decrease appropriate public policies and regulations such as zoning pricing and urban design are required to avoid the negative impacts of increased suburbanization and longer distance travel some believe that once automation in vehicles reaches higher levels and becomes reliable drivers will pay less attention to the road research shows that drivers in automated cars reacts later when they to intervene in a critical situation compared to if they were driving manually depending on the capabilities of automated vehicles and the frequency with which human intervention is needed this may counteract any increase in safety as compared to all human driving that may be delivered by other factors ethical and moral reasoning come into consideration when programming the software that decides what action the car takes in an unavoidable crash whether the automated car will crash into a bus potentially killing people inside or swerve elsewhere potentially killing its own passengers are nearby pedestrians a question that programmers of AI systems find difficult to answer as do ordinary people and ethicists is what decision should the car make that causes the smallest damage to people's lives one proposed solution is the implementation of ethics pots in self-driving vehicles which learn from user preferences to ultimately guide autonomous instruments in accordance with the owners values and preferences the ethics of automated vehicles are still being articulated and may lead to controversy they may also require closer consideration of the variability context dependency complexity and non-deterministic nature of human ethics different human drivers make various ethical decisions when driving such as avoiding harm to themselves or putting themselves at risk to protect others these decisions range from rare extremes such as self-sacrifice or criminal negligence to routine decisions good enough to keep the traffic flowing but bad enough to cause accidents road rage and stress human thought and reaction time may sometimes be too slow to detect the risk of an upcoming fatal crash think through the ethical implications of the available options or take an action to implement an ethical choice whether a particular automated vehicles capacity to correctly detect an upcoming risk analyze the options or choose a good option from among bad choices would be as good or better than a particular humans may be difficult to predict or assess this difficulty may be in part because the level of automated vehicle system understanding of the ethical issues at play in a given road scenario sensed for an instant from out of a continuous stream of synthetic physical predictions of the near future and dependent on layers of pattern recognition and situational intelligence may be opaque to human inspection because of its origins in probabilistic machine learning rather than a simple plain English human values logic of parsable rules the depth of understanding predictive power and ethical sophistication needed will be hard to implement and even harder to test or assess the scale of this challenge may have other effects there may be few entities able to marshal the resources and AI capacity necessary to meet it as well as the capital necessary to take an automated vehicle system to market and sustain it operationally for the life of a vehicle and the legal and government affairs capacity to deal with the potential for liability for a significant proportion of traffic accidents this may have the effect of narrowing the number of different system operators and eroding the presently quite diverse global vehicle market down to a small number of system suppliers you topic potential changes for different industries the traditional automobile industry a subject to change is driven by technology and market demands these changes include breakthrough technological advances and when the market demands and adopts new technology quickly in the rapid advance of both factors the end of the era of incremental change was recognized when the transition is made to a new technology new entrance to the automotive industry present themselves which can be distinguished as mobility providers such as uber and lyft as well as tech giants such as Google and NVIDIA as new entrants to the industry arise market uncertainty naturally occurs due to the changing dynamics for example the entrance of tech giants as well as the alliances between them and traditional car manufacturers causes a variation in the innovation and production process of autonomous vehicles additionally the entrance of mobility providers has caused ambiguous user preferences as a result of the rise of mobility providers the number of vehicles per capita has flatlined in addition the rise of the sharing economy also contributes to market uncertainty and causes forecasters to question whether private ownership of vehicles is still relevant as new transportation technology and mobility providers are becoming preferred among consumers you topic taxis with the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the private ownership of autonomous vehicles it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue as it rises in popularity established providers such as uber and lyft are already significantly present within the industry and it is likely that new entrants will enter when business opportunities arise you topic healthcare car repair and car insurance with the increasing reliance of autonomous vehicles on interconnectivity and the availability of big data which is made usable in the form of real-time maps driving decisions can be made much faster in order to prevent collisions numbers made available by the US government state that 94 percent of the vehicle accidents are due to human failures as a result major implications for the healthcare industry become apparent numbers from the National Safety Council on killed and injured people on us roads multiplied by the average costs of a single incident reveal that an estimated 500 billion dollar loss may be imminent for the US healthcare industry when autonomous vehicles are dominating the roads it is likely the anticipated decrease in traffic accidents will positively contribute to the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles as well as the possibility to better allocate healthcare resources as collisions are less likely to occur and the risk for human errors is reduced significantly the repair industry will face an enormous reduction of work that has to be done on the reparation of car frames meanwhile as the generated data of the autonomous vehicle is likely to predict when certain replaceable parts are in need of maintenance car owners and the repair industry will be able to proactively replace a part that will fail soon this asset efficiency service would implicate a productivity gain for the automotive repair industry as fewer collisions implicate less money spent on repair costs the role of the insurance industry is likely to be altered as well it can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to autonomous vehicles will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers which is positive for the industry but fewer payouts may imply a demand drop for insurances in general the insurance industry may have to create new insurance models in the near future to accommodate the changes an unexpected disadvantage of the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles would be a reduction in organs available for transplant you topic rescue emergency response and military the technique used in autonomous driving also ensures life savings in other industries the implementation of autonomous vehicles with rescue Emergency Response and military applications has already led to a decrease in deaths military personnel use autonomous vehicles to reach dangerous and remote places on earth to deliver fuel food and general supplies and even rescue people in addition a future implication of adopting autonomous vehicles could lead to a reduction in deployed personnel which will lead to a decrease in injuries since the technological development allows autonomous vehicles AVS to become more and more autonomous another future implication is the reduction of emergency drivers when autonomous vehicles are deployed as fire trucks or ambulances an advantage could be the use of real-time traffic information and other generated data to determine and execute routes more efficiently than human drivers the time savings can be invaluable in these situations you topic anterior design and entertainment for the interior design industry there are exciting times ahead the driver is decreasingly focused on the actual driving this implies that the interior design and media entertainment industry has to reconsider what passengers of autonomous vehicles are doing when they are on the road vehicles need to be redesigned and possibly even be prepared for multi-purpose usage in practice it will show that travelers have more time for business and/or leisure in both cases this gives increasing opportunities for the media entertainment industry to demand attention moreover the advertisement business is able to provide location-based ads without risking driver safety you topic telecommunication and energy as autonomous vehicles are producing enormous amounts of data that need to be transferred and analyzed the upcoming 5g cellular network will play a pivotal role in doing so in addition the earlier mentioned entertainment industry is also highly dependent on this network to be active in this market segment this implies higher revenues for the telecommunication industry since many autonomous vehicles are going to rely on electricity to operate the demand for lithium batteries increases similarly radar sensors litter and high-speed Internet connectivity require higher auxiliary power from vehicles which manifests as greater power draw from batteries the larger battery requirement causes a necessary increase in supply of these type of batteries for the chemical industry on the other hand with the expected increase of battery-powered autonomous vehicles the petroleum industry is expected to undergo a decline in demand as this implication depends on the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles it is unsure to what extent this implication will disrupt this particular industry this transition phase of oil to electricity allows companies to explore whether there are business opportunities for them in the new energy ecosystem you topic restaurant hotels and airlines driver interactions with the vehicle will be less common with in the near future and in the more distant future the responsibility will lie entirely with the vehicle as indicated above this will have implications for the entertainment and interior design industry for roadside restaurants the implication will be that the need for customers to stop driving and enter the restaurant will vanish and the autonomous vehicle will have a double function moreover accompanied with the rise of disruptive platforms such as Airbnb that have shaken up the hotel industry the fast increase of developments within the autonomous vehicle industry might cause another implication for their customer bases in the more distant future the implication for motels might be that a decrease in guests will occur since autonomous vehicles could be redesigned as fully equipped bedrooms the improvements regarding the interior of the vehicles might additionally have implications for the airline industry in the case of relatively short haul flights waiting times at customs are the gate imply lost time and hassle for customers with the improved convenience in future car travel it is possible that customers might go for this option causing a loss in customer bases for airline industry you topic elderly disabled and children autonomous vehicles will have a severe impact on the mobility options of persons that are not able to drive a vehicle themselves to remain socially engaged with society are even able to do groceries the elderly people of today are depending on caretakers to drive them to these places in addition to the perceived freedom of the elderly people of the future the demand for human AIDS will decrease when we also consider the increased health of the elderly it is safe to state that care centers will experience a decrease in the number of clients not only elderly people face difficulties of their decreased physical abilities also disabled people will perceive the benefits of autonomous vehicles in the near future causing their dependency on caretakers to decrease both industries are largely depending on informal caregivers who are mostly relatives of the persons in need since there is less of a reliance on their time employers of informal caregivers or even governments will experience a decrease of costs allocated to this matter children and teens who are not able to drive a vehicle themselves are also benefiting of the introduction of autonomous cars daycares and schools are able to come up with automated pick-up and drop-off systems causing a decrease of reliance on parents and childcare workers the extent to which human actions are necessary for driving will vanish since current vehicles require human actions to some extent the driving school industry will not be disrupted until the majority of autonomous transportation is switched to the emerged dominant design it is plausible that in the distant future driving a vehicle will be considered as a luxury which implies that the structure of the industry is based on new entrants and a new market you topic incidents you topic Tesla autopilot in mid-october 2015 Tesla Motors rolled out version 7 of their software in the US that included Tesla autopilot capability on the 9th of January 2016 Tesla rolled out version 7.1 as an over-the-air update adding a new summon feature that allows cars to self-park at parking locations without the driver in the car Tesla's automated driving features is currently classified as a level 2 driver assistance system according to the Society of Automotive Engineers say international five levels of vehicle automation at this level the car can be automated but requires the full attention of the driver who must be prepared to take control at a moment's notice autopilot should be used only on limited access highways and sometimes it will fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself in urban driving the system will not read traffic signals or obey stop signs the system also does not detect pedestrians or cyclists on the 20th of January 2016 the first known fatal crash of a Tesla with autopilot occurred in China's Hubei province according to China's 1/6 three.com News Channel this marked China's first accidental death due to Tesla's automatic driving system initially Tesla pointed out that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to conclusively prove that the car had been on autopilot at the time however 1/6 three.com pointed out that other factors such as the car's absolute failure to take any evasive actions prior to the high-speed crash and the drivers otherwise good driving record seem to indicate a strong likelihood that the car was on autopilot at the time a similar fatal crash occurred four months later in Florida in 2018 in a subsequent civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla Tesla did not deny that the car had been on autopilot at the time of the accident and sent evidence to the victim's father documenting that fact the second known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in Williston Florida on the 7th of May 2016 while a Tesla Model S electric car was engaged in auto pilot mode the occupant was killed in a crash with an 18-wheel tractor trailer on the 28th of June 2016 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the Florida Highway Patrol according to the NHTSA preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non controlled-access highway and the car failed to apply the brakes the car continued to travel after passing under the trucks trailer the NHTSA s preliminary evaluation was open to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash which involved a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars on the 8th of July 2016 the NHTSA requested Tesla Motors provide the agency detailed information about the design operation and testing of its autopilot technology the agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to autopilot since its introduction and Tesla's planned updates scheduled for the next four months according to Tesla neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky so the brake was not applied the car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S Tesla also claimed that this was Tesla's first known autopilot death in over 130 million miles 210 million kilometers driven by its customers with autopilot engaged however by this statement Tesla was apparently refusing to acknowledge claims that the January 2016 fatality in Hubei China had also been the result of an autopilot system error according to Tesla there is a fatality every 94 million miles 151 million kilometers among all type of vehicles in the u.s. however this number also includes fatalities of the crashes for instance of motorcycle drivers with pedestrians in July 2016 the US National Transportation Safety Board NTSB opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while the autopilot was engaged the NTSB as an investigative body that has the power to make only policy recommendations an agency spokesman said it's worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event so that is that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible quote in January 2017 the NTSB released the report that concluded Tesla was not at fault the investigation revealed that four Tesla cars the crash rate dropped by 40% after autopilot was installed according to Tesla starting the 19th of October 2016 all Tesla cars are built with hardware to allow full self-driving capability at the highest safety level say level five the hardware includes eight surround cameras and twelve ultrasonic sensors in addition to the forward-facing radar with enhanced processing capabilities the system will operate in shadow mode processing without taking action and send data back to Tesla to improve its abilities until the software is ready for deployment via over-the-air upgrades after the required testing Tesla hopes to enable full self-driving by the end of 2019 under certain conditions you topic wham-o wham-o originated as a self-driving car project within Google in August 2012 Google announced that their vehicles had completed over 300,000 automated driving miles five hundred thousand kilometres accident-free typically involving about a dozen cars on the road at any given time and that they were starting to test with single drivers instead of in pairs in late May 2014 Google revealed a new prototype that had no steering wheel gas pedal or brake pedal and was fully automated as of March 2016 Google had test-driven their fleet in automated mode a total of 1 million five hundred thousand miles two million four hundred thousand kilometers in December 2016 Google corporation announced that its technology would be spun off to a new company called way mo with both Google and way mo becoming subsidiaries of a new parent company called alphabet according to Google's accident reports as of early 2016 their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions of which other drivers were at fault thirteen times although in 2016 the cars software caused a crash in June 2015 Brin confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date eight involved rear-end collisions at a stop sign or traffic light two in which the vehicle was sideswiped by another driver one in which another driver rolled through a stop sign and one where a Google employee was controlling the car manually in July 2015 3 Google employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rear-ended by a car whose driver failed to brake at a traffic light this was the first time that a collision resulted in injuries on the 14th of February 2016 a google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path during the maneuver it struck a bus Google stated in this case we clearly bear some responsibility because if our car hadn't moved there wouldn't have been a collision Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience no injuries were reported in the crash you topic uber in March 2017 an uber test vehicle was involved in a crash in Tempe Arizona when another car failed to yield flipping the uber vehicle there were no injuries in the accident by the 22nd of December 2017 uber had completed two million miles 3.2 million kilometers in automated mode on the 18th of March 2018 Elaine Herzberg became the first pedestrian to be killed by a self-driving car in the United States after being hit by an uber vehicle also in Tempe Herzberg was crossing outside of a crosswalk approximately 400 feet from an intersection this marks the first time an individual outside an auto piloted car is known to have been killed by such a car the first death of an essentially uninvolved third party is likely to raise new questions and concerns about the safety of automated cars in general some experts say a human driver could have avoided the fatal crash Arizona Governor Doug Ducey later suspended the company's ability to test and operate its automated cars on public roadways citing an unquestionable failure of the expectation that uber make public safety its top priority uber has pulled out of all self-driving car testing in California as a result of the accident on the 24th of May 2018 the National Transport Safety Board issued a preliminary report you topic Navia automated bus driving system on the 9th of November 2017 an a via automated self-driving bus with passengers was involved in a crash with a truck the truck was found to be at fault of the crash reversing into the stationary automated bus the automated bus did not take evasive actions or apply defensive driving such as flash headlights sound the horn or as one passenger commented the shuttle didn't have the ability to move back the shuttle just stayed still you topic policy implications you topic urban planning according to a wonk blog reporter if fully automated cars become commercially available they have the potential to be a disruptive innovation with major implications for society the likelihood of widespread adoption is still unclear but if they are used on a wide scale policymakers face a number of unresolved questions about their effects one fundamental question is about their effect on travel behavior some people believe that they will increase car ownership and car use because it will become easier to use them and they will ultimately be more useful this may in turn encourage urban sprawl and ultimately total private vehicle use others argue that it will be easier to share cars and that this will thus discourage outright ownership and decrease total usage and make cars more efficient forms of transportation in relation to the present situation policymakers will have to take a new look at how infrastructure is to be built and how money will be allotted to build for automated vehicles the need for traffic signals could potentially be reduced with the adoption of smart highways due to smart highways and with the assistance of smart technological advances implemented by policy change the dependence on oil imports may be reduced because of less time being spent on the road by individual cars which could have an effect on policy regarding energy on the other hand automated vehicles could increase the overall number of cars on the road which could lead to a greater dependence on oil imports if smart systems are not enough to curtail the impact of more vehicles however due to the uncertainty of the future of automated vehicles policymakers may want to plan effectively by implementing infrastructure improvements that can be beneficial to both human drivers and automated vehicles caution needs to be taken in acknowledgment to public transportation and that the use may be greatly reduced if automated vehicles are catered to through policy reform of infrastructure with this resulting in job loss and increased unemployment other disruptive effects will come from the use of automated vehicles to carry goods self-driving vans have the potential to make home deliveries significantly cheaper transforming retail commerce and possibly making hypermarkets and supermarkets redundant as of right now the US government defines automation in to six levels starting at level zero which means the human driver does everything and ending with level five the automated system performs all the driving tasks also under the current law manufacturers bear all the responsibility to self certify vehicles for use on public roads this means that currently as long as the vehicle is compliant within the regulatory framework there are no specific federal legal barriers to a highly automated vehicle being offered for sale yard rawan an associate professor in the MIT Media Lab said most people want to live in a world where cars will minimize casualties but everyone wants their own car to protect them at all costs furthermore industry standards and best practice are still needed in systems before they can be considered reasonably safe under real-world conditions you topic legislation the 1968 Vienna Convention on road traffic subscribed to by over 70 countries worldwide establishes principles to govern traffic laws one of the fundamental principles of the convention has been the concept that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behavior of a vehicle in traffic the progress of technology that assists and takes over the functions of the driver as undermining this principle implying that much of the groundwork must be rewritten you topic legal status in the United States in the United States a non signatory country to the vienna convention state vehicle codes generally do not envisage but do not necessarily prohibit highly automated vehicles to clarify the legal status of an otherwise regulate such vehicles several states have enacted or are considering specific laws in 2016 seven states Nevada California Florida Michigan Hawaii Washington and Tennessee along with the District of Columbia have enacted laws for automated vehicles incidents such as the first fatal accident by Tesla's autopilot system have led to discussion about revising laws and standards for automated cars in September 2016 the US National Economic Council and Department of Transportation released federal standards that describe how automated vehicles should react if their technology fails how to protect passenger privacy and how riders should be protected in the event of an accident the new federal guidelines are meant to avoid a patchwork of state laws while avoiding being so overbearing as to stifle innovation in June 2011 the Nevada Legislature passed a law to authorize the use of automated cars Nevada thus became the first jurisdiction in the world where automated vehicles might be legally operated on public roads according to the law the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles and DMV is responsible for setting safety and performance standards and the agency is responsible for designating areas where automated cars may be tested this legislation was supported by Google in an effort to legally conduct further testing of its Google driverless car the Nevada law defines an automated vehicle to be a motor vehicle that uses artificial intelligence sensors and Global Positioning System coordinates to drive itself without the active intervention of a human operator the law also acknowledges that the operator will not need to pay attention while the car is operating itself Google had further lobbied for an exemption from a ban on distracted driving to permit occupants to send text messages while sitting behind the wheel but this did not become law furthermore Nevada's regulations require a person behind the wheel and one in the passenger's seat during tests in April 2012 Florida became the second state to allow the testing of automated cars on public roads and California became the third when Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill into law at Google headquarters in Mountain View in December 2013 Michigan became the fourth state to allow testing of driverless cars on public roads in July 2014 the city of Coeur d'Alene Idaho adopted a robotics ordinance that includes provisions to allow for self-driving cars on the 19th of February 2016 assembly bill number 2866 was introduced in california that would allow automated vehicles to operate on the road including those without a driver steering wheel accelerator pedal or brake pedal the bill states the Department of Motor Vehicles would need to comply with these regulations by the 1st of July 2018 for these rules to take effect this bill has yet to pass the house of origin in September 2016 the US Department of Transportation released its federal automated vehicles policy and California published discussions on the subject in October 2016 in December 2016 the California Department of Motor Vehicles ordered uber to remove its self-driving vehicles from the road in response to two red-light violations uber immediately blamed the violations on human error and has suspended the drivers you topic legislation in Europe in 2013 the government of the United Kingdom permitted the testing of automated cars on public roads before this all testing of robotic vehicles in the UK had been conducted on private property in 2014 the government of France announced that testing of automated cars on public roads would be allowed in 2015 two thousand kilometers of road would be opened through the national territory especially in Bordeaux in Azir Ile de France and Strasbourg at the 2015 it's World Congress a conference dedicated to intelligent transport systems the very first demonstration of automated vehicles on open road in France was carried out in Bordeaux in early October 2015 in 2015 a pre-emptive lawsuit against various automobile companies such as GM Ford and Toyota accused them of Hawking vehicles that are vulnerable to hackers who could hypothetically wrest control of essential functions such as brakes and steering in spring of 2015 the federal Department of Environment transport energy and communications in Switzerland you vek allowed Swiss come to test a driverless Volkswagen pass set on the streets of Zurich as of April 2017 it is possible to conduct public road tests for development vehicles in Hungary furthermore the construction of a closed test track the Salah zone test track suitable for testing highly automated functions is also underway near the city of Selangor Shaikh you topic legislation in Asia in 2016 the Singapore Land Transit Authority in partnership with UK automotive supplier Delphi automotive PLC will launch preparations for a test run of a fleet of automated taxis for a none demand automated cab service to take effect in 2017 you topic liability self-driving car liability as a developing area of law and policy that will determine who is liable when an automated car causes physical damage to persons or breaks road rules when automated cars shift the control of driving from humans to automated car technology there may be a need for existing liability laws to evolve in order to fairly identify the parties responsible for damage and injury and to address the potential for conflicts of interest between human occupants System Operator insurers and the public purse increases in the use of automated car technologies eg advanced driver assistance systems may prompt incremental shifts in this responsibility for driving it is claimed by proponents to have potential to affect the frequency of road accidents although it is difficult to assess this claim in the absence of data from substantial actual use if there was a dramatic improvement in safety the operators may seek to project their liability for the remaining accidents unto others as part of their reward for the improvement however there is no obvious reason why they should escape liability if any such effects were found to be modest or non-existent since part of the purpose of such liability is to give an incentive to the party controlling something to do whatever is necessary to avoid it causing harm potential users may be reluctant to trust an operator if it seeks to pass its normal liability onto others in any case a well advised person who is not controlling a car at all level 5 would be understandably reluctant to accept liability for something out of their control and when there is some degree of sharing control possible level 3 or 4 a well advised person would be concerned that the vehicle might try to pass back control at the last seconds before an accident to pass responsibility and liability back to but in circumstances where the potential driver has no better prospects of avoiding the crash than the vehicle since they have not necessarily been paying close attention and if it is too hard for the very smart car it might be too hard for a human since operators especially those familiar with trying to ignore existing legal obligations under a model like seek forgiveness not permission such as way Moe or uber could be normally expected to try to avoid responsibility to the maximum degree possible there is potential for attempt to let the operators evade being held liable for accidents while they are in control as higher levels of automation are commercially introduced level 3 and for the insurance industry may see a greater proportion of commercial and product liability lines while personal automobile insurance drinks you topic vehicular communication systems vehicle networking may be desirable due to difficulty with computer vision being able to recognize brake lights turn signals buses and similar things however the usefulness of such systems would be diminished by the fact current cars are equipped with them they may also pose privacy concerns individual vehicles may benefit from information obtained from other vehicles in the vicinity especially information relating to traffic congestion and safety hazards vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating nodes in a peer-to-peer network providing each other with information as a cooperative approach vehicular communication systems can allow all cooperating vehicles to be more effective according to a 2010 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration vehicular communication systems could help avoid up to 79 percent of all traffic accidents there have so far been no complete implementation of peer-to-peer networking on the scale required for traffic each individual vehicle would have to connect with potentially hundreds of different vehicles that could be going in and out of range in 2012 computer scientists at the University of Texas in Austin began developing smart intersections designed for automated cars the intersections will have no traffic lights and no stop signs instead of using computer programs that will communicate directly with each car on the road in 2017 researchers from Arizona State University developed a one-tenth scale intersection and proposed an intersection management technique called crossroads it was shown that the crossroads is resilient to network delay a v2i communication and worst case execution time of the intersection manager in 2018 a robust approach was introduced which is resilient to model mismatch in external disturbance like wind and bump among connected cars and unconnected one is the weakest link and will be increasingly banned from busy high-speed roads predicted a Helsinki think-tank in January 2016 you topic public opinion surveys in a 2011 online survey of 2006 US and UK consumers by Accenture 49 percent said they would be comfortable using a driverless car a 2012 survey of 17400 vehicle owners by JD Power and Associates found 37 percent initially said they would be interested in purchasing a fully autonomous car however that figure dropped to 20 percent if told the technology would cost three thousand dollars more in a 2012 survey of about 1,000 German drivers by automotive researcher polls twenty two percent of the respondents had a positive attitude towards these cars 10 percent were undecided 44 percent were sceptical and 24 percent were hostile a 2013 survey of 1,500 consumers across 10 countries by Cisco Systems found 57 percent stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver with Brazil India and China the most willing to trust automated technology in a 2014 u.s. telephone survey by insurance.com over three-quarters of licensed drivers said they would at least consider buying a self-driving car rising to 86 percent if car insurance were cheaper 31 point 7 percent said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available instead in a February 2015 survey of top auto journalists 46 percent predict that either Tesla or Daimler will be the first to the market with a fully autonomous vehicle while at 38 percent Daimler is predicted to be the most functional safe and in-demand autonomous vehicle in 2015 a questionnaire survey by Delft University of Technology explored the opinion of 5,000 people from 109 countries on automated driving results showed that respondents on average found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving 22 percent of the respondents did not want to spend any money for a fully automated driving system respondents were found to be most concerned about software hacking misuse and were also concerned about legal issues and safety finally respondents from more developed countries in terms of lower accident statistics higher education and higher income were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data the survey also gave results on potential consumer opinion on interest of purchasing an automated car stating that 37 percent of surveyed current owners were either definitely or probably interested in purchasing an automated car in 2016 a survey in Germany examined the opinion of 1603 people who were representative in terms of age gender and education for the German population towards partially highly and fully automated cars results showed that men and women differ in their willingness to use them men felt less anxiety and more joy towards automated cars whereas women showed the exact opposite the gender difference towards anxiety was especially pronounced between young men and women but decreased with participants age in 2016 a PwC survey in the United States showing the opinion of 1584 people highlights that sixty-six percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver people are still worried about safety and mostly the fact of having the car hacked nevertheless only 13% of the interviewees see no advantages in this new kind of cars a Pew Research Center survey of 4135 u.s. adults conducted 1 to 15 May 2017 finds that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimes from the widespread adoption of automated vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers you topic morale issues you with the emergence of automated automobiles various ethical issues arise while the introduction of automated vehicles to the mass market is said to be inevitable due to a presumed but untestable potential for reduction of crashes by up to 90% and their potential greater accessibility to disabled elderly and young passengers a range of ethical issues have not been fully addressed those include but are not limited to the moral financial and criminal responsibility for crashes and breaches of law the decisions icarus to make right before a fatal crash privacy issues including potential for mass surveillance potential for massive job losses and unemployment among drivers de-skilling and loss of Independence by vehicle users exposure to hacking and malware and the further concentration of market and data power in the hands of a few global conglomerates capable of consolidating AI capacity and of lobbying governments to facilitate the shift of liability unto others and their potential destruction of existing occupations and industries there are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash especially with people being hurt many experts see the car manufacturers themselves responsible for those crashes that occur due to a technical malfunction or misconstruction besides the fact that the car manufacturer would be the source of the problem in a situation where a car crashes due to a technical issue there is another important reason why car manufacturers could be held responsible it would encourage them to innovate and heavily invest into fixing those issues not only due to protection of the brand image but also due to financial and criminal consequences however there are also voices that argue those using or owning the vehicle should be held responsible since they know the risks involved in using such a vehicle experts suggest introducing attacks or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that program the code for the automated operation of the vehicles and suppliers of components of the Avenue taking aside the question of legal liability and moral responsibility the question arises how automated vehicles should be programmed to behave in an emergency situation where either passengers or other traffic participants like pedestrians bicyclists and other drivers are endangered a moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software as described in an ethical thought experiment the trolley problem a conductor of a trolley has the choice of staying on the planned track and running over five people or turn the trolley onto a track where it would kill only one person assuming there is no traffic on it when a self-driving car is in following scenario its driving with passengers and suddenly a person appears in its way the car has to decide between the two options either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall killing the passengers there are two main considerations that need to be addressed first what moral basis would be used by an automated vehicle to make decisions second how could those be translated into software code researchers have suggested in particular two ethical theories to be applicable to the behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency deontology and utilitarianism Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics are a typical example of deontological ethics the theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written out rules that it needs to follow in any situation utilitarianism suggests the idea that any decision must be made based on the goal to maximize utility this needs a definition of utility which could be maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash many trolly discussions skip over the practical problems of how a probabilistic machine learning vehicle AI could be sophisticated enough to understand that a deep problem of moral philosophy is presenting itself from instant to instant while using a dynamic projection into the near future what sort of moral problem it actually would be if any what the relevant weightings in human value terms should be given to all the other humans involved who will be probably unreliably identified and how reliably it can assess the probable outcomes these practical difficulties and those around testing and assessment of solutions to them may present as much of a challenge as the theoretical abstractions privacy related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual this information gathering ranges from tracking of the routes taken voice recording video recording preferences in media that is consumed in the car behavioral patterns to many more streams of information the data and communications infrastructure needed to support these vehicles may also be capable of surveillance especially if coupled to other datasets and advanced analytics the implementation of automated vehicles to the mass market might cost up to five million jobs in the US alone making up almost three percent of the workforce those jobs include drivers of taxis buses vans trucks and a hailing vehicles many industries such as the auto insurance industry are indirectly affected this industry alone generates an annual revenue of about two hundred twenty billion dollars supporting 277 thousand jobs to put this into perspective this is about the number of mechanical engineering jobs the potential loss of a majority of those jobs will have a tremendous impact on those individuals involved both India and China have placed bans on automated cars with the former citing protection of jobs you topic anticipated launch of cars in December 2015 Tesla CEO Elon Musk predicted that a completely automated car would be introduced by the end of 2018 in December 2017 he announced that it would take another two years to launch a fully self-driving Tesla unto the market wham-o launched a ride-hailing service in Phoenix in December 2018 it seems the clear leader in self-driving cars although its crash rate in California is still higher than a novice driver dr dot AI is doing a trial run in frisco TX and arlington texas you topic in fiction you topic in film the automated and occasionally sentient self-driving car story has earned its place in both literary science fiction and pop sci-fi a VW beetle named dudu features in the 1971 to 1978 German super bug film series of

upgrade 2018 set in a not too distant future highlights the hazardous side to automated cars as their driving systems can get hijacked and imperil the passengers you topic in literature intelligent or self-driving cars are a common theme in science fiction literature examples include in Isaac Asimov's science fiction short story Sally first published May to June 1953 automated cars have positronic brains and communicate via honking horns and slamming doors and save their human caretaker due to the high cost of the brain few can afford a personal vehicle so buses have become the norm Peter F Hamilton's Common Wealth saga series features intelligent or self-driving vehicles in Robert a Heinlein's novel the number of the beasts 1980 Zeb Carter's driving and flying car gay deceiver is at
