 [Music] hello and welcome to our discussion on autonomous driving gentlemen the Society of Automotive Engineers defines six levels of autonomy in your mind what's your what's your thoughts in five years out of the most important one coming in I think that the most important ones moving forward in the next five years are probably level one mostly due to the affordability and accessibility of course you don't want to take away from level four in level five because they're really gonna be pushing the limits on what's possible for Less self-driving cars yeah I completely agree with that if you look in the US somewhere between 35 to 40 thousand people are killed on the roads every year you look at the opportunity to really go impact that that those the statistics are huge and it's really going to be those those much simpler systems like the level one that we can really drive mass amounts of deployment to really make an impact on saving lives yeah and I think if you look at layman if you ask them for five s where they want to be right but we also see where one through three kind of need to advance to get there any thoughts on that yeah of course so level one to three those are gonna be covering a lot of the more simpler cases so for example just keeping a car within a lane that's an easy way to prevent a lot of accidents very common accidents as well yeah into that point you know lots of people I've talked to also that aren't necessarily in the industry are scared to death of a car driving themselves but when you start talking about a level-1 level-2 automatic emergency braking and the car actually braking half a second before the human and taking away that power in an accident I think has a huge potential impact and I think it's it's pretty exciting to see what could happen there when we started kind of in this journey or this road to autonomy cameras played a important part front camera is one that's a little more prevalent now in vehicles can you kind of go in some details of how it fits into levels of autonomy yeah of course so front camera is is basically required for level-1 level-2 functions like lane keep assist some cases adaptive cruise control as well and of course moving forward that is basically going to be the eyes of the computer driver as well as it is looking forward just as we were as we were driving the cars so if we're looking at the modalities of all the sensors that are available or the technologies that are that are on the horizon any thoughts on the comparisons between them or even how they work in conjunction with each other that's a great question and really when you look at people doing high levels of autonomy there's no agreement on what modalities are going to be required how many modalities are gonna be required it's a factor of what each modality does well it's a huge cost factor and what's gonna be the right balance of modalities to to have the safe driving experience because when you start talking about more and more autonomy you're also talking at raising some pretty serious safety questions and you've really got to be thinking about that from a modality point of view from a car architecture point of view from a redundancy point of view from the electronics or in the systems and the software it's it's a complete package we look at sensors and having two or three validate each other I think that's kind of the the goal right so obviously there is some acyl or ISO type of thoughts going into the designs of these of these sensors any comments on that yeah I think your you know that's certainly an area that there's a lots of continued thought advancement going on and I think it's it's really important you've got to be thinking about how you know first off how do you deal with the corner cases and how do you run enough corner cases around enough around a sensor set that you actually had create that really safe driver environment then you've got to go down to how do you actually architect the systems what redundancy is going to be required and redundancy also adds lots of cost so you know you've got to deal balance all those to be able to drive affordability for for it to be deployed in a massive environment and that's a real challenge yeah yeah and I could see where affordability plays a big part right could you go with one sensor or from an affordability standpoint put three or four that do basically the same function so as these systems become more complex sensor fusion becomes a big play into that can you comment on how sensor fusion they're gonna change the level of autonomy in the vehicle yeah so in order for a car that's driving itself to make reliable and safe decisions it's gonna need a very accurate picture of his environment and the way to do that is to you know put sensors around the car and capture that data so once that data is captured it needs to process that data effectively so that in and of itself is a challenge the processor is gonna be processing about gigabytes of data very quickly and that processor is gonna be very hot so that in and of itself poses quite a challenge for the market I think that's a great point but I also think it it's one of those areas that we're gonna have to have a lot of innovations for because at the point now just throwing more performance throwing unlimited memory unlimited power isn't really sustainable when you start start talking about wanting to deploy in high volumes I think that's really where it gets down to at the end of the day these are gonna be highly embedded systems very real time are gonna have to care a lot about power and we're gonna have to carry about total cost so I think that that's going to be a real interesting area of innovation as we start trying to figure out how we can get the part these price points in a deployables roam if that the problem right as our electric vehicle counterparts we're talking about trying to get more miles out of that charge those types of systems as they're taking more power of it basically equate to miles being driven or it could be driven right and the good news is there is you know these are problems that we can start putting different forms of processing against to help make that power problem get a lot better and I think if you look at today what's available to the masses surround view systems the assisted parking type of systems are pretty prevalent do you see a tie-in between it and the autonomous driving going forward so that I think that's possible there's a good chance that you could use those sensors dual function you know you could probably improve the accuracy of different drive functions but that's a tough call to make at the moment and I think right now we're going through lots of learning in the system right once we get more learning in there's gonna be opportunities to integrate but we've got to go through those learning processes yeah then I think that's that's fair so we've talked a lot about the sensors around the vehicle what about the sensors inside the vehicle the one that gets me most excited both from autonomous vehicle point of view but maybe even more so as a dad is driver monitoring right and just the the impact that we could make sure the drivers have their eyes on the road you look at the fatality numbers you look at how many of those are caused by distracted driving to me that's a really exciting potential safety adder didn't you start thinking about that in autonomy and studies have shown that if you're not paying attention it takes you 10 seconds to be able to drive a car after the car says it's not able to drive itself that's not feasible in a real-world environment so how we work through and how do you keep the driver alert as we're going through these different levels of autonomy is going to be is going to be key yeah my thought there is is if you have a you know deep learning algorithms as all those sensors are bringing in and you still have that one individual that's been driving a vehicle for many many years and and watching them and their expressions or their heart rate could really give you a good idea of something effectively dangerous is coming on right so good illness act as another sensor in the system very good great discussion on autonomous driving and the future of it I really appreciate your time for
