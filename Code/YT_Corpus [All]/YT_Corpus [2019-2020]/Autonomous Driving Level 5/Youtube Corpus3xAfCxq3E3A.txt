 today we're going to be answering the big question if you're buying a Tesla is full self-driving fsd worth the money [MUSIC[ now as many of you may know i've just had to purchase a tesla model 3 performance for a customer for sale and this car had full self driving so today we're going to be going through what full self driving does and in my honest opinion do i think that you should purchase it now there's a couple of things it does above standard autopilot now if you buy a tesla model 3 for example autopilot standard autopilot is completely free you don't pay anything for autopilot so we're going to be talking about what self-driving adds for you know what extras you actually get above autopilot and you know at the end the summary of should you buy it so first of all let's have a look we've got summon now summon allows you to move your car forward and backwards within a given slot in a car parking spot so you can pull the car out and in now this is nothing new this is something that mercedes bmw and just general ice cars have been able to do for a while yes you have to pay extra for it but it's not unique to tesla it's just basically using the parking sensors on the front of the back to work out if they can carry on going forward or backwards to get out of tight spots now this is an absolute bonus especially for the customer that was buying this car that was disabled people often don't park very considerate next to disabled drivers in disabled spots and haven't realized that the reason why the spots are bigger so they can get in and out of the car with more ease and they park very very close so this allows you to pull the car out of the space and easily get in and out now you have to have full self-driving to allow this summon on previous autopilots on model uh s's and x's used to get a different level of autopilot they've messed them around and changed them around a bit where it used to allow you to do this type of SUMMON just as standard as part of the autopilot package but tesla rejigged all the autopilot and full self-driving packages in my mind to make full self-driving look like it had more included than it actually did instead of just being full of vaporware which let's be honest at the moment it is mainly vaporware um the promise of level five autonomy is not anytime soon well let's have a look at what it can actually do you can actually do advanced summon now so advanced summon is a little bit more clever and this this is pretty cool so advanced summon in fact when elon first demonstrated on model 3 when he was first announcing it he showed basically that you could pick a place on a map and have the car drive to you and on the example they used a police officer chasing after the car trying to put a ticket on the front of it and the car running away from the police officer now it does work in the uk and the legality of it is you can only use it in private spaces so private car parks stuff like that non non basically stuff where the insurance companies should be angry now when i've tested it it works you can pick a place in the map and it will drive to it the only problem is it only works here in the uk anyway if you're in bluetooth range of the car because it uses the the phone's bluetooth connect the car to know that you're in line of sight safe line of sight and this meant for me when i was testing it that had to be as close as a couple of meters away um so really didn't really add any functionality over moving it forward and backwards out of a spot unless you're in a really tight angled spot car park and you need to physically drive round you know turn the wheel out as you came out of the spot but it didn't really add any massive functionality i was hoping what it would do is the promise of i'm i'm sat here in my showroom my car's parked round the back i can see the car i've got line of sight it's chucking down with rain and instead of going out getting absolutely soaked i could press a button on my phone watch my car drive all the way around from the back of the showroom to here where i'm sat now i'm getting it you know less wet and that was the whole promise of summon but i don't know if it's insurance legalities or some other issues but it doesn't really do what you'd want it to do and whether that will change in the near future or not it is just questionable but it's a cool feature and to be honest the forward and backwards reverse summon that should just be included this standard in autopilot i don't understand why that needs to be in fsd now another feature that you get included is part of full self driving is automatic parallel parking and normal parking spaces you know your normal standard bay parking so you get all to parking which is great you drive past the spot you put it in reverse and the car will control the steering wheel and part you in a spot absolutely great but shouldn't be part of full self-driving again it should just be included as part of the standard autopilot and why you asked me because you can buy a renault a french you know car french budget renault car with this on it's not an amazing super feature that needs all the full self-driving cameras and computer no it just needs the standard ultrasonic sensors that around the car that every car has to to do this and it's it's not really that that amazing it's been on cars for years in fact i think mercedes and ford were the first two car companies to add it onto their cars yes again they charge you for it but on this type of car that shouldn't be the price that they're charging for full self-driving it's a pretty standard feature and to be honest i think tesla it used to be part of autopilot and i honestly again i think they've moved it to full self driving just to make full self driving look like you're actually paying for something now it's a great feature and i love self-parking cars yes we can all park a car ourselves but full self-driving uh these self-driving parking spot cars that you know a lot of cars now have the advantage of it is you don't curb your alloys now the piece de resistance of full self-driving is of course navigate on autopilot and this is this is why i thought i'd i want to add it on to have basically put something in your navigation and your car to drive you there come on that is sci-fi that's amazing however it's it's not as great and as perfect as you'd think now the car that i had i only had full self-driving navigate on all pilot for a very very short period it took a while to calibrate the cameras because i had to do some you know various lanes and stuff like that for the cameras to fully calibrate but when i thought got it on navigate autopilot and autopilot slightly different so on autopilot you get the blue lanes down either side of the road on navigating autopilot you get a blue line down the center of the road so this allows you to basically drive autonomously on the motorway and if a car in front of you is driving too slow the way it works is it will overtake that car that's too slow if your speed cruise control is set higher than the car in front it'll overtake them and then pull back in the lane and also get you ready for exiting the motorway or in america the off-ramp so it will pull you in the off ramp take you off it's great yeah that that's exactly what it does however you have to accept each of these changes by pressing a button on the screen so would you like to overtake this car uh yes um would you like to exit this this turning on uh on the motorway you know get get ready for your exit turn uh yes you know which is which is great you have to press a button but it's not really saved me any real great heartache of actually using the physical steering wheel and overtaking the car myself and changing back into the lane myself and pulling off on the lane now very very first auto pilots on model s and metal x's you used to be able to signal with your with your indicator and the autopilot would wait to change lanes for you automatically which is great which you won't do on standard autopilot it's now been moved to full self-driving only so if you haven't got navigate and autopilot you can still signal to change lanes which is one of the my mind one of the best features that was on tesla's autopilot system but now you have to pay for full self-driving to be able to change lanes using autopilot so again it's tesla trying to remove features from the autopilot and move it on to full self-driving and it just feels to me that they haven't got enough chunk at the moment for full self-driving to sell on its own so they're taking features away that used to be part of autopilot and moving them onto full self-driving and i look i don't want to upset the tesla fanboys because they really really really don't like you know you're discussing things that you know don't sound perfect in the tesla eye but that's what it feels like to me as a consumer i'm just a bit upset because these are great features and i think that tesla should include them for free and if full self driving is only a couple of years away and they've almost cracked it then then that's that sell on its own you don't need to take away gimmicks that used to be part of autopilot and put them on full self driving now the other system it does are traffic lights the traffic light system didn't work on the tesla i picked up until the very very very last day that i had to drive the car back from the hand control people that fit hand controls to tesla now if you want to understand why someone would buy a brand new tesla from a secondhand car dealer like me then check out that video top right and that will explain the very last reason why someone has to buy a new tesla model 3 from me instead of direct from tesla which i hope tesla will sort out because it will increase sales and also improve the lives of many many people who want to own a tesla now moving back onto the traffic light system i did get a small sort of taste of what it would do so first of all it recognizes the traffic lights red amber and green here in the uk in the us they obviously just have red and green but here we have an amber amber for my american users who are watching this amber lets us know that the light is about to change to red so we go we go red amber's about to go green and then green and then we go green amber about to go red and then back to red so it just gives us a bit of indication when we're getting to light that we should start to prepare to slow prepare to start moving etc depending on what the last state of the light was now tesla can read all those states of lights brilliant they've also got a thick white line where the car should stop at the junction great did that you know it notices notices that perfectly now in the us this feature is working and i've watched a couple of videos of people using it i've read the user agreements from tesla and unfortunately it's not that great um it will work and it will stop automatically without you physically pressing a button on the screen like you do have to on the full self driving on a motorway and navigate on autopilot so yes it will stop at the lights and yes it does work however the use agreement for tesla is very very clear you need to pay 100 full attention okay great i mean you'd expect that and that's pretty much tesla's cop out on most of the autopilot stuff that it's in beta uh you have to make sure that the if the light is green that the line stop line on the on the road is green as well that means it's noticed the light and the light line is green if the light is red then the line needs to be red it basically says that just because it says that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to stop there and you still need to be aware and basically it it's not perfect which is fair enough but they have been working on the system a while and that was pretty much the big selling point of the thing of the whole system is that it would be able to stop and go on lights now it's going to get better tesla software always does and i i do expect it to get better and better and improve but the big question is you want to know should you buy it is it worth it it's a big question and a lot of it's going to be down to personal preference and what you think now i was tempted to buy full self driving on a tesla model 3 if i purchased one for myself when the price was at 5200 quid for the self parking and the you know various other little bits like changing the lane on the motorway then 5200 quid i could very happily justify and with the hopes that the traffic lights and other little bits would start to improve but the parallel parking to me and some of the other bits i could have swallowed the pill at 5200 quid and be quite happy that you know yes everything doesn't work but eventually software will improve and by the time i've had the car three years maybe more of it will be fully working or they'll be closer to it being more reliable and i'd be quite happy with that at 5200 quid well i wouldn't be happy but i'd be more happy than it now cost which is 6800 pound and what have tesla done for this 1600 pound increase um um oh sorry check nothing absolutely nothing so it's 1600 pound more and you get nothing now in the us you do get a little bit more it does more the traffic light stuff but in the uk yeah still nothing it does nothing extra in the uk for that one thousand six hundred pound so they've increased full self-driving throughout the world and in the uk it's now 1600 pound more for nothing and tesla this this is me telling you that i was going to buy full self-driving when i buy if i buy a tesla now now that was 5200 quid that you would definitely have got off me if i bought it i would definitely definitely add it on now at 6800 quid not a chance so you've just lost yourself five thousand two hundred pound and you how many other people have thought the same as me how many people have gone that's nearly seven grand for not a lot of features now i'll leave it and what do i think you should do do i think that level five autonomy is coming to model 3 in the next year next two years no i don't i think it's much further away than that i think it's at least three four years plus we've been promised that it's gonna come next year it's coming soon it's coming soon elon even put a tweet out recently we're on the verge of cracking level five autonomy look it's it's gonna happen one day but i don't think it's that close and if if i was you that six thousand eight hundred quid keep the money don't put it towards full self driving if you want to support tesla and you want to use that six thousand eighty pound support tesla then buy some tesla shares because if they crack level five autonomy that six thousand eight hundred quid worth of shares will go up far far far more than what they'll increase the price of full self-driving because if they crack level five autonomy trust me every manufacturer will be willing to bang on tesla's door and say can we come can we buy your software can we use your software how much do you want for this software they'll buy it and everyone will want to buy a tesla taxi firms car car share services they'll all want to buy tesla's it will dramatically whack the stock price through the roof even further than what it is now because tesla's stock price is literally really high at the moment it's doing really really well it's rallying so save you 6 800 quid buy some tesla shares because at least then you've got a chance of getting something that's worth something at the end rather than buying full self-driving at 6 800 and getting nothing and there's one last caveat about this if you buy full self driving and you sell your car three years later and it's still not got any major improvements you don't get a refund of your six thousand entry quarter to take on to your next tesla you have to purchase it again and it might be more expensive on your next tesla so you're essentially possibly buying full self-driving not for yourself but for the next owner or the next owner after that so save your money and buy some shares if you've enjoyed this video check out the new videos down here don't forget to subscribe here and if you want to support my channel help
