 day which is January 8th of 2020 so we'll be coming back tomorrow to visit the other pavilions and the other booth we will try to visit the startup area I and we have here look soft which I have never heard of robotic driving which are if I'm not mistaken so far robotic bride robotic driving right which is the right into submission so you have like an SDK for automated driving that's not an SDK that's an okay is the full profit to to create your car to convert your car into one automated driving data so you do the sensor capturing from the lighter sensor - right so you provide this server I guess it sits in the car this is so or this server is in the crowd right it's begins right so the data should be collected okay in the vehicles and 54 terabyte this is 64 Churubusco holy cow that's correct so as soon as this cartridge is full then the data transfer could be done into the you know server on the cloud using the injured station okay or a copy station in this case and afterwards well there is a possibility to analyze this data directly by the procedure okay gatherings information about the you know metadata which is happening the room though Catchings is metadata from from information that is stored on the recordings right and then to prepare this information which is data for the next steps so basically what you do first is gathering all the sensor data that is in the vehicle and then you machine-learning big data analysis whatever you have to do that's correct also to you know drive zai development okay so you clean it junior rating ground truth okay right okay and then you are you in any particular vendor already like is this something you can disclose who uses your technology this is something that in this field for winding them so what are the minimum requirements need to be met by the autonomous driving project we need to have a lighter sensor and sensors in all the different components in the car or what whether they're required you need to collect so you can somewhat understand what kind of it's possible to reach it was a sensor setup it was a software okay five different levels from level 1 to level 5 which is four level finds the highest level one is just you know basics just like a parking or moving around the vehicle or whatever direct influence on how the systems are designed where there's a lot of division together for nursing out too to show some images to dream the system can assimilate I see here in your video over here that you show a B&W a car I assume that that's well it doesn't look like a be enjoyed by this is a B&W sure I mean I never seen anybody else make car it's like you show me an opportunity is that I love Virginia I don't know it looks like a Lamborghini good but that's correct that's the what you're saying about the testing right the validation so basically is a minute to push the partial testing and validation at scale right generating the digital tween of the vertical digital queen of the environment right implies the taste testing procedures that is already known by the goyim sentir ones chooses differs between idea and what was that last part that you have here showing here you had just a lighter machine a lighter sensor demonstration that you know the software that has been developed with the support of that platform right so it goes into so once you have it all working when you had the neural network working all this whatever I got it adapt it yes right and then you just make it into a firmware that sits in the car and as maybe you got a more data with more cars and you reflash it that your car becomes smarter yeah and so that's why also with a demonstration about the wider well we are performing the pedestrian detection and also visualization for you know digital cockpit in this particular case just transform I think I've seen this this uui before yeah I think it's a German company that those is widgets this is no no this is our yard right this is yes from loksat but definitely we have an expertise in there as well because we have also Department for the UI and the user experience right designing you know for special cases for alternate one last question will be when or what will be the price or the cost that you should like allocate or say I have a small company let's say I make up electric golf carts vehicles and I want to turn those into autonomous vehicles depends so the answer will be calming if you want this give me a call I'll work with you something like that you're basing one country oh you're instance are you guys in in the United States already - okay I guess in the US we also where's your operation credit quarters a good facility okay we have also in Detroit a good facility so basically where the music you know is play so you see if Detroit then you're thought the US manufacturers California maybe men's to yura whatever perhaps alright thank you very much it's very instructive we learn a lot you guys are watching take a TV show the first day here they can t be tomorrow when I come back we're gonna get back to the hotel where we're going to edit prepare song shows in your channel
