something away and we're giving away something big I'll tell you in a second what it is now if you all thought you'll also find out Facebook it'll be pinned to the top of the page I've run a short version of a 60 seconds to go to Instagram Twitter or tik-tok you'll find this there yes we are giving away once again a sleep evasion mattress fantastic mattress this is just a little sample of it you can see it's got the individual mattresses it's got the air channels very comfortable brand i both have one of these and we find it it's just it's a world of difference between this and when I sleep in the other bed that we have in our cabin yeah well I'm telling you Bob I didn't want to get out of bed this morning it was just fun to lay in it alright I'll get rid of this and you can show the pillow real quick but yeah yeah it comes with a pillow tool and the pillow also has a patented you have Springs inside this pillow in here Oh Bob you look like a lost puppy yeah anyways he said really nice pillows we got a cross-section here but we got to get on with this neck pain yeah we got to get going here we gotta go to work say no more okay Bob first first you want to adjust posture right well I want to talk a little bit about the nerve pinched nerve why are we addressing posture when we got a pinched nerve so why don't you show them where the nerves come out the neck on my neck there's you know you got the cervical spine here and the nurse come out at a nice level they come out and they actually come down and into the arm giving innervation to the arm as far as sensation and movement muscle movement right so if you get a pinching Ashi in the neck or anywhere along the line it can cause pain down the arm all the way down the arm into the hand right and weakness right as well as in that shoulder - typically the pinched nerve we find is in the neck yeah it can be along a line but majorities is in the neck so in order to keep that nerve from being pinched we find that poor posture head forward posture can cause problems where the nerve comes out the framin in the veranda and the spine itself causing that pinching so if we just change our posture it's a critical step you have to do this because if we if you try the exercises the other exercises we're gonna show you to help try to decrease the pain but you don't correct your posture it's not gonna go away it won't stay away it's gonna come right back again so you got a correct posture first right so here we go first one now these these we talk about these a lot over the years but you got to stick with the basics it's the found the fundamental foundation so we're gonna do scapular retraction oh you can do these in a seated or standing position I'll show how by my shoulder blades are basically squeezing together or if you want to think about them going downward into my pocket so this one goes down in this pocket this one goes down there that gets those lower traps working in the middle traps all together for a good posture do five to ten of these what's nice about these it's you can do these anywhere all right well you can't do them driving in the car yeah I supposed to be a little difficult well you can't it's like sitting on the steering wheel you might be I've been doing on church well but why not get the whole congregation yeah that's right and then we go to chin tucks chin going in like this so we're not tucking down it's in and back and back this for like you're bringing your chin right to your Adam's apple now this one's great for posture and this is also actually the first exercise that we start for treating the pinched nerve - right so now when you're doing this well we don't need to get into the framing but it doesn't open and gap the frame and what you can take that pinched nerve and relieve it this is one you can do in church you can do this in church you can just see your car - Wow yeah I've done it my car people look at you funny but it's okay everyone will be doing it it's not as he's doing chin tucks okay this one you need to do in a chair particularly if you're at work or at home you take a ball like this if it's a little soft it works a little bit better you don't want a hard ball that's blowing up with a lot of pressure and you're going to put that behind your back like I'm showing here and the W exercise that we show before it's basically the same technique but we're gonna relax into the ball and you can adjust the ball up or down and you'll know because it feels better in a certain position in you're in the right spot so right there I need to go up a little bit I can just feel it there we go and stretch back we can do this you can do Bob's alleluja stretch either way you're gonna get that shoulder to come back with a chin tuck then you can even let your head go back and get the full extension all it should be pain-free right and I this is a wonderful stretch it seriously is it's it's great for the neck and upper back fantastic stretch I'd highly recommend it for most people and all these you're gonna do five to ten repetitions and you know every 1 to 2 hours throughout the day as long as you can fit that in your schedule the next one this is where you go up against the wall all right we don't fall Brad over to the wall we use the wall and the wall is gonna show you good pass you take your your belt line or your butt area that goes against the wall shoulders against the wall bring your shoulders back the back your head with a slight chin technique now I've got good posture the the wall is my guide and I'm gonna bring my arms up like this and slide my arms up like this now I personally have a kind of a tough time getting my Schult my elbows to the wall but it's getting better over time there were years ago this was not possible for me so I'm improving and this works the proper muscles for posture and the walls guides you that you are in good posture oh and I'm getting tired you can feel this posture working aggressively you're gonna do that for a minute or two if you can go that long before you called wall angels yes and you know if you can picture Brad as an angel yeah yeah all right yeah that's a far cry now the other thing we do have if you wanna go the next step up this is actually postural exercise is great for the shoulders as well as the low back and it's our hanging handle right and you do that against the wall too and I'm just gonna hang out here haha no pun intended you know you'll do this for anywhere from ten to thirty seconds depending how long again it should be pain-free if this bothers your neck pinched nerve deck right you won't be doing this but if it feels good it's good you know and this basically has our it comes with our wall anchor and that comes with a clip that you could just clip on there and you have the handles and these these things are rated for how many pounds breath 250 each 250 or no I think it's 275 it might be yeah if you're close to 500 pounds you better not hang a LOF yeah so either way I think you're covered now we're gonna look at symptoms down the arms excellent it's not uncommon for a pinched nerve in the wound deck to send numbness tingling burning sensations all the way down to the finger Ignis even yep and weakness and if you are having weakness lee your grip is obviously weak you have a hard time opening the door you probably better go see a doctor yeah you better see a doctor if you get symptoms into the hand I would say that that's pretty extreme but what we can do and we've had a lot of success with this exercise is in a chair with a backrest you put your bottom all the way back in very good posture very good posture we've just worked on posture so you got that in your head and we're do some chin tucks and then we're gonna actually bring our head back now if you do this and it's this become uncomfortable and painful and it makes symptoms down the arm worse it's pretty clear you got a pinched nerve and your neck so if you take a towel roll well the red tape is just something to hold the towel together you can use rubber bands you don't even have to hold it together as long as you keep with your hands low on the neck back up against the chair and I've got an office chair that works good for me it don't get the kind that lets you go back so far you want a good support right so you feel confident in it then I'm gonna do my chin tuck and then gently go back and with this support here often times makes that pain much more comfortable and then you can go back and then when you start to feel pain you come forward again and back so you're not gonna hang out back there for 30 seconds or anything like that it's just a back until you feel the discomfort then come forward relax if you have the let's say this is the painful arm sometimes I'll let that one relax yeah I'm just grabbed with one arm sure and what you're looking for here ideally is we're looking for centralization of the symptoms what does that mean if let's see you're getting pain all the way down the arm into the hand even what you're looking for first is that it's going to get better in the hand or get better in the forearm first right so you want these symptoms to go away first and it might even get a little more intense here but it's going away here that's great that's a very good sign if you know even if you haven't less tingling yeah there that's a good sign you know anything that improves down here yeah eventually it'll get improve here eventually you'll feel it just into here and then eventually you'll feel it just in the neck that's the progression you want to feel that's centralization yeah that means you it's going the right way why don't you show them the other option sometimes you get that pinching and instead of using this it actually improves from going to the side right sometimes for some people this is for me and this was a I told this story before you're such a great example of he's a dentist and he was getting pain down so I'm very serious to the point where he wasn't gonna be able practice sure and so what he we had him do he tried those it didn't really help so what we did instead it pain were down the right arm so we had him doing the chin tuck and then side Bend alright and he would do these repeatedly and he would do these like you know ten times every hour a set of ten and it was it was miraculous Brad his arm pain and symptoms yeah within two days oh it was it was very much improved and within a week it was pretty much gone sure so you know it doesn't always go that way unfortunately but you know you like these small miracle wins yeah once in a while so all right last but not least we didn't do anything on the floor yet but now if you do have a six-inch form roller just another great postural one thing yeah and you're gonna roll and typically kind of up towards the neck and you can do the double use here as well hand bracket here with some chin tuck so all the same basic movement again pain free yeah and then one thing and I was just doing this with my wife because she is having some issues with paint on her arm and you can put the roll this way now if you have a foam roller that's a softer one like this blue one they're more comfortable to do this this is all you do you just hang out here for 15 30 seconds and you can just hang out now I've done this after exercise I'll just hang out here for three to five minutes and just relax and close my eyes and and go but if you gotta have the softer roller otherwise it's a little uncomfortable the black ones are the hard density the colored ones are typically the softer lazy man's way to posture there yeah lay down there and let it stretch let gravity do its thing I'm telling you Bob you you give someone the lazy person how to do a task and it'll be the easiest way that's right they'll figure out the best way to vary that's right right alright thanks everybody enjoy the day thanks everybody for watching [Music] you
