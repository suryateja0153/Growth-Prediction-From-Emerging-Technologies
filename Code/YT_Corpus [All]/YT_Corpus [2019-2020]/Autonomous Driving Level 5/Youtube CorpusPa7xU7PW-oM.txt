 (music) For over five years now, we've been driving the streets of our hometown, San Francisco, nearly nonstop. Day and night, rain or shine over two million miles, our zero-emission cars were ready to drive on their own. There've been so many tests and yet I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for it to start. Like I said, though, I mean, this is gonna be a big moment, but it's just gonna accelerate from here. It's gonna go from one vehicle on a few city blocks to several vehicles on several regions of the city. And before you know it, we're gonna be operating at city scale within multiple cities. (bell ringing) All systems ready, engaging in 3...2...1... engaged. Here we go. Oh, we're going driverless. Oh, it just happened. (upbeat music) After that very first drive, we did something you might expect. We did it again and again. There are no shortcuts in our mission to drive change. But every day, every hour, and every neighborhood, we get closer. We believe this is a drive worth taking. Oh, this is the beginning. If you're watching, there's not that many opportunities in life to work on a technology that's gonna disrupt the last 100 years of transportation, and probably not an opportunity for any of us to work on a technology that can have such a positive impact on society and on humanity. And this is our humble step in that direction.
