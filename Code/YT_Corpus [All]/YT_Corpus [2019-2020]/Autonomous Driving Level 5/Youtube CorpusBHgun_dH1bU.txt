 even in self-defense teamwork makes the dream work today's video is brought to you by the generosity of new bold targets new bold targets are self sealing reactive polymer targets that act like steel targets for training and practice but are safer than steel they allow bullets to pass completely through the target without ricochet or lead splatter check out their links in the description and thank them for bringing us today's video welcome to today's active self protection lesson I'm your host John Correa today's video comes to us from my home state Arizona out of Tucson and shows us an armed robber who gets a little more than he bargained for so what we see here is just another day at this restaurant and at me nidito and this guy comes in and he starts acting crazy and all of a sudden he's gonna come in and start giving these guys some significant problems he's got a knife in his hands you can see the employees is customers are trying to get the heck out of there these employees are just not having it and he's threatening but they're not backing down completely because they don't feel like they're at some significant threat apparently and even though he wants into the till they're like nah look at this big guy in front look at the look on his face he's just like nah man I'm not having that and one of the other employees decides to pull a WWF move but now that guy still has a free hand it's a little box cutter that he has in his hand if you go watch the news story and he's able to use it because they didn't necessarily get that arms secured and he's able to use that one of the guys he needed I think 14 stitches in his leg and one of the other employees was cut as well but now it's a dog pile on the rabbit and these guys are all after him and you could see the employees who aren't in immediate there's guys using a a broom there and using it like a pool cue and whacking him and now they finally I think have a good hold on that arm to keep him from doing that now some distracting punches just beat on him a little bit and they're gonna beat the tar out of him get that knife out of his hand and hold him there for a good long while you notice again I mean they call the cops for sure however it's taken that police officers forever to get there they're the ones responsible for their own defense and they've got to hold this guy down now notice how many guys it's taking but they did hold him there and you can see now that officers come and they arrest this guy and thankfully no one was worse hurt and he was stopped and that's where this one ends that's what my momma would have called a good old whooping I got a pull question for you out of this one have you talked to your co-workers about what you would do in a situation like this have you gamed it planned it I would at all hit the pole let me know what you think I think it's an interesting thing for us to discuss but some workplaces would be more open to that than others out of today's video I want to think about the incredible importance of launching a counter ambush I also want to think about working together as a team and communicating well and why empty-handed skills should be a part of everyone's repertoire so as this begins I get it that we talked about being prepared all the time but of course we're all just live in our lives right and everybody is simply trying to do their business during the day but that's just going to end very quickly because we're always at a deficit now think about the attitude of these guys here they recognize he has a little box cutter and if you have a high level of empty handed skill where you have a good advantage in numbers sometimes you can say nah man I'm not going to do that is it okay to resist if you have a high level of skill and enough of you that you feel like you can take him down sure just recognize that it does put you at risk and this guy here is getting angry and those kind of things and now the employee comes through with a distance tool this was actually really wise because this guy has a knife a box cutter in fact and it's a very short-range tool so the employee grabs a longer-range tool in the chair and yeah that looks like a WWF move and you know it's maybe not the most effective way because he didn't knock the guy out but the distance gives him an advantage so there's a principle that we talk about all the time have a force multiplier that gives you a distant disadvantage if at all possible that's a good way to be and if you don't have one that's purpose-built use one in your environment now notice here that that he comes out of the way but notice that the guy's arm is free and because his arm width and the knife and it is free he throws it around in a roundhouse and almost cuts the heck out of that guy's an act that could have been deadly in a hurry because it comes around so if you have an armed opponent remember those five DS plus one if you're not armed yourself got a the first thing you gotta do is control the distance then deflect and then dominate that tool if you leave that tool wielding arm free he is gonna cut you to ribbons and that's actually what we see happen here is yes they're all over him but notice his arm with the tool is free and they have not secured it now it comes around again and can slice this guy very dangerous you have to deflect and then dominate dominate the tool dominate the hand with the tool dominate the entire arm with the tool that has to be your primary goal also very difficult to do in the moment because under the stress of a deadly threat auditory exclusion is a very common side effect however you really want to work to try to communicate together as a team so that you're able to old work in concert and not duplicate efforts these guys really as they are all thinking about what they have to do to dominate that hand to get that guy down need to start thinking and helping each other to do the right things together to get him off them and to keep him from hurting anyone and they start doing that I really think it's wise that they are working together I have a hold of him here you have a hold of him there I've got him by the neck you get that hand put that hand behind him hold that thing down there hey he's cutting this guy make sure you get that hey stop that help him punch him a couple times knock that guy out now here's where some control techniques would be really valuable and this is one of the reasons that I say empty handed skills so important for all self defenders and I really think some of those empty handed skills should be based in a grappling based art in a ground based art something like jujitsu judo those kind of things because what that does is it teaches you how to control someone who means you harm and it can teach you how to do so in such a way that maybe with a you know a vascular neck restraint or you know what they would call in jujitsu a rear-naked choke or something like that could be helpful to get this guy down now thankfully that it took him forever but the police finally got there but also noticed that the police weren't there in time to protect anyone and that's not a bad thing on our police officers they just can't be everywhere all at once these guys were responsible for saving themselves they had to attitude the skills and the plan to do so I admire them for doing it they covered their ass [Music] [Music] [Music]
