 Sejal City has taken the first step towards self-driving public transport on Tuesday running its first road test the city hopes for passengers to be able to ride on these driverless buses by 2023 ari Choi dong-hoon has the story a driver takes her hand off the steering wheel and her feet from the accelerator the bus reads data from the traffic light and calculates when to stop and take turns this is a self-driving bus that the city of sejong plans to demonstrate on public roads from next month self-driving busses have had several trials in the restricted testing environment but this is the first time in Korea those buses have driven themselves along with regular vehicles in real traffic situations there were more concerns and excitement at first but I was relieved to see the bus smoothly and able to recognize pedestrians in dangerous situations it was a bit frustrating as a bus gave way to other vehicles too often it drove really slowly when Lincoln turns were changing lanes the Ministry of Land infrastructure and transport will operate two of these level three buses and roads as a test project traveling a 9.8 kilometer route roughly twice a week it will then scale up the project by operating eight buses was level for vehicles on the 35 kilometers in 2021 and allow local residents to actually write the buses moving towards a final goal of commercializing the buses in 2020 three out of the five levels of driverless vehicles a level three car can carry out a range of autonomous driving functions but the driver must be ready to take control at level four the vehicle is in full control under limited conditions and that level five a driverless vehicle can drive without any driver present experts say self-driving services in public transport might see commercialization earlier than normal vehicles as the buses are driven on specific routes and they're operated under central transport management systems which makes it easy to collect data this minibus is an on-demand service users can download applications and set locations where to get on and off the bus people with disabilities or who live in rural areas can benefit from this as this is a human free bus you can bring efficiency in operations by driving 24 hours with shorter bus interval however in order to establish such a system in Korea changes in the law on safety and regulatory issues are required clear standards on responsibility for accidents and insurance must be resolved Choi Jong Hyun Arirang news
