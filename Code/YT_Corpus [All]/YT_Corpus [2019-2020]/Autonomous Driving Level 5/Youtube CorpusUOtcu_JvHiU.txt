 hey everyone Azura here once again the new week of Tides of War challenge is coming in two days this week we are going to get the Valentine arches self-propelled anti-tank gun today I'm going to talk a little bit about the tank history and interesting facts but if you want to skip ahead to find out the most efficient way to unlock this tank through the challenges I'll leave the timestamps in the description below the archer tank destroyer is based on a valentine tank it uses the same chassis but with an engine upgrade with this relatively small chassis it does pack a big punch 17 pounder anti-tank cannon I will show you some rounds comparisons here you can see that the 6 pounder that the Valentine Mk VIII uses here in the center the one on the rights of its is used by the regular Sherman tank then you can see a 17 pounder right next to it it is massively bigger and more powerful than a 6 pounder because of the large size of this cannon and it's impossible for the tank to have a turret it is mounted in an open-topped armor box facing backwards to keep the size small an interesting side note is that the same cannons also mounted on a Sherman Firefly tank back to the Archer it is also interesting that the tank cannot move while firing because a gun breech will recoil into the drivers position the driver has to physically leave his seat before they fire the shot it's backwards design does allow the tank escape with ease it will be interesting to see how it DICE will balance his tank judging from the trailer here it appears that the tank is capable of firing while moving but the unanswered question would be whether the drivers are susceptible to explosives or bullets because of this open-topped design I personally think that main driver will be immune to external damage but we'll find out in a few days now we'll be discussing this week's challenge there are three main progression paths that you can follow I will show you the challenges here the middle path I believe is the easiest and most consistent both the top path and the bottom path required to disarm or arm an objective this may be a little challenging for many players because only a small number of players can interact with those objectives at a time once again I do think the central path is easiest I've highlighted the objectives here you need to kill an enemy within 15 meters then you need to spot 10 enemies using a spotting player in one life I recommend you to stop by the ammo station before attempting this because you may not get all 10 people with just one flare then you need to win three rounds and complete three squad orders these will be very easy just keep playing the game quick game modes like TDM domination or squad conquest will likely let you finish these very quickly the last one will require you to inflict 500 damage using hand grenades I think impact grenades will likely be more consistent but feel free to use any grenades of your choice and that's really it for today I'll give my thoughts on the archer tank when it gets released please consider liking and subscribing to the channel if you think this video has earned it I would really appreciate it have a good day and I will see you all next time
