 twenty-eight and 20 seconds a.m. Central time 9 28 and 20 seconds p.m. in Baikonur you are looking live at launch site 1 Yuri Gagarin's launch pad at the Baikonur cosmodrome where human spaceflight began more than 58 years ago a team of launch controllers is watching over all systems aboard the Soyuz rocket which is fully fueled and ready for launch no issues have been tracked throughout the day which began with fuel and oxidizer loading in the Soyuz booster about 6:20 8 a.m. Central time 4:28 p.m. in Baikonur fueling of the Soyuz booster was completed about two hours later along with the flight control teams around the world supporting the International Space Station program here in Mission Control Houston a team is watching over the expedition 60 crew and Space Station systems preparing to support the increase in crew size later today from 3 to 6 with the addition of NASA astronaut drew Morgan European Space Agency astronaut Luca parmitano and Russian cosmonaut and soyuz commander alexander skvortsov this trio was about to begin a planned four orbit six-hour flight to the International Space Station with docking scheduled at 5:51 p.m. Central Time 651 p.m. Eastern Time their Soyuz ms 13 spacecraft will be docking later today to the aft port of the Zvezda service module joining the Soyuz ms 12 spacecraft that is linked to the Rassvet module on the earth-facing port of the Russian segment morgan parmitano and sports auth will join the current station residents onboard NASA astronauts Christina Cooke and Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut and station commander alexey ovchinin who arrived at the station aboard soyuz ms 12 back on march 15th here in Houston the team in Mission Control will be monitoring today's launch and receiving updates on the flight from their Russian counterparts flight director Mary Lawrence is on console for today's launch joined by the Capcom or spacecraft communicator european space agency astronaut andre US Mogensen who will be talking directly to the station crew throughout the day during the Soyuz has climbed to orbit tracking in telemetry will be downlink to ground stations along the flight path and will be routed to the Russian Mission Control Center in the town of curly off on the outskirts of Moscow you're looking at a view of that control room from a balcony camera and throughout the day we'll be taking questions from you on social media if you have Soyuz launch questions you'd like answered during our broadcast please submit them on twitter using the hashtag ask NASA I'm ready to copy all the parameters guys this is Sawyer's lead this is just one with this day of historical significance so much on our minds that is not lost on the crew members themselves who are set to launch a short time from now recently during pre-launch activities at Red Square in Moscow NASA's drew Morgan who's a colonel in the United States Army took a moment to reflect on the significance of launching to the International Space Station on this day the 50th anniversary of the landing of Apollo 11 at tranquility base I think that it's a huge honor for both my crew my Soyuz crew as well as the entire crew of expedition 60 that will be joining and for us to be launching as an international crew to the International Space Station it's just a beautiful way to commemorate that and for us here in the same year that nASA has laid out this very bold plan to return to the surface of the Moon by 2024 as part of the Artemis program this is just a just a tremendous honor for us to be participating this way and to be carrying the torch forward of space exploration and continuing to a spot to inspire generations both today and generations in the future and for Luca parmitano a lieutenant colonel in the Italian Air Force the Apollo program represented a dream to be fulfilled and the moon has a special destination to visit with a live view of the Soyuz booster on the launch pad at the Baikonur cosmodrome the countdown standing at t-minus 51 minutes and Counting before launch lift off again scheduled for 11 28 and 20 seconds a.m. Central time nine twenty-eight and 20 seconds p.m. in Baikonur all of the pre-launch preparations as we mentioned earlier have gone by the book everything proceeding on track in about 10 minutes the retraction of the gantry arms will be completed to expose the Soyuz booster for the final 45 minutes or so of the cow down the crew climbed on board of destroyers less than an hour ago strapped inside for their ride to orbit conducted leak checks the hatch to the Soyuz spacecraft is closed as we mentioned earlier Luca parmitano of the European Space Agency who is a lieutenant colonel in the Italian Air Force in pre-launch activities at Red Square in Moscow a few weeks ago before the crew departed for Baikonur also offered his views on the significance of launching on this day the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11s landing on the moon I think my generation was affected by the Apollo program despite the fact that we didn't see it happening I was born about six years after the last landing but it was such a momentous event we change humanity forever that it created what I would call a collective memory growing up I would I would see it in toys or reports on on TV documentaries I could I would hear my parents talk about it and as a matter of fact for the first 10 or 12 years of my life I was convinced that we were still going to the moon I was not aware of the fact that we had stopped traveling to the moon long before I was born so it gave me a sense that going to the moon and being an astronaut was something possible despite the fact that I was born in Sicily which is that the periphery of Europe far away from anything that is aerospace related I think he affected me more ways that I can describe because it gave me it gave me that sense of possibility which is what I would like to communicate when I talk to students and young kids that things are possible that was Luca parmitano who was board engineer number one seated in the left seat of the Soyuz ms-13 you see this view of the launch site one yuri gagarin's launch pad where human space flight began 58 years ago more than 58 years ago with his launch on April 12 1961 again just now beginning the retraction of the gantry arms the service structures that have surrounded the Soyuz spacecraft in its booster since it rolled out to the launch pad back on Thursday the launch again is just 47 and a half minutes from now at 11:28 and 20 seconds a.m. Central time 12 28 and 20 seconds p.m. Eastern time here in Mission Control several graphics have been specially prepared before this 50th anniversary of Apollo 11s landing on the moon on this front screen you see as some of the insignias of the partner agencies of the International Space Station program the Apollo 11 logo Apollo 11s 50th anniversary in the words we came in peace for all mankind the words on the plaque on the leg of the lunar module eagle that landed at tranquility base 50 years ago today and earlier today less than an hour ago the legendary flight director who was on console in the Apollo mission operations control room one floor above us Gene Kranz visited flight director Mary Lawrence and spacecraft communicator ondrea's mogensen on this 50th anniversary of the landing of eagle at tranquility base accompanied by the chief flight director Holly ridings this truly a moment in history Kranz wearing his traditional white vest he is his callsign was white flight back during the day visiting Mary Lawrence whose callsign is infinity flight on this 50th anniversary of the landing of Apollo 11 Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin that occurred at 3:18 p.m. Central time 4:18 p.m. Eastern time near the crater molt he at tranquility base on the surface of the Moon to rewrite humankind history and now a good view once again from our cameras at the launch pad at site one at the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan as the gantry arms are retracting to expose the Soyuz booster the FG booster and the Soyuz ms-13 spacecraft and here's a view inside ms-13 of the bottom of your screen as soyuz commander alexander skvortsov of ros cosmos to his left at the top of the screen is European Space Agency astronaut Luca parmitano just out of the field of view to the right of scores off is NASA astronaut drew Morgan hanging over escorts off is a zero-g indicator a toy duck that squirts off has used as a mascot to indicate motion during powered flight and the absence of gravity once of the Soyuz separates from the third stage of its booster into the preliminary orbit for the chase to catch up to the International Space Station the same mascot that sport saw flew on his two previous Soyuz flights he is about to embark on his third flight into space parmitano his second drew Morgan making his first flight into space today we're approaching the 44 minute mark until launch again the countdown proceeding smoothly on a sweltering midsummer night at the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan about to begin a mission to increase the crew size from the from three to six aboard the International Space Station as expedition 60 crew members Christina cooked Nick Hague and alexey ovchinin the current station commander await the arrival of three new crewmates later today the day's activities in Baikonur begins several hours ago the crew was awakened at about 228 Central Time 12:20 8 p.m. local time and Baikonur some nine hours before launch the crew members then participated in final pre-launch activities that began at their crew quarters and a time-honored tradition before departing for the launch pad the three crew members observed the ritual of autographing the doors of the rooms they occupied at the cosmonaut Hotel in the town of Baikonur the crew received a traditional blessing from an russian orthodox priest God's a guide for you see and then to the traditional music around 528 a.m. Central time the crew departed the cosmonaut hotel and boarded a bus for their 40 minute ride to the integration and suit-up facility at building 254 inside the Baikonur cosmodrome again an extremely hot day temperatures over the century mark in Baikonur a large throng of family members and well-wishers on hand to watch the crew bid farewell as they climbed aboard their bus for the 40 minute ride out to the cosmodrome and the SUDEP facility at site 254 okay guys bye good luck we're with you [Music] [Music] [Applause] and the crew bus departed for the sudo facility now you're looking inside the site 250 for several hours ago as the crew began its suit up procedures the soyuz commander alexander skvortsov suiting up inside his Sokol a launch and entry suit joined in that activity by Luca parmitano and drew Morgan you'll see in a moment as the suits were pressurized to ensure that they were leak free as a family members looked on across a protective pane of glass maintaining quarantine with the suit up having been completed about three and a half hours prior to launch this is video that was recorded just a few hours ago at the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan alexander's corks off and Luca parmitano will be aboard the International Space Station until February sixth next year a slightly extended stay for Drew morgan he will remain onboard the International Space Station until April 1st of next year returning home with Alex for coschka and Jessica Mir of NASA who will be launching on September 25th you can see a view there of some of the large throng of family members VIPs and well-wishers in the suit up facility again separated by that protective pane of glass to maintain medical quarantine Morgan set to begin the first flight for him this will be the second flight into space for Luca parmitano and the third coming up for Alexander Skvortsov we'll be talking more about these three crew members just a few moments from now there you see a drew Morgan settling into what essentially is a replica of the seat that he is now strapped into aboard the Soyuz ms-13 spacecraft as the leak checks were conducted to ensure that his suit is airtight and ready to support the 8-minute 45 second flight to orbit countdown by the way proceeding on track launch schedule less than thirty six and a half minutes from now [Music] and you see Luca parmitano settling in for his pressurization check of his sokol launch and entry suit and there's drew Morgan as he strode up to the glass to have a chat with his family final opportunity to talk to them before heading to the launch path the skies [Music] [Music] as you can see the crew in good spirits very animated as they had this opportunity to share their thoughts about their suit up the final hours before liftoff [Music] [Music] and their suits lead-free and ready to support launch the crew then exchanged final thoughts with senior Russian Russian NASA and European Space Agency managers one final opportunity to receive expressions of good luck and Godspeed before departing for the launch pad everything is fine that way great point having successful flight wish you knew that everything goes as planned I am glad to see you happy focus goal-oriented phases we're confident seriously you guys are well trim down you look very ready to go see factor in soft landing [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] once again maintaining tradition the crew members strode out of the site 254 integration building toward Russian managers to declare one final time that they were ready for launch before boarding their bus this was at about 8:30 a.m. Central time for the ride that Launchpad won the drive took about 25 minutes with an arrival at the pad just before 9 a.m. Central time [Applause] decree of the transportation Soyuz vehicle is ready for lunch no the blogroll domestic I've replaced it back away from the glass away from the bus this video now showing the crew arriving at launch pad one at the pad the crew you'll see in a moment climbed a few stairs and waved goodbye to well-wishers entering the elevator for the ride to the top of the soyuz rocket to board their capsule which they've now been aboard for the past two hours who of them s12 has arrived at the lunch bed should we take photographs and the elevator carrying the crew headed up to the 160 foot level where the crew boarded the Soyuz vehicle they are strapped in of course and ready for launch now back with a live view of the Soyuz on the launch pad and Baikonur the gantry arms had been retracted we are now coming up on the t-minus 28 minute mark before a launch lift off again scheduled for 11 28 and 20 seconds a.m. Central time 9 28 and 20 seconds p.m. in Baikonur 50 years ago on this day the world Stood Still and held its collective breath as NASA rewrote the history books of course by landing humans on the moon that achievement came less than a decade after a call to action by President Kennedy join us now as we take a look back at how those words and the efforts that followed inspired and continued to inspire generations of space explorers and it is one of the great adventures of all time [Music] - I climb the highest mountain why 35 years ago fly the Atlantic why does Rice play Texas we choose to go to the moon we choose to go to the moon we choose to go to an armed program [Music] expedition 12 commander bill McArthur with a greeting for his expedition 11 counterpart [Music] because of your work because of the ingenuity dedication and entrepreneurial spirit reflected in this room and throughout the American space enterprise since the end of Apollo 11 we forged incredible breakthroughs in our technology have allowed us to go further more safely in space than ever before [Music] let me be clear the first woman and the next man on the moon [Music] we'll be American astronauts once again a live view just after sunset of the Soyuz ms-13 extremely warm night at the Baikonur cosmodrome in the Central Asian desert today's launch marking the first flight into space for NASA's drew Morgan the second for Luca parmitano of the European Space Agency and the third for Roscosmos cosmonaut and Soyuz ms-13 commander Alexander Skvortsov with that in mind and a look at the crew let's take a moment to learn more about drew Morgan NASA's next astronaut to fly in space I think I often describe myself as a soldier a physician and an astronaut the pursuit of those happen in that order one of the earliest memories I have is of always wanting to be in the military of wanting to be a soldier quite a history of military service in our family both of my grandparents my my father was an Air Force officer and I also remember my parents telling me a story about my great uncle Clank Perry McClintock who was a paratrooper in World War two he was in the 101st Airborne Division and jumped at Normandy on d-day and then jumped in operation Market Garden in Holland and that was the first time I had ever heard of the concept of a paratrooper or what it meant to be an airborne soldier so when I later decided and graduated in high school and I went to West Point I knew that I was very interested in this concept of being an airborne soldier at West Point they had a parachute team called the Black Knights yes I made the parachute team and and that became one of the central activities of my remaining three and a half years at West Point in addition to academics after class we jumped most days of the week but then we were also demonstration team so we jumped in football games also while I was a cadet I went through military basic airborne course which taught military static lines parachuting specifically the parachute aspect of it if I go back to the time when I was a cadet my teammates that I was selected with became my best friends in the world and continued to be to this day and that camaraderie that we had and that dependency we had on each other making sure that we were skilled in the aircraft skilled in the air our lives depended on each other to do safety checks of each other that type of camaraderie is something that I feel now in the astronaut corps with my astronaut colleagues as well I think about how 20 years ago I was developing those skills at an early age and didn't even know it [Music] I'm Andrew Morgan and I'm a soldier a physician and an astronaut [Music] born in Morgantown West Virginia to a military family drew Morgan moved between California New York Texas Great Britain and Delaware over the course of his childhood he graduated from high school in Delaware earned a Bachelor of Science degree in environmental engineering at the US Military Academy at West Point and then earned a doctorate in medicine from the uniformed services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda Maryland he is an emergency physician in the US Army with a specialization in primary care sports medicine he holds ratings as a military flight surgeon and as a special operations diving medical officer his military career includes service and elite Special Operations units in Washington and in Iraq Afghanistan and Africa Morgan along with current station residents Nick Hague and Christina cook was selected to become an astronaut as part of NASA's 21st astronaut class known by the nickname the eight-balls together they participated in a two-year highly specialized training program completing that training in July of 2015 Morgan Haig and cook along with Luca parmitano are all part of what will be the Space Station's space walking teams for the next several months in fact if all goes as planned Morgan will be joining Nick Haig next month to install the next international docking adaptor to the harmony module during a spacewalk and is slated to join parmitano for a complex series of spacewalks later this year to repair and refurbish the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer which was delivered to the station in 2011 in addition to being an accomplished soldier physician and soon to be space traveler there's a lot more to astronaut drew Morgan as we head into the final minutes of the launch countdown let's take a look once again at this unique individual [Music] what's your favorite movie Band of Brothers your favorite food anything spicy favorite color olive drab are you a morning person or a night nurse definitely a morning

song for your life live it well by Switchfoot you could spend one day on mars what would you do there for fun take pictures what is a life goal you plan to achieve this year come home safely from space born and paterno Italy European Space Agency astronaut Luca parmitano is a lieutenant colonel in the Italian Air Force after completing a bachelor's degree in political science at the University of Naples Federico - in 1999 he graduated from the Italian Air Force Academy in 2000 the following year he completed basic flight training with the US Air Force involved in European NATO joint jet pilot training at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas he continued his training completing coursework in Germany in 2002 in Italy in 2003 in Belgium in 2005 and then completing a master's degree in experimental flight test engineering in July of 2009 parmitano flew the AMX aircraft with the thirteenth group 32nd wing in Amendola Italy from 2001 to 2007 obtaining all aircraft qualifications during that time in 2007 he was selected by the Italian Air Force to become a test pilot he has logged more than 2000 hours of flight time his qualified are more than twenty types of military airplanes and helicopters and his flow over 40 types of aircraft selected as an ISA astronaut in 2009 parmitano was assigned as a flight engineer to the Italian Space Agency's first long-duration mission on the International Space Station flying in 2013 aboard soyuz tma onine m to the station as a member of the expedition 36/37 crew he took part in a pair of spacewalks logging a combined total of seven hours and 39 minutes outside the station he will take over command of the International Space Station from current commander alexey ovchinin in october becoming the third european astronaut on the first italian to do so he is board engineer number one for today's launch the left of the Soyuz commander Roscosmos cosmonaut alexander skvortsov who is returning to space for the third time today a retired colonel in the Russian Air Force Skvortsov was born in the shulk of a Moscow region in Russia after graduating from high school and then from the Stavrou Pohl Air Force pilot and navigator school as pilot engineer he went on to graduate from the military red banner Zhukov air defense Academy in 1997 as a navigator and operational tactical fighter Defense aviator he served as a pilot a senior pilot and an air flight commander squirts off enlisted into the astronaut and cosmonaut core of the Gagarin cosmonaut training center in 1997 becoming a member of the 12th cosmonaut class and becoming a test cosmonaut in November of 1999 qualified as a cosmonaut instructor he is qualified as both a diver and a powered paragliding instructor having performed over 500 jumps in 2010 he graduated from the Russian Academy of Public Administration with a degree in law he is a veteran of two long-duration spaceflights both to the International Space Station in 2010 he was the commander of Soyuz TMA 18 an expedition 23 flight engineer in the station's expedition 24 commander his second spaceflight took place in 2014 once again taking on the role of commander of Soyuz TMA 12 M and working aboard the space station as an 39/40 flight engineer during his mission he performed two spacewalks accumulating a total of 12 hours and 33 minutes outside the station as mentioned earlier he is serving as Soyuz ms-13 commander today and will be a flight engineer during expeditions 60 and 61 as we celebrate the Apollo 11 anniversary today as we've mentioned several times earlier in this broadcast and inspired by the Apollo missions drew Morgan described the significance and the symbolism of his cruise expedition 60 crew patch during a recent crew news conference 60 patch there are elements of that hatch that commemorate the Apollo 11 moon landing you are familiar with the Apollo 11 patch bears some resemblance rather than the moon in the foreground we have the earth in the foreground and the moon in the background and the El constellation for the fifty years and then the Eagle constellation and just like the Eagle in the Apollo 11 patch so you know the patch designers and the crew came together and really thought this was a great idea and very similar to the Apollo 11 patch of course there are no names represented on this patch which was an important element for us as well that to really embody that sense that this was an accomplishment of the world and not one single country and we're back with our live coverage of the launch of Morgan parmitano and supports off and of course on the launch pad at the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan the Soyuz ms-13 stands on the floodlit launch pad with liftoff scheduled just under 14 minutes from now the Soyuz rocket stands 162 feet tall weighs six hundred eighty thousand pounds and consists of the Soyuz ms-13 inside a protective shroud at the top and the three-stage Soyuz FG booster below the Soyuz spacecraft that will take our trio of crew members to orbit today was mated to its booster and the three main stages were joined together on Wednesday just 24 hours later on Thursday the soyuz rocket began its trek to the launch pad right on time at 7 a.m. Baikonur time maintaining tradition arriving less than two hours later where it was raised to its vertical position for final pre-launch preparations the Soyuz is now of course poised for launch with its three crew members on board the Soyuz spacecraft sitting high above the three stages of the Soyuz booster which uses kerosene and liquid oxygen as the propellant at engine ignition the Soyuz as engines will come up to flight speed the launch pad hold down arms will retract and the booster rocket will be on its way the first stage engines and liquid fuel strap-on boosters will burn for about one minute 58 seconds as the Soyuz arcs out to the northeast from the Baikonur cosmodrome on a trajectory designed to catch up to the International Space Station six hours later just before first stage separation the vehicles launch escape tower will be jettisoned followed seconds later by the jettisoning of the four strap-on first-stage boosters about a half minute later the clamshell fairing around the upper stage of the booster will separate exposing the Soyuz ms-13 for the first time as the Soyuz continues its Trek uphill the second stage of the Soyuz rocket will burn until the four minute 57 second mark when the third stage will ignite a so-called hot stage technique that precedes the separation of the second stage the third stage will continue to fire until eight minutes 45 seconds after launch when it too will shut down leading to Soyuz spacecraft separation that will be followed within seconds by the deployment of the soyuz MS 13 solar arrays and navigational antennas at this point the soyuz in its three-man crew will be in its preliminary orbit for this chase to catch up to and dock to the International Space Station and that Soyuz spacecraft is scheduled to dock to the aft part of the space station's Zvezda service module later today for orbits after launch docking the schedule for 551 p.m. Central Time 651 p.m. Eastern Time now just eleven minutes until launch down at the Baikonur cosmodrome a large group of NASA Russian and European representatives is at the cosmodrome a short distance from the launch pad and with them NASA public affairs officer Dan Huot who was there to provide an update on activities there dan hello Rob coming to you from a very sweltering Kazakhstan where temperatures throughout the weeks activities have climbed into the triple digits but haven't dampened the excitement to see this launch one bit friends and family from our crew members along with senior program officials including NASA International Space Station program manager Kirk Shireman where's cosmos head Dmitry Rogozin and ISA director-general yawn Verner are all on location to support the launch of this international crew taking flight 50 years the day after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin put humanity's first footprints on the moon Morgan scores off in parmitano we'll have no shortage of activities once they arrive with their expedition slated to be jam-packed with more than 260 science investigations a steady stream of visiting spacecraft and upwards of a dozen spacewalks including some of the most ambitious forays into the vacuum of space ever conceived that we'll see Morgan and parmitano work to extend the life of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer a massive particle physics experiment looking to unlock the secrets behind the origin of our universe for now though I'll send it back to you Rob and Mission Control Houston as we countdown to liftoff here in Baikonur back with a live view of the soyuz on the launch pad that countdown approaching the t-minus nine minute mark inside the crew cabin the crew is making final preparations for launch a good view of drew morgan his face partially obscured by the zero-g mascot that he is batting around in a playful manner at the lower right hand corner of your screen as soyuz commander alexander skvortsov just a few minutes ago that come the crew completed their final suit leak checks the testing of the descent module in which the three crew members are strapped inside is now complete the spacecraft's gyros are in flight readiness and flight recorders have now been activated just eight and a half minutes away from launch pre launch operations nearly complete at the Baikonur cosmodrome launch controllers at the blockhouse in Baikonur reporting everything is in readiness for liftoff at the time of launch the International Space Station will be flying 254 miles over southern Russia flying between Kazakhstan and Mongolia some 646 miles ahead of the Soyuz as it climbs off the launch pad the Soyuz will be launching into a narrow corridor of just 34 point two degrees basically the moment where the Earth's rotation carries the Baikonur cosmodrome into the plane of the station's orbit very much like driving a car onto an on-ramp of a freeway to expedite the Soyuz is four orbits six-hour trek to catch up to the International Space Station later today we're now at the seven and a half minute mark before launch at this point in the countdown the Soyuz is first and second stage engines have been declared ready for launch telemetry being received from the rocket indicating that all primary and backup systems are set to support liftoff at a view from the other camera inside the descent module squirts off at the bottom of your screen at the top of your screen European Space Agency astronaut Luca parmitano ready to begin his second flight into space here in Mission Control in Houston flight director Mary Lorenz has pulled all of her flight controllers the International Space Station is ready to accept the arrival of the three crew members later today Lawrence on console joined by European Space Agency astronaut and spacecraft communicator ondrea's Mogensen the feed that you're watching on NASA TV is also being uplinked to the crew onboard the International Space Station now at the t-minus six and a half minute mark before launch all this is just one word we are feeling well that report through an interpreter of the words of Alexander Skvortsov saying the crew feels well they are ready for launch by the way a launch key has now been inserted in the launch bunker this is a real key that transitions the launch sequence into its automatic mode and you're hearing some of the music that is piped in from the blockhouse in Baikonur to relax the crew in the final minutes before liftoff this is a traditional activity coming up on the 5-minute mark before launch the blockhouse in Baikonur reporting the range is clear the Soyuz rocket ready to begin its journey up hill t-minus five minutes and Counting onboard systems now are being switched to onboard control the commander's cockpit displays have been activated and the crew has closed their helmets putting them on suit oxygen - - 4 minutes 28 seconds as we speak the International Space Station now flying directly over the Baikonur cosmodrome the fuel lines and other elements of the rocket engines now being purged with nitrogen to fireproof them by removing fuel and oxidizer vapours inside four minutes before launch everything proceeding on track the next major activity will be the drain back of excess propellant to make sure the Soyuz booster is of the proper weight for liftoff less than three and a half minutes before launch the other everything is well onward coffee 2-3 minutes and Counting just seconds away from the boosters fuel tanks being pressurized for flight this will optimize the flow of fuel and help to add structural support to the rocket as it sits on the launch pad the propellant tank pressurization initiated coming up on the t-minus two minute mark on the 50th anniversary of humanity's first footsteps on the moon t-minus two minutes and Counting coming up on determination of the ground propellant feed at the 1-minute mark the vehicle will be placed on internal power t-minus 90 seconds the first of two ground umbilicals will retract their from the side of the vehicle at about the t-minus 35 second mark that will initiate auto sequence start t-minus 50 seconds you go to internal power ground first of the two umbilicals now retracting t-minus 30 seconds the second umbilical now retracting initiating auto sequence start we have main engine ignition engines and turbo pumps up to flight speed five four three two one and liftoff fifty years after a small step for man the Soyuz rocket and its multinational crew take a giant leap off the launch pad bound for the International Space Station [Music] good first stage performance Soyuz delivering nine hundred thirty thousand pounds of thrust from its four boosters and single engine the night time sky is creating a halo like effect as the Soyuz arcs to the Northeast away from the Baikonur cosmodrome in pursuit of the International Space Station the vehicle are nominal and they're stable copy good reports from the blockhouse in Baikonur punching a hole through the clouds overhead good engine performance being reported your feet roll are nominal one minute 10 seconds into the flight alexander skvortsov reports the crew is feeling well now going through the period of maximum dynamic pressure leaving a contrail Soyuz traveling almost 3,000 miles an hour 15 miles in altitude 10 miles downrange from the Baikonur cosmodrome one minute 45 seconds after launch all structural parameters reported to be in excellent shape a good view inside MS 13 Alexander sports off at the bottom of your screen at the top

downrange from the Baikonur cosmodrome to want to have minutes into the flight all structural parameters reported to be an excellent shape second stage performance reported nominal the launch shroud has now been jettisoned and now we're seeing a view from a camera on the second stage of the Soyuz rocket we will no longer see in cabin views that external camera activated by Alexander Skvortsov from a button on his control panel but a great view of looking down the Soyuz booster again this view from a second stage camera on the Soyuz rocket three minutes 15 seconds into the flight everything proceeding normally 120 seconds of the second stage engines are operating nominally and everything is nominal onboard with you involved 220 seconds the flight is nominal copy everything is nominal on board four minutes into the flight almost halfway through powered flight as the Soyuz ms-13 in its trio of crew continues its flight uphill and the beginning of a six-hour journey to the International Space Station a spectacular view from a second stage camera on the Soyuz booster the Soyuz traveling 8,500 miles an hour 91 miles in altitude 248 miles downrange from the Baikonur cosmodrome

from the Soyuz booster at the five minute 15-second mark into the flight three and a half minutes of powered flight remaining the Soyuz being powered on the singular capability of its third stage engine all parameters are reported in excellent shape three hundred and thirty seconds in the third stage engines are operating nominally the soyou is now traveling over ten thousand miles an hour 111 miles in altitude 417 miles downrange from the Baikonur cosmodrome and by the way at the time of third stage shut down an orbital insertion the ISS will be flying over the far eastern coast of Russia near the Sea of Japan almost 2,500 statute miles ahead of the Soyuz as it begins its chase to catch up to the station and Ernest six minutes 20 seconds into the flight two and a half minutes of powered flight remaining 190 seconds the launch vehicle parameters are nominal copy Oh everything is nominal on board the cruise feeling well all the parameters are nominal as you can hear Alexander Skvortsov continuing to provide progress reports to the launch control center in Baikonur at the time of third stage shutdown in spacecraft separation control of the Soyuz his flight to the International Space Station will be reverted back to the flight control team of the Russian Mission Control Center in Korea on the outskirts of Moscow 7 minutes 15 seconds into the flight the Soyuz traveling thirteen thousand two hundred miles an hour 124 miles in altitude 715 miles downrange from the Baikonur cosmodrome the vehicle stable copy everything is nominal here good reports continue to be received back from the blockhouse in Baikonur good structural parameters the third stage engine continues to burn as advertised as we approach the 8 minute mark into the flight third stage engines are operating nominally everything is nominal onboard we're doing well 490 seconds the vehicle is stable okay all everything is nominal here we're doing well eight and a half minutes into the flight about 15 seconds away from third stage shutdown in spacecraft separation Patrol are nominal copy we are sending by for coal and everything is nominal on board and we have third stage shutdown and separation its confirm congratulations on the nominal orbital insertion Mission Control Moscow is here get you Slav is here congratulations again copy all thank you very much and you can see the Soyuz solar arrays beginning to unfurl as planned clear loud and clear as well and we have confirmation of a perfect solar array deploy a vanilla antennas have also been deployed a text book launch for Soyuz ms-13 three new space explorers enroute to the International Space Station 50 years to the day that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon okay we are on page 35 and please perform all those steps and we are standing by for the readings from the flight engineer for page 36 Moscow this is which was - and I ready to copy the first reading yes we are s are pressure seven nine eight will pressure is eight one three assail pressure is 844 appeal so they're there forever and at their we'll need to go through the corral actual is complete already copy I'm deactivating Kaddu pressurization copy you must be pretty clear that we perform on three do you want me to give you form three Sara yes we are ready seventeen decimal one eighteen seventeen nineteen two six six twenty two decimal zero 21 one decimal 722 three to seven twenty three three to nine twenty four seventeen decimal three twenty five seventeen decimal seven twenty six two six six the prop is eight seven is eight seven eight copy all 'i'm course one test is underway copy each other did you send the command from input - yes I did send it this is Mission Control Houston you're looking at a view from the balcony camera overlooking the cavernous flight control room of the Russian Mission Control Center in car the off outside Moscow drew Morgan Luca parmitano and Alexander skorts off well on their way to catch up to the International Space Station after a flawless launch from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan liftoff occurring on time at 11:28 and 20 seconds a.m. Central time 12 28 and 20 seconds p.m. Eastern Time 9 28 and 20 seconds p.m. at the Baikonur cosmodrome about an hour after sunset Soyuz ms-13 lifted off perfectly arced out to the northeast and began its Trek an 8 minute 45 second journey to its preliminary orbit Soyuz is now well on its way to reaching the International Space Station later today all of its systems in great shape and Alexander skorts off the Soyuz commander reporting that his crewmates Drew Morgan and Luca parmitano and himself all are in excellent shape so with that let's take a look ahead at what lies on the horizon for NASA TV programming coming up Soyuz related at 3 p.m. Central time 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time we'll have a video file a post launch video file that will include all of today's launch activities and post launch interviews that are being conducted at the Baikonur cosmodrome our docking coverage rendezvous and docking of these Soyuz to the F port of the Zvezda service module will begin at 5:00 p.m. Central time 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time that will lead to a docking at 5:51 actually 551 p.m. Central Time 651 p.m. Eastern Time there will be then our hatch opening coverage and the welcoming ceremony that will ensue with congratulatory calls from family and friends in Baikonur our hatch opening coverage to begin at 7:00 p.m. Central time tonight hatch opening planned at 7:50 p.m. thank you very much thank you we hope everything will go smoothly we're sure of that good luck Godspeed thank you you just heard congratulatory words radioed up to Alexander's courts off and his crewmates aboard the Soyuz from the chief flight director at the Russian Mission Control Center of Vladimir Solovyov scores off reporting that the crew is in great shape the Soyuz on its way with a series of pre-programmed burns over the next several hours on a fast track for orbit rendezvous to reach the International Space Station well that will wrap up our launch coverage a perfect launch on this 50th anniversary of the landing of humans on the moon as Soyuz ms-13 drew Morgan Luca parmitano and Alexander Skvortsov in their preliminary orbit enroute to a docking to the International Space Station later today we'll be back on the air with you at 5:00 p.m. Central time 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time with our rendezvous and docking coverage in the meantime from all of us here at NASA on this historic day in human spaceflight history we wish you all the best on this Saturday this is Mission Control Houston
