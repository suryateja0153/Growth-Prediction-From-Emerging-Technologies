automotive address market professional variants also includes roles in system engineering and sales management now let me turn things over to our presenter I met the floor is yours thank you very much you know everyone so we are great every new in our webinar I think that imaging radar in general the phone's long range range radar is exciting technology and Texas Instruments is we having lots of fun working on this technology with you and we're looking forward to all our more today I want to spend time looking on the trends technology trends market trends that we have informed long-range radar and in specific in their own in the imaging radar he is doing great to take this imaging radar very complicated technology and we're trying to make it easier for a dog because we do believe this it is a very important technology for our or the ADA's making the ADA's system safer let's look on what's driving today the front radar market and and really a very very steep autistic growth right so we can see that safety measures like the autonomous emergency braking ISM in the other automatic cruise control are already required in level zero safety so today any new vehicle that will release through the market will very likely have font radar sensor in is in as part of the safety measures right so that's definitely driving the adoption of the sense of the font rater sensor in in the vehicle not just from the a in our fancy level 3 level 4 level 5 but already from the high volume mass production level zero are vehicles so looking on the end cap okay when the N cup pursuit of vision zero right we see applications definitely application like the AED head on right for highway is already required in and these start being tested in 2020 but also what's happening I love the slide but also from the full panic scene right the applications like the AED vonabell rule user from bicycle and Jackson crossing solving a safety measures required also much higher performance rate of sensor and in and today we already see 20 audience that are already committed to as a a B system as a standard safety equipment in there in there in there vehicles so what is what it does is definitely contribute to a very very nice growth in the in the font radar application and again not just from the AAA from the a autonomous driving perspective but also from the ADA's in the systems and that that will just make all our lives more safer because we will drive with a vehicles that are more equipped to Morris for a safe drive the other thing that is it's nice to see here that he'll the phone trader is needed by performance right so still performance there are much more important than cost so you can see that although fundraiser is in volume in smaller than corner radar the dollar amount that fundraiser is generating is higher or may be equal to the corner ADA which really tells us that the margins these sensors are still being sold in a higher dollar amount compared to corners and we do see many t1 starts ramping up in and they started with corner radar but now they are moving to work on font radar where now that they feel much more comfortable with with the reader sense of design yeah right you know that's just surely a look on the Banach area showing our important is they our important is to increase the resolution of the fundraiser in order for us to really see nicely all the different vulnerable road users in the scene through the trans technology trends that we see that are driving the front Raider development are they need to measure the height right to be able to decide if we can go underneath the bridge or not right the need to for higher resolution in order to destroy nearby objects in an opening scenario but also in I when I when we approach to a traffic jam and we need to differentiate between the different colors in in the length and the need to do the fusion with the image sensor and to use a deep learning official intelligence for classification all of that driving very nicely the default radar technology and and I will show LTI is then done these requirements in the next few slides so were the eyes in the indoor thing so T I just released complete to release the first generation products either from the pure front end right having the area front end with with pulling out the raw data with the CSI interface 12:43 all having the system-on-chip which integrated an NT is the only company today to integrate all the sense of functionality into one device if they are a Fontaine the DSP the safety MCU the better memory the radar accelerate and crystal accelerators everything integrated into one device right so today forefront radar we typically see the phone trader the phone trader the front end it plays a role right and and and the reason is that the phone trader is really defined to end all the extended range and the max velocity that's needed for foreign traders so trade for TCP which is the device that is released to market today is very wide I have been with 50 megahertz and in the better phase North Laurel noise figure and higher out of power compared to other terms of today in the market so definitely a device that is leading today in the market for the phone trader but also for corner right so nothing to stop the shaking this device to corner device and font as well as imaging radar that will show later on another thing that is this device is enabled is the ability to generate up to 2,000 a different chips right so it's a very very nice flexibility in the amount of chip that you can configure and that's really take out the processor from the equation rights of the processor doesn't need all the time to toggle the spi bus to generate the different chips between frame to frame between chip to chip right you can program a program they chip into a local memory of this device and the device can walk by itself support ignition clear in use the amount of computing power say host it required to do a couple of applications that is I performance allows you allows us to handle one application in the r79 where we need to identify the motorcycle on a 170 meters approach to us in the one ago 32 meter per hour so the very nice RF performance of 12:43 enabled it to detect objects from target meter using the enhance performance of 12 DB noise figure 12 DB of our and the 95 DBC per Earth's faintness of this device also the ability to control the phase shifters in a 60 B 16 resolution right so we are able to generate informing and steer the beam in a 6 6 pj resolution so that really allow us that allowing us to along to answer these application requirement without having without needing to do any any trade-offs with the antenna footprint alright so definitely you can you can get to the Watauga 70 meter with a higher gain and narrow beam using a antenna footprint but that will cost you in the field of view i so with this device you're not required to do so many trade-offs on your antenna few dreams are to answer these requirements the other thing that these devices enable us to address is the imaging radar market to me we see the need for enhanced range and in signed a resolution rate of sensor are already required in in the endcap market right not just in the autonomous drivers like level 4 and 5 but already from level 2 and level 3 you can see that advanced safety measures like Auto automotive automatic emergency steering are acquired already by 2022 right so to meet these very advanced safety measure at the most economic sense or to address that is the imaging radar right with enhance and resolution now we do see that we do we do understand that imaging radar is still consider complicated in today market and this is why he is developed very nice tools to make this development much more much simply one one simpler and much and much more accessible for you guys so what is imaging a radar we believe that imaging radar is a game-changer right today the senses that you have employed today in the in the in the field are not capable of differentiate between two static vehicles in different lanes right and this caused many times for the system for the fusion systems to completely in order radar today from ignore the radar from the static environment reading while the vehicle is moving imaging radar going to change it right with a fortune cascade that we release the docking key that we just released we are able to go down to one point for a angle a as much as a resolution and in and that allow us to differentiate from one again meter between two static cars in our lane or between the vehicle to the guard guard rings on the side and that's really I can enable now the way the sensor to become the primary sensor in the vehicle right not like today that I image sensor is the primary sensor right and and most of the decisions are being taken by the image sensor now we'll be enhancing the resolution the radar can become the main sensor in the vehicle and a in then we can every much more robust sensor right because the radar sensor is there is only sensor that is keeping his performance in in winter in a snow or rain in different visibility conditions so in order to make these complicated design more accessible to the board market see I had the first one to release to market at the state imaging radar developing key based on the RF voltage that shows for chip cascade together in able to work as a what you need to be able to get to reach up to 350 meter range with in for me and down to one point four degree azimuth angle resolution all of the design files all of the algorithms everything that that is needed to start designing a imaging radar or cascade product is online see I believe sharing we're reassuring all our knowledge online in order to make it easier for customers to alter the first step into adopting this these technologies very very important technology this biscuit enable driving for 40 minutes and capture the world data into a SD card so between these between the RF ball to the DSD board there is a SD card the plug n allowed to store the data the raw data and later on allow you to do the post-processing and run your greetin's in a matter of environment and we also saw one use case insect capture use case so in the data into SSD and then run post-processing the other use case is doing a real time processing running the rhymer and informing algorithm in the CDA to processor that at the balls at underneath year limit how to see again we are the video online and we are all the documentation already online and if you are interested in purchasing this case it's available online few of the challenges that we are solving with this kit is we have a very very detailed a design guide showing showing how to synchronize multiple radar front-end showing how to do the chip configuration for my more and beamforming showing different techniques showing how to calibrate a the power to the goals to the both sides right all of that is detailed on the in the TI design we have a very detailed explanation on memory bandwidth required showing them the antennas will be mapping that we choose of course that stuff in the first step for you guys I'm sure that you will have a more more dedicated antenna footprint to your application but that just gives the first step and then we are also discussing on the processing flow how to process the ninety-two virtual antenna channels that we have on board and and aventurine anyway so fewer performance that that we showing based on these kids is you can see here the ability to differentiate from Vonnegut 12 meter in tool parking vehicles right showing the performance of the of the ball to go down to one point seven degrees azimuth angle resolution another thing that we created in it and doesn't move okay another thing that we created and you can also see that in a video that we have online is that Billy into differentiate between the parking vehicles here to the ground rings the ability to see the contour of the bike the contour of the vehicle and really start showing showing you all the weather sensor all the integrators and so start showing them much more much more real view of the scene around us fighting and showing the really give the back up to what we saying that the way the Raider the using radar sensor will become the primary sense of the vehicle here we taking the doctor a Doppler data and we laid out on the static on the static environment and in the video you can see it also moving in in real-time the other things one thing that we highlighted in this video is the Bible performance going down to 1.0 1.7 a greedy and resolution the other thing is the extended range that we gain with beamforming going up to 350 meter and the ability to jump between the informing changes in literally informing to mile between chip to cheer right so we are the vehicles the driving away from us in one ship and then in the next ships we are tracking the pedestrian that are walking next to the sensor right really giving us a nice nice indication our digital integrated sensor is able to fully control the scene all of that without without the without needing the processor to exercise the SPI so few of the other platforms that you can find online again Ti is putting a lot of efforts to making trying to make your life easier right we put all the algorithms all our idioms we're trying to make EVMS dedicated for the end equipment right and we put both the outer and the algorithm everything online in order for your result trying to replace you guys obviously we're not trying to make the product but we are trying to make it easier for you to do the first step with us and then take it from there and concentrate on your IP to gain first time to market in addition we have a wide echo system different patterns each pattern is a strength in different fields so I encourage you to work with us tell us what's your goal and then we can probably have a good clue on which which sir party can be the best field - it is to help you achieve these objectives so the sunlight summarize this is a little bit there are many details on this slide but I think it's important I [Music] think the I competitive advantage comes from the formal performance right if it's in the signal processing phase in security we are our products touching all these major fields we are trying very very hard to make our portfolio a chemical impossible scalable as possible so if you invest in one in one in one device you will be able to scale your investment to all the different sums so we have in our portfolio right so we trying to it to prevent you of inventing the wheel every time from from from from scratch right this way you can focus on your IT or not on how to work with our device from time to market the eye is the leader in the RFC most market and we are the first one to release the system on chip our device online we already have a hundred of case devices driving and so that's from also from a liability perspective we already passed all the coil and our devices are very mature and ready for the automotive and industrial market thank you very much ready for your question excellent a few of you have already submitted questions so we're going to jump right in if you'd like to submit a question type your question into the question went on the side of your screen and hit the submit button while we're answering your questions please complete the feedback form which is located at the bottom of your screen so for our first question what's the max distance imaging radar can currently sense sorry the magazine sense yes yes so right now we are showing on our video with the imaging radar is 350 meter but in we can probably go further than that we stopped there because these are the requirements we see currently in the market we we probably can sense further than that maybe on our next video will show that will show forged meter all right does writer have accuracy issues in any weather types no III don't think accuracy is the function of SNR and radio stencils are no there is no sense of performance are not degraded from weather okay what makes you believe T I will lead the front in the radar market in the next few years so I think today from RF signals we see RFC was get start gaining a lot of traction in corner inter initially and now it's moving very very strongly also to phone trader application TI today is the leading is the leader in RFC most millimeter a basis sensor in the market so so the fact that we're living this domain and the fact that RFC must gain a lot of traction today in the market I think it was a good feeling of our TI direction into this market okay what are the advantages of RS CMOS are compared to silicon germanium sensors in front radar applications so so yes a silicon germanium for many years the leadership in RF performance right well as its digital integrations of the ability to integrate a micro control and different digital features were a disadvantage for for this technology now with our first generation a RF CMAs products and definitely with the generation that will follow we believe that we already meet or outperform the RFC most performance of a of the C key sensors and we are we are much more advanced in our digital future integration so for example we are integrating many of the functions things in monitors that allow much safer a much safer fact of function right so our products are they shall be certified also and as well our ability to generate a high number of tubes a configuration give us a very nice advantage over city okay well time we'd wrap up at this point and those questions that we did not get to will be responding via email on behalf of electronic design I'd like to thank Texas Instruments we're sponsoring today's event and of course to all of you for joining us have a great rest today thank you very much
