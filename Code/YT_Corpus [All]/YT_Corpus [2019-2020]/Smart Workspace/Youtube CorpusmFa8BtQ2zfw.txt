 [Music] when we think about meetings we clearly we want to move away from that this is a screenshot from Google probably about a year or two ago how people feel about meetings so clearly there's a lots of room for improvement and when you dive into the data there's sort of two things that stand out for us that we really want to change one is the amount of time that is spent scheduling right now on average a US office worker spends about one and a half hours a week just managing their calendar setting up meetings moving them around accepting responding and so on the other thing is about 40% of meetings that do take place tend to be unproductive and you're probably wondering why are all my meetings in these 40% so there's lots of reasons for that some you might not just you might just not be able to hear what's going on some the discussion might be all over the place or maybe maybe you just don't have the right tools so while we haven't solved all of those yet we think we actually have pretty good solutions for a number of them and so that's what we want to show you in this session my hope is that you can leave this with like two or three things that you can take home to your organization to make meetings better over the next few weeks just to make sure we're all on the same page I just want to give a very brief overview of what we consider our meeting solutions on the top left you have hangouts meet it's our video conferencing service you can connect to high high quality video meetings from any laptop mobile phone or tablet if you want to hook up your rooms and you want to turn any room into a meeting room you can use the hangouts meet hardware it then allows those meeting rooms to connect to the very same calls we got Chambord right here so clearly you'll see more of that later in the show but it's our digital whiteboard that lets you do remote brainstorming quite easily and then lastly there's calendar calendar sort of coordinates it all and make sure you got the right people in the right place at the right time so with that it's demos from here on out again everything you're gonna see either is already live in our product or will be there in the next few weeks I'll start off by showing you calendar and a bunch of things there to speed up scheduling then my colleague Priya is gonna come up and talk about the in meeting experience in some ways you can make that more productive and lastly Aishwarya will actually show you jam board and how you can use that to have more effective brainstorming sessions at the end I think we should have plenty of time for Q&A and hopefully be able to answer all of your questions and maybe give you some more more tricks or spontaneous demos if there's an opportunity with that will switch over says I'm doing a demo so here I am so we're looking at calendar and we're using sort of a fictitious example of a smart kitchen appliance company part of the team is on the west coast part of the team is on the East Coast there's like lots of collaboration and lots of video conferencing involved so first thing we're gonna do is imagine we want to take some time off take a couple of days off next week because we have family visiting so I'll be out from Wednesday through Friday historically you might have had to go to every existing meeting and say like no I'm not coming to this or like I can't make it unfortunately and here's why we have a more satisfying way of doing that you can just select the three days and when you type in vacation calendar automatically detects that and actually says hey you just want me to put you in out of office and I'm happy for you to add a message for example I'm out until Monday I got family visiting with just one click technically - I've let all of these meeting organizers know that I won't be able to make it and then they're there then free to either move it to the next week you can see it here it says like I'm out I got family visiting to either move it or to go ahead without me so that's what just one way we can speed up managing the calendar but more common scenario is let's say I want to set up a meeting we're gonna like talk about our smart kitchen planning and so we'll go in here and I got the team on a mailing list so I can just set that up and go find some time for the windows a little small but you can see tomorrow afternoon 2 to 3 p.m. that should work just fine for everyone so let's go ahead create that meeting turns out I had not considered certain things Michael is not working on Thursdays and Priya and Scott are actually on the East Coast so my 2 p.m. for them is 5 p.m. and therefore after their working hours now had my calendar not warrant me I would have either come across as inconsiderate or probably had some back-and-forth to like move that meeting fortunately account the bid warn me now how did it do that let me open a second tab to show you where you can set that up when you go to settings you see there's a working hours section down here here you can set up your hours like when you're working on any given day you can see I generally work 9:00 to 5:00 except on Tuesdays where I come in a little earlier so my weekend can start a little sooner and by the way while you're in here and will refer back to this later you should also set up like which which office you're in and which floor you're on and you'll see that's relevant when we meeting rooms so let's go back here how could I avoid this like how could I figure out when people's working hours actually are if you're in here and you switch to the day view you certainly see some additional information so each person gets an individual column and I can see what is my 2:00 p.m. is 5:00 p.m. for my call it's 5:00 p.m. for Priya and it's 5:00 p.m. for Scott so you see the time that you're about to schedule meeting in in every person's time zone so that lets you hopefully avoid these 2 a.m. meetings or these 11 p.m. meetings for all your other for all the people that you're you want to meet with and for yourself hopefully that will let others know when you actually want to take meetings and when you don't so clearly Thursday doesn't work a Friday morning actually does so hopefully these are some things we can speed up like finding a time for for a meeting but now now it's rooms and rooms actually turns out probably about a third of the time the people like try to schedule meetings is spent finding meeting rooms now we have some solutions here too one is if you actually hover over the meeting rooms you can see some additional information you can see how big the room is you can see what equipment it has and here for example it says that it has Windows and it's wheelchair accessible now how do you set that up if you're an admin you can go to the admin console and go to buildings and resources and here you can go into the resource management and you can set up all your buildings essentially all your your offices and you can then make sure that both your employees are assigned to them as well as your meeting rooms if you want to create a new meeting room you go in here you pick the building that it's in you pick the floor it's on you say how many people it fits and maybe that it has hangouts meet hardware and is wheelchair accessible and if you give it a name you can then very easily create that if you have a lot of meeting rooms you can also do this by a CSV upload or via API that information is then as you could see available to two employees to look at but also calendar actually uses it to automatically find you the best meeting rooms in this case myself and Priscilla are in SFO while Priya Michael and Scott are in New York so calendar looks at that and says like okay I need two people I need a room for two people in SFO and a room for three in New York and because there's multiple involved they need to be able to talk to one another so we'll make sure they're really a conferencing enabled so I'll go ahead and I'll pick infrared and I'll pick Empire and with that hopefully we can avoid these last-minute we schedules because some people were not able to find a meeting room and therefore the meeting could not go ahead before I go ahead and actually create the meeting I want to make sure I have my agenda attached so we have a document in Drive that we can attach here here it is and I'll make sure the team reads it and I hit Send and I have my meeting created here it is so as simple as that hopefully you can save a bunch of these 90 minutes a week by actually like getting ahead of some of these common problems with that I'll hand over to Priya who will now take you through the in meeting experience hi I'm Priya and I'm also a product manager on the meeting solutions team so the first thing I'm going to go ahead and quickly do is log into my account over here okay so now that we've walked through the scheduling process all nice and easy let's actually talk about what happens when you're going into the meeting and we'll continue to use our smart kitchen planning example to show you what I mean now we've made it nice and easy for you to find and join the right call by providing multiple ways for you to join the meeting you can either go right to meet google.com which will show you a nice overview for upcoming meetings or join directly from the calendar invite which is what I'm gonna go ahead and do now so with that I'll just click through and it looks like my colleague Scott is already here in the meeting hey Scott awesome I think we okay looks like the audio is working now great so it looks like we're still waiting for a couple of others to join us on this call so while we wait I'm gonna take this opportunity to tell you a little bit more about what you're about to see now with everything that can go on during a meeting between presentations and coworkers jumping on and off the call at various times it can be tough to focus on what actually matters during your meeting while still feeling like you're genuinely maintaining and maintaining a connection with everyone you're talking to and so we've made that easier for you by adding new adaptive layouts to hangouts me now as you're about to see in a couple minutes I'll let my colleagues go ahead and join the call you'll start to see the layouts automatically adapt as people join the meeting so that you can have a nice clear view of everyone you're talking to and now with that you can see that I have a nice clear shot of Priscilla sac Michael and Scott as soon as their video feeds pop up okay hey everybody are we all ready to get started yeah perfect so now that everybody's on the call let's go ahead and follow our good meeting practices and start by pulling up the agenda that Robin had attached in this calendar invite now this is something that you can do very quickly thanks to the new support we've added for attachments within meetings to simply pull up my attachment very quickly all I have to do is go to the bottom left hand of my window go to attachments and you see it's right there and that saves me valuable time and getting the meeting started and getting everybody ready to go now I hate meeting notes so I actually don't want to go ahead and open this up can anyone else help me out and do this yeah I can do it awesome so now as we take a look at our meeting agenda we see the first item on the agenda is to watch a video that I believe Zack had mentioned would be good to take a look at now this is something you can now you will soon be able to do in meet as we look as we're continuously looking at ways to supercharge your presenting experience and I'll show you how to go ahead and do that you'll simply have to go to the bottom right hand of the screen click on the present Now button select presenter chrome tab and make sure you're sharing your audio but I'm gonna let doc take it from here since it's his video yeah sure I found a video that shows how tech is already playing a role in the kitchen let's check it out playing a video on YouTube leave the dough to rise for 30 minutes help at a glance great thanks for the watch Zack now we've done a lot of talking about all the ways in which we've made your in kollek's perience more productive and easier to achieve your goals but at the end of the day it's hard to actually have a productive meeting unless you could hear and follow along with what everybody in your call is saying and this is currently a lot easier for some of us to do than it is for others for those who are deaf or hard of hearing which kurtz which currently makes up 4 percent of the u.s. workforce it can be very difficult to follow along with what's going on in your meeting without making special arrangements beforehand and that's something we really want to make easier so starting today we're adding the ability for you to turn on live captions within your hangouts meet meetings so that it's easier for anybody to be a part of the conversation now this is launching today and will be available for you to use within the next few weeks but for now I'll give you a quick glimpse of how it works so to enable captions within my call all adds all I'll do is go to the bottom right hand of my screen and select the option to turn on captions and with that we're ready to go okay everyone what kind of smart kitchen appliance do we want to start making next definitely a smart fridge they've been doing really well agreed I have so many ideas for what we can do there I really think a smart way to go sorry Scott I like this smart fridge idea too yep I'm definitely team fridge and with that it looks like we have a majority and we can plan to have a brainstorming session next time thanks everyone we'll see you next time okay and with that I'll now hand it off to my colleague Aishwarya who will tell you about how to have a productive brainstorming session so now that you've seen how to be productive in a meeting let's take a look at meetings that might require a little more remote brainstorming and whiteboarding typically meetings like this are really unproductive and really hard because remote participants have a hard time jumping in and I da ting together a lot of times the people in the local room are facilitating and it's hard for remote participants to jump in with their ideas so jam board is here to solve exactly that problem jam board is a digital collaborative whiteboard that allows you to id8 and brainstorm together from different locations it saves content on Google Drive so you can access it later so you avoid the situation where you have to take a picture of a whiteboard and send it out to everyone after the meeting is over so let's take a look at features on the jam board itself well it is a whiteboard so hopefully you'd be able to draw and erase but the nice part is because it is digital you can do cool things like use the lasso tool to group elements together make them bigger and even smaller if you need more room to write my personal favorite feature is actually the auto draw tool so you can open up the tool bar on the right hand side tap on the auto draw tool and easily convert your drawings into illustrations right on the board and if you're not an artist so someone like me this is a great way to still add visual content directly on the board so we've taken a look at how Jam board has really solved the whiteboarding use case but we're really excited to bring you our integration with hangouts meat to tie jam board even closer to the meeting room especially because a lot of these whiteboarding news cases happen in the meeting room itself let's take a look at what that means and looks like on the board so if you can see there's a meet icon that shows up on the top right hand corner of the board when I tap on it it expends - it expands into a menu the first item on the menu is actually join or start a meeting and if I tap on this I'm able to join a meeting with the meeting code and if I don't have one I can actually start a new meeting directly on the jam board but it looks like we have a meeting scheduled here so I'll join that in just a second your admin or if you're an admin in the room you can actually configure your jam board to enable this option to be persistently available on the jam board once you do this the gem board can be used as a meeting room device or standalone meeting room device and of course you can also pair with calendar to be able to use the jam board as a book above resource in a room so as I said before it looks like we already have a meeting scheduled and our team's probably waiting for us so I'll go ahead and join with one tap I'm dropped into this immersive hangouts meet experience with my team waiting for me the active speaker is in the center of the screen and all other meeting participants show up on the right hand side the really unique thing here is actually this tap to jam bar on this side this bar when I tap on it it actually allows me to access the whiteboarding portion of the jam board from here I can still use all the jam board tools I was using before I can open the menu I can switch tools I can save and I can share but the really cool part is I'm still in the meeting and I can always switch back and forth between fullscreen meeting and I can switch at any time to the white boarding portion all while still being in a call alright so our team is ready to go and this is actually our team our jam board team from the New York and San Francisco office and they're really excited to be part of this demo but for the purposes of this demo we're gonna do video only the jam board is fully equipped with both video and audio during four meetings but just for simplicity we're gonna keep it video only all right team are you guys ready to get started cool okay um I'm not really sure where we left off last time can someone please present the meeting minutes cool thanks Karolina all right so Karolina is actually presenting her laptop screen directly into the call and because of this integration with hangout Smith we're able to see exactly what's on her screen and use the jam board as a secondary display or just a presentation screen in a room so let's take a look at these action items it looks like we have two one brainstorm smart fridge features and to create a high-level design for our smart fridge I guess alright let's go ahead and get started I'm gonna top to jam and everyone and everyone on our team is gonna hop onto the same Jam I've actually prepped this Jam and attached it to the meeting ahead of time so everyone can easily access it and collaborate with me all right let's do this I'm also going to go ahead and present my jam into the meeting just in case someone doesn't have access everyone can still follow the meeting and of course anyone the has extras access to the jam can always hop on and collaborate with me alright I'm gonna go to the second frame can we think of some cool smart fridge features that we'd want to see alright so as the team starts adding ideas well looks like we already have some so they want to see what's in the fridge on the go they want to see recipe ideas they want the fridge to help them eat healthy and of course we do want some assistive features on the fridge itself these are some awesome ideas as you can see here if we were all in the same room this would be super easy for us to do we just walk up to a board a whiteboard maybe and throw some post-its on there with our ideas and we'd be able to easily talk about our ideas and discuss them but because we're all in different rooms that becomes a lot harder with the jam board we're able to use a sticky note tool to help us get there let me show you what everyone all the devices that people have been using to collaborate with us so far it looks like Priscilla is in San Francisco on her iPad using the iOS jam board application Zac over here is on his pixel book so he's joined from the Android application and it looks like the rest of our team is actually on their laptop so they're using the jam board web application let me tap back to jam so as you can see here like it's super easy for everyone to regardless of the device they're on or the room they're in to whiteboard with me so let's take a look at a different scenario where Oh actually let's do this let's elaborate on seeing what's in the fridge and maybe assistive features can we think of a way to combine both of those into maybe a design let's do this on the next spring priscilla can you design maybe an iPhone app for us that shows us what the content of her fridge looks like Priscilla's are really talented designer from the San Francisco office so let's see what she has up her sleeve oh it looks like Scott's actually added an image as well that's great all right so let's see we can use the Google Home Hub and the design on this phone to maybe be able to ask our phone what's in our fridge that sounds about right so in the previous exercise you saw how people our team was able to just throw con using the sticky note tool and we were able to discuss our ideas but here we're able to use the drawing tools and even our image search tool to add content that more visual content to help us with our discussion this design looks great Priscilla um actually I have a really good idea do you think you could draw us a fridge to let me see maybe if I move this directly onto the fridge then we can just ensure the same design shows up on both our iPhone app and the fridge itself that looks about right I think we really have something here thanks to be in New York okay so that was just a lightweight so that was just a lightweight demo of what collaboration can really look like in the workspace as I said before these kinds of remote brainstorming meetings can be really hard when there's distributed offices and people and on different devices that may not be able to see the whiteboard or discuss with you but using these tools on the jam board we really make that seamless and by bringing meetings to the jam board we've brought jam board even closer to solving the remote collaborating a whiteboarding problem and so with that I really hope you were able to take away two to three tips that you can take back to your organization and share with your colleagues to make your meetings more productive and more effective oh I do have one more thing to say so Ben Q has a great promotion going on for Jam boards at their booth if you buy a jam board you actually get the stand for free and that's over a thousand dollar value so I really encourage you to stop by their booth check out the promotion and also play around with the jam board they have there [Music]
