 "Ok Google, turn on welcome home." The Magnolia smart home has got a lot going on. From the Screen Innovations motorized shades, to the lights, to the entry gate, the TV, the speakers, the thermostat, even the fireplace and it's all controlled through the Savant system with just my voice or with the app. So imagine this, it's game day and you're entertaining friends and family out by the pool. Now you want everything just right. But instead of running around all these components setting everything up the way you want it, you've got the Savant app setup by Magnolia and you tell it "pool party". It knows to fire up that waterfall and the waterslide, TV's up, music is playing all around the pool, all you need to worry about is being a host and topping off drinks. Magnolia keeps the smart home integration going here even in the kitchen. And, need professional grade appliances? Pacific Sales has got you covered there too. Music is a required amenity in a bathroom now and Magnolia took it next level by integrating speakers into the design. That's a waterproof speaker from Sonance and a TV in the mirror in the wall so you're shaving while you're watching the news in the morning. Sometimes at the end of a long day you just want to say, "Ok Google, goodnight."
