become more common after this kick in the ass from covin 19 but regardless of what this means for our future what I want to talk about in this video is how to make your work from home environment into a cozy sanctuary so that in the face of all this uncertainty and fear you can carve out a little piece of comfort for yourself while you're stuck at home so in this video I took you on a tour of my home office and I showed you all the little details that make it inspiring and aesthetically pleasing to me I'll link to that in the description below now I'm gonna go more in-depth into the actual steps that you can take to make your workspace work for you let's talk about little style details and the actions you can take to make your home office into an oasis that makes working from home feel homey as well as productive tell me in the comments below are you working from home right now is it challenging is it a breath of fresh air how are you navigating this work from home situation and are you doing anything to make your home office into a better environment for yourself tell me below so the first step that you can take to make your home office into a cozy and productive space is something I'm about to do for myself right now and it's going to be some work but I'm gonna take you on this journey with me I am gonna go through my junk drawers I am going to go through my junk drawer if you've watched my home office tour video you know that my greatest shame in my apartment is this junk drawer and since I have been working from home it's been driving me extra crazy knowing that all this is down there taunting me waiting so I'm gonna go through it and I'm gonna show you from my own experience the impact that it has on my sanity so clearly my sanity needs some improvement and the solution is in this trunk junk drawer so so here's the junk drawer as it is right now and now I'm going to finally after three years of living here and never organizing this little beast I'm gonna do it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that felt good oh so yeah that's man you know go through your junk drawers battle hmm feels feels good seriously if you have a junk drawer and it's in the vicinity of your workspace or part of your workspace go through that junk drawer it will make a huge huge difference to your sanity that's probably the most valuable piece of advice that I could give to you in this video I can go through your junk drawer the next thing I would do is actually something that I just recently did for myself with my home office and it has made a huge huge difference and that is to optimize the space to make it more conducive how I'm using really big words for no reason optimize the space to make it more conducive to being organized damn basically what I'm saying is find something that will allow you to better manage your random little items on that you keep on your desk so recently I switched from an iMac to a laptop a macbook pro and that prompted me to get this little guy over here so i it's just such a small little detail it's just a little shelving thing that i ordered off of amazon and i got it with the intention to put it under my laptop just to elevate it and also create some extra storage space but i ended up putting it over to the side right here and it's totally changed my desk now i have a place to put my headphones and a place to put some random papers and stuff like that and it's made a huge difference i'll link to this little shelving thing from amazon I just got one that I knew would match my my black desk but there's a lot of different options out there but I'll link to this specific one it was really easy to put together my boyfriend helped me but I could have done it myself so you can definitely do it too basically the reason why this has made such a huge difference is I feel like before my work space was just pretty and I actually talked about it in this it's de grand post that I made a while ago about how my office she she may look good but she doesn't have a lot going on up here and what I meant by that is I pretty much just made a pretty place for myself but it was really hard for this place to feel productive and organized and just the simple act of getting a small little shelving thing to store away the the little odds and ends that kind of gather around my desk it's made a huge difference it it's better for your sanity to have a clutter free space and especially since we're working from home now we we need to like up our game I think or else we'll lose our minds storage storage storage if you have if you want mine take on the best storage stuff you can watch this video I'll link to it below it I walk you through all of my favorite storage solutions that I've been using since living in tiny apartments in New York that's really a key thing here is storage so that you can stay clutter free and make it so that all of your mental space is going towards your work and your comfort rather than on the clutter another tip I have for making your home office feel cozy and inspiring is don't be afraid to be really extra about it when it comes to your decor in my home office tour video that I'm linking below I talked a lot about how drama and romance in this space really is what makes it feel warm and inviting so don't get stuck in the mindset of this is a workspace so it needs to be serious and it needs to be cold and it needs to just be organized and that's it no take this opportunity this work from home phase that we're all in to really express yourself even if it means taking some decor from from other parts of your apartment and putting them in here I mean right now since we're working from home that means that a lot of our time is being spent in our in our little workspaces whatever that means for us for some of you might even just be on your couch and that is something that I'd have definitely been taking advantage of is working from my couch and cuddling with Hilo but wherever you're working from really go for the style that you love don't limit yourself go over-the-top really commit to a style and you'll find that it makes it more of a joy to sit down and and work you know it I feel excited to sit down at my desk every day because it looks like this and again you don't have to spend extra money right now find some things just a couple things maybe that that are already in your apartment and move them over to your workspace because your workspace kind of needs it more right now don't you think you're gonna be spending a lot of time in there for a bit and the last step that I have for making your home office into a more comfy and productive space is to accept the fact that styling makes a difference and it's not pointless you may think okay well what's a candle on my desk actually gonna do or what's a some faux florals on my desk gonna do what's a crystal gonna do and yes maybe they won't magically make you better at your job or they won't magically improve your mood but actually they do kind of magically improve your mood having these little aesthetically pleasing elements right on your desk does improve your mood I mean as long as you're open to it I mean if you're dead set I'm not accepting that these things can actually have a positive impact on your mindset then you they probably won't have a positive impact on your mindset but if you allow it these are the things that will make your workspace feel like your workspace we have an opportunity here to make an environment a work environment for ourselves that actually feels good I mean imagine that and shouldn't we feel good every day isn't there power in that so the way you create that feel-good feeling in your home office is through these little these little accents if I were to give you a quick shopping list off the top of my head of things that will make your home office feel more homey it would be a candle or a few in my case it would be some faux florals or real ones if you can handle the death I can't which is why all my florals are faux I would get some wall art that you feel an emotional connection to so not just pretty wall art but wall art that really you know likes you up inside I would get a cute mug as a pen holder like this you don't even have to go buy a pen holder just use one of your favorite mugs and if you keep a box of Kleenex on your desk I would get a Kleenex box cover a stylish one so that the ugly Kleenex box isn't showing you know these are just the little details that at all add up to create a stylish and comfy space and if you're not in a place to be buying things right now a lot of the stuff you likely already have check your ear closet do you have some candles in there that you forgot about do you have some really great pictures of you with your friends that can be your wall art you probably have a mug that you could use as a pen holder these are likely things that you already have and it's just a matter of putting them together in your home office space to make it feel more like you rather than a cold work space where you just do work so those are my tips for creating a workspace that's inspiring and comfy-cozy and really a place that just likes you up inside every day like I said we're gonna be spending a lot of time in our workspaces and why not make them beautiful and why not make them appeal to our senses why not make them a place that we're excited to sit down and work in every day things are really scary and unpredictable right now but that doesn't change the fact that you deserve to live comfortably live stylishly and live in a way that benefits your mindset in fact it's more important now now more than ever to find our little bits of comfort are little bits of joy wherever we can wherever we can get them [Music] for daily posts from my studio apartment here in Seattle follow me on instagram at moto dot misfit and for more apartment styling tips be sure to
