 for me a home office isn't just a place where i work but of mixed usages from studying relaxing to some videos and playing video games this is why i'm so excited for products like this new lg c10 48 inch tv a smaller tv that still has all the latest and greatest display technologies you get a gorgeous oled panel for that infinite contrast and perfect blacks next generation specs like 4k 120 hertz support g-sync freesync support low input lag and hdr this display is as good as it gets for gaming on the upcoming ps5 and xbox consoles and it's even small enough to use as a pc monitor for casual everyday use hi i'm david and this is the lg c10 48-inch tv the ultimate small tv big gaming monitor for the home office [Music] so just a disclaimer lg sent me this tv to test and i've been using it over two weeks now as my main display across a variety of use cases i'll start with my experiences using it for watching videos and movies but you can also skip ahead using the timestamps in the description and no surprises here the image quality of oled lives up to expectations vibrant colors and bright highlights when watching standard def or hdr content wide viewing angles so even if you're viewing off axis the image still looks really good playing 4k content over the built-in apps like youtube and plex or external devices connected via hdmi look super crisp but the biggest benefit to this oled panel is thanks to those self-lit pixels meaning perfect blacks no distracting blooming or halo effects which can commonly be noticed when watching more dark space and star type scenes on other displays the other feature that movie watchers may enjoy with this tv is the updated alpha 9 processor which is supposed to help with improving the picture with color processing sharpening and smoothing algorithms i'll be honest i don't really like those features what i do like is that i can easily turn off all that stuff by choosing the filmmaker mode picture profile this is essentially like going into all those menus and turning off all those enhancements that can make a movie look a little artificial but it's quick and easy if you do want to dive deeper into tweaking the advanced settings i'll link to a couple resources on that from tv test and ratings in the description next let's talk about console gaming and this is where it starts to get really exciting with this tv but at the same time it's a little wait and see i'm waiting for the next generation ps5 and xbox series x coming out later this year but until those are available we can't fully test and take advantage of those capabilities that this tv has to offer but spec wise this lg c10 is stacked to be the dream gaming display hdmi 2.1 with support for 4k 120 hertz refresh rate a 10 bit and supporting variable refresh rate as well for smooth tear free gaming i'm hoping the next generation consoles take full advantage of all of this for the cleanest smoothest gaming console experience but even if you're just gaming on a current gen console gaming still looks great and input lag feels really low regardless of resolution refresh rate or hdr setting you use you just need to make sure you're using the game picture profile for minimal input lag there are also some other tidbits that i want to highlight about this tv that i really like such as the four hdmi inputs all of them have the same full support for hdmi 2.1 40 gigabits per second which is great especially with all the devices in the near future that will take advantage of that the built-in speakers are also another high point i think especially for this target market of users needing a small tv space for dedicated speakers isn't always going to be an option while they don't have good low end bass and they aren't going to replace a full home theater speaker setup compared to small computer speakers i think they're decent enough to use in place of those and you can always use a pair of headphones when you need to be a little more critical in terms of physical design i like the simple design of the stand and it has a nice thin bezel so overall has a clean minimal look and i can't forget to mention the price at fifteen hundred dollars it's not cheap but there's nothing else in the market that compares to this with its oled panel and hdmi 2.1 support for gamers at this size and that's the other big news here being 48 inches this is the smallest tv in the market with all these premium features while that sounds a bit weird with tvs getting bigger and bigger and yeah i like having a big screen tv for my main home theater but not everyone has a room for such a large tv in their place and for places like my bedroom or office a smaller 48 inch tv works out to be a great size to use at these distances like six or seven feet and still feel very immersive but what i'm most excited about with the smaller tv is that it's getting to a size to replace and be my main pc monitor all those same features i mentioned earlier that make this great for movies and console gaming i also want on my pc setup so is 48 inches too big to use as a pc monitor and that really depends on how far away you're sitting from it i had to switch back to my ikea gurton tabletop that has a longer depth of 75 centimeters for better comfort also keep in mind that the tv and stand does protrude out back a little over 20 centimeters so that eats up a lot of desk space as well you can also put it on a monitor arm which will allow you to customize the height and tilt but it will still stick out for just as much as the original stand in my normal sitting position seat up tucked in and arms on the desk my eyes are about 60 centimeters away which i find is a little too close and sharpness definitely takes a hit with the low 92 pixels per inch of the screen pulling the keyboard to the edge and leaning the chair back to where my eyes are around 80 or 85 centimeters away feels more like an ideal distance for me to target so i think a wall mount would probably work best for most people but regardless in this current setup it's still comfortable and usable on a daily basis but i'd be all for a 43 or 40 inch side screen if it were available instead keep in mind that's me using it with applications tiled across the screen to multitask which is great for people like me who have multiple windows open at the same time but if you want to just full screen a single application i think it's too big to run anything in dedicated full screen and hunt your eyes all over the display if you do decide to use it as a monitor when you first plug in the tv to your pc you're going to want to switch it to pc mode it's not the easiest setting to find you first go into input then home dashboard the settings icon and edit click on the icon next to the input you're using and then select pc mode and save choosing this feature does two very important things one it puts it into its low input lag setting similar to choosing the game picture profile this means you can switch between any of the picture profiles while in pc mode and still stay super responsive and two i believe it removes some chroma sub sampling blurriness so choosing the setting will help with sharpness of text the other settings i like to change are more personal preference i'll switch to one of the more neutral picture profiles like isf expert dark i'll turn off the energy saving and reduce the oled light down to around 40 or lower in a dark room for pc gaming with a mouse and keyboard again i find it way too big to be this close up especially for fast paced shooters you can play unscaled or in windowed mode which actually works quite well when supported and if you're okay with the lower resolutions but when possible i'd rather plug in a controller to my pc and push back a couple feet for a more comfortable gaming experience and take advantage of the full screen but based on my limited experience pc gaming on the screen i think it looks great again this tv is ahead of its time and i'm waiting to purchase the next generation gpus to take advantage of that full 4k and 120hz 444 experience but for now on my 1080 ti i can choose between 4k 60hz or my preferred 1440p 120hz for smoother gameplay this tv also supports g-sync on nvidia cards and freesync on amd cards for variable frame rate support to eliminate screen tearing my nvidia gpu doesn't support g-sync over hdmi which is only available on the latest gpus so i didn't get to test those features though and finally there's bfi black frame insertion you can find the setting under the trumotion user oled motion pro setting this can help improve motion clarity for fast paced games but keep in mind it does add flickering so it's best used at 120 hertz and it will lower the overall picture brightness but it's a nice feature to test for yourself so overall pc gaming just like console gaming is really nice on this display but i'm waiting on the next gen gpus to take full advantage of it there are some minor limitations that are important to consider if you're using this as your main monitor and you can't talk about oled tvs without mentioning burn-in i've only had the tv for two weeks now so i can't really say how much of an issue it'll be using as a pc display the tv does have some built-in burn-in protection features like pixel shift which will shift the entire screen once in a while and logo luminance adjustment that will sometimes dim regions of the screen that it detects as a static logo but regardless i'd still recommend taking some basic precautions like using a dark color theme hiding desktop icons hiding a taskbar and using a screen saver i've also noticed some minor color fringing which is most noticeable around solid yellow objects for example highlighted text in microsoft word will have red and green borders on the left and right edges i ran some custom test patterns and captured an up-close shot of the pixels just to be sure it wasn't an optical illusion and compared to my 43-inch ips tv you can clearly see the fringing is much more noticeable on the lg oled to be clear while watching movies or playing games which is what this tv is specifically designed for i don't think anyone will ever notice it's only noticeable up close while using it as a pc monitor and even then it's limited to searching solid color objects and is pretty minor being just one pixel wide but if you're working on more color critical work it is something to consider this tv also has an auto dimmer when the screen is static which you can't turn off this is different from the logo luminance adjustment option in the menu basically the entire screen will dim after around three or four minutes of idle which makes sense to prevent burn-in but for static tasks like typing a word document or even just moving your mouse around is also considered static and will trigger this feature so once in a while i'll need to wake up the screen by moving some windows or more easily just double pressing the windows tab keys to wake it back up in conclusion this is a great premium tv that's uniquely small at 48 inches which is great for those with small spaces for movie watchers you get those perfect blacks with oled and for gamers you get low input lag and support for hdmi 2.1 features like 4k 120 hertz and vr on next-gen consoles while it's not perfect as a pc monitor still being a little bigger than i'd wish and the burn-in protection features can be noticeable during static tasks like word processing and excel but if you need a single display to do it all in big screen gaming and movies are your priorities this is as good as it gets in my opinion but hope you guys enjoyed this one you know what to do and i'll see you in the next video you
