 a lot of the journeys that I've had as organizing tiding consultant has been in a very physical process but I do feel that the non-physical is just as a mother was sharing her space for so long I think it's important that we're aware of each family members partners I've worked schedule for the dice but we can complement each other support each other and align our priorities it's something that I do with my husband as well we like to take out a sketchbook and really write out what our priorities are what our goals are right now we're in the process of trying to make our environments part the most joy as possible given the situation so I think thinking about how we spend our time is an important aspect of tidying one of the things I recommend especially when you're working in the same place that you're also living is all about mindset I like to have a ritual over there it's meditation or chiming my tuning fork that really allows me to shift gear in my mind and let my body know that I am entering work mode I think it's so important that we have a sense of calm in our hearts especially now so at the end of the day try to focus on try to appreciate what you did accomplish rather than what you failed to accomplish I think ending each day with that feeling I've gotta do contributes to do I have a positive outlook for next time [Music]
