 Hi. I'm Agent Villegas from Best Buy. Here's some ways to take your at-home workspace up a level. If you're starting from scratch, look below for a link to another video about how to make a basic setup. Try to secure a room that can be dedicated for work. This will keep part of your home separate for work and allow you to disconnect when you're done. If you can, try to use an external monitor that's larger than the screen on your laptop. A larger screen can help reduce fatigue. If you can hook up more than one monitor, go for it! All that extra screen real estate will help with productivity. Using a monitor riser or stand will position the monitor at the appropriate eye level. If you have more than one monitor, keep them at the same level. Now let's move over to your keyboard and mouse. An external keyboard and mouse are a good addition to your workspace. Wireless options may be better, as they can reduce the clutter that's in your workspace. I'm using a keyboard that allows me to switch between my laptop, my smartphone, and my tablet Sound is an important part of your workspace. Having external speakers or noise-canceling headphones, will allow you turn up the volume while you're listening to music. Either can improve the sound during a virtual meeting. Having an external microphone on your desk may take up some space, but your co-workers will appreciate hearing you clearly. If you're like me, and you keep your laptop closed and tucked away, having an external webcam will allow you to be seen during a virtual meeting without having to move the laptop from its home. Many webcams feature HD resolution, some will even do 4K. A voice assistant speaker in your workspace can benefit you in many ways. It can be used to control your smart thermostat, a vacuum or smart lights. You can also use it to set an alarm or a timer, so you know when it's time to take a break. I hope some of these ideas have been helpful in setting up your workspace. Thanks for watching. Bye.
