 [Music] my name is Rey Niang I'm the director product for RG sweet meeting solutions and I'm super excited to be here today to talk to you about how we're thinking about the future of meetings I want to talk to you about a few areas that were focused on we're gonna show some cool live demos along the way and then we're gonna hat close it off with a fireside chat with with Shopify but before I dig in I want to talk a little bit about how the workplace has changed pretty drastically you know our teams now span multiple offices and and countries and by 2020 50% of the workforce is going to be working remotely right and this shift is forcing organizations to of all sizes to rethink how they equip their employees to stay productive and feel engaged while working remotely but connecting needs to happen regardless of where someone is and most of the time we're not sitting at a desk or in office and when we talk to Fortune 1000 companies employees are actually not at their desk 50 percent of the time so communication and collaboration tools really need to adapt to workers on the go now technology has really transformed how we could how when and where we communicate and today a lot of the enterprise users actually expect the same experience from work products that they get from consumer products now when we take a look back it took about 50 years for the telephone to reach 50 million users it took YouTube just four years and it took Angry Birds three months all right companies are feeling a lot of pressure to work faster and to compete to try to keep up with this pace of innovation and we need to provide our teams with the right communication tools so that they can communicate in real time and we really believe that the cloud has really enabled us to do this and when we look at doc sheets and slides we see that 74 percent of time spent is on collaborative work meaning that they're multiple people actually working together in real time and when I think back to when I first started using email which was back College a very long time ago it blew me away right for the first time there is this easy way for me to be able to communicate with friends and family from anywhere at any point in time and now when we look at technology we can chat with anyone from from our devices right every single person is just an instant message away and we can communicate a lot faster more spontaneously and in a less formal way than than email so speaking of informal did you know that 92% of people online use emojis like it's a fascinating stat you see what I did there so in just a few short decades we went from communicating on paper with formal headers and proper capitalization to short casual messages with with a hint of emotion and you know last year if you were in my session I talked a little bit about how my niece's love using video calling to talk to their grandparents they love just seeing them on the screen they carry the phone around in the house tell them about their day and they just really love it but they are now grown up a lot more and they now have their own iPads and they send me a lot of emojis and we have now entered this new generation of communication where email chat video and voice are all integrated channels of communication so that's why at G suite we are reimagining communications for work so that we can help you stay connected anywhere and really create a unified experience across Gmail chat and now with the GA launch of Google Voice so a big part of communications is about meeting with people and you know there's something really magical about seeing someone face-to-face it's a lot more expressive its interactive and it allows you to build a connection with with someone and we believe that all organizations whether small and large can really have this video first meeting culture in order to help your team's communicate that are anywhere and that's why we launched our enterprise suite of meeting solutions 4G suite customers hangouts meet need hardware and and jam board now at Google we have 99 thousand people across 70 offices in 50 countries so it's a lot a lot to stay in touch and we transition to a video first culture about a decade ago because we recognized that in order for us to succeed at a global level we needed to really change the way our people worked and now meat and meat hardware are the standard in our twenty thousand video enabled rooms and we have about 10 years worth of video meetings every day at Google and this whole shift has really changed the way our organization has worked now as a pioneer for this video first meeting culture we understand the importance of ease of use of having a really high-quality experience and the ease of administration and we've built a lot of these capabilities into our tools we have smart integrations with calendar with chat with voice with G suite assistant now and all of these really are going to enable businesses to really join the movement for video first meetings but when I do a Google search for meetings are the results are not so great right meetings are a waste of time meetings are toxic meetings are where things go to die and with all of these changes happening I think we have a real opportunity to actually change what the auto auto suggested search results are now in the future and so you know as we think about where meetings are going there are three areas that were really focused on one we want to make meetings a lot more immersive by really elevating human connection the second thing we want to do is to help you make the most of your time we want to help you optimize productivity and really figure out how you can meet smarter and then lastly we want to make sure that your organ organization is maximum maximizing ROI so I'll walk through each of these different areas so technology is often accused of creating less human interaction but I think technology also has the power to bring a lot more humanity to the workplace there's a research that was done by UCLA where they found that 55% of our communication is through nonverbal elements like facial expressions your gesture so being able to see people and hear people really helps you connect better and get your thoughts communicated much more clearly that this whole concept of video meetings isn't a new one I think Thomas Edison actually created some device back in 1879 to enable some sort atella televideo communication and you've probably seen over the decades that there are have been many rooms outfitted with video conferencing equipment but those were you know pretty expensive and hard to maintain today you know video is affordable its scalable and and integrated right neat makes it super simple for your team's to connect face-to-face and collaborate in real time wherever they are and it's just one click away from calendar from web for mobile or even from a room so we also make it possible for any businesses to have video meetings from anywhere from a one-to-one meeting to to an all-hands and in fact we can actually scale to a hundred thousand concurrent viewers based on secure Google infrastructure so last year we announced meet live streaming and we're excited this year to announce that we will soon support public live streaming so people outside of your organization's can listen in with the ability for you to track who who attended and we will also be increasing the meet participants size to 254 to 250 from 104 enterprise customers and we'll also adjust the maximum size for basic and business tiers as well and all these will be coming very soon now as I mentioned before we have 20,000 video enabled rooms at Google but we also recognize that that's probably not the case for for many of you and it may sound daunting and expensive to really think about how you outfit every conference room with video but one of the things that we've done is to really think about how we can create a simple cost efficient and scalable way for you to monitor modernize your room across all different sizes so our meet Hardware kit which can seamlessly also integrate with our jam board is really secure and it can self remediates so that you don't need a ton of IT staff in order to manage it and make sure your users have good experiences but we also know that many of you have already invested in existing video conferencing equipment and that's why we have a partnership with pexif which enables us to have me interoperate with existing systems like Cisco and Polycom as well as Skype respect for business so you can continue to use existing Hardware while getting some of the benefits of needs you still want to continue giving our customers flexibility and choice and so earlier this year I see we announced a new partnership with Logitech where we will be launching a new hardware portfolio of Logitech room solutions for meat that are pre-configured bundles for Huddle's midsize and large conference rooms and for those of you who have smaller rooms like phone rooms or or deaths we are refreshing our all-in-one Easter chromebase for meat with a nice sleek new new look now in addition I think many people are starting to think about different collaborative workspaces and we will soon be supporting meet for Jam board which is a great device where you can actually have seamlessly white seamless white boarding and brainstorming with presenting all with the power of fullscreen video conferencing behind it so while we strive to build a video first meeting culture within all organizations we also know that people are on the go and sometimes you just can't join a meeting with video and voice is super important to us and we're really excited about the launch of Google Voice because it enables us to create a more integrated experience so within meet today we already support 42 countries with with Iowan and we're excited to announce that coming soon we are actually going to be enabling international dial in for all users regardless of your license or or tier and later this year in partnership with the Google Voice team we're also going to be expanding dial into even more countries as well as international dial out support that will be build by by Google Voice so we're pretty excited to expand these capabilities for you now the other thing we have are supporting very soon is to have hangouts meet actually call you and this is really to just give you a lot more flexibility so you can now seamlessly listen and speak in the meeting by just answering your phone you don't have to enter a dial in there's no passcode needed and you can do that all while continuing to see the video and and the screen sharing from from your laptop and finally you know we see a future where people will have more spontaneous and what I like to call snackable video or voice conversations with the integration of our real-time communication tools across chat me and voice we don't always need to wait for some formal scheduled meeting to get something done and we can actually enable teams to have virtual hallway conversations and instantly hop on a video or voice call in the right moment for example when you're involved in a long Gmail thread or if you're in a chat room and you know that you just really need to get on the call to talk it through and with that I am gonna turn it over to Priya who's going to talk about how we are optimizing productivity thanks Rainey so now that we've outlined a few different ways you'll be able to participate in calls with others what next how do you make the most of your time together now in 2019 there are going to be 24 billion hours of meetings yeah I didn't believe that when I first heard it and that's a lot of time that we're spending in meetings and I think we can agree that that's a lot of time that we're also spending at work and so I'm gonna tell you all a little bit about what we're doing to help you make the most of your time and how I sleep can help you maximize your productivity I'll also give you a little peek into what we're doing with intelligence to help you meet smarter and that's all gonna begin with your schedule so with all of that time you're spending at work it's becoming more and more important that you're able to set the boundary between that and the time you want to spend away from the office and we want you to be able to do this with minimal interruptions that you face during your personal time so to help with this you can set your working hours in calendar to let others know when you'll be around and when you'll be at home and when you're out of office calendar that will now show sorry will very soon show to your colleagues when they try to send you either a message or an email that you're out of office to let you know that they can't expect you to respond and make it easier for them to respect your personal time so now for the time that you are spending at work and are actually ready to meet with others scheduling a meeting can still be a pretty big chore and so we're continuously looking for ways to make this process smarter for you through calendar now thanks to our people first approach and scheduling for calendar you can visualize everyone's schedule and it's pretty easy to find a time that works for all but even once you've found this time we recognize that it can still feel like a shot in the dark to find the right conference room for all of you to meet in especially when you aren't as familiar with remote buildings or remote conference rooms and so calendars gonna help you out with that as well we've recently launched automatically room suggestions which is where we provide an intelligent room suggestion based on all the attendees of your meeting and their work locations the exact size and setup for your meeting and any preferred meeting rooms that calendar has been able to pick up on and that's what we're doing for scheduling so now that we've gotten the schedule out of the way let's talk about how you can actually make the most of your time in your in your call now is everything that can go on within your meeting between multiple participants jumping on and off your call presentations different sizes of meetings it can be tough to focus on what matters most during your meeting regard regardless of whether that's the people that you're talking to or the ideas that you're trying to share and speaking of the ideas that you're trying to share 40% of meetings right now involve some sort of sharing or presenting content and so we're introducing new ways for you to share your ideas so this is now going to include supporting smooth video playback in presentations and also making it so you can present locally within a meeting room and as you switch between presenting and sharing and not adaptive video layouts understand your meeting context and show you the right view to help all of your meeting at stay engaged and connected so that's all well and good for meetings that have structured presentations but sometimes their meetings aren't that structured and we don't always have polished plans to share and often need to jump into a call together just to brainstorm personally my best ideas usually start out as chicken scratch and a whiteboard but it's only after I'm able to share these ideas with others and we're able to work on them together and develop them further that they really turn into something worth pursuing and so now thanks to Jim board on the web mobile and tablet you can bring this brainstorm with you everywhere you go and collaborate from anywhere now with all of this talk about how we're improving the experience during on during your meeting called a very important part of having a good meeting it's actually being able to hear and understand what's going on during your call and this is currently a lot easier for some of us to do than it is for others in fact for you for anyone who's deaf or hard of hearing and this currently makes up 4% of the US workforce it can be difficult to follow along with what's happening in your meeting without making special arrangements ahead of time we really want to make that better and so starting today we're adding the capability for you to turn on live captions during your Hangouts meet meetings powered by Google's advanced speech recognition technology now with captions it'll be much easier for anyone to be a part of the conversation regardless of any hearing assistance they may need or even if they're a non-native speaker as a bonus referring to captions can also help you follow a follow up with your conversations later on so this is just one example of how we're leveraging intelligence to improve your meetings let's take a peek at a couple more so we announced voice commands last year to help you accomplish basic tasks in your meetings without missing a beat such as dialing a phone number or starting your meeting now this is an area we're gonna continue to invest in to help you get the most productivity out of your meetings we are also taking this one step further now we've seen how helpful the Google assistant can be in your personal life but as we establish we spend a lot of time at work and the Google is system should really be able to help us out there too and so we're bringing the assistant into the workplace starting with Google Calendar now with assistant and Google Calendar I can ask it for help with my schedule and easily check on what my day looks like and if you're anything like me and usually rushing in the morning but still want to get a glimpse of the day ahead this is going to be particularly useful and that's just the beginning of what we're looking to introduce here so now with that I'm going to call my colleague Mandy up to the stage so we can run through some demos if some of the products I'm talking about okay so thank you for joining us today and as it was talking about on the assistant the assistant is deeply embedded into my life I'm not sure I can remember the last time I actually turned on a light switch but I do know that daily I'm asking ok G to perform some tasks for me and of course I'm not gonna try to do that in this room because I know you all have that on your phone Google in the morning wakes me up it sets my teapot going it reminds my daughter that she needs to pack a Chromebook for school and it also provides an intercom in case I need to push them a little faster out the door and what's awesome is today the assistant got much smarter and now it's gonna be able to merge both my home and my work life together so pre and I are spread a classic ro globe with our teams we have people in Zurich we have people in Stockholm I'm in Boulder Priya's in New York and we spend a lot of our time communicating and collaborating in hangouts chat let's jump into that and I'm gonna go ahead and do that as well we're excited to share that you can now use hangouts chat right from within your Gmail window all you have to do is go to the bottom left corner here and it opens up full screen for you now with this deep integration of chat within Gmail we also support threading just like you just like you have in Gmail right now this will allow you to keep track of multiple conversations at the same time without losing track of any single one oh it looks like Jennifer and Ashley really want to meet so we should probably reply to them so I'm gonna go ahead and go in and now they really want to meet right now and as the Rainey was mentioning one of the things we want to do is often elevate a conversation that we might be having in Gmail or in chat in to a face-to-face meeting now I could do that by clicking this meet chip and dropping a chip in and with one click everyone in the room could join the meeting and would instantly be face to face but since we're on stage let's go ahead and schedule that meeting okay now go ahead and get on that so what pre is doing now is going to ask our intelligent scheduling bot to try to find us a time that we can meet and what it will do is look across our calendars and see if it can find a time that's going to work for all of us I think what I'll go ahead and do instead is go ahead and drop that chip in for us to join the call okay so now let me go ahead and do that okay just like that we're in our call and while we're waiting for everyone else to join when everyone joins what you're going to see are those adaptive layouts that I talked to you a little bit about later so as you can see as everyone started to jump on the call here at the layout is automatically shifting to allow us to have an easier time focusing on the people we're talking to hey everyone great so now we really want to get Mandy into this call as well but usually at this time she's driving into work so we probably can't expect her to join in on videos so let's have someone tell her and instead you were joining a call with more than four people please mute your phone the actual meeting still available so that I know who's calling and that I actually want to take the phone call great so now that everyone's actually in our call and ready to go we want to make sure that everyone can follow along with what we're saying so let's go ahead and turn on line and turn on live captions so to get captions going what I'm going to do is go to the bottom right corner of my screen here and select the option to turn on captions and with that and we're ready to say hi to everybody hey thanks to captions you can now keep track of what I'm saying and what I'm saying without confusing it with what I'm saying and now it's a lot easier for anyone to be a part of the conversation thanks everyone thanks see you later all right that is a pretty cool to see thank you Priya and Mandy alright so lastly before we bring Shopify up I want to just talk about our last area which is really to help you maximize ROI and we're really invested in thinking about different smart and scalable tools to give you the right insights and and controls to really be able to manage your meetings within your organization's so the first thing I want to talk about is some of the things that we've been doing over the last year and I think sometimes you know necessarily you know kind of talk about these things but over the last year our team has been working really hard behind the scenes to raise the quality bar to the next level in a few different ways for your meeting experience with with screen sharing you know one of the things that's really important to us is to make sure that when you hit the next slide it appears immediately for everyone so that you're always on the same page and talking about the same things and so over the last year we actually made this even faster by reducing latency by six times now when it comes to audio I think there's probably nothing more annoying than hearing your own voice and having echoes during during a meeting and what we've done is meat is now using an advanced echo canceller which is 75% more effective than the previous generation so everyone can actually actively participate and you don't have to do a lot of muting and unmuting now in addition we're our engineering team is constantly making improvements and optimizations behind the scenes and leveraging new intelligent disruptive ways to make sure that things like audio quality is always reliable and resilient especially in those Network and additions that are variable or have low bandwidth and so you'll all be able to see a lot of these improvements just appear within me as you as you hop on meetings and lastly when it comes to video meet now supports vp9 on devices that support it and this is the same codec that's used by YouTube and many other streaming devices and we actually have seen that it's 30 30 percent more efficient than the previous version of the codec which will help improve quality and also optimize bandwidth usage but we also recognize that network administrator's also need to have flexible tools to control and optimize bandwidth within your own organization and within your own networks we already enable things like limiting bandwidth options on the client side today and we're soon publishing our meet back-end API s as well so that you can whitelist me traffic or work to segregate the traffic between enterprise and consumer users and coming soon which is I think been a really popular request from our customers we will be introducing per media client QoS capability so you can now have a separate policy for audio and video and have a lot more control of how you want to manage your systems now in addition to this we're also providing you with a lot of rich analytics and insights to help you manage your meeting trends to help you troubleshoot issues and also monitor your network during calls so that we can actually tell you when your network is congested and all of this data is available in audit audit logs that can actually be exported to bigquery and data studio for you to do for further analysis and see deeper insights and you can slice and dice this data in any way you want including by location rooms or even specific participants now we also know that when we think about spaces you know real estate can be scarce and expensive and as a facilities manager within your facilities team you always want to make sure that conference rooms are being utilized as efficiently and effectively as possible so we are continuing to build out optimization and insights tools to help you maximize space utilization with automatic room release we free up all rooms if all participants decline and at Google last year we saw that we released about 60,000 hours of meetings from from this feature alone and we're going to continue to improve on this so that we can continue to give you more optimization capabilities now alongside of this we also have a room insights dashboard which is which is pretty cool it actually gives you a lot of insights on things like most popular and least popular rooms things around you know which equipments are driving usage and these metrics have been really helpful for a lot of our facilities manager just to understand and predict the needs of your organization and where and when you need to make future investments and then finally we are leveraging our experience at Google to help you scale and administer large meeting room deployments more effectively with meet Hardware we strive to make our to build Hardware that takes care of itself so that we can help scale your IT team and reduce maintenance costs but art and our hardware is smart and we'll try to auto remediate so that it saves down time when people are switching switching meeting rooms and getting their meeting started now when our hardware can't fix itself we want to make sure that we are you know alerting you proactively and so we have a rich dashboard that will show you the health of your devices really easily and cleanly on what's up and what's down and then we also recently launched cannot connectivity alerts where we will automatically let you know if a peripheral is broken or a lost connectivity so you can actually take care of the issue before it impacts a user and all of this will be is ready to be integrated with your automatic ticketing systems as well in addition to all of this coming soon we will be introducing improved device views within the admin console and we're also enable you to batch export your fleet information for for further analysis so as you can see we're focused a lot on really thinking about how we can make meetings immersive intelligent and and flexible for you and we're really excited about our efforts around elevating human connection helping you to make meetings a lot smarter so you can optimize productivity and also maximize our ally and so with that I think it'd be good to hear from a customer and I'd like to welcome Chuck on stage from Shopify to tell us a little bit about their experience take this all right great how are you I'm doing well thanks yourself good so I think it would be helpful maybe to just kick it off by having you tell us a little bit about yourself and maybe share a little bit more about Shopify and how long you've been a GC customer and I will pull up a slide to help you with that sure alright in in sort of a nutshell Shopify is the leading multi-channel conference platform Shopify merchants use Shopify to design set up and manage their stores across multiple sales channels this includes anything from web mobile social media brick-and-mortar stores pop-up shops marketplaces essentially anywhere the merchants are looking to sell Shopify is looking to provide a channel for them and then a little bit me I've been Shopify about just shy of 18 months and I'm responsible for the the AV infrastructure team so what this team does is designs builds manages and supports all of our meeting rooms across across all of our offices so we're looking at about 300 plus meeting rooms across 11 11 offices right so I think earlier I talked about how at Google we sort of went all-in on video conferencing and it sounds like Shopify did the same thing given how many meeting spaces you have across all these different environments can you talk a little bit about you know what motivated you to embrace this video first culture and how you approach thinking about your meeting rooms and equipment and and all of that yeah absolutely so so Shopify really from from day one was was video first so we never we never sort of migrated from from phone systems or anything like that and and really the the driver there was to ensure that all of our all of our employees really had the best tools possible to do their job and we weren't starting with something that was an older tool and then having to to move platforms as we grow as a company okay so I know you work with many people on our team and I've heard all these things about how your office spaces are super cool and I know you shared some pictures with us can you tell us a little bit about that room with the barrels in it that spaces is our meeting room in or the sort of the entrance hall in our office and or one of offices in Waterloo and it was a former Seagram's distillery so this is a barrel hall so that sort of original Timbers from when it was a distillery so it was a former distillery so there's sort of around the corner from that there's a bunch of kettles and things like that and so what we tried to do was keep the history of the space while modern modernizing it with a with a video wall and video conferencing we also run community events out of that space as well as town halls and have a live stream and broadcast capabilities there yeah so I think a lot when I look at some of these pictures there's a big difference between you know some of the layouts and environments like what has been your philosophy to you know kind of create these different collaborative environments and how have your users I guess responded to them yeah so it's it's it's sort of evolved over time so I think I think early on what we were doing is we're just sort of building a mix of spaces so we're building large and small meeting rooms sort of hard surfaces soft surfaces sort of more standard meeting rooms but then also something that you'd almost would be like a living room with couches and coffee tables and so that sort of has evolved and what were what we're doing now is is working with our facilities and our real estate team to to pull our users both through surveys but also working with with some of the tools that you highlighted the the room utilization and and sort of those pieces to find out what what spaces are most most popular with with people at Shopify and then also sort of the right size of meeting rooms so that we're we're evolving over time and building less hard sort of boardroom style rooms and more soft comfortable couches meeting rooms and and what what trends have you seen with with users they're they gravitate more toward one type of room or the other probably probably 75 80% of our users prefer for first off meeting rooms something to think about for everyone so let's talk a little bit about an administration for a little bit you have you know obviously have many meeting rooms spread across different offices how what has it been like to manage this large deployment of of meet hardware like how big is the team that you have to support it you know how have some of the tools within me helped or or knots you with with some of the deployment efforts yeah so our sort of my team is divided up into into sort of two groups people that are looking after sort of the the new builds and then the team that looks on ongoing operations upgrades and support and that support team as of yesterday is five people now some would go in news new when a new employee started yesterday so so five people supporting more than three hundred meeting rooms so what we're what we're finding from from a support perspective is a lot of the tools again that you highlighted are allowing us to to stay on top of issues with our rooms so if there's problem with peripherals we're seeing that in the in the room health dashboard before users report it we're also working now with some of the automated messaging that comes out of the room health dashboard so that it tells you when there's a problem with a peripheral and then if it's something that self-corrects it tells you when it's corrected looking tie that into our ticketing system so that we can open in close trouble tickets so that we can get metrics on on if we have particular peripherals that are causing problems or not so that we can we can look at swapping at hardware if there's if there's issues with a particular hardware or software versions all right great and and are there any different ROI metrics and things like that that you look at as you think about your your meetings and and video conferencing from from a peer from a peer ROI perspective I don't sort of have a before-and-after because we were never a non-visual first company but what we do find is is a lot of people will sort of it as was highlighted in some of the demos conversations don't don't don't drag on too long instant messaging so what we find is people are are very are very comfortable with video conferencing so if we're using instant messaging and it goes back and worth a couple volleys people just jump on a quick call we do the same thing with with email threats if they get too long we just we just sort of jump on a jump on a video conference and we find that we're able to resolve things more quickly jump fly is a fast moving company so we don't want to spend a lot of time sort of volleying things back and forth and what are some of the productivity benefits that your users have have seen by using hangouts me so I think it and again part of it was what you what you called it in the in the presentation but some of it is is less miscommunication it's easy to sort of read something one way and have someone means something completely different the same happens with even with a voice call you can talk to someone and they can say something but their body language said something completely different and you can you can sort of run down a path and realize that you've gone down the wrong path it's sort of too late or not not too late but further than you normally would what we also find is people are just more like I'm more inclined to interact with each other yep so I noticed that in one of these pictures you have two Jim boards hanging up there and we know that Shopify has been investing quite a bit in Jarrod's both for collaboration as well as thinking about it from a meetings context can you share a little bit more about like how you're using Jim boards and yeah your thoughts on that yeah so we've actually had gem boards it was before I started a shuffle fight but I was I'm actually told that we had gem boards in Canada before Google did Oh we ended up buying them in the US shipping them to the border and then my lead actually drove to the border with a very month so we've been we've been using jam boards for a couple of years I'm sort of working with with the team at Google to to progress the platform we use them a couple different ways so initially we had them have them just on carts and people could book them or use dots and what we found with that is some people use them but people didn't really know they were there and we oftentimes couldn't find one was at one point I was looking for a gem board it had to work with our network team to figure out what access point it was on a figure out what meeting we're in the gym board was in because I had no idea where to find it so what we started doing is mounting the main room it's impaired with with Google meat and we found by doing that it was people knew where they were and they were there were more prevalent in people's faces so they started becoming more popular and then from there we've been on sort of the the early testing of of me--for jam board and we're now using in some rooms the only Hardware that we're putting in the room is it is a jumble on the wall so that's sort of a different way that we're using it and people who use it either as as just as meat meat and gem board or sometimes just as a gem board only that room there particularly something new that we're trying are are called sprint rooms so what we have in this space is on one wall that's not in the photo is a 98 inch TV used for for video conferencing one of the gen boards it's paired to the the Google meet system in that room and the second one is just a peripheral jam board and what we'll do is we'll have sort of on-site off-site so we'll bring entire teams to an office so instead of having to book a space somewhere to do team building and sort of events like that we'll do them in that space and with the two jan boards in a room it allows you to sort of have separate collaboration and then pull it back together very cool so one of the things that I think is often talked about in the industry is just about how we're trying to bring more intelligence into meetings and into rooms and you know we talked a little bit about live captionings coming to meetings but I know there's also talk about you know voice assistants things like transcriptions facial detection all of that what is your perspective about you know intelligence and meetings and and what are you most excited about so I think and it's it's probably based on my background as I spent sort of prior to being a Shopify 15 years as a software project manager across a couple different different companies and one thing I am of many things I'm not great at but one thing I'm particularly bad at is is running a meeting and taking notes at the same time and I found that that I had a 5 or 6 hours of meetings I would then spend 5 or 6 hours of putting together notes and minutes would come out late in the evening or the next day with with transcribing of meetings I think it'll make it would make my life substantially easier yeah so I want to lose time for questions but so before I think we kind of opened it up you know I think they're probably a lot of companies out there that are thinking about this video first meeting culture thinking about their spaces and and things like that what advice do you have for Organ the organizations out there to kind of get get started now it may sound a little cliche but I think I think really you just have to sort of do it all at once and sort of jump in with both feet if you if you sort of set up a couple rooms you're going to sort of segregate your your your employees a little bit and people will won't completely adopt the the video first sort of option that you're providing but if you sort of swap everything out all at once although it's it's requires more planning and news is sort of a heavier capital investment you'll see you'll see substantial returns on the head in in my experience okay thank you very much thank you [Music]
