 [Music] hi everyone i'm dibanjan saha vp of engineering and gm of data analytics at google cloud thank you for joining us today at next on air this week we are going to focus on data analytics i am going to kick it off with an overview of our portfolio highlighting some of the new product launches i'll also talk about our strategic priorities and what's next for data analytics at google cloud throughout the week you are going to hear from my teammates about our roadmaps and under the hood technical details about our products we'll also have our customers and partners telling their stories about their data journey with google cloud so let's get going big data is in our dna in fact it is part of our mission statement to manage and organize world's information there are many google products that handle massive amounts of data over the past 20 years to support these products and their users we have built a powerful data analytics platform this platform is now available to all our cloud customers our data analytics platform offers a comprehensive set of analytics services everything from data collections to processing analysis and activation in the last year we have added a number of new services cloud composer our workflow engine cloud data fusion a visual etl system cloud catalog or metadata management service i am also really excited to have luka join our family our existing products like bigquery data flow and data proc added exciting new features now good tools are only one part of the story without data analytics is not very meaningful and that's why we spend a lot of time making sure data is readily available to our customers this includes various google data sources google analytics search trend maps and mobility data data from various operational databases in google cloud cloud sql bigtable firebase etc data from external sources as for example sas and third-party applications like salesforce adobe and sap ready availability of valuable data is a big reason why customers come to google cloud for their analytics needs well we have the tools we have the data how do we translate that to drive business outcomes and do that quickly that's where solutions come into the picture we are codifying common use cases in various different industries into solution blueprints customers can begin their journey with these blueprints and build custom applications and solution in matter of days not months this accelerates time to insight and time to value for example we have put together the solution blueprint for google ads and marketing platform activation using bigquery and its built-in ml functions and looker using a variety of data sources available in google cloud we have many more examples like this there is a list of various solutions in various industry segments that we are working on solutions are a high priority for us and a major area of investment let me now talk about our strategy going forward our vision is to build an enterprise class analytics platform an analytics platform our customers can depend on for their most demanding mission critical workloads and we want our platform to be open intelligent and flexible let me walk you through this why open well our customers don't want to be in wall gardens they want choice both first party and partner services they want portability so that they can move into cloud easily and migrate out if they want to they want support for hybrid and multi-cloud speaking of multi-cloud in a recent gartner survey 80 percent of public cloud users indicated that they use multiple cloud providers and will continue to do so as you know we are a big proponent of multi-cloud and believe that multi-cloud is the future that's why i'm really excited to have luka join our family it is truly a hybrid and multi-cloud business intelligence platform that runs on google aws azure and also on on-premises lucar helps you create semantic models and data api on all your data across clouds and on-prem you can use this to build interactive dashboards custom workflows and applications i'm also really excited to introduce bigquery omni many of you use and love bigquery or flagship data warehouse you have asked if you can make it available on aws and azure well consider your wish granted bigquery is now available on aws for customer testing and it's coming to azure soon with bigquery omni we are breaking down the data cycles no matter where the data is google aws azure you'll be able to query it using the same familiar bigquery ui and standard sql powered by anthos it is the first fully managed multi-cloud data warehouse from a major public cloud vendor everyone wants to use intelligent services infused with aiml we have some of the most advanced aiml technologies in the world what is unique about our approach is that aiml augmented analytics is that we make it seamless that is we seamlessly integrated most sophisticated aiml technologies into our systems tools and processes so that users don't have to learn anything new to take advantage of them it is a huge plus for that option of aiml let me give you an example let's take a look at bigquery ml it allows you to build custom ml models using standard sql with data already stored in bigquery so data analysts can build sophisticated models and use them for inferencing using simple sql without having to learn anything new how awesome is that we are taking it a step further we are using these models to build solutions that solve real business problems like recommendation systems customer segmentation animal detection and forecasting one of the solutions we are launching this week is animal detection it has used cases in different industries as for example flagging fraudulent stock transaction or money transfer in financial industry detecting all traffic patterns between a pair of sender and receiver in telcos flexible we have a diverse customer base they are in different industries have different use cases and different business models and they want choice and they want flexibility in how they use our product flexibility in pricing models we want to meet our customers where they are let me elaborate with an example a lot of our customers use bigquery their use cases are different and so are their access and analysis patterns for example data scientist wants to access data stored in bigquery directly using the storage api data analyst likes the sql interface business analysts access bigquery through their favorite bi tool like looker and tableau we have now added a natural language interface to bigquery this is the kind of flexibility our customers are looking for i'm really excited about data q a all business users as for example agents in call centers traders in stock exchange will now be able to use the power of bigquery it is true democratization of analytics we talked about a lot of cool things but those only matter in the platform is dependable that's why we are laser focused on availability we just announced four nines guaranteed sla for bigquery best in the industry our platform offers scalability and security that meet the requirements of the most demanding workloads and compliance and governance control required in the regulated industries like finance and healthcare but the best testament to our proven dependability is the adoption of our services by our customers the largest enterprises in every major industry segment use our analytics services and it is not just the big enterprises customers big and small and customers all over the world are using our services in increasing numbers but instead of me talking about our customers let's hear from one of our very important customers i am pleased to introduce to you vittorio cretella cio of proctor and gamble vittorio first of all thank you very much for joining us to share a bit about your data story could you introduce yourself first though sure and thanks for having me uh here at the next on air the banjo my name is vitoria patella i'm the cio of procter gamble and i've been working as an i.t professional in the cpg industry for many years my passion is to create consumer value with technology and data masterio png is the best company in the world to do that our aspiration is to serve consumer in the world better than our best competitors in the every category in every market where we choose to compete and in the process uh creating shareholders value png is 180 year old company or should i say 180 at a young company you clearly know a thing or two about consumer experiences and i've gone through a few transformations over the year so how are you thinking about data analytics in the cloud to deliver even better experiences for your customers and help transfer png again yeah the banjo and our objective of png is to understand consumers and step and serve them better than anybody else and we do that by becoming a data centric business like many other businesses we use data for descriptive and diagnostic purposes to understand what happens and why but where we excel is using data to make predictions to understand what will happen next and understand whether a promotion will be successful to decide product assortment by clusters or stores to manage spikes in demand across our supply chain like it happened during the pandemic and i can name many other examples now to achieve that we can tap into a very rich data lake environment and we benefit from the skills of our data scientists and business analysts who create algorithms to solve some of the toughest questions increasingly we turn those predictions into a prescription so we automate the result of this algorithm and inject them into our transactional and planning systems so that mainstream decisions are automated now the cloud provide us the agility to do that at scale with three things number one the capacity to store big amounts of data on demand second the tools and the machine learning libraries to work on those data and last but not least the means to ensure operational reliability and the protection of data privacy now getting there means we need to invest in our partnerships and google cloud 4-1 helps us deepen our technical capabilities and supports our needs across the data stack thank you for that now speaking of cloud and google cloud specifically can you share a little bit more about how google cloud fits in your data strategy sure let me say first that we are on a multi-cloud data lake environment with several petabytes of data across functional areas with many business use cases our partnership with google cloud started about a year ago with the objective of storing and analyzing our brand and marketing information and since then we have been on a journey to migrate all our consumer information in a data lake which currently is larger than four petabytes the data lake provides one unified view of consumer and allowed to orchestrate effectively omni-channel consumer journeys which means enabling to serve the right content to the right audiences at the right time on the right channels now we take advantage of many great products in your analytics portfolio and i like to call out one in particular that i've been really impressed by which is bigquery and since we started working with bigquery the technology performs incredibly well we are using it both for data science purposes but also to serve descriptive and diagnostic information to larger audiences thanks to the compatibility it has with our standard visualization tools from other partners and and that i believe is a great story it's a great story when we can make our tools work better together so everyone can deliver against the business and analytics objectives that is a great story indeed you touched on using other tools and technologies there pictorial as you know we are a big believer of customer choice and open platform can you share how that's influenced your decision to work with google cloud yes google cloud is a strategic partner in our multi-cloud environment and one of the things that i've appreciated is how your teams work together as an extension of our teams to help us bring transformation initiatives to lives without pushing us into a closed an ecosystem a close software environment now our future is with a multi-cloud environment and we are really excited by what working with google cloud will deliver will enable us to do and to achieve to redefine the experiences for all consumers of procter and gamble brands i'm intrigued by those future experiences vittorio is there anything else you would like to share with us today well i believe you'll see more and more examples of connected products where our consumers opt in to share information and receive in exchange personalized and services and advice and i'm sure you're familiar with some of them such as lumi by pampers uh the sleep routine system that helps parents to track day-to-day developments and monitor their babies 24x7 or the urlb io serious toothbrush that as a unique and very effective brush head design but also shows you how to effectively improve your cleaning your teeth cleaning routine all this is made possible by data including the information we safely store on google cloud and things will evolve it'll be interesting to see how indeed it will thank you for joining us for next on-air tutorial it goes without saying we very much appreciate your time and your partnership thank you thank you the banjon it was a pleasure have a safe and productive summer just to wrap up throughout the week we are going to cover different aspects of data analytics services in google cloud and how we are building a platform that is open intelligent and flexible please tune in and participate in the 40 plus breakout sessions from googlers our customers and partners thank you [Music]
