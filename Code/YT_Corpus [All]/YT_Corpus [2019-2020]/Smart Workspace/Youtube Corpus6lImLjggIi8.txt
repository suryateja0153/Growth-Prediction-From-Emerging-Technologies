 hello thank you for joining us today to talk about Windows 10 modern management with VMware workspace one my name is Pat Linsky and I'm going to be guiding you through an overview of how we solve the modern management problem and manage these Windows 10 devices using the modern management style Windows 10 introduces some major changes into the operating system one of those major changes is an API framework just like how we manage mobile devices it allows you to both configure and manage these devices over-the-air without any need for these Windows 10 devices to be joined to the corporate domain or connect to the corporate network to receive things like security updates modern management brings a slew of other automation and security tools that will really allow you to take what you're doing now with your traditional PC OEM tools and bring it to the next level really solving the challenges of a mobile workforce and these devices that no longer sit connected to a corporate network all day and we're going to take a look at how we do that directly here in the workspace one unified endpoint management console so if you take a look we will start in the uem console and take a look at a couple of the higher-level advantages that VMware brings to the table when managing these devices in a modern style the first is going to be this concept of multi-tenancy so as we manage large fleets of windows 10 devices we have the ability to break those devices up into manageable chunks or personas and assign configurations and applications based on that user profile so the management system is by no means a one size and fits all in fact we offer incredible granularity to allow you to configure really an unlimited amount of different windows 10 use cases and personas out there additionally we take the step of security a bit further with the inclusion of roles based access so you'll notice has a top-level administrator I have access to all these devices all of these system settings ever if I migrate to a new management role I now only have visibility over my Windows 10 devices that are being managed in a modern style it offers some security benefits to delegate some of this management responsibilities to the desktop teams without having one team that has to manage every single device type being managed by workspace one uem as we move back to another role we're going to drill down into a more detailed listing of these devices checking into the system and we're going to take a look at a particular Windows desktop by filtering through the system here by platform and bringing up just our Windows devices and we're gonna drill down on one of these a little bit further and take a look at some of the detailed information that we can gather from these clients you'll notice we both record security States things like BitLocker is the device encrypted in addition to security policies profiles and applications that are currently installed on the device additionally we have the ability to take some quick actions on this device and again these actions can be taken regardless of whether the device is on a corporate network connected to a home network these are all provisioned over-the-air and that is one of the biggest benefits of modern management first traditional PCL on management is that these commands we're talking about can be provisioned down to the device regardless of what type of internet connection it's on whether or not it's joined to the domain etc so a few of these pertinent commands that we're gonna take a look at first is going to be enterprise wipe an enterprise white will simply remove any sensitive information that has been provisioned down to the device through workspace one so if an employee forgets their laptop in a cab or in the airport you can very quickly ensure that any sensitive information is removed from that device even before it's back in the employees hands the next new tool that a lot of my customers are really interested in is the concept of an enterprise reset so an enterprise reset allows you to restore the operating system to a known good state avoiding lengthy troubleshooting sessions resets reimaging etc so if you have a device out in the field and is maybe throwing up driver errors operating system errors you can simply perform an Enterprise reset which will restore that OS to a known good state and retain all of the user settings user applications and configurations for that end user so it's a very quick way to go ahead and troubleshoot that device restore it without taking a lot of productivity out of the end users day and then lastly remote management so we have a fully the full platform to remote control these Windows 10 devices so if you do need to invoke some deeper troubleshooting you can have a technician directly through this console here remote control the device on behalf of the end-user and repair whatever needs to be repaired so as you can see modern management brings some new tools to the table that really help troubleshoot and alleviate some of the day-to-day operational pains of managing these devices out in the field especially for remote workers that may not be joined to a corporate network or domain moving on we're going to talk about how we configure some of these devices so modern management introduces a new concept traditionally with P CLM tools we would leverage what are called GPOs to configure these Windows 10 devices modern management has a new concept called csps and what CSPs allow you to do similarly to GPOs they allow you to configure this Windows 10 device over the air so have no fear we can import GPOs down to these devices as well if you have traditional DPOs that may not have been migrated to CSPs we can also enforce that functionality on your Windows 10 fleet but we can overlay the added benefits of modern management and these csps on top of your legacy configuration and let's take a look at some of the popular configurations for my customers managing these devices out in the field so as you can see we've come to a profile page which is really just a configuration page for different payloads around Windows 10 with workspace one uem you can be very granular with which devices are going to receive this particular configuration by leveraging a concept called smart smart groups allow you to send these configuration down to one device 100 devices or any combination of throughout your deployment let's take a look at a few of the specific payloads that I think are most important around modern management and the first is going to be encryption so we leverage the native BitLocker encryption and we have the ability to go ahead and configure manage that and change the settings as necessarily doesn't necessary directly through the workspace uem console there are some encryption options around how and what you would like to encrypt but I think one of the biggest wins here are the ability for VMware workspace one to handle the key escrow management so that traditionally required a third-party tool in addition to whichever tool may have been handling the encryption right now this system will either allow you to create a static key or simply use a unique key per device escrow that key in workspace one so as an end user needs to retrieve that key they have two methods an administrator can retrieve the key through the system for them or you can invoke some automation and allow the end user to solve that problem themselves and retrieve their encryption key through the self-service portal so again one less support to get by allowing the end user the power to grab their own encryption key if that is something you choose to allow the next payload I'd like to take a quick look at our restrictions this restrictions configuration section allows you to do a lot of amazing things with Windows 10 first and foremost of course we want to prevent these devices from ever leaving management so we have a very easy way to do that here forcing location service on is a big win so we know where our laptops are and where our devices are at all times and these are settings at the end user cannot turn off once they are configured through the administrator console how here we can allow the end user access to various system settings and I think this is powerful so if an end user you know needs date and time region and language settings but we really don't want them to change anything else you can grant explicit approval to change non-critical settings however things like UAC control etc you can prevent the end user from changing to see there are a lot of rate restrictions in here and controls around Windows 10 management the next payload I'd like to take a look at is data protection and I think data protection is one of the most powerful new features that Microsoft has built into the Windows 10 framework data protection protection functions very similarly to how containerization works on mobile so if you're familiar with containerization it allows you to build an enterprise sandbox on a device where any enterprise data is going to be encrypted and stored separately from the user data on the particular device the way that this works in Windows 10 is the first thing we do is define the corporate space based on the applications using a lot of times this could be Outlook Excel whatever corporate Apps you may have that may be epic if you work in healthcare or sensitive applications once the corporate container is defined along with corporate domains and protected networks you have the ability to invoke different enforcement policies to this data generally would I see one of these last two right we want to encrypt our corporate data keep it separate from the user data and we want to prevent any accidental data breaches and that's really what this is designed for to prevent someone from accidentally copying a sensitive email or Excel spreadsheet to Google Drive or to some other cloud service or posting it on Twitter and that's what these enforcement policies help with so you can simply encrypt the corporate data and prevent it from ever being moved outside of that container or you can have a slightly bit of a lighter touch where you encrypt the data but then prompt the user for an override when they wish to move that data outside of the enterprise container space they can audit that move the data and we will save all of these transactions in the database so you can go back and see where this data has moved when the end user is using this profile the next configuration that I'd like to take a look at is going to be around Oh II M specific settings so depending on your specific provider if you will there are certain things we can do above and beyond traditional modern management CSPs for example if you are a Dell customer you have the ability to both control Oh II M Dell updates along with BIOS as well and this has been a big win for our joint Dell customers being able to control these things over the air without having to touch each machine or run a third-party tool so some very powerful controls depending on which specific om provider you use around things like om updates and BIOS control so there's a lot of other payloads in here obviously traditional ones Wi-Fi control certificates firewall AV etc we're going to come back and take a look at some of those including Windows updates in a little bit however what we've looked at so far can be a lot for new customers when thinking about moving to modern management there's a lot of configurations we would need to copy over and we give you a much easier way to do that then building all of this net new as you decide to make the move and what we do is we use a function called baselines so I'm gonna move to a new role here that allows me to interact with these baselines now what baselines allow you to do are configure a whole groups of security policies right off the bat for these devices so you don't need to necessarily build out each payload one at a time we can do that all at once leveraging baselines and as we go to create a new baseline we're gonna give it a name and then you have some options around what pre-canned configurations so we integrate with both the windows 10 security baseline and the CIS baseline so again you can pick your version and you can import all of these security configurations right off the bat if you have a customized baseline you also have the ability to import that here once you choose a baseline you have the ability to now view which settings are pre-configured in this baseline in addition to adding policies as well so you can take a pre-canned CIS baseline customize it as necessary by adding various policies or changing policies that are already pre-configured so what this does it really helps ease the burden of configuring these machines with net new CSP policies and baselines without having to build out a couple profiles and match up all of your traditional settings it really speeds up the journey to modern management so now that we've looked at baselines let's talk about Windows updates I think some of the modern management updating functionality is arguably the most powerful new addition to the Windows 10 framework so again you see a quick glimpse of all the different operating systems we support here however we're focused on Windows 10 for this discussion today so when we talk about updating Windows 10 devices traditionally this has been a little bit of a bear with with PC LM tools you have devices that aren't checking in if we push out a major security update but that user is on vacation or maybe is traveling for a couple days they're not going to get that update until they either join the VPN or connect back to the corporate network that story has trained changed drastically when we talk about modern management updates and Microsoft providing those updates through a cloud service versus the traditional wsus system so you'll see here that with VMware workspace 1 you can choose your update source whether you do want to use the cloud service or traditional services and then you can choose your channel you then have some very deep controls around the installation and behavior of how these updates are both applying themselves to the machines and interacting with the end-users so one thing I hear from my customers is that modern management gives you a lot more options around how to control automatic restarts how to push off automatic restarts defer them if you will and how that interaction takes place with the end users who may or may not be working in a critical situation like a hospital where their device cannot be restarted at certain hours of the day so with modern management you have the ability to install updates control and user behavior configure various update policies but I think most importantly Auto approve specific branches and types of updates so you may want to allow security updates critical updates and install things like security updates automatically but have an approval process for major feature updates like 1909 that kind of combination is absolutely achievable with modern management and we're going to look a little bit more in-depth as to how we do some of the automatic installation with intelligence but when we talk about update management it's more than just applying the updates and automatically provisioning to them to the device if you have a couple hundred or thousand devices all on the same network we want to make sure we don't bring down the wind using Microsoft's Update service so what we do is we plug into the native framework called delivery optimization that is the Windows 10 peer-to-peer distribution method for updates and this is great if you're provisioning an update like 1903 that might be three and a half gigs you won't have a couple hundred clients all reaching out at once you'll have a few and then they can share that update amongst themselves through pre-canned methods and allowances that you can define here so again really eases the burden of the cloud update service by leveraging delivery optimization in the built-in peer-to-peer framework so we've shown how to configure the client machine settings through this update profile telling the client where to get its updates which updates to automatically install but how can we inject more automation and more security into this update process to really take advantage of that modern management framework let's take a look at how we do that with workspace one intelligence we're going to move to a new role here that allows us to access the intelligence engine and we're going to talk about how we can use this engine to both monitor updates better and apply automatic updates in certain situations where needed there's a lot of powerful a lot of powerful automation and powerful tools that we're going to show you so the first thing that we're going to take a look at is we're going to move to a dashboard here I'm going to search for a Windows vulnerability dashboard this dashboard gives you a detailed insight into the current patch status of your Windows 10 ecosystem you can see that we not only show you current patch levels of all of your devices but we are overlaying your patch status with the NIST CVE listing if you're not familiar with that NIST is a government agency that publishes a common vulnerability and exposures list of the most critical Windows patches and that is ranked by how serious the vulnerability is that the patch is solving so you'll notice that right off the bat into the insight into your ecosystem you can take a quick snapshot into some of this data for example how many devices are in your Windows 10 ecosystem that don't have critical CVE patches those that are ranked at a 7 or above you can then take that data and apply those patches automatically and we're going to take a look at how to do that in a second additionally you can drill down to specific devices that are missing certain CVE patches get a list of those devices and reasons why that patch may or may not have installed successfully as well so let's take a look at how we might bring this to the next level so having insight into this data is wonderful it's near real-time the devices report back very quickly however VMware workspace one intelligence combined with modern management allows you to take this to the next level and what that will allow you to do is automatically approve critical patches to your Windows 10 devices without any administrator interaction and what we're going to use here is an automation and this is part of our intelligent pack patching system that both gives you these insights integrates with the CVE list and also gives you these automations to to automatically approve when these patches are going to get installed so if we take a deeper look at this and break this down a little bit you're going to notice it's effectively an if-then statement and what we're doing is we're looking at Windows device is currently being managed by workspace one um that have that are missing a patch that CVE ranks as a nine or above so this is an ultra critical patch wanna crys your specters things we want to get patched right away traditionally how would you solve that an administrator would have to log into your PC LM tool find the patch approve it out to all the devices and then hope that those devices through the domain join to the corporate network whether it's on a VPN or coming into the office and wait many many hours or days for that data to come back and see if our patching was successful this system changes that story where as an administrator you can create this rule and you can automatically apply those ultra critical patches down to your devices without any interaction so as soon as the CVE listing identifies a critical patch our system will recognize that your devices do not have that patch an issue in automation that approves the patch and publishes it out to your devices those devices then report back in near-real-time and you have a much better insight into the current state of your Windows 10 patch ecosystem additionally workspace one intelligence integrates with many third-party tools such as slack and ServiceNow so you can do things like send messages create tickets lots of different actions outside of the uem ecosystem when it comes to approving and provisioning these patches so looking at these patches provides a much better security patch management framework than what is available with traditional PCLM tools and we're going to take a look a little bit more deeper as to some of the different security pieces that we can invoke and bring to the table here in addition to some of this automation so what we're going to look at now is going to be the compliance engine the workspace one compliance engine allows you to create security rules that are automatically monitored on these devices for violations when the system recognizes that a device has become non-compliant and has five one of those rules you can then create automatic actions to take place on this device so for example you can see the listing of potential compliance violations that we can monitor for Windows 10 so maybe we want to say all right if we have a device that is not monitored by antivirus and we've identified that that's a requirement for all of our devices we want to then take some automatic action on that device we want to mark the device as non-compliant and maybe send the end-user an email and an SMS to their device and let them know through a custom notification and a custom fully branded template that their device is in violation because their Windows 10 device is not currently monitored by antivirus you can then add escalations based on certain time periods to take more drastic actions if the device does not come back into compliance immediately so you can see here we can install compliance profiles block access to various profiles all based on the state of the device this compliance engine allows you to inject automation over the day-to-day management of these devices so instead of someone having to log in and look for alerts or get emails that violations have happened you can build these automated rules that help you rectify that situation before an administrator even has to worry about the device that's being in compliant you just frees up time and adds more automation into the system to help it manage itself so that is about the end of our presentation really want to thank you for joining us today to talk about modern management if you'd like to test this in depth or have any other questions please feel free to contact your VMware representative or visit us at VM test drive comm where you can get in play with modern management on your own devices and test the system thank you and have a great day
