 [Music] I'm Rachelle Turner welcome to smart home 101 I'm the director of product for the smart home ecosystem I am here with my colleagues Vera Donovan who runs all of business development for the Google smart home ecosystem and our technical lead David Shire and we are super excited to have you guys here this morning so let's talk a little bit about smart home we've seen the evolution of Technology over the last 30 years starting with the PC moving to the Internet to smart home and now we think we're at the beginning of the stage of the ambient of ambient computing you know it's interesting if you look back at the mobile era mobile went on for a long time before it really just became very dominant and it took the advent of the smart phone to be able to do that what we're seeing with ambient computing and smart home is smart who has been along for a while I imagine in fact I know that there are some of you out there in the audience today that have x10 systems at home right but it did not actually start to become something that mainstream users started to use until the advent of voice and ambient computing we really believe that the next leap in technology in the hardware space is going to come from the application of AI to hardware and software so to achieve the vision of where we're headed with smart home two years ago we launched the ability for developers like yourselves to leverage the actions on Google platform to integrate their smart home devices with the Google assistant for smart home integrations we focused on making sure that we can have simple and seamless interfaces within the aog console this also allows developers to leverage contextual understanding that drives the intelligent interactions with their users to ensure that this contextual understanding was available to developers we created the home graph the home graph is our technology that understands the contextual relationships between structures users and devices and rooms so if you take a look this is a super simple representation of the hunk within the structure we had the structured name so I might have Ramona's the name of my structure we have the address we have the managers of the structure in my house that's myself and my husband we have all the rooms that are in the structure the device is within those rooms and we also have a knowledge of presences the room occupied or not we have a knowledge of the room so we have the name of the room living room and we had the devices in that room I might have a speaker at a TV and then we have an understanding of the devices themselves so the name of the device the type of the device is that a camera is a light bulb the traits associated with that device so if it's a light bulb we would have on/off we don't also have colors we also have and more advanced bulbs we have sleep-wake so lots of different types of traits and attributes that were evolving with these different devices these days and finally the state of the device is that device on or off all of this information in the home graph enables us to have apply context to what's going on in your home and this is what makes homes truly smart this also allows us to do some interesting things so like in my home today if I say okay G turn off all the lights all the lights to my home go off which is great at night when I want to go to bed but if I'm standing in the master bedroom and I say okay G turn on the lights only the lights my bastard bedroom go on because it understands what room I'm in when I'm making that that request so being able to do more intelligent interactions like that is what the context behind home graph enables so our smart home API does all the work for you it's really simple to get integrated and I don't know how many first-time smart home developers are in here today but it you can get going with our smart home API very quickly there's only one API that you need to implement we send you the queries and the commands you send us your device information the state information and any out-of-band notifications and the assistant does all the rest you don't have to write any grammar you don't have to do any internationalization we take care of all of that for you and we have ample documentation and reference implementations to help you get started in fact if you're interested out the code laps later on today so we've grown a lot in the last two years and we now work with over 3,500 brands globally we would love to have you as one of our developers if you're not already started with us today we work with developers of all sizes from Alibaba hoots you're probably heard of them there are very big platform in China and they provide their own smart home platform as well that help developers integrate with the assistant over in China flow by Moen which is a leak detection system and a valve that helps consumers save water the Panasonic home energy management system that's in Japan energy management is a big area where smart home can take a play a prominent role in our environment and finally the Telus smart home devices in Australia so over the last year we've really expanded globally and we're very excited to see how this expansion plays out over the next few years but we're also seeing a really big shift in how consumers expect to be able to control their homes when we think about the helpful home it needs to be intelligent personal and predictive consumers want a whole home not just a collection of devices and those of you who have smart devices in your homes today you know what I mean right it's they don't interact as well today as they should and we need to fix that they also want simple pairing and advice device integrations that just work and one of the things that's really challenging is getting these devices online it's just too hard today still so later on today at 4:30 right here on this stage if you're interested you can come learn about how we're doing local integrations local execution and seamless setup through the Google assistant that's going to take care of a lot of these simple pairing and seamless integration issues they also want a platform that works for them but always ask permission I one of the things that's really important about smart home is that we give users control we can never do this without making sure users feel like they're totally in control of their homes but we have a lot of contextual understanding where we can enable things to happen for them so if we want to be able to do unpredictable or predictable tasks for them like if somebody leaves the house and the garage door is not closed you want to probably notify them that their garage door isn't closed before you just go ahead and notify it or just close it for them automatically but there are a lot of other things that are predictable like things at bedtime or certain alarms and within users control we can start to program those to just happen for them automatically to make the smart home a whole lot smarter and more helpful finally we have a lot of sensors that we are collectively putting into people's homes and this is going to enable a lot of new services that together we're going to be able to create services around security around energy management and around elder care and wellness and this is a growing trend that I think is really exciting for consumers so we started back in 2016 and we we started out with just a handful of devices lights plugs thermostats and switches and we've grown pretty massively over the last few years and this year in 2019 you can connect everything from your fireplace to your pergola and pretty much everything in between if you have a device that you're developing and it's not on here please find one of us over the sandbox a little later because we can help you with that so let's talk about the basic smart home with the aog platform we have a really simple core model with our smart home API we use device types to represent the taxonomy of the devices a light is a light a vacuum is a vacuum and even if you've created all kinds of cool features within your device they're just a basic device type to us device traits is where we start to differentiate the device traits give us a lot of functionality and they're the building blocks for the new device types as we'll see more in the demo that David's gonna give you in a minute and finally as I talked about the home graph is where this all comes together and allows the assistant to help make a smart home truly smart we've really focused a lot on developer tools and ease of use and in fact we've we've added a lot to are the aog console this year for smart home the devices that we're doing now like appliances and home security in many ways are a lot more complex than the devices we're starting with in 2016 however we've made developing with a smart home API a lot easier and it's also a lot more process driven in fact one of the things that we've done is we've enabled a self-certification program that we just recently launched that will help you get through the certification process more quickly and get your device into market with the assistant a lot faster our cloud to cloud AP is our lightweight and easy to use and the majority of our developers integrate very quickly in fact most of the integrations are up within six weeks but we've actually had some developers be able to get their integrations up in a day so it really just depends on what you have your past experience in the complexity of your integration so let's talk about some of the new things we have coming out we have a lot more functionality coming out this year we have a bunch of new traits including dispense new app capabilities account linking and some expanded languages so traits traits are the behaviors of devices that are invoked through the smart home grammars lock and unlock is a pretty simple example of that we have a lot more complex complex traits that are coming out this year the traits like lock and unlock can provide can play multiple apply to multiple devices so something like on lock and unlock can be used for doors but they could also be used for windows and they're invoked through a grammars such as okg lock the front door what's interesting is that our trait model is not specifically matched to a device they can be applied to a lot of different devices take zones for an example which we released this year we originally developed the zone trait to work with robot vacuums there are new robot VAX that can go understand and map an open floorplan house and mark off a living room or a kitchen and you can just say okay gee can clean the kitchen and even if you're an open floor plan house the robot back know is exactly what area to to clean because it knows what zone that is it's pretty cool then we started working with some sprinkler developers like Rocchi Oh rainberge they said hey we have zones too so the zone trait is now used for sprinklers and robot backs something that's just pretty obvious when you think about it but not something that you would necessarily be aware of when you're first thinking about traits relative to devices you could check out the sandbox for examples of our new traits we have a most of these new traits that we have are being shown in the in the sandbox today you also get touched for free and we are seeing while voice is awesome for most use cases for the smart home touch is being used a lot you have an the consumers have an option of using the Google home app the Google assistant app or the Google home hub and with the Google home hub we have the home view on there the home view actually you can see looks very much like the interface that's on the Google home app today making it a really consistent user experience for your consumers and because your devices are integrated in the home graph all of this information is pulled out of the home graph and into the UX on our displays and our apps so that it's just completely mirrored and you don't need to do any extra work to have your devices show up in any of our touch controls ok next slide here yeah we've also expanded the functionality in the assistant app to show the home summary so you can see it's 72 degrees at home and the living room lights are on and the backyard camera is on we've added a lot of new functionality into the assistant app to really represent the smart home well so Vera's gonna get a lot more into this but one area that we're super excited about this solves a big problem for smart home users is improved account linking for those of you that are partners today we know that we struggle getting consumers to link from your app your device into the assistant from your app into our app this can be a real challenge so we've added two things one is seamless set up through the local home SDK and the other is something that we're called calling Google account linking or app flip an app flip is really easy I'm gonna let Vario tell you more about it in a second but it essentially just lets you go from you the home or the assistant app into your app and back through the OAuth process making it a significantly easier and streamline for consumers we're also doing a ton of international expansion and I think this is a great area where Google can leverage a lot of our core strengths around internationalization we added 18 different languages in 2018 we're adding another 18 this year bringing us up to over 36 countries by the end of 2019 and just by integrating with the smart home API you get language support for free you don't have to do any additional work so if you want to expand into a new country you're pretty much assured that the languages that grammar will work for that country that you're expanding into and finally I want to touch on report state last year at i/o we announced report state and you guys have been awesome about providing state reporting in to the assistant API but one of the things the smart home API but one of the things that I wanted to touch on is we've gotten a lot of feedback from our developers from you guys about how we could do this better so we've added a few things if you have multiple devices we can now that you want 200 through you can now let your users choose which devices they want to provide state to Google through through the OAuth process which is great it gives users more control over their data another thing to remember is state data is ephemeral we don't hang on to this data and finally this data is only used in home graph we get a lot of questions about well we're just a day to go the data is only held in the home graph it doesn't go into any of other Google's other systems so you can rest assure that that data is really protected and used only to help the contextual understanding because it is not experienced if we don't have state data and somebody says lock your door you know okay do you lock the door and then they go up and they look on their app or they look on one of the home hubs and they go oh wait I lock the door why is it not showing that the door is locked it's a really confusing experience for consumers so States super important but so is privacy so we are doing our best to apply both of those things all right that's it for me I am going to hand it over to David right now and he is going to show you among other things how to protect your cookie thank you so much Michelle so we talk in terms of features of the smart home eco system we break this down into a couple of candidate to four categories in fact lights and switches pretty obvious on/off color brightness integration with routines and scenes and so forth entertainment devices much more complex media initiation media control lots of complexity around targeting and understanding five smart devices in months in one physical stack of media devices home security security systems cameras alarm sensors doorbells and then energy comfort and control that's everything else it's your appliances it's your vacuums it's your your bathroom utilities some other things that make your home be not that box but actually a lifestyle the nice thing is that all of these four things these four verticals are really the same API the same ecosystem and you can build one integration and then you know add in all the devices that you support and increasingly as we add new features as you add new features grow your ecosystem and our ecosystem over time we talked a lot about commercial products in the marketplace and you've seen certainly lots of commercial products and store shelves using the Google assistant and using smart home to integrate their devices but there's a lot more that could be done for individual users for makers for developers for education all using the same ecosystem in fact we have several orders of magnitude more developer accounts and developer developer setups in the system then we have commercial partners and if you are a maker if you're using this stuff at home if you're doing hacker hacker projects like this the whole ecosystem is available to you I was visiting a friend's house a few weeks ago he had 700 smart home devices all set up in his house he's all done individual integrations using his own on from implementation of our API to do you know a really really personalized implementation he has more time than I do clearly but he's done a significant job to make all voice control all assistant touched for an entirely custom home build if you are developer if you have a prototype product you can use our developer API s2 to prototype you the entire experience have everything available for demo do your drive up and down Sand Hill Road Hardware in hand that's full voice integration we don't need to approve that it's just all available to you and likewise we have a tremendous number of stem projects in the system you know college high school even some junior high folks that are learning how to code very easy to take some of the open-source platforms already have like home assistant integrate it with a Raspberry Pi hardware project and for anyone who's learning how to program have full voice control full touch control over whatever device they happen to make as Michelle said we have two integration paths I'm gonna demo the cloud today the cloud is what we've had you know since the start of time which for us is late 2016 very easy to build very easy to deploy if you already have cloud infrastructure and then later today we'll be launching our local home SDK uses exactly the same design language same type same traits same API representation of things but you can actually run your controller on our hardware you don't need to run all your stuff to the cloud it's much more scalable for you because you don't need to deploy your cloud at the scale of events submits code of devices for onboarding and performance of course is inside Google and improved so please come by if you can 5:30 on this stage with my counterparts carlomon Gaurav are gonna be presenting with that if you're watching this on YouTube you should be able to see that talk somewhere over there or possibly down here because I'm sure to be related to this one again the local home SDK works the same as the cloud you can integrate with the cloud to get your device sync and query and then use execution and state management directly on the local network with the home devices you don't need a Google home device the cloud still works but you have the local path available to you for that high-performance highly scalable infrastructure now I'm gonna turn it over and do some demos here we have login we have here a little hacker smart device project this is same cookie jar that we have over in the sandbox in the assistant tent two buildings over it is out of course this is the this is basically a permanent electromagnet on the lid but here I have a Raspberry Pi controller that connects to the cloud I have a cloud instance running on a little deviant nine instance that has the cloud controller with it is connect to and implements our API so I have already built over here in the actions on Google console a smart home project that's this cookie jar project here and I have set it up with oh uh you know the basic stuff all the instructions on this are in the documentation that was linked earlier it'll be in the final slide so I can see I have set up o auth already with some client keys that you shouldn't copy and that and then down here I have an action I have set up this here is my cloud instance before so that's still action action regard there is my execution path both of these points on the instance I'm about to show you and when I with that I now over here have an ojs instance running an odious instance which I'm going to now restart is running the command and control software it is running engine X in front of nodes yes that connection is the Raspberry Pi here connecting to the cloud controller so now if we can cut over to the phone can we cut to the phone perfect this I'm going to go in I'm gonna set up a device this is using the standard build whoops I've already connected that let me disconnect that and sure that this has good states I'm gonna restart that I'm going to connect again here and I have a login screen I have a login screen there we go I login I've got the password saved there don't do that in production obviously now I have a cookie jar device hooked and I should see it right down there cookie jar showing us a lot because that's how it was added in that code now if I go back to the assistant open the cookie jar sever wallah cookie jar has open now unfortunately we were not allowed by legal to actually do real food on stage just like Michelle said earlier but my wife and her friend me my wife me and her friend Megan made all these cookies last night and I said I'd give them a shout out so shout out for cookies I don't now consume and talk with my mouth full on stage snickerdoodles are awesome contact me later for the recipe the problem is that cookie jar is open to anybody they're up and come over and take a cookie and we don't want that to happen sorry I'm sorry so what we're gonna do here is last name it knows here is the execution code that runs that first version so with that without a pin it simply responds and executes the open command that's the open command that's returned the response has returned it passes through and sends a command down the pipe to this the Raspberry Pi which actually it's a pin which pops the magnet however I've already got the code here so I'm going to change this to true now we're gonna run out of this code and when this executes when a request has no pin we're gonna send a pin challenge right there so instead of opening the jar we're gonna send an error that says mean a pin and if we have a pin but the pin does not match the con that's up at the top again in real code you'd do that from a database then it's going to generate a repeat pin so now I've written that it's now pin needed I go back to my other window I'm gonna restart my little node instance puppet comes there's the connections in the device and now open the cookie jar 17:59 whoops 18:05 so now I have so now we've implemented a to F a feature you saw was about 20 lines of code and the nice thing about the second for the two-factor authentication is you as the partner can decide when and how to challenge so if for example you wanted to make a cookie jar that was locked before dinner but available after dinner because you don't want your kids eating cookies before dinner you could absolutely do that and if you had a cookie jar with an F C so you had a dongle and you waived it no you said open you could do that too with a second factor we don't know about so you have that in your control and the two FA feature is available on pretty much all of our traits so if you want to have a cookie jar obviously it's designed for security systems door locks and so forth where it's really mandatory to have that's that second factor of security but it's also available on whatever interesting devices you might happen to make can we go back to the slides perfect so everything I just did was available with all developers all makers educational projects what have you no approval no launch needed you put into your project we can share that project anybody that you share it with can run it it's very much like you know in any App Store Play Store having a feature that you can share internally if you want to launch it to the to the the masses we have a process there we'll talk about more you go through the same portal you have self testing tools and it's usually pretty fast for partners to get these into into full launching which is what I had over for virility all right I seriously can't have one you know when you get home exhausted from work all you really want to do is set the thermostat to heat up your freezing house start doing all of the laundry start preparing a big meal for your family then do all the dishes then prepare for the next morning know we just talked about how we're gonna solve for a lot of this with the connected home and once we solve these problems for users they're gonna start expecting it which is really good news for all of us here from the thermostat developer to the oven developer to the dishwasher developer to the device we didn't even know we need a developer we're all going to grow the smart home ecosystem together look at the data the number of connected homes in the next five years is set to grow 10x that's amazing and of those homes the number of connected devices already today in those homes is 10 and over 50% of users are using connected devices every single day that's amazing but what's different what's changed well incredibly over 44% of users have used an assistant to control a connected device how do these trends benefit you and how are we here to help well number one we can help deepen user engagement number two we can help increase your device sales and number three we can drive brand value so let's walk through each of them starting with engagement let's remember that the assistant is live on 1 billion devices so we want to help enable your reach - we want to solve for the device discovery problem it's been in a problem that's been plaguing our industry for a very long time and then the third is we really want to help with setup it's still way too full of friction let's start with reach remember that the assistant is live on 1 billion devices that's on mobile phones it's on speakers it's on displays it's on cars aunty and much more so remember your user he or she is driving home and wants to preheat the oven or set the thermostat now you as a developer have access to that user on the go and you have to do nothing else let's also remember that the assistant is live internationally and the connected home market your customers are also growing significantly internationally so when you build for the smart home API once you get access to all those users across different locales countries languages entirely for free we need we're doing a lot to actually solve for discoverability as well remember I mentioned that on average a user has ten connected devices in his or her home what we've already launched is an ability for user to discover the devices directly in the home app in the feed through something called suggestion chips when a user taps on that they can start connecting the device the next thing we're doing with discoverability and I'm especially excited about this one remember the reach that the assistant has on mobile devices we're going to be sending notifications to users on Android and iOS who have a third-party app downloaded encouraging the user to connect and set up the device but that's not only going to be it we're also through those flows gonna start educating the user on the benefit of connecting the device so think about everything that you do every single day to make your device connected you think about all the new features you're gonna launch all the functionality all the smarts things like this are gonna help bring your features to the forefront we need your help we're doing a lot of work across our ecosystem of developers to help with this discoverability so our partners are doing things like launching badging on boxes or putting inserts and packaging they're also doing a lot within the UIs themselves so the UI is within TV or with a third party app and they're doing a ton across things like email press and other campaigns we actually did a program with Vizio where the partner launched a education flow directly on the TV on the benefits of connecting to the assistant that discoverability of features and they saw a 10x increase in the number of connected devices all right so we've talked about Reach we've talked about discoverability with an engagement now let's talk about set up how many horror stories have you heard of your customers struggling to set up a connected device I embarrassed to say I sometimes have problems setting up a connected device I know my team does as well I'm legitimately worried that our industry is going to change the centriole joke of how long does it take to screw in a light bulb and so how long does it take to set up a connected device and I don't want to be here when that happens we want to prevent that from happening so we're doing a few things yesterday we announced that we're opening up the local home SDK this is the first step it enables local execution it allows things like the home hub or the speaker to be able to identify devices nearby the second thing we're doing is Google account linking so if a user starts with in the assistant experience and then goes to your app to accept the Terms of Service they can then flip back to the assistant experience without having to re-enter username password credentials which we know is a significant friction point all right so we've talked a lot about engagement we've talked about Reach we've talked about the ability to solve discoverability we've talked about setup now let's talk about sales we know that the reasons users are buying connected devices are for convenience and cost for value and incredibly 89% of customers are influenced by compatibility of their assistant when considering which connected device to buy so what are we doing there unsurprisingly a lot of people are starting their purchase process directly on search so we've launched a works with Google assistant attribute and shopping on search to encourage users to be able to find which devices work with their assistant to be eligible make sure you register your devices in the Merchant Center and an ad works with Google assistant in the title and the description it's not just on search we're doing a lot across other channels so we work very closely with our retailers across things like promotions fixtures displays we're doing a ton to Train installers and our retail partners we're doing a lot of width above the line marketing brand marketing etc but the point here is you don't have to be a big company to benefit make sure you launch a quality integration with a great use case and we'll do our best to showcase you alright now let's talk about brand value remember that for users home is a sanctuary it's where they go to find comfort care and to be in control this is the best place for your brand once the vision of the helpful home becomes a reality the brand's your brand will be at the center of it users will use your devices daily you will be the new household brand I mean look at some of these examples some of these brands we didn't even think about or use just a few years ago and now we think about and use them daily now think about this new world you get home your house is warm and toasty when you arrive the laundry is already done the oven is preheated for that pasta dish that you've been dying to make your family and the dishwasher is set to run at night to save you energy and money and yet you think about none of those things we simply take off your shoes and hug your family so when we achieve this as an ecosystem of developers users are going to be using your device daily it's why they went and bought it and that's why they know your brand the benefits to you across deepening user engagement increasing your sales and across driving brand value we'll all be there to recap make sure you launch the smart home API that's the cloud to cloud integration also launch the local home SDK which we announced yesterday that's what enables local execution also implement Google account linking it's what really helps with what is today a pretty friction full setup process register your devices in the Merchant Center and add works with Google assistant in the title in the description and then check out the marketing hub once you launch we want to make sure that we're educating our mutual users on the benefits of your connected device and connecting to the assistant we have a few upcoming sessions to deep dive into these topics local technologies for a better smart home is later this afternoon it'll also be recorded and streamed live and then tools for building better smart home actions is tomorrow also will be recorded in stream live thank you so much [Music]
