later releases the token issuer service is hosted on AWS in these following three regions north america virginia EMEA in frankfurt and for APAC is japan also know that client secret is stored in hashed format in token service database now let's jump into the new Chrome OS features we have the new certificate lifecycle management from Chrome OS the big differentiator here from our previous certificate management chrome is that this one is fully managed which gives granular visibility and control to the admins and it is also automatic deployment which gives you simpler management which also gives you flexibility Asian options full lifecycle management real-time visibility and you have a reduced server load which is great and zero user intervention you will have the options between two types of certificates the user certificates which is for use only by a single user and it will not be shared with other user accounts the other one is device certificates which is shared across all device users and includes login users guest users kiosk and managed guest sessions now some of the use cases for both of these certificates are Wi-Fi web sites or web apps or portals VPN email and for next releases will have the Chrome extensions and Android applications added as well now let's talk about the new iOS be in the version 2001 we have support for GMs and non-gm s in a single OG there will be a new QR code enrollment setting force AOSP close network enrollment when that is enabled devices will enroll without creating a managed Google account even when AOSP and closed network is not selected AOSP / closed network enrolled devices will not be available for public application assignment this requires the hub 2001 let's jump into what's new in Windows 10 in 2001 we'll have baseline exclusions additions to skip profile new BitLocker options om update custom sources and app inventory enhancements first one is the workspace one baseline enhancements the baseline assignment will now support smart group exclusions to allow for flexible assignments so now the ability to assign a global baseline to site wide or company-wide smart groups and exclude smart groups with specific users devices like executives etc that would be one of the use cases second feature for Windows 10 is the additions to skip profile for Windows 10 we have added of support to the skip proxy you can select the location for their certificate private key TPM required will be for private key protected by trusted platform module or TPM TPM if present will be for private key protected by trusted platform mobile if the device supports TPM then we have software and that's for private key saved in the device OS KSP and lastly we have passport which is for private key protected by Windows hello for business formerly known as Microsoft passport for work this option requires the azure ad integration third feature we have here for Windows 10 is new BitLocker options for a more granular deployment flexibility the first option here is to keep the system encrypted at all times what it does is that it ensures that a system will stay encrypted and there is essentially all circumstances it requires purposeful administrator actions to override and it also provides an out for BYOD system second option here we have for BitLocker is to suspend BitLocker until TPM is initialized it handles OOBE or other scenarios where a poor user experience might appear it also provides administrators with a balance between management of security versus the user experience fourth feature we have for Windows 10 is om updates source location we have the ability to specify the update source location which you can now point del command update on your enterprise their Windows 10 devices to custom update sources this feature lets you customize the update catalog to only contain the files you want fifth feature we have in Windows 10 is enhanced app inventory where we have consistent results with add or remove programs on Windows 10 now previously unmanaged app inventory was limited to applicate followed strict guidelines for registering them with Windows hub and now reports the same application inventory as control panel add or remove program displays as zoom management allows admins to make user installed on manage apps to become managed reporting information will be available for user installed applications and through workspace one intelligence app inventory honors privacy settings for BYOD Windows PCs and it not collected now our final new feature is with Apple which is on-demand custom app updates this new functionality will allow the administrators to update custom applications on endpoints the benefits here is that a custom applications can be updated without changing the app itself the update will occur for all devices assigned to the applications at that specific OG but only if the device were ported the application is installed and very important at a version older than the update thank you for listening to the workspace one uem 2001 what's new video again my name is Karim Chelouati and I'm a senior technical marketing manager please
