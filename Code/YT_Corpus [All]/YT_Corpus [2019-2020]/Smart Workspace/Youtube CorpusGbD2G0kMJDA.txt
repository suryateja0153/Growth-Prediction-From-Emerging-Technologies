 hello everyone I'm Andreano Lanusse EUC staff architect at VMware and today I want to give you a full review on our most recent innovation risk analytics to get started I'm going over this presentation and I will explain why we introduced this new approach across the workspace one including an in-depth explanation on what a risk analytic does and how it works followed by use cases and I will finish with an end to end demo on the entire solution to get started let's take a look on today's approach to validate trust of end-users device most of enterprise organizations today leverage solutions that use device posture information along with authentication and authorization data to make a decision about access to an app that is good but with today's workplace dynamic remote workers are becoming the new standard and access to applications from everywhere is a reality this approach needs to evolve and expand the sources of information to make a better decision for example in workspace one access today the controls to validate the device before when the user access are based on device compliance roles and deterministic matching of configuration States defined on Workspace ONE UEM as an example I can allow-list or deny-list applications I can set compliance checks related to antivirus encryptions firewall passcode SIM card and so on all of those should be activated or even I can restrict OS versions that will be enrolled in my environment such approach covers the device portion but not enough to really assess the risk of the connection that goes beyond the device in identity but what if I add the dynamic capabilities combining the power of the cloud with machine learning models to evaluate risk beyond the device where based on dynamic risk assessment I can leverage additional information and compute the risk of each user like trust low-risk users those are free to go and access those applications and introduces some frictions for moderated in high-risk users or even block those high-risk users because they are representing a high-risk for the organization risk analytics is the foundation to achieve that across workspace one allowing organizations to assess user risk by identifying practice that hinders security such as common negligent user behaviors and provides a risk score for every device and user and organization it leveraged machine learning to detect anomalies based on user behaviors and the intelligence cloud service to handle massive data processing all the complexity around that will be simplified for the IT users they will obtain insights on user in device risk score through reports and dashboards take actions through automation roles based on device risk score events to mitigate risk and simulants integrate with workspace one access for risk-based conditional access the risk scores calculated by risk analytics are based on models we developed to detect anomalies and human factors for example the range of knowledge the range of negligence misuse or even lack of self control so we are looking for those behaviors that make the user vulnerable to risk what we call user behavior analytics the user behavior analytics relies on a continuous process that starts with the ingestion of the data that comes from Workspace one UEM next it assess the risk based on the user behavior and then compute a personalized risk score for every device and user into the organization and finally it allows the automation of responses to mitigate risks associated with the end user device let's take a closer look on each one of these steps on the first step you need device data that comes from Workspace ONE uem to the intelligence connector that's the main requirement to get scores calculator on workspace ONE intelligence the risk score will be calculated once a day on an environment with a minimum of a hundred devices per platform which is the minimum required to be able to provide an accurate score for each device and users risk score won't be calculated for users that has more than 6 devices registered under the same account those will be considered as shared device the second step is the assessment of risky user behaviors in this first release we look into 6 risk indicators let's start with this first two laggard update and risky settings both are identified as score device information and it is available on corporate and personal devices the laggard update model identify users that systematically ignore software update which may lead to vulnerability and increase the risk of being compromised the behavior model evaluates the dominant version of operation sustained organization and score them based on their relative age in this example most of the organization iOS devices are on version 13 the small number of devices on 12.4 and under represents a risk for the organization to mitigate the risk in situations like that we could consider to automatically upgrade their devices or create a support ticket to assist users in this process those devices there are behind on the OS version will be getting a low or middle risk score when comparing with the entire organization next is the risky setting model this model evaluates the risk associated with the configuration status of every device it is course every selling combination based on the prevalence of the security settings across the organization for example if the firewall is disabled on most window devices in our organization it won't penalize as much as if it was the baseline for every device but devices with most security settings disabled the outliers will have the highest score how can we not get this behavior and make users more careful with the status of their device we can leverage intelligence automation here to push profiles that will enforce policies or tag devices that will automatically be added to a smart group associated to a windows baseline that you will force those settings the next four are related to applications which looking to unmanage apps when allowed by the privacy settings configured on workspace one UEM we don't look for manage apps as those are defined by the administrator and should not represent a risk let's dive into each one of them the first one the compulsive app download look into how many apps got installed over the past 14 days it ignores activities related to installed apps on the first 30 days after enrollment it does that because when we enroll a device main applications will be provisioned and this is the normal behavior this model measures the frequency of apps downloaded to better understand this model let's take a look on this chart in this result the model identify that a normal behavior is the download and installation of up to 15 usual apps devices with up to 30 apps installed in the past 14 days are in the middle range but those that install it over third applications are the high-risk because each app may include non or unpatched vulnerabilities that may become attacked vectors that attack surface area for cyber attacks increases with the number of applications on the device next is the unusual app download the unusual app download looks into rare apps installed over the past 14 days the same 30 days grace period after enrollment applies to this risk indicator this model the app popularity the app popularity is measured taking the list of all unmanaged applications from your organization tenants in look how common those are across all the other tenants hosted on the same intelligence region let's dive into this in this example a set of common apps has been installed across multiple devices devices with common apps installed doesn't represent risk however devices with rare apps installed does more rare apps you have installed increases the risk unlike you idly use applications rare ones have often questionable prevalence and have a higher chance of contain malware or security vulnerabilities for the last two app risk indicators app collector in rare app collector that is no grace period they will look for the device app inventory and activities cease enrollment app collector will measure the amount of apps the user kept on the device the rare app collector will measure the popularity of the apps kept  on the device the app popularity use the same technique we discussed before to measure and identify how popular those are the assessment of risk user behavior as today is based on these six risk indicators and we plan to grow over time to in which the risk score the third step on the risk analytics workflow which to computer personalized risk score and let's take as example John that has four devices and on his Android device he's not performing an activity that brings the risk into a meter high so he's too on the on the low risk but he start doing some things on his iPad that raises the risk into medium because he's actually downloaded a lot of rare applications so those applications are questionable from the risk analytics perspective on his Mac he keep postponing they always update so he I wanna upgrade for the latest Mac released like Mac Catalina so he keep ignoring delaying the software update so he because of that he's showing to the medium risk however then he goes into his Windows Device and he want better performance so he thinks that disable antivirus disable the firewall it will help to increase that performance so that risk jumps into high on this Windows Device when we compare across all the other device that has those cells enable so the overall risk of John's gonna be high because the aggregation of risk on these devices the highest one is high at this point so those combination of those risks and the risk indicators across other device defines what is the risks for the user itself and finally our fourth step into the workflow is the automation support for risk analytics it allows the administrator to remediate device risk take your two minute actions based on device risk score events as an example we can identify device that become high risk devices because they are laggard update in this case we can take automated action that will push up update to the OS of those respective devices or in case of personal devices we can notify the user that in each to update the OS in in the time that he doesn't update the iOS I can for example remove access to some corporate applications or cooperate networking so other types of actions can be taken as well since on the automation you can see here that we can take actions based on the risk indicator so if some site is on the device has been disabled like firewall antivirus why not push a profile for those devices that enable those sad is it doesn't allow the user to change or even tagged the device to make this device as part of a smart group in case you leverage Windows baseline for Windows device that you can immediate apply those baselines on the devices and enforce those policies through to to the device itself doesn't allow or not allowing the user to change those anymore so those are the type of things that you can do with automation on risk analytics let's take a look in the demo and see how that look like into the watch based on intelligence console on the workspace one intelligence console we can take a look at the user risk dashboard that user risk dashboards provide us visibility on the trends of high risk users identify across the organization you can drill down on this chart and identify who are those users so we can take a look and see the users the number of devices their risk score and when the last assessment were performing in addition to that you can see all the devices associated to those users in the risk score associated to each device you can take a look here and see that Kevin has one device that it has three risk indicators assign it one is related to the number of applications another one related to the laggard update so here's an OS version behind compare with organization and the third one the risk setting and their risk indicators let you know what are the signs that are disabled on this device and need some attention maybe force the policy educate the user and so on and the final here is the last device so his device in this case is in an old version very very old version and for that reason when comparing with other other device across the organization he is represent a high risk the aggregation of those risks on the device puts Kevin into a high risk score for for this scenario another useful dashboard is the device risk dashboard which gives you visibility across all the risk indicators per device that in that chart you can see here that you can follow the trends of risk indicators across all of your device that has been assessed in the daily basis you can drill down on the chart and take a look and see each one of those devices here and see the risk indicators associated to each one of them you can drill down even if you want to see specific a risk indicator for most of the devices in their platforms associated in users and if you wanna you can also create a automation based on device risk score in this example here you can see that I can take actions on device that has been reported high as high risk I can even filter more here and say I want to take actions on devices that are iOS and the risk indicator that has been reported as part of the the high risk device I want to filter based on the laggard update so in this case devices that are reporting as laggard updating represent a high risk I can take action that will call a UEM API and will send a notification to schedule OS update for those devices that are reporting like an update even though you can take a look here and consider the ownership type in this case so I don't want to do this on personal devices I want to I wanted to disown my corporate devices that I know I can perform that because they are under DEP so this is some other things that you can do on the workspace one intelligence in how you're going to be able to interact with the data that has been generated and analyzed by the risk analytics on the daily basis now that we learn how to risk analytics works let's take a look on the use case that you can leverage risk score the first use case that we are releasing is the risk score for conditional access as part of workspace one access up to today the authorization process on workspace one access work were relying into the user authentication and device posture now we add the risk score as part of this authentication service and you can leverage the risk score to define what would be the authentication mechanisms required based on the risk of the user to leverage risk score and workspace one access you must integrate that workspace one intelligence and workspace one access that integration can be performed through the workspace one intelligence console under Settings integration you can perform the integration here as soon those are authorized it you're going to be able to enable the risk score adapted on workspace one access and then it start leveraging the that as part of the conditional access policies with the configuration of intelligence and access successful you're going to be able to enable and see the risk score adapter on workspace one access from there you can define what the steps based on the risk of the user in this case I'm allowing with low-risk users for medium risk users I'm stepping up the authentication which we've called the fall back into my policy and for high-risk users I media access you'll just perform that configuration safe and then start assigning the risk score for the policies that you desire to use a risk score I'm switching here into the fall access policy on my workspace one access environment you can see there have multiple policies and each one of them I'm defining policies for platform I'm adding risk score as part of the conditional access I'm leveraging mobile so for iOS device compliance and risk score and in case those one of those fail the fallback is going to be mobile sso device compliance and vmware verify I do the same similar policy for Android web browser and for Mac OS in each one of them I'm leveraged the risk score sometimes associated with device compliance sometimes with certificate pass or this so on let's take a look a little bit in more details on the iOS policies that I have define it here you can check that in see that the defined policies from iOS I'm calling mobile sso the first method of education must be one that identify the user in this case you cannot use a risk score the risk score is gonna be the second at least the second method of authentication as part of your policy in this case I mean using combined here device compliance any risk score in case the user is medium risk I'd set up that policy the risks were adapted as step authentication that will go into the fall back which will request mobile sso device compliance and vmware verify so this is my policy form iOS I have different policies here for Android different policy for Mac OS and I have a different policy when I'm trying to access applications from the web browser in this case you see that I request for some password so the user will have to provide his AD credentials and risk scores the second in case the users a medium risk into a fallback pass password and vmware verify let's take a look now how it's gonna look like the experience for the user when he tried to access the applications from workspace one intelligent hub in this case I'm gonna use a low risk user he's on his iPad and he will launch office 365 from the workspace one intelligent hub the works office 365 is available in the catalog and when he launches the application the single sign-on were quickening I defined a mobile so as part of the policy it will check for the risk user and since that user is a low risk the experience is gonna be the same so they use it for the user doesn't change anything in the case of like I try to access with a medium risky user my policy said I had to ask for a second factor authentication in this case here VMware verify will kick in because that user was identified as a medium risk and will ask for a second factor VMware verify kick in the user approval on his mobile phone and then he's gonna be able to access office 365 after confirmed the second factor authentication now going to the high-risk user I define a policy that when accessed through a browser you have to provide your AD credentials in this case that user will provide his AD credentials to access the workspace one access Portal and then he's gonna get access denied that user was a data file has a high risk by workspace one intelligence and will not be able to access those applications risk analytics symbol averaged across multiple use cases with workspace one as long workspace one access is part of the authorization process when the user tried to access applications you're going to be able to leverage risk score as part of the conditional access to request additional authentication factor or even then I access depend on the risk of the user represent for the organization you're going to be able to leverage there to access applications hosted on-premise applications hosted on the cloud SaaS web virtual desktop in published applications and that's it for today I hope you enjoyed this technical review and if you want to learn more about workspace one
