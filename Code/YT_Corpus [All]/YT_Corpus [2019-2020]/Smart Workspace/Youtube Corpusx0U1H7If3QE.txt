 - Hi, I'm Janelle. I live here on the ground floor of this apartment building. And I recently installed the TELUS Smart Automation System in my home. Rules are a pretty cool thing. You set them up online, and the system will perform them automatically. If I go away for the weekend, I can turn down the thermostat, and turn the lights on and off just like I was at home. I like that the system allows me to do these little things to make my home more secure. That's whey I'm so happy with my TELUS SmartHome System. (upbeat music)
