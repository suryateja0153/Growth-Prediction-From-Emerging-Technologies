 hi everyone thank you so much for joining today's webinar enabling and securing the remote workspace before I hand the presentation over to our presenters for today's session I have a few housekeeping details to cover first this webinar will be recorded and shared after today's presentation next all participants have been placed in listen-only mode but we'd love to hear from you during the session so if you have a question for our presenters please feel free to type it into the chat feature which is located on the bottom left corner of your screen we will be answering questions at the end of the session however if you don't get to your questions during today's webinar we'll be sure to follow up with a response via email afterwards so without further delay I'd like to kick things over by welcoming our presenter Jeanette Jeanette over to you thank you so much art welcome everyone good afternoon happy to have you here for the enabling and securing the remote workspace webinar a part of our new world of work webinar series so here at Ricoh we do recognize that security gaps may be a part of your current remote workspace my name is Jeannette Sirois I am enjoying a 25 year career in IT much of that in leadership roles management consulting and including as a CIO for hire and today I'm joined by my colleague Scott Easton and Scott I'll turn it over to you to introduce yourself please Thank You Jeanette good afternoon everyone my name is Scott Easton I'm a manager with Ricoh IT services and I am responsible for leading the architect and IT management consultant team I've had a career in IT going back 20 years with the past 15 being in management as well as director level roles thank you so much Scott so today that we want to touch on these topics we want to touch on understanding the remote workspace we want to talk about today's IT challenges the new threat landscape creating a security strategy securing the remote workspace and how you can afford comprehensive security as a small medium-sized business we'll talk about your next steps and then we have a question-and-answer period so hopefully we will hit the target for you today all right so let's talk about understanding the remote workspace as it is today so it is not business as usual we are being very challenged to adapt to the way we communicate how we access information and securely so there are cultural differences now like we have virtual drinks on Friday afternoons and it's acceptable for kids to pop into video screens during video calls and people might even be accessing business systems from their personal devices so what does COVID-19 mean to business continuity well it means that organizations need to be nimble and the questions that we have are is your business equipped to service the customer experience to people in your organization have the right tools and access to information you know one day people were forced to work from home and businesses just weren't prepared for it so how do you keep your customers happy and your employees connected there are likely lots of changes in how your business needs to work in order to ensure that your products and services are available and relevant in this changing landscape so when we think about empowering your remote workforce pardon me there are lots of things to consider we've got remote collaboration so what communication tools does your organization have and are your file sharing process is simple and well-known process automation so things like automating forms and workflow maybe you need something that's going to help people be triggered as to when it's their turn to take on a task as a part of a process and maybe you possibly need secure signatures on documents or otherwise and then there's IT security so as a part of digitizing things can be fairly simple and or they can be complex and security is an underlying you seen for all of it and that's what we're going to focus on here today alright so let's look at the top IT challenges so right now the top IT challenges that you see here on the screen are really centered around securing the remote workers so COVID-19 has put organizations globally into chaos as they're attempting to continue their operations while keeping their employees safe and IT is needing to support business continuity without necessarily clarity of duration and amid conditions that change daily and on a scale that's never been seen before so IT is needing to juggle capacity and ensure that services are available to its end-users and again the key being without clarity of duration so these priorities are now being centered around the remote worker as I mentioned which is a part of business continuity and the security is also a part of business continuity as is the availability of processes to continue without people being in an office so for example automating routine processes things like accounts payable and accounts receivable receivable which can be very paper intensive processes and then continuity also considers how to leverage the cloud especially as applications need to be securely available to remote workers and possibly client so then we consider scaling infrastructure all of these challenges are tightly coupled and therefore they need an overarching roadmap in order to determine how you scale your infrastructure all right so let's talk about the new threat landscape collected some survey information and 85% of the organization's surveyed have half of their workforce working remotely which is pretty significant and then 36 percent of those surveyed believe that cybersecurity threats have risen since work from home has been in place so these cyber threats are more prevalent we are seeing that and and they are very cunning alright well definitely remote work adds complexity so a lot of people are having to deal with a number of different elements at home so workers are being challenged to be focused and certainly they're being challenged to be focused and thoughtful about security and there is a lack of enforceable home office security policies that can be audited and there's no control over home office print output there's a tendency to go between personal and work email file sharing systems as well so when we look at the top five security threats through the COVID-19 timeframe here these won't be unfamiliar likely to those of you that are participating in the webinar here today but they're phishing emails malicious applications insecure endpoints fake websites ad domains and ransomware so let's talk about an example ransomware let's take ransomware so ransomware denies access to a device or files and tell ransoms been paid ransomware for PCs is malware so that gets installed on a user's workstation using a social engineering attack where the user gets tricked in clicking on a link opening an attachment or clicking on malvert izing so one of our customers had a competitor in fact that had to pay a fair amount of money on ransom money to get their data released and that organization did not have an employee cybersecurity education program in place another example of one of our customers an accountant got caught by a fishing and spoofing scam now thankfully she reported it to IT when she realized what had happened due to the email spoofing which sent some executives in the organization a suspect email from her and then IT immediately put a task team on to tracing what was happening and getting the accounting system access protected but this took a huge was a huge distraction for the organization in a large risk so with COVID-19 the tactics prey on happenings that are going on now and how likely people are to respond to those so this leads us into our first poll questions so we are curious what is your organization's top IT security concern or what are they right now so we'd like to invite you to just take a couple minutes and participate in the survey please that's good we thank you for participating so we'll just give it another 15 seconds or so and then we'll close the poll and see what the results are okay so in our audience today fifty percent are looking at securing end points and then followed by data security which is definitely a theme that we're seeing more and more of system access and availability are tightly coupled with performance and reliability and then we've got ransom attacks and customer threat and experience okay super so lots of great stuff that that you folks are looking into it's good to be aware and prudent of what needs to be done okay well let's take that information and talk about how these types of things matter when it comes to a security strategy so so to develop a security strategy you want to start with your IT roadmap and then in in today's landscape and really all the time you want to understand what's new what's changed in terms of the business goals and how they're operating so typically your IT roadmap would take your business goals you would assess that against technology availability and then you would come up with your strategy and you develop your roadmap so what's new with the business strategy and the ever-changing COVID-19 requirements is likely meaning that you need a new security strategy and a security strategy is intended to outline major security concerns similar to what we just looked at in our poll questions so a strong IT function will be aligned to a security strategy as you know IT is critical to ensuring system access and availability things like supply chain back-office functions and processes that support customer service so sure a quick example with you we have a client whose services are designed to be delivered in person and now the organization cannot provide these same services online without providing technology directly to their clients who are unlikely to have their own technology and who are less likely to be technology literate so this requires a completely different business strategy and this requires them to issue assets that can be can have the data controlled on them so this is both to be able to push information like training videos out and to audit what's on the devices and to control the devices in case there's some kind of a risk and they need to be able to meet government requirements for protection on specific information so they may need remote control software and possibly data encryption tools or otherwise as a part of that dot solution but this is an example okay so purity strategy has three main elements it's got governance management and information security framework so an organization's security risk compliance posture which is a part of the governance can either have too much security to allow people to be productive or too little security to ensure that data and systems are properly protected and secure so - so to secure with prevention have detection response and recovery processes in place all three of these will involve people process and technology which you can see on this diagram is a part of management and then of the part of governance let us suppose that your organization does not have a work-from-home policy and the context to this came from the fact that simply wasn't the way that your organization worked now the context with COVID-19 has changed that dramatically an IT advises that prevention detection response and recovery all need a new work from home policy so the new work from home policy gets developed and part of that policy states that the use of personal computers to access business systems is not permitted she'll therefore the direction again coming from governance to the management portion of the strategy is that everyone working from home will use a company issued computer perhaps set up with VPN virtual private network as part of the new policy then for compliance to be audited which is again part of the governance acquire certain processes to be set up technology and processes to be set up for managing specific rules an example of this might be onedrive let's take that a lot of people are familiar with that so perhaps onedrive is not available then to be accessed outside the network therefore a VPN again virtual private network connection would have to be in place before that tool could be used okay so then in that scenario however there's nothing preventing the employee from emailing themselves a file so that they can print it from their own home computer fuel management the management area IT they're all doing what they need to in doing their job and there may be ways in which they can detect certain things or not so anyway the behavior expectations here would be set by the policy again however non-compliance like I mentioned it's hard to prevent or detect and even audit okay so now that we have a sense of the implications of a security strategy which is that it drives technology design process and behavior let's consider these top five priorities with working from home security and addressing these domains will immediately reduce attack surfaces and risks so we've got culture and awareness network security endpoint security which many of you are concerned about vulnerability management and security incident management so let's consider this scenario there's an awareness campaign in place and people are cautious all Network equipment is up-to-date and monitored configuration supports segregation antivirus and anti-malware and VPN protects the endpoint remediation of vulnerabilities is prompt when it's discovered and an incident response process is in place and the Incident Response process accommodates remote workers so there are some different things to consider in that endpoint security element and Scott's going to talk to that a little bit later here for us today all right so how do you know how secure you are and how can you assess and learn how secure you are so I've got a few things here on the screen and I want to touch on today so some options are having a vulnerability assessment which will help list all of the internet facing assets and scan ports for exposed services as well it as well it will assess all software for exposures then we've got penetration testing and so this is testing to see if you can bypass security controls and identify places where they can travel through compromised hosts and then you get a sense of what kinds of security controls and measures you might need to change then there's web application testing and this one's also very important so it's an automated vulnerability scan where it'll also test application logic for flaws and so whether you've got something that you're purchased and is being hosted by someone else or the software development done by someone else or in-house it's always good to have this kind of a test performed and then social engineering which I've touched on a bit already here today so collecting information from public sources and then attempting to email attempting email and password hacks so this also tests behavior to determine whether weak areas an example today could be with everything going on with COVID people can be more distracted and things are a little more hectic they're having a hard time focusing at home with the kids around and all sorts of different distractions you know everything that's going on in the news and it could be easy for someone to just call up a help desk and potentially get access to someone's email through asking for a password change for example so yeah I guess I could share an example here too you know we recently I had a client where they hadn't done penetration testing so they're very security aware and and they've got you know different partners in place and processes for ensuring that their environment is and their data is is secure but they hadn't done the penetration tests and some changes were made and sure enough someone hacked in through weakness in a web application and placed data into their environment so that was a very scary incident for for that client all right so I've probably talked enough now we are going to get into securing the remote workspace and I'm going to turn it over to Scott to lead you through this part Scott please thank you very much Jeannette before we get started with discussing securing the remote workspace we do have another poll question for you so which of these does your business need to leverage today to support your remote works force cloud readiness assessment two-factor authentication mobile device management data encryption on computers applications in the cloud the backup of data on computers or virtualized desktops if you wouldn't mind taking 20 or 30 seconds and just participating that'd be fantastic excellent it looks like we have some great response to the poll question so I'm looking forward to the results all right it looks like a two-factor authentication is the major concern of this group followed very closely with mobile device management which completely makes sense with the current situation that we're facing with the remote workforces that came into play very quickly with probably most businesses not being prepared for the extent required following up mobile device management with cloud readiness assessment and then virtualized desktops the backup of data on computers and then data encryption and applications in the cloud being tied all right let us move on to discuss business continuity business continuity needs smart IT design architecture options need to match the business landscape and to be nimble cloud options are a key element in the design as it allows businesses to be nimble scalable and include managed security if we take a look going back to what Jeannette was discussing you want to start off with your IT strategy in your roadmap from there it's advised that you move on to a cloud assessment a cloud readiness assessment provides information that enables smart business decisions and allow businesses to be secure and nimble once you've completed your cloud readiness assessment you'd be looking at the migration strategy as well as management after implementation a good example of business continuity would be leveraging the cloud in implementing office 365 by doing so your email would be migrated to the cloud and instead of being on prem would be available anywhere via any internet browser on any device along with access to the MS Office suite this would also take the management and administration of the infrastructure out of your hands as well so now that we've discussed using cloud for business continuity I'd like to move on to the cloud options that are available and the security as you can see cloud does not have a one-size-fits-all approach there are many uses for the cloud starting off with infrastructure as a service so infrastructure as a service is where they provide the virtual servers storage networking firewalls and security they take that physical infrastructure out of your hands platform as-a-service involves the infrastructure but then at the same time takes it a step further and you're provided with developmental tools database management business little analytical tools as well this is used primarily by developers with the creation of new applications and then we have software as-a-service software as a service is where a third-party vendor will host their application in the cloud and you're responsible only for your data now we need to take a look at security in the cloud you must be aware that there are risk decisions that you'll need to consider being that there is no one international standard for cloud service providers however there are other certifications and due diligence is recommended by your business when you are selecting a cloud provider from the cloud I'd like to continue discussing securing the remote workspace with two-factor authentication so why would you use two-factor authentication two-factor authentication is a method that grants a computer access only after presenting two pieces of evidence in the authentication process how does it get set up well most applications these days now have it built in and it is easy to enable usually it takes maybe about 5-10 minutes to set up with the applications having it pre-installed if you're looking to implement two-factor authentication with your custom application or your in-house application you'd need to look at getting the assistance of a third party vendor if you're looking at securing your mode access to your network with two-factor authentication my recommendation would be to get assistance from an architect to solution out the design implementing two-factor authentication does take a quite a bit of work on the back end where you're setting up with your servers and whatnot so you need to make sure that you do have it set up properly so we've looked at business continuity with office 365 and now we've looked at securing the remote access as well to your applications office 365 is another one of those applications where you can easily implement two-factor authentication and and secure remote access so the next step would be to secure your data so I'd like to discuss securing your data by using mobile device management so when and why would you use mobile device management you'd use it when you're allowing your team members to use their own devices such as phones tablets PCs or laptops for any business related requirement now these days with COVID-19 and people working from home this has probably come into place a lot quicker than most businesses were prepared for which brings about the possibility of a threat with BYOD you don't have that extra layer of security or built-in when their users are using their own device unless you're using something along with MDM so the solution with using ng allows you to go back to Jeanette's talked about strategy this is where you can apply the governance of the requirements of your business to set the policy and then you can set up audit trails and remediate as required so this security strategy allows you to add that additional layer and by adding that layer you can set the policy which data is saved to a mobile device can they get email on a mobile device what applications can they use on a mobile device are you going to push everything out individually or is it going to go specifically to a container that if the device is lost or stolen then you can send a command to remotely wipe that device so mobile device management adds that additional layer security to what we have discussed today already consider office 365 we can access it anywhere from a browser allowing the business continuity then we can enable two-factor authentication on mobile devices to ensure our access it's secure but then we can also add that additional layer to protect the data by implementing mobile device management taking it one step further to protect data we'd be looking at data encryption so why would we use data encryption on endpoints data encryption adds that additional layer to what we've discussed already today and would protect your data due to any loss or theft whether it is being from hacked or lost or stolen laptop PC or memory key so what is data encryption data encryption uses a mathematical algorithm to scramble messages leaving the individuals who possess the sender's key the ability to decode the message there are two types of data encryption there's symmetric key encryption which involve use of one key and then there's asymmetric encryption which involves the use of two keys do you need to encrypt your entire system no you do not have to encrypt your entire system you can encrypt individual files and folders you can create a volume container or if you do desire you could encrypt the entire hard drive what types of data would you be looking at to encrypt you'd want to encrypt any personal identifiable information financial information or confidential business intellectual property and what could you use for data encryption Microsoft has a product called BitLocker that is an encryption tool that they include with their operating systems many of the anti-malware vendors out there include encryption in their security suites or they also sell it as a standalone product so how secure is your infrastructure some key points that you want to look at to ensure the security of infrastructure would be backup continuity you'd want to make sure that your regularly scheduled your backups from this you'd also like to go back to the governance strategy and policy and maintain a data retention policy on how long you would actually keep the data and then you'd want to follow up and ensure that you're doing file restores for disaster recovery on a regular basis to ensure everything is working properly the next item to look at with securing your infrastructure would be endpoint security you want to make sure that you have secure remote connectivity and with this there's various forms of remote connectivity to you you can use one of the most popular being a virtual private network virtual private network can create an encrypted tunnel from the device into your network enabling that additional layer of security that hackers cannot get through and then you'd want to take a look at ensuring that your antivirus protection is up to date on your endpoint this would help you against any hacks malware or ransomware attacks that you may face the next step for your infrastructure to take a look at would be firewall security the firewall is the edge device for your network and it takes the brunt of any of the virus or hacking attacks that come in so what you'd like to make sure is that you have redundancy and high availability built in what I mean by that is instead of just having one firewall best practice is recommended that you actually have two firewalls that are in high availability mode what this means is when the primary firewall goes down for any reason it's a heartbeat and the secondary firewall picks up the idea being is that your network does not go down and your business continues to work without interruption you'd also want to make sure that you're you're taking a look at ongoing administration of your firewall rules a firewall just isn't a set and forget type of device you actually need to make sure that your rules are updated especially with the threat of attack that we're facing now and this being your edge device and then you'd also want to look at the white listing and black listing of website so what white websites do you want your users having access to what websites do you not want your users having access to email security is the fourth item that you should be considering email security is key especially with the ongoing virus cyberattacks that we're facing the phishing and spam threats the malware and ransomware attacks and this ties back to the endpoint security as well with the antivirus protection you have in place and then it also ties back to the firewall security as the rules that have set on the firewall will also assist with your email security patching and firmware is a key element that ties into all of the four items that I've already discussed you need to make sure that your operating systems for your PC's your laptops your servers as well as your switches routers firewalls are up-to-date it's ideal to make sure that the firmware is up-to-date on your your hardware devices as well plus then you'd like to take a look and ensure that your business applications are kept up to date this is key with securing your infrastructure because essentially these devices can be hacked and the older that they get the more vulnerability opens up with them once a vendor stops creating any sort of patching or firmware updates then you must take a look at a life cycle refresh the life cycle refresh is basically when you you replace the operating systems the hardware the business applications with the latest version generally in terms of hardware we're looking at about anywhere from three to five years operating systems and business applications as you know are constantly pushing out patches as hackers are constantly finding new vulnerabilities so next I'd like to discuss how can you afford comprehensive security as a small business you can do this by using the guiding principles for strategic fit and this again ties back to the strategy that Jeanette was talking about earlier in our presentation you start with strategy as policy drives the process and behavior so the guiding principles includes optimize which is standardized increasing utilization of your current IT you want to reduce your complexity consolidate into smaller groups and fewer units wherever possible and increase the utilization rates of what you do have maximized what do you have in place that you can leverage further you want to make sure that you extract as much value as you can from your current investments and then consumer eyes you want to leverage the managed services that are available to you by third-party vendors and the cloud so for the next steps I'd like to pass the presentation back to Jeanette thank you Scott hopefully everyone on the webinar has found that very useful information thank you so much for all that that was great detail very thoughtful okay so what are your next steps we've gone through a lot of information already today today we touched on IT enabling and securing the remote worker and it's important and that this is a part of business continuity again business continuity simply being the continuance of a business under some kind of an operation that is or condition that is like what we're experiencing now with with COVID so back to considering those top IT challenges that I started talking about when we began the webinar these are tightly coupled and need an IT roadmap that was what we got out of that and then IT and the executive need to work together to make sure that they're they're making careful decisions that will drive continuity as it relates to the remote workforce so strategy your next steps are strategy just know what you need and then the security and architecture design will enable the right scalability and nimbleness to ensure that you've got that availability and have that and and it'll do that when it's tied to your new security strategy so the solution does matter and it and it does all need to tie together and then get secured so use professional assessments to help you know where your organization has weaknesses and put remediation plans into place and then manage so stay diligent I can't speak enough to that it's really important that you monitor and audit often so if you remember us going talking about the remember me talking about the security strategy and managing with prevention detection response and recovery being key things so this is an ongoing practice and the more tools you have and different things that are automated that's certainly going to help you and then and that includes you know whatever is going on with with IT so make sure you've got the right tool sets in place and the right service providers so then be wise with your resources so keep your tech updated and Scott talked a lot to that today and he's touched on how that managed process when organizations are leveraging the cloud whether it be platform as a service infrastructure as a service or a software as a service a lot of that management and therefore all the security elements of that will be taken care of as a part of those services so here at Ricoh we do have a very diverse team of experts and I just want to say that you know Ricoh is a leader in the market and this today the information that's been presented to you by myself and Scott doesn't just come from our experience or plethora of experience in our careers it comes from you know working with folks and clients where you know Ricoh serves almost 1.3 million companies worldwide with digital solutions and managed services and consulting services just a whole host of great things that organizations can take benefit of and I believe that we do have three other new world of work webinar webinars in our webinar series and I think with that art I'll maybe turn it over to you I just want to say a final thank you to everyone who joined us in the webinar and we looking forward to your questions art thank you so much Jeannette and Scott we are now opening up the Q&A session so please type your questions into the chat box on the bottom left corner of your screen if you have not already done so during the session I see that a few questions have come in during the session so I'm just going to get started with those here's a question for you Scott it is how would I move my servers to the cloud excellent question art so there there are a number of ways that you can do this one of the ways is actually building new servers in Azure and then migrating your data there are also a number of software applications that allow you to clone your servers and then migrate your data into your cloud and what they'll do is feed the data and as the data gets copied over and the server created you'll do one final seed and then you'll be able to do testing at that point in time ideally what you'd want to do is have an architect involved so that they could solution it out for you to ensure that you are using the proper method for your data all right well thanks so much Scott the next question here is for you Jeannette the question is what do we consider when selecting a mobile device management solution okay that is a great question so there's some good data is available through technology research firms like for example the Gartner quadrant that will help you to get a sense of the variety that's out there in terms of these tools so just like we've talked about today you just really want to make sure that you're looking at what fit for your organization so having some idea of what your security strategy needs to be what kind of data are you protecting and what kind of workforce do you have so in my experience organizations are best to drive this direction like I said based on that business strategy and how operations are but also current technology architecture and so when I mentioned that there's an example for one of our clients had a mobile device management solution very well thought through they were a little bit ahead of the curve but that solution was to proprietary in nature and therefore was causing them problems when they were looking at using it with with different device types so that would be something to look out for and then there's other things like does your organization need to have coverage over different rules so different things that would apply whether it's based on region or based on a role of someone inside of an organization and then I would also invite you to really think about especially for small medium-sized businesses some of these can be very complex which may not fit a small to medium-sized business and in some cases there are organizations that offer matter solutions so that could be an option as well hopefully that answers the question and certainly of course that security posture comes in to influence that I talked about earlier so with the selection you know best consider what kind of compliance regulations your organization has on the data that that they're using to manage their business awesome doesn't that sounds good Jeanette and I think there is another policy related question for you the question is what is the most timely and important part of a security policy okay so I think what I'm understanding there is what's what's sort of most timely and important right now maybe based on coded yes I would think yes yeah okay so um I would say if you haven't if your organization doesn't have a work-from-home policy then that would be something really important to get in place right away as we talked about I mean that can drive a lot in terms of technology decisions management all of the security practices and then behavior as well and and so also having that cybersecurity education I think is really important all right great and talking about cybersecurity I think there is a security question here for youth but it says that you mentioned several various security solutions today do I have to implement everything that you've discussed or to be secured no that's a great question art basically what it comes down to is the risk that your business is willing to accept my recommendation would be to follow along the lines of what Jeanette and I were talking about in the presentation and come up with a strategy and our IT roadmap for your company from there you can determine what is most important and what is the highest risk for your company and come up with a timeline as well as a budget that would fit your small to medium business all right great thank you so much for that Scott and with that that ends our Q&A session thank you everyone for attending please look out for the email with the recording for this webinar sessions which we will send out tomorrow via email also please do take a couple of minutes complete the survey that will pop up once we end this session your feedback is really important to us for us to continuously address any challenges you are facing in your business today so stay safe and have a good day thank you
