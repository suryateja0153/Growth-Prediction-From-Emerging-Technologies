 albertans pushed the edge just a little bit harder we believe and most others and being a TV financial where we are every day going to work to make banking work for Albertans means we're always pushing the edge a little bit to serve them that much better and to ultimately make a bigger difference on our province we're in a financial services industry that has been the same for 50 hundred years we need to rethink how we work because otherwise if we continue to work the way we always have we will not survive some people might have thought it would be risky to take on G suite adopting a new tool set of that nature and changing the way we work it was certainly a bold decision because not a lot of organizations our size have contemplated doing this nor in the banking space before G suite ATP I would say was a very traditional company we had desktop installed prerogative is he software we had a mail system that was in our data centers what G suite has really allowed us to do is go from an idea to implementation far more quickly now a great example would be the branch for arts and culture which is a pretty unusual kind of approach to bring to market for a financial institution we're looking at artists we're looking at creatives often making their livelihoods in a much different way than people who are working 9 to 5 meaning when your financial institution trying to provide products and services you have to be more creative and the G suite has opened the door to that the branch for arts and culture can feel a bit like an outlier a special offering for a special part of the market the shareable access of the G suite platform has enabled us to remain aligned with the whole organization we're kind of spread out all over Alberta so it's great because we can work on the same Google sheet or on the same Google Doc in the real time now a good example of a problem that we solved with G suite is actually using chat in financial services one of the things you often run into or you have outages between financial institutions that could be customer impacting we're able to reach out to literally over 5,000 people all at once with the latest information so in fact you know a lot of people would look at it as a risky move it was the exact opposite when I look back now most two years on since we made that decision to go with G sweet nobody would go back like nobody would ever go back because it's changed who we are [Music] you
