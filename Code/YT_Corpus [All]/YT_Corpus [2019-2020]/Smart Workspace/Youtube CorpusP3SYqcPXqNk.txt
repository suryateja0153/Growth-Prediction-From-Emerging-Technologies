 hi I'm Alvin I'm a product manager here at Google and a practicing doctor in internal medicine our goal is to restore the joy of caregiving and redefine how physicians nurses pharmacists and more operate we want to enable them to operate at the top of their license encouraging high quality and high value care today healthcare data is siloed an innovation to improve the clinical experience is hard the tools for frontline clinicians are clerical and suboptimal for decision-making we need modern tools that are a joy to use doctors and nurses spend half their day in electronic health record and they often have to log into multiple systems with multiple usernames and multiple passwords rather than seeing all the information in a single place this makes accessing the information they need burdensome and even when they do get to the data they are often confronted with information overload and they don't have the tools to quickly and easily find what they are looking for we're excited to share with you what we've been working on here in Google health the chart you're going to see is synthetic meaning it's not real patient data the product is currently in development and early clinical pilots it's not yet available for clinical use with a single login doctors can access a unified view of data normally spread across multiple systems all the types of information clinicians need are assembled together such as the vitals labs medications notes clicking on any value will start a deeper exploration showing recent and historical trends both graphically and with tables doctors can query the entire chart with their own words and typos results are not strict keyword matches a variety of Google technologies are used to identify related concepts such as coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia clinical shorthand works too you can search a B X for antibiotics and will return the administer of antibiotics and mentions of them in the note below to reduce the number of clicks clinicians can jump directly to any part of the chart with a simple search such as vitals or notes key information like the latest admission note known as the H and P are also just a few keystrokes away text is often copy and pasted from prior notes obscure and fresh from stale information copy forward a text is automatically detected in grey and the source is shown on her documentation is a major pain point for physicians to help we've adopted smart compose from Gmail to complete common clinical phrases as clinicians write in different sections of the note relevant information will be shown on the right hand side and tricky to enter or spell information is automatically made easier to enter as clinicians type about lab tests relevant results will automatically be shown on the right hand side we'll even try to successfully complete grammatically what the clinician wants to type and enter the right piece of information similar proactive assistance works or reports such as the chest x-ray where we'll show the full report and after you enter it you can go back and see it in any time point last and this is my favorite feature you'll even be able to search for information and scan documents in those boxes even when they're handwritten we'll still find an information for you [Music] we want to empower clinicians by making it easier to access complex clinical data with tools that are delightful to use we want to make the work of caring for patients like documenting your thoughts or efficient and seamless we're excited to work with doctors nurses on our collective mission of delivering the best possible care for all patients [Music]
