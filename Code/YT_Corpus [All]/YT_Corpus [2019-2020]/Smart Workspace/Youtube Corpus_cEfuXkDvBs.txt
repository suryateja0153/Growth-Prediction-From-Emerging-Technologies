 (bright music) - [Narrator] "Safe is the new clean" since clean surfaces mean safe surfaces in today's world. The trusted critical cleaning experts at MicroCare bring both safety and "perfectly clean" to your whole workspace. Effective cleaning helps prevent the spread of viruses and germs, so important in the fight against coronavirus. Stereze Workspace Cleaners meet the highest safety and quality standards to keep your people and space as safe as can be. They are formulated from 70% Isopropyl Alcohol, as recommended by Centers for Disease Control, CDC, for disinfecting surfaces. Clean all of your communal areas like conference rooms, classrooms, offices, restrooms and lobbies. Stereze Workspace Cleaners clean everything from desks to door handles, from keyboards to phones, sinks, tools and more! They are safe for use on stainless steel, metals, plastic and glass materials. The mixture of 70% high purity IPA and 30% deionized water evaporates slowly, staying on the surfaces longer for better cleaning, and the cleaners don't leave particulate, scents or residue behind. The Presaturated Wipes are safe to use on electronic devices like touch screens, mobile phones and keyboards. The strong, tear resistant wipes stand up to rigorous scrubbing on rougher surfaces and the unique "slam-shut" lid keeps the wipes wet and ready to use. Stereze Hand Sanitizer wipes, gel and spray are FDA registered as safe and compliant for sanitizing hands and everything you touch in your workspace. When you want to clean or sanitize your workplace and reduce the risk of infection, look for Stereze Workspace Cleaners and Hand Sanitizing Solutions. Visit MicroCare.com for a distributor near you.
