 Hi my name is Hailey I'm from Albuquerque New Mexico I'm a rising senior at Columbia studying Electrical Engineering today I'll be taking you through a day in my life so stay tuned. So on campus I'm part of a couple clubs I'm the president of women in computer science check us out if you're into CS @Columbiawics on Instagram I'm also part of the Columbia undergraduate science journal where we published scientific research and also the Hong Kong students scholar Society it's a wonderful family actually not on campus right now I'm in Canada doing research in the Institute for quantum computing my field is specifically in photonics and this is something that interested in while doing research on campus many students do research on campus and it's as simple as sending an email or two to a professor you want to work with seeing if they have a project you can help on - and actually my professor helped me get this internship by writing me a letter of recommendation this summer I'm also working on a little side project so here's my schematic so far I'll be working on the PCB layout. thank you're joining me on my day today hope you enjoyed if you have any questions feel free to email this e-mail right
