 okay hi everyone my name is Mira Kimiko as you saw from the previous slide as well today I will be talking about learning quantum mechanics with IBM Q so a brief outline of my talk of what I'm going to speak about first with touch on quantum mechanics then I will talk about quantum computing with IBM Q and about Kiska twitch J already talked about it and then I will give you some example of experiment that you can do with the IBM Q so at the beginning of the 19th 20th century or 1900s a growing number of experiment showed that classified classical physics was not good enough to describe and predict what these experiments in atomic physics were showing us so in the face of this we were forced to make a kind of adjustment and a patchwork of theoretical ideas was born to to fix what classical mechanics and the classical laws of electromagnetism were telling us eventually this effort ended in the 1920s when a coherent and consistent mathematical framework was developed by Heisenberg first and then Schrodinger which was able to to explain these all these atomic experiments the problem is that since then we've been struggling to understand what really the mathematics is telling us about the feature of nature so what I think it's the take-home message from from this mathematical framework that we've developed is that physical properties are discrete so there is a minimum precision with which we can know the values of physical variables or certain physical variables and this is given by Planck's constant the second take-home message is that we can only predict probabilities of future events or the probabilities that certain variable will take specific values and the last one is that in this framework we can't really tell what the properties of a system are whenever we are not interacting with the system or as so to say measuring it now how can we use this well with quantum computer of course otherwise we won't be here and in this sense IBM was the first one to lead the way when they released as I said the quantum experience first and then kiss kit this allowed people to have access to anyone with an internet connection to have access to no intermediate scale quantum computers which that's determined that we are given now for to these quantum computers which are not yet the ones drained by the pioneers of quantum computing in the 90s but there are four step towards these these machines and this took the form of various 5 and 16 and now 14 qubit devices which as I said every one can can access and do experiments with now to use these these machines we need to talk tisket and kiss kit is a python-based software which is open source anyone can contribute to that and develop it kiss kit is based on four four elements so I'll just go over it very quickly since you're already heard about this the first one is called Tara and it's kind of the foundation of the whole software and that allows you to compile your circuit and interact with the hardware Ignace it's about noise and errors acqua contains applications for of quantum computing like optimization chemistry and artificial intelligence and their host several high performance emulators now once you start talking kiss kit you can do several things and anyone can turn himself you know into a quantum scientist that's that's the coolest part of it and so one of the first one of the example of the things that you can do use it as a pedagogical tool to familiarize yourself or teach other people and give them a hands-on experience on quantum mechanics for example you can really observe the effects of superposition which is the simultaneous assignment of different states to the same system with a certain probability or observe the effects of entanglement which is a stronger than classical correlation between quantum systems another thing that you can do is to explore applications of quantum computing which give a quantum advantage which means that you have a speed-up with respect to classical alternatives in solving the same mathematical problem so the very first examples that that were found in this sense the Deutsch jaws algorithm but Bernstein's Asrani and Simon are algorithm which is a precursor to Shor's algorithm and those showed that it was in impressible possible to have a speed-up which was constant linear or exponential respectively with respect to their like best classical counterparts last one last thing that you can do with a quantum experience in which I think it's one of the most important ones is that you can explore questions related to research so whatever your your quantum phenomena that you want to explore if you can phrase it in terms of kiss kit then you can actually use the quantum experience or IBM q2 to get some answers for example one of the topics which get me most interested is about the foundation of quantum mechanics and one of the notebooks available for kiss kids actually shows that you can do experimental tests of Bell's Theorem which is a theorem about the locality or non locality of nature and using their quantum experience or or kiss kit then you can actually do this test experimentally and you know find experimental data and check if if your experiment or nature is violating bells inequality or not and with this I'd like to conclude and thank you for your thank you [Applause]
