 now many countries around the world are racing to develop a supercomputer based on the quantum physics South Korea researchers have been developing innovative ways to turn quantum computing into reality our ASEAN has more on how this could become reality in our daily lives South Korean researchers are working on the building blocks of supercomputing networks that are hundreds of thousands of times faster and more secure than present-day technology quantum computing researchers at Korea Institute of Science and Technology have develop ways to use diamond structures to generate qubits normal computer store and send data in binary form as either ones or zeros however quantum computers use qubits which can exist as a 1 and a 0 at the same time in what's called a state of superposition as both possibilities exist this increases the amount of data the computer can store or process meaning it can run through all possible outcomes at once however it's not just the number of qubits that matter as they're largely volatile keeping them isolated and in a workable state is one of the biggest hurdles in quantum computing we use spin qubits to develop our system the advantage of using nitrogen vacancy color centers in diamonds to make qubits allows them to work better at room temperature and there is also good connectivity with photons we can also incorporate semiconductor processes to produce qubits scientists around the world are working to obtain the quantum advantage or reach the point where quantum computers can significantly be traditional computers at solving complex problems most expect this would require at least 5200 stable qubits quantum cryptography is another promising field being the closest commercial application of quantum technology from using secured Wi-Fi to controlling power grids encrypted networks are vital to security on individual business and national levels using the quantum principles of physics could help make networks unhackable a secret key is distributed between two parties and cannot be intercepted without collapsing traditional networks are secured of mathematical problems or encryption which can be resolved and less hacked but by using random values and the BBA t4 protocol we can check elevates to detect hacking attempts while quantum network equipment has mostly enabled data centers to connect with a single receiver or client we have successfully tested a system with multiple receivers hands team aims to develop this multiple receiver system and make the equipment smaller while increasing the distance of data transfers Korea science ministry aims to invest more than 37 million u.s. dollars over the next five years to develop a five qubit quantum computer and a hundred qubit machine by 2027 Oh Sooyoung Arirang news
