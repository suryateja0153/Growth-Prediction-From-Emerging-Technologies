 looking around the room I can see up there is a read first instruction and I guess that's what I was supposed to read first so I'll close and actually show you how to play the game so let's get started [Music] hi welcome back to coding with kiss kit this is a in today's episode we'll be talking about games so games tend to be the first application in almost any new type of technology for example we've seen games like crypto kitties developed in blockchain we've seen competitive gaming like alphago and artificial intelligence and quantum is no different the nice thing about quantum is that the field is so young that this is great opportunity for you to develop games so if you're interested there are generally two ways that people have been building these games where you take open chasm code you populate a string with the blocks that you're creating and then run that string with a simulator and another way to do it is to write the game entirely based on kiss kit so using Python to generate the circuits instead of using open chasm generally people have found that because the simulators are more readily available they're much easier to integrate into games in this episode we'll be covering a particular game called kiss gate blocks and this game was developed by one of our Star developer advocates James Weaver so kiss gate blocks use this mind test as an open source voxel game engine and Mayon test is essentially like an open source version of Minecraft that you can then use to play any voxel type of game so voxel just in this case refers to those block looking objects in mind test and those are units of graphic information that define a point in three-dimensional space so to give you an idea of what you need to do to install kiss kit blocks the instructions are found in the readme of the github repository for kiss code blocks and this is James Weaver's github page so you can look at that readme and we'll put a link to that file in the description below but effectively what we're going to do is install mine tests first and then install the kiss kit blocks world so to download and install mine test the website that you go to his mind test net so once you have mine tests installed you can open it and I have my intestine stalled already this is what it looks like once we're here the first order of business is to download kiss get blocks world so we'll go to content and we'll say browse online content and type in kiss kit blocks and hit search and you should see the kiss gate blocks option here I already have it installed so I only see how to uninstall it but in your case you'll be able to install from this page once the installation completes click the back to main menu button and now you should be able to go to start game and switch to the kiss kit blocks world so once you're at this world page you can now uncheck all of these options click new here to create a new world you can type in a name for the world and that is something that has to have alpha alpha and underscore character so something like a von der score world works here choose zero for the seat and choose flat for the map gen and choose kiss kit blocks for the game and you can click the Create button in my case I've already created a world called coding with kiss kit world here so what I'll do is click on that world and say play game so now that we're here we can start playing the game at any point you can learn more about the game controls by pressing the escape button on your computer which will take you to the screen that shows you the keyboard shortcuts so as we begin we're in the starting room and this starting room has all the quantum operations that we've been seeing throughout this video series and in fact if we want to learn more about each one we can right-click this question mark button here so to get closer to it I can use the navigation buttons W a s and D so pressing W takes me closer and I can right click to learn more about what that particular gate does looking around the room I can see up there is a read first instruction and I guess that's what I was supposed to read first so let's get closer going to this page tells you how the game works so you can read through this instruction to find out what the objectives of the game are and what the structure of the game looks like so I'll close and actually show you how to play the game so let's get started so what I'm going to do is by walking around this room and seeing what's available around me so in this world there are three main areas and they are quantum cat sandbox the quantum circuit garden and the puzzle rooms in this particular building where we are so there are also some areas under construction with a few quantum circuits in them and some mind cards that will take you to them quickly so let's go to the puzzle room okay going back here looks like there's a hidden room and there is a ladder the ladder wants us to go down so I'll get close to the ladder and hit shift to go down so clicking shift I'm at the ground floor now and it looks like we have a series of boxes to play with and what looks like a quantum circuit okay so let's figure out what we're being asked to do so there is a chest here with a question mark sign above it and we see this one out of sixteen sign which tells us that we're on puzzle number one so let's right-click the question sign and it tells us this circuit consisting of only one wire leverages the ex-gay t' also known as the paui X naught or bit flip gate okay so let's look at the circuit so the objective of the circuit is to take us from zero to the state one here and to do that already we've seen that this is done using the X gate so where is the X gate the tool for the X gate comes from this chest so I'll get closer to the chest and hit the right click button and now it gives me this tool so I'll add X to my toolkit and walk toward circuit and place X well that's a nice sound that means I did something good let's see yep you can see that the block sphere has also changed to reflect the state that has changed from up here to down here okay so that's mission one out of 16 let's go forward to another room and find another circuit okay again let's look for the question mark it's right here it's number two out of sixteen question mark says this circuit consists of two wires demonstrates that one or more x gates may be leveraged to create a classical state let's see what it looks like so we're trying to go to the one zero state so in kiss kit the way the state is read is by putting 1 here and 0 here so I'll apply an X gate here so let's pick up our tools again so I'll hit right click and get my X tool and then place it onto this particular box so one thing I should also point out is you see this blue box here you'll see that this the intended solution for this problem is up here and you also see another blue box the idea here is that the amplitude the probability amplitude of the circuit in its current state is shown in blue here and the phase is represented by this arrow so we intend to make this box look like the box above so let's put an X gate here ok at this point the box looks like the one above and we've created the state that we desire which is 1 0 and you see the Bloch sphere shows us that this qubit has gone from the zero State down to the 1 state all right that's two out of 16 let's go forward but I'd like to give you some tips in particular so let's walk back out of this room and one thing you might have noticed I've been walking very quickly so far it's because I have fly mode enabled you can enable and disable fly mode by clicking the K button on your keyboard so you can see I have it enabled and disabled now so if I disable it the walk will be fairly slow so let me speed it up and go back to the first level so I enable fly mode so I'm stepping outside of that very first room or we were and the place I'm taking you to will allow us to play the quantum teleportation circuit in a kiss gate block so you see these yellow boxes we're going to follow those yellow boxes so teleportation is hidden in this space so you see this fence I'm going to walk toward it and in particular once I get close you see this box with the series of elements so that's our circuit I'm going to hit shift to go down and try to land close to the circuit ok let's go back a little so we have a better view this circuit should look very familiar to you from our quantum teleportation video it shows you a teleportation circuit so these are the two qubits between which you're creating entanglement and you're teleporting the state on this qubit onto the third qubit so to complete the circuit you need to insert a block here and you have the measure Z and the measure Z up here and you're applying a Z gate and you're applying an x gate also depending on the measurement of those two qubits so this is a very familiar teleportation circuit that you might remember from our video so we have the two qubits between which we have our entanglement and we're teleporting the state from this qubit onto this 3rd cubed so instructions for solving this particular circuit can be found here so again right click and you'll see the circuit demonstrates quantum teleportation to complete the quantum teleportation circuit grab a classically controlled F block so the trick here is that you have this missing box here which tells you that you need to apply a Z gate conditioned on a classical result so you'd find that classical block there and place it into its respective space so I'm going to go back to the chest right-click it I see a series of tools here so in particular I want the classical control here and I'm going to take that and the control tool as well so I'm going to move forward and place the classical control tool here and you see now that there is an indicator here which tells you the line which corresponds to the qubit where that control is coming from so you see for the X gate you have the second line activated which means that X gate is conditioned on the second qubit being one this Z gate has the first qubit so that's correct but the condition says if it's equal to zero so let's right click again and if we change it to if it's equal to one you see we've solved this particular puzzle okay that's exciting so now let me show you something really cool where we learn how this game actually works you see this Q picture here so what I'm going to do is get closer to it and then right click when I do you see the chasm code that's generated from the circuit and this is the chasm code that's being run to check whether or not you have the right circuit so in fact if I take this chasm code so I'm going to copy it to my clipboard close it take line test out of full screen mode and then go to my browser and go to quantum computing ibm.com and go to the composer I can click create new circuit I can go here and paste in the chasm code from that circuit we saw in mind test and indeed you see that the circuit that's generated is exactly the one we had there so here's your controlled gate that you insert it for so this is the control on a classical bit so this bit is coming from measuring this particular qubit so this is exactly how that game checks if you have the right answer or not so this is probably the first time that you're seeing open chasm code so you can think of open chasm as a simple text-based language to describe quantum circuits and chasm stands for quantum assembly language so there's a nice paper here that describes the entire open chasm assembly language and gives you an idea of the details involved in describing quantum circuits and different components in this kind of way so let's take a look at how kiss gate blocks works so I'm back at the github page for kiss gate blocks if I go to the kiss kit blocks folder and go to the mods and in particular what I'm looking for is the cue command folder and this file called init Lua and you can see that these are the instructions that are building the quantum circuit out of the blocks that were putting down so to find out exactly how this code interacts with Kasim you can look for compute underscore circuit on this page so it looks like this compute circuit function takes in the parameters of the circuit and then populates the string Kasim start with first it starts with this line and then builds on it by adding different components from the circuit and eventually it takes this Kasim string and runs it on an IBM Q simulator so let's remind ourselves what we've done today so we downloaded mind tests which allowed us to have then a kiss gate blocks world and that's where we played our games and in that gameplay we learned how to solve several different quantum circuit puzzles and in particular we also learned how that game works by integrating open chasm into its functionality so we saw that the open chasm code that it creates can be pasted into the IBM quantum and you can see the circuit that it's building and the runs that it's doing in the back to simulate and find out the puzzles that you're solving hopefully this inspires you to then think of ideas that allow you to build your own games based on Oakland chasm if you'd like to see some of the games that have already been built using Kiska and open chasm take a look at the link that we placed into the description below so this was our ninth and last episode of coding with kiss kid on YouTube but the good news here is that we're just getting started
