 [Music] quantum computing is not just better computing faster computing it's a different kind of computing it's predicted to solve some of the world's most fundamental problems from inventing new drugs to making brand-new materials and creating more precise climate models it could solve some problems in seconds that would take current supercomputers thousands of years the technology is in its early stages but the effort is quickly gaining momentum so how well quantum computing changed the world a standard computer might have billions of bits each one can be a 1 or a 0 and they're all completely separate from each other quantum bits or qubits work differently for a couple of reasons that come from quantum mechanics thanks Jason but let's not go down that rabbit hole all you need to know is this the theory shows that certain kinds of problems not all just some particularly thorny ones are made much easier when you've got quantum computers one of those problems is in encryption the kinds of codes that protect your credit card details online or your messages in whatsapp or signal what caught people really interested in making corner computers was the realization that they could break encryption that was supposed to be too hard to crack because regular computers couldn't crack them that's the kind of thing that gets the attention of national governments the ability to crack other countries encrypted networks as in the case of artificial intelligence China says it intends to lead the world in quantum science and has announced plans to open its own national quantum laboratory to open in 2020 America is getting involved too it intends to create a national quantum initiative that's because the prize that quantum computing offers the potential strategic or commercial advantage is huge imagine if you could make minute-to-minute real-time stock predictions based on data from every trade ever made or if you could simply compute the formula for a new fuel or a drug that beats a horrible disease that's the kind of promise the quantum computing may offer there are already quantum computers out there but it's a bit like the situation with regular computers in the 1950s big basement sized things that required a pile of PhDs operate and they still weren't very powerful typewriter like keyboard is the master control setting up data and instructions on a punch tape which in turn feeds the electronic computer there's a huge effort to make more powerful quantum computers this used to be the stuff of university physics departments but you can see the potential when you see who's in the business now it's big names like Google Microsoft IBM but it's not just about when one day one company or one lab invents this one computer it's going to be a bunch of small advances towards the kind that's commercially available reliable and can really solve some of these big problems here's the thing when we talk about quantum computing people tend to think of all singing all-powerful machine that can run any kind of program what's called a universal computer that's still a distant prospect but in the mean time there will be smaller machines more specific purpose less general purpose these things are incredibly hard to run they're held at temperatures lower than that of deep space in very very controlled laboratory environments even if you could just pick one up off the shelf you wouldn't yes they're incredibly powerful for some kinds of problems but they're not going to replace the kind of computer on your desk or in your phone you don't need quantum powers to edit photos or send emails in fact what will probably happen is that a few companies have the best computers and you can use them on a kind of timeshare basis in the cloud or you send off your gnarly quantum problem and just get an answer back but the kinds of problems that we'll be able to pose the kinds of answers we'll be able to get are absolutely unthinkable now and that's what has governments industry giants and plucky startups in on the race
