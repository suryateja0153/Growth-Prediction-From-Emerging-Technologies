 so i was a student of the kisket global summer school program i had no idea that the kiskat community was so huge it was a huge motivation for me as a new student summer school wasn't just a place to live it was a campus-like experience connecting with students from different backgrounds and from different parts of the world was certainly the most amazing thing about the summer [Music] school it was an amazing experience the lecture started from very basics and went up to very advanced it filled up all the gray areas that a beginner might have really gave me the tools to extend my studies in this field we played a lot of fun games had quizzes met a lot of new people i also like talking to people in this huge display server just has really inspired me to continue learning as an undergraduate student in a small university in a developing country i don't have many opportunities to work with actual quantum computers but i understand now that i can contribute to the kiskit community i can participate write my own code run this code on actual content computers this summer school has shown that quantum computing can get students like me excited enough to wake up at 8am in the summer to watch three-hour lectures and do labs every day the motivation was something that i really didn't expect from an online summer school it's a very new field there weren't a lot of resources available at the very very early stages of my career knowing that i have a community that i can rely on was way more valuable than any kind of theoretical summer school you could ever go to i think this summer school has set a gold standard for all future online events to follow thank you [Music] um you
