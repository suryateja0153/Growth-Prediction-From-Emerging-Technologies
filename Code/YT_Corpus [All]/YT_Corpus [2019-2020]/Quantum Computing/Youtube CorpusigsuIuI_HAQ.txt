 hi everybody i know i promised i would tell you what it takes to solve the measurement problem in quantum mechanics but then i remember that almost one of two physicists believes that the problem does not exist to begin with so i figured i should first make sure everyone even the physicists understand why the measurement problem has remained unsolved despite a century of effort this also means that if you watch this video to the end you will understand what half of physicists do not understand that about half of physicists do not understand the measurement problem it's not just anecdotal evidence that's polar results from 2016. please check the information below the video for the reference this questionnaire was sent to a little more than 1 200 physicists from which about 12 responded that's a decent response rate for a survey but note that the sample may not be representative for the global community while the questionnaire were sent to physicists of all research areas 44 of them were danish with those warnings ahead a stunning 17 percent of the survey respondents said the measurement problem is a pseudo problem even worse 29 erroneously think it has been solved by the coherence so this is what i want to explain today what is the coherence and what does it have to do with quantum measurements for this video i will assume that you know the bra cat notation for wave functions if you do not know it please watch my earlier video in quantum mechanics we describe a system by a wave function that is a vector and can be expanded in a basis which is a set of vectors of length one the wave function is usually denoted with the greek letter psi i will just label the basis vectors with numbers a key feature of quantum mechanics is that the coefficients in the expansion of the wave function for which i use the letter a can be complex numbers technically there can be infinitely many basis vectors but that's a complication we will not have to deal with here we will just look at the simplest possible case that of two basis vectors it is common to use basis vectors which describe possible measurement outcomes and we will do the same so 1 and 2 stand for two values of an observable that you could measure the example that physicists typically have in mind for this are two different spin values of a particle say plus one and minus one but the basis vectors could also describe something else that you measure for example two different energy levels of an atom or two different sides of a detector or what have you once you have expanded the wave function in the basis belonging to the measurement outcomes then the square of the coefficients for a basis vector gives you the probability of getting the measurement outcome this is bond's rule so if a coefficient was 1 over square root 2 then the square is one half which means a 50 probability of finding this measurement outcome since the probabilities have to add up to 100 percent this means the absolute squares of the coefficients have to add up to one with these two basis vectors you can describe a superposition which is a sum with factors in front of them for more about superpositions please watch my earlier video the weird thing about quantum mechanics now is that if you have a state that is in a superposition of possible measurement outcomes say spin plus 1 and spin one you never measure that superposition you only measure either one or the other as example let us use a superposition that is with equal probability in one of the possible measurement outcomes then the factor for each basis vector has to be the square root of one half but this is quantum mechanics so let us not forget that the coefficients are complex numbers to take this into account we will put in another factor here which is a complex number with absolute value equal to one we can write any such complex number as e to the i times theta where theta is a real number the reason for doing this is that such a complex number does not change anything about the probability of getting one of the two measurement outcomes see if we ask what is the probability of finding this superposition in state 2 then this would be 1 over square root of 2 times e to the i theta times the complex conjugate which is 1 over square root 2 times e to the minus i theta and that comes out to be one half regardless of what theta is this theta is also called the phase of the wave function because you can decompose the complex number into a sine and a cosine and then it appears in the argument where a phase normally appears for an oscillation there isn't anything oscillating here though because there's no time dependence you could put another such complex number in front of the other coefficient but this does not change anything about the following okay so now we have this superposition that we never measure the idea of the coherence is now to take into account that the superposition is not the only thing in our system we prepare a state at some initial time and then it travels to the detector a detector is basically a device that amplifies a signal a little quantum particle comes in one end and a number comes out the other end this necessarily means that the superposition which we want to measure interacts with many other particles both along the way to the detector and in the detector this is what you want to describe with the coherence the easiest way to describe these constant little bumps that the superposition has to endure is that each bump changes the face of the state so the theta by a tiny little bit to see what effect this has if you do a great many of these little bumps we first have to calculate the density matrix of the wave function it will become clear later why as i explained in my previous video the density matrix usually denoted with the greek letter rho is the cat bra product of the wave function with itself for the simple case of our superposition the density matrix looks like this it has 1 over 2 in each entry because of all the square roots of 2 and the off-diagonal elements also have this complex factor with the phase the idea of decoherence is then to say that each time the particle bumps into some other particle this phase randomly changes and what you actually measure is the average over all those random changes so understanding the coherence comes down to averaging this complex number to see what goes on it helps to draw the complex plane here is the complex plane now every number with an absolute value of one lies on a circle of radius one around zero on this circle you therefore find all the numbers of the form e to the i times theta with theta a real number if you turn theta from zero to two pi you go once around the circle that's euler's formula basically the whole magic of the coherence is now in the following inside if you randomly select points on this circle and average over them then the average will not lie on the circle instead it will converge to the middle of the circle which is at zero so if you average over all the random kicks you get zero the easiest way to see this is to think of the random points as little masses and the average as the center of mass now let us look at the density matrix again we just learned that if you average over the random kicks then these off-diagonal entries go to zero nothing happens with the diagonal entries that's the coherence the reason this is called decoherence is that the random changes to the phase destroy the ability of the state to make an interference pattern with itself if you randomly shift around the face of a wave you don't get any pattern a state that has a well-defined face and can interfere with itself is called coherent but the terminology is not the interesting bit the interesting bit is what has happened with the density matrix i know this looks utterly unremarkable it's just a matrix with one over twos on the diagonal but what's interesting about it is that there is no wave function that will give you this density matrix to see this look again at the density matrix for an arbitrary wave function in two dimensions now take for example this off-diagonal entry if this entry is zero then one of these coefficients has to be zero but then one of the diagonal entries is also zero which is not what the decohered density matrix looks like so the matrix that we got after the coherence no longer corresponds to a wave function that's why we use density matrices in the first place every wave function gives you a density matrix but not every density matrix gives you a wave function if you want to describe how a system loses coherence you therefore need to use density matrices what does this density matrix after the coherence describe it describes classical probabilities the diagonal entries tell you the probability for each of the possible measurement outcomes like in quantum mechanics but all the quantumness of the system that was in the ability of the wave function to interfere with itself have gone away with the off-diagonal entries so decoherence converts quantum probabilities to classical probabilities it therefore explains why we never observe any strange quantum behavior in everyday life it's because this quantum behavior goes away very quickly with all the many interactions that every particle constantly has whether or not you measure them the coherence gives you the right classical probabilities but it does not tell you what happens with the system itself to see this keep in mind that the density matrix in general does not describe a collection of particles or a sequence of measurements it might well just describe one single particle and after you have measured the particle it is with probability one either in one state or in the other but this would correspond to a density matrix which has one diagonal entry that is one and all other entries zero the state after measurement is not in a 50 50 probability state that's just not a thing so the coherence does not actually tell you what happens with the system itself when you measure it it merely gives you probabilities for what you observe this is why the coherence only partially solves the measurement problem it tells you why we do not normally observe quantum effects for large objects it does not tell you however how it happens that a particle ends up in one and only one possible measurement outcome the best way to understand a new subject is to actively engage with it and as much as i love doing these videos this is
