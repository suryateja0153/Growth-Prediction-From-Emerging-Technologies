 i think if you ask anyone in the field for a good place to start you'll start hearing some repeated suggestions um so when i started and asked this question of what book to use people recommended this um you've probably seen this book all over the internet it's michael nielsen and isaac chuang it's called quantum computation and quantum information and it's effectively the the standard book of the field it was written at least a version that i have in 2010 and it has all the information up to date up to that time some of it is outdated and especially the physical implementation part but the key thing to know about this book is that it's not just about the hardware it's also kind of the bible of the field so it has good introduction to quantum information theory it has good introduction to the fundamentals that you need to learn a very nice comprehensive section on the linear algebra prerequisites that you need and so on so there are many times when you'll need to come back to this book at some point in your career so if you do need uh if you do need to buy one or two books i strongly recommend getting a copy of uh the book by michael nielsen and isaac tron uh people affectionately affectionately call it mike and ike so that's another search term that you might see in the discussions about the book personally when i was learning um i found mike and ike to be a bit overwhelming so my favorite book for learning was this one let me just put it on the screen so that you can see it it's called quantum computer science and it's by uh merman so i really like merman's book um i find myself going back to it because that's the book i use to teach myself a lot of these concepts and also because it has a very nice succinct way of explaining things it's not trying to be a bible of the field it's trying to get you a very good set of core materials that you need so that then you can graduate to reading something like mike and ike's book also as a beginner i don't know about you but when i see this comparison the choice is kind of immediately obvious to me so these are the two books that i keep coming back to i wanted to show you a couple of other books um so this one is highly praised by a lot of people i think it's worth it's worth seeing this as well looking through it i'm seeing that it has a very nice way of presenting things for anyone with a background that has to do with either electrical engineering or computer science and so it's a very good reference to look through in case you're deciding to buy one of these books and finally more recently a book that i discovered and i'm starting to go through is this one um this one is more of a so for me personally it's called picturing quantum processes it's a very interesting book because i think it has the potential to change how we teach quantum computing and generally how we teach quantum mechanics it's trying to show you how to do all of these things how to walk through quantum circuits all these manipulations in a visual way so it's making basically a new language like here's a random page that i found where it's trying to teach you how to do things by drawing these lines so different kinds of features of quantum circuits become apparent when you have this kind of new way of teaching the material as you're going through all of these books something that something that's not immediately obvious even at the time when i was learning mike and ike and merman's book were available all of these books are still kind of write down and understand things on paper kinds of books i generally learn a lot when i'm programming so the the reason why we also have put in a lot of effort into the kiskit textbook is to make sure that all of you can also be programming and practicing on the real systems as you're learning so the kisket textbook gets a lot of its influence from merman's book um so it's really trying to match merman's book which i think is appropriate for an undergraduate level and the key thing is that as you're learning about the hardware you get more insights than than you would if you just as you're programming than you would if you were just reading through the physics of the devices so i think it's an interesting kind of way to couple your learning whichever book you do with something online that allows you to learn things from uh from running them on real devices so strong recommendation of all of these references and i see a lot of people in the field also talking about them so i'll stop the discussion about the uh the discussion about the books here and maybe answer a few questions before going back into the lecture yeah we have some questions a lot of great questions rolling in the top one we have right now is there any historical reason why the non-inverted quantum fourier transform is equivalent to the inverted discrete fourier transform uh as someone who i'm an electrical engineer and having seen even the standard fourier transform written with the plus and minus in many different notations i honestly don't even have a clear view of what is the standard anymore so i don't think it's uh i don't think it's fair to kind of assume one is the standard against the other um maybe that's just the way i've learned things um we can take another question brian sure um another question we had i i know i saw this in the chat and that it was uh tried to put into the q a i'm sorry i don't see it on here so i apologize that it didn't get uploaded so we'll just go with the next upvoted is it likely to consider the wavelet transform for shore's algorithm and i think maybe there's a grammatical thing there but they're asking about using the wavelet transform in shortest algorithm sure um i personally am not aware of a wavelet transform uh at least a quantum version of it um i so i'll say for this question let's pause until the end of the the discussion and we can maybe look for some references to get to people that might be pedagogical great thanks very much yeah thank you uh are we ready to go back into the lecture i'd say let's dive back in let's get to uh the final part of the lecture here awesome so all right let me get my pen in a different color so so far let's do a quick recap of what we've learned so far so part one of today's lecture we did a quick review of the materials you've learned so far and we learned how to apply and implement the quantum for a transform and we also saw a demo in kiskit and i think one of the key takeaways i hope is that all of you have have seen how easy it is to build out these quantum circuits there's nothing complicated about them in general given the amount of the amount of material we've covered i think it's important to emphasize a couple of things just tricks that are worth keeping in your mind for future um for future applications as well you might remember we wrote down the hadamard applied on on a bit on a qubit with one qubit is zero plus e to the two pi i x j over two 1 and you saw how to use hadamard and these u rotations with some power up to them so the u-rotation gate if you remember applies a phase e to the 2 pi i over 2 to the power of k the hadamard one is simply the the 2 to the power of 1 version of this onto one so we use these gates in order to build out a quantum fourier transform now this is this is all interesting um and it would be an exercise in mathematics if we didn't discuss why all of this matters in the first place so let's let's go with uh let's go with the following so part two of today's lecture is going to talk about quantum phase estimation and i want to point out that this is also the cover uh the material covered in today's lab i think you have a very fun lab today where you can figure out exactly how to solve a problem like the examples we're about to discuss now so we talked about the quantum fourier transform and motivated it by saying it's really a change in basis from computational to fourier basis and we showed that it's it's our way of building out shore's algorithm and finding periodicity in some way i'd like to show you uh how we implement a quantum phase estimation algorithm which is interesting in its own right and how the quantum fourier transform fits into this big picture so let's uh let's uh talk about the quantum phase estimation but the key takeaway that i want you to get from this is that here we are using qft to do something useful and i'll motivate what that useful thing is but notice how in three days in this summer school you've gone from not just learning about these quantum algorithms but to now zooming out and using these algorithms as black boxes and other bigger things so now you're about to use qft to do something else all right and this this presentation that i'm going to give you is relevant in many different fields so it might not seem relevant at first but it's actually a very important problem to be able to know how to solve let me let me tell you what the problem is that we're solving here so problem remember that a unitary matrix we said this at the beginning of the lecture remember that a unitary matrix has eigenvalues of the form e to the i theta right you remember this from the beginning of the lecture and that it has what did we say about the eigenvectors so eigenvectors that form orthonormal basis and that's just a very fancy way of saying if there are two unique eigenvectors they're orthogonal to each other so what does this mean let me remind you again if i have a unitary u and this is one of its uh this is one of its eigenstates an eigenvector then the operation of u on that eigenvector is to apply some phase that depends on which eigenvector we're using so the question that we're trying to solve is can we extract this phase theta psi given the ability to prepare psi itself in other words if i can if i have accessible some quantum circuit that's able to prepare psi for me and i'm able and the ability to apply you itself first of all i want you to pause here and think about how you would even attack this problem i'm asking you to find a global phase here think about what what what it means to measure a global phase if i told you the following state zero plus one with the one over square root of two coefficient on it and i asked you to measure the state what would be the outcomes you can you can type the outcomes that you expect in the chat but i hope it's very clear to you now that the outcomes are either zero with probability one-half and one with probability one-half that's not too surprising right okay so let me give you a different state here's another one 1 over square root of 2 of 0 plus 1 with a coefficient out here called e to the maybe i don't know i pi over 2. what are the outcomes of measuring this date i'll wait a few seconds for everyone to make some guesses i hope it's not surprising to you because we have to take the absolute value remember so the norm of e to the i pi over 2 over square root of 2 so not norm let's put squared is just one over two so it's still zero and one again right and zero and one again with probability one half so it's the same as the first one you're right all of your writing it's the same as the first one you're all right but look at look at what i just did i've applied this global phase here and this shows you the difficulty of applying a global phase and being able to measure it out right well what i'm telling you here is that if that global phase was applied by some unitary operator i can use a quantum phase estimation algorithm to find that global phase so i have a trick for being able to find that global phase in this specific constraint where it's being applied by some unitary so let me show you how you do that because i don't think it's when you're learning this the first time it's not a trivial process to be able to measure a phase like this so the solution to can we extract um the theta phi uh the theta psi given the ability to prepare sai is yes and we're going to use the quantum phase estimation algorithm but before we get into how the quantum phase estimation works why do we even care if you remember at the beginning when i was talking about um unitary matrices and hermesian matrices i mentioned to you that the two are related i'll just point out here that the the kinds of things that we can measure the kinds of uh things that represent uh real physical systems are operators that are hermitian and time evolution of those systems is unitary so hamiltonian evolution so evolution [Music] time evolution of real systems is unitary and this has implications for quantum stimulation so if we're able to do this there are many things that we can enable ourselves to do in the field of quantum stimulation just a bit of motivation so that you see you see exactly what you see exactly what we're about to do here okay so let's jump into it how would i measure that phase i want you to see something called the quantum phase estimation which i'll call qpe from now on the qpe trick is the following so remember i have the ability to prepare psi and i have the ability to apply you all right so let's use the following circuit i'm going to start off in the state 0 for this qubit i'm going to apply a hadamard here to that qubit and then i am going to i don't even know how many qubits psi is i'm just going to prepare it so there was something else that allowed me to prepare it and i'm going to apply the unitary operator u on side and the way i'm going to do that is by controlling it on that top qubit and then i'm going to apply a hadamard again and we have the wires that come out here so this is a controlled u operator i want to show you now what this circuit is doing it's a very nice demonstration of the qpe trick so let's go through it very quickly at this point you've seen how we go through these circuits so you're all experts at doing this so let's walk through it else this is step zero one two and three step zero what do we have we have zero on the first qubit and psi in the second sets of qubits okay step one we apply the hadamard to that first cubit so it turned into 1 over square root 2 of 0 plus 1. and psi is still out there unaffected so i'm going to distribute this so that you see things very clearly it's 1 over square root 2f 0 psi plus one psi okay step two what happened just before step two we applied this control unitary right what does the control unitary do it does nothing if the control is zero but it applies the unitary if the control is one so we end up with one over square root of two of zero psi because the control is zero nothing happened or one and then the unitary is applied and when the unitary is applied remember it applies a phase so that's what happened at step two all right so that's step two uh what happens at step three at step three we apply another hadamard uh i'll spare you the calculation uh it's very easy to look through it right the zero turns into zero plus one and that gets multiplied by side the one turns into zero minus one [Music] with an e to the i theta psi in front of it here if you collect all the terms what you end up with is something that looks like this so the square root of two's multiply and you have half i'll factor out the first qubit to be zero one plus e to the i theta psi and i'll factor out one and you have one minus e to the i theta psi i hope you're getting excited because you can immediately see the impact of this right so what does what what is the probability of measuring zero in the first cubic so in other words if i put a meter here to measure that first cubit what is the probability of measuring zero the probability of measuring zero is the following so it's exactly this with the half in front of it so it's half 1 plus e to the i theta sine absolute value squared and the probability of measuring 1 is half 1 minus so that's this minus e to the i theta psi squared so what does this mean it's almost half for both of them but there's a small factor here that makes them differ from half so for example if um if that angle is is one degree let's say so if the phase that's being applied by that unitary is one degree then the probability of measuring zero and the probability of measuring 1 are respectively 0.9999 and 7.6 times 10 to the minus 5. okay so if theta psi is 10 degrees the probability of measuring zero and the probability of measuring one are 0.9924 and 0.007596 all of this is to tell you now in the difference between the probability of measuring 0 or 1 you've encoded that phase in other words you've taken that phase information and turned it into an amplitude that you can measure so how would you do this experimentally you would do let's say a million shots of this experiment you do it over and over again you would collect statistics and you try to see what that statistic says how many times did i get zero how many times did i get one and you would hope that the difference in the statistics between 0 and 1 would allow you to back out theta now notice how painful this experiment is to do though because we're using only one qubit here let me show you again we're using one qubit and the information the amplitude is coming from that one qubit in order for us to understand what the phase is in order to do uh a much more precise measurement so this experiment uses one qubit to measure theta psi a better set up is to get more precision by using more qubits so this is the going to be the interesting thing that we're going to do so the picture turns from the previous one where i've used only one qubit to a different one which is going to be several qubits let's say they're all prepared in the zero state they all get hadamards applied to them so i'll put hadamard with with n here and you have psi and you have the ability to now so you have several qubits here so we're going to apply u to some power 2 to the power of n minus 1 from the very top qubit controlled u to the power of 2 to the n minus 2 coming from the second qubit and so on until from the last qubit you apply u to the power of two to the zero and that's the end qubit extension of the picture that we saw earlier so let's look at what happens in this circuit so let me finish drawing these wires uh and there are many of these wires in the middle here okay so notice how we've now extended uh the picture to have n measurement qubits is what people call them [Music] and people call this one the target state and remember i mentioned before one of the requirements of this algorithm is the ability to prepare psy so we haven't even talked about how i'm going to prepare psy yet there's another circuit that probably was used to prepare psy and that was just given to me so that's our assumption here okay so let's look as before i'm going to do step 0 here i'm going to do step 1 here and eventually i'm going to do i'm going to try to figure out what is this state there all right so this part is um is a is a very interesting thing to walk through and i think you'll see something very cool coming out of it step zero what happens step zero we started off in the state 0 for n qubits and psi step 1 all of the qubits are in the superposition state 1 over square root 2 of 0 plus 1. so i will multiply all of them together all of the coefficients at least one over square root of two to the power of n and then zero plus one to the power of n that's just my way of shortly writing that they're all in the zero plus one state and you have psi in the second register okay now i'd like to point out something very important to you before we apply this gate let's talk about what u to the 2 to the power of x on psi does because all we have is just a series of different x's once we learn how to do this u to the 2 to the power of x can be written down as u 2 to the power of x minus 1 so i'll subtract 1 here from the power and apply u once directly right that's exactly what that is i just took out one of those u's and applied it separately well what is that that's u of psi is actually e to the i theta psi of psi right now i'm going to move this constant out here and apply this again and i'm going to subtract off one power so it's going to be equal to e to the i theta psi from the first application e to the i theta psi from the second application u to the 2 to the power of x minus 2 of psi okay that's fine now let's keep doing this over and over again so notice how you have two factors out here if you do this for all of the factors what you're going to see is effectively going to look like so step final remember you have these controlled operations from different qubits so what you end up with is is a state that looks like 1 over square root 2 to the power of n which is exactly what you had before for the first qubit you get 0 plus e to the i theta psi times 2 to the power of n minus 1 right you get all of the powers of 2 coming in so this power is here and that's exactly this power applied on one for the second qubit you get 0 plus e to the i theta psi with 2 to the power of what n minus 2 1. and so on until for the very last one you have 2 to the power of 0 which is exactly going to show up here i theta side two to the power of zero one so how cool is this one thing i want to show you now is something you've seen before i'm going to write it out here explicitly let's compare this expression with qft i'll remind you again what qft looks like x tilde looks like 1 over square root of n which is one over square root of two to the power of n zero plus e to the two pi i x over two to the power of one one zero plus e to the 2 pi i x over 2 to the power of 2 1 going all the way to 0 plus e to the 2 pi i x over 2 to the n one do you notice anything between these two so first of all the forms of them are very similar the difference between them is that here in the quantum phase estimation one you have same as qft except we have that theta psi replaced by theta psi divided by 2 to the power of n with a 2 pi coefficient in front of it right so let me highlight these for you so orange here notice these two pi powers don't appear anywhere here and also notice that the coefficients so i'll use a different color in the denominator here but they actually appear in the numerator here and the only reason that happened is because we had a dividing factor here so all of this is exactly like um exactly like writing out the quantum fourier transform with a different phase so uh let me let me write out psi here because it's missing to be frank i don't actually care about psy here what really matters is what's happening in those first set of qubits so i'm going to go back and suggest that we do the following it seems like what we have here is actually the qft of something and in fact what is it the qftf it's a qft where we have taken exactly this kind of uh this kind of phase right so if i apply here instead of a qft a box called qft inverse i can undo the qft that happened and what i expect to see out here is the state 2 to the n times theta psi now the reason why we see that 2 to the n times theta psi is exactly because of this mismatch between the two so i hope this shows you the the reason why we learned about the qft right you are able to use an entirely different procedure that looks like this all of this and what it's doing is effectively generating the qft of something so what you're doing then is applying the inverse qft of this exact uh this exact expression which ends up when you measure giving you the state 2 to the power of n times theta psi now before we before we conclude um i would like to point out something very important here what was the reason we came down this path the reason we came down this path is because we noticed that there was one qubit here in this set of qubits and we didn't have enough precision to do our measurement notice how in this particular case we've multiplied that phase by a power of 2 to the power of n so instead of needing to do lots and lots of shots what we've done is instead multiply the phase that we're looking for by 2 to the power of n which gives us more precision right if i had for example n to be 10 2 to the power of 10 is roughly 1024 if i were able to multiply these two numbers by a thousand what are the numbers that come out one of them is 99 992.4 and one of them is 7.596 it's much easier to tell the difference between these two numbers especially if you have signal to noise limitations than it is between these two numbers so that's the value of doing this measurement by using more qubits in order to gain more precision more fundamentally though you've just learned a very important insight which is that now you're able to use quantum phase estimation to measure global phases uh when those global phases come from unitary operators and are applied on the eigenstates of those unitary operators and the cool part of everything that you've done is that now you've generated the qft so you can undo that qft with an inverse qft here so i want to motivate i want to leave things here and motivate the lab for this afternoon you're going to work with a specific example where theta is going to be 0.5 so it's a small number and n is going to be 5 qubits so lab 3 is going to use these numbers and you're going to see if you can back out exactly what theta is by using 5 qubits i encourage you also in that notebook to um to change the number of qubits and to see what effect that has so i'm promising you here that fewer qubits means fewer lesser precision as i've showed you but i think that's an experiment that you can also try out in today's lab so i'll pause here um having motivated today's lab and just tell you this is exactly the amount of prerequisite material you need to be able to talk about uh to be able to talk about quantum quantum algorithms in general and more specifically to talk about schwarz algorithm tomorrow so let's pause here and take some closing questions before we finish today's lecture so brian are there any questions that we can take in the last uh 14 minutes sure thing so one that i want to highlight here at the beginning is something that was actually really awesome to see happen in the chat this is a question from max i'm going to read the question and then give you a little bit more context before you answer it question is could the qft circuit be built such that the output is not reversed and what i noticed in the chat was max and a lot of other people were talking back and forth about this exact question and ended up getting pretty far down the path of figuring out what the answer might be so just want to highlight everyone that was a part of that conversation this is exactly why we're doing this school we love to see the community coming together like this working with each other but also having professionals uh and experts around to help give you some guidance so with that abe i'll let you answer the question could the qft circuit be built such that the output is not reversed i think the easiest way to build a qft is to do exactly the reversed uh ordering and just do swaps at the end there's no reason to worry about the reverse ordering so long as you're able to apply swap gates simple as that yep there's no reason to complicate it it's a very simple exercise another question we had uh that came through was why did you use the controlled version of you rock k in the implementation and not just you rock k ah okay that's a very good question uh let me remind you again um the the hints that i wrote down um i'll bring them back up maybe if i can find them wow we wrote a lot of notes today it looks like um yes so here are the hints so notice that i showed you the phases that are applied on each of these states as i was thinking about how to build out the circuit notice that the the way the the way the qubits are applied matters for the phases that come into the front right so there's there's no difference between these two states other than the fact that one is applied on the last qubit here and on the second to last qubit here but it looks like a different phase is applied because of that that gives me a hint that what i want is actually not something that is independent of which qubit it's coming from but dependent so that's why i wrote down the phase is qubit dependent uh and the other aspect to it that helped us figure out what the circuit would look like is the fact that when you have more once you seem to be increasing the phase right or at least the terms that you add in the phase so this is this is the key intuition that allows constructing that circuit as you've seen before awesome and then one last question i think for today again thank you to everyone that was in the comments helping to answer people or provide links where they were needed uh one last question during the qft what what happens if x is in superposition going into the quantum fourier transform what happens if x is in super oh let me remind you again the quantum free the quantum fourier transform expression that we derive does not care about what x is doing um so long as we can write it down in this way but there are hadamards that meet you here so we've written down individual bits here so zeros and ones and that's going to be the framework that we deal with so we're going to start with states like that but i would actually flip the question back to you and say why don't you write out the qft why don't you write out the qft and kiskit and see what happens when you insert superpositions what you should expect to see at least for that first qubit that i'm pointing out here is that you have a hadamard that meets you exactly as you start your work which means that will take you back from superposition back to the computational basis so just just think about that as your ex as you're getting the hint to what the answer to this question might be
