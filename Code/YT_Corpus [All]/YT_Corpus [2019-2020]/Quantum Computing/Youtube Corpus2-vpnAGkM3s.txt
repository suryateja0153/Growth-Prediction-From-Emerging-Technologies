 Thank You cam and it is my pleasure to be here back at Duke University virtually taking you through a journey of quantum computing my name is Alex Khan I am actually a MBA from Duke and also I got the health sector management certificate from Duke University so it is almost my 15th anniversary for my MBA so it's a real pleasure to be here all right so please stop me as you know if you have questions this is you know this is really for you we'll be covering a lot of topics in quantum computing I will give you a sense of what quantum computers are and the level of their progress we will also look at the power of quantum computing and the dark side of this technology if you do not have much familiarity with this topic this will be a lot of information but hold tight I will take you through this step-by-step in the end you should have enough familiarity to be able to dig deeper and have conversations on this topic if it comes up at work let's go back to 73 years to 1947 in New Jersey the first transistor has just been made at Bell Labs by Bill shortly Walter breton and John Beaton after many painstaking experiments between physicists chemists material scientists but not much attention is given to this Bell announcement except a small article in the New York Times in the Time magazine however certain labs and researchers even as far as Japan are paying attention and trying to replicate the results there are only a handful of people who see the value of this new technology that will replace the older vacuum tubes that were used to amplify sound signals on the bell telephone lines and in large room size adding machines so the diagram on diagram above shows the first transistor a few wires sticking out of a germanium crystal however this innovation would revolutionize the computing industry over the next several decades two engineers from Japan licensed the new technology from laughs and started working on their own to make smaller transistor radios and became the stonee company and they could not keep up with the demand Texas Instruments also started selling radios in the mid 50's but were not profitable due to the high transistor failure rate there was still a lot of technical challenges to make an actual circuit and shortly move to his childhood suburb in Palo Alto near Stanford University where he created the shortly semiconductor company this was the beginning of what is now known as Silicon Valley so what is a transistor basically a transistor shown at the bottom left is made of three layers of material this can be silicon germanium indium and various oxides however the goal is to create an amplified current in the two output wires C and E when the middle one B has an a has a small voltage applied to it thus one can use a transistor to represent a switch that you can turn on or off as needed when there is no output current the circuit is off and we represent that as a zero and when there is an output current the circuit is on and we represent that as a one thus we can use a single transistor as a unit of binary information zero or one called the bit as the technology improved transistors became more stable didn't break and were embedded in casings to create larger circuits this led to the ability to embed logic for example and or not an odd operation as shown in number two here turns an on or one into an off or zero or zero into a one a core set of logic gates that can be used to create any arithmetic or operations that we might need is called a universal gate set and the word universal will come up later on thus larger circuits like the adder shown in three we'll created out of gates this led to integrated circuit chips shown at four right here where many transistor transistors are used to create carry out binary logic and arithmetic on many bits of data stored in registers of memory the main component is called the central processing unit or the CPU an image of the Intel 4040 CPU is shown above and was produced in 1974 later as computer needs increased a chip manufacturers like Intel started adding multiple core processors into one CPU as shown and five now we have multi-core CPUs with billions of transistors along with graphical processing units or GPUs number six shows motherboard where various processes that are attached and this includes hard drives our RAM and in other components all right any questions you everyone's good with this all right so early in the evolution of computers Gordon Moore who was the founder of Intel noticed that they could double the number of transistors every two years this became known as Moore's law and held for the last 50 plus years by the mid seventies intel had already created chips like the Intel 8080 with about 5,000 transistors in the next two years they were at 10,000 transistors the graph shows how Intel and other chip manufacturers continued to improve the fabrication technology to develop transistors on smaller and smaller scales new technology breakthroughs were needed at every step but those who overcome and more and more transistors were squeezed into a square inch of silicon wafer now traditional semiconductor scaling will end 2024 currently transistors are 10 to 20 nanometers in scale and IBM I just saw just created a 5 nanometer chip this year however transistors are now arranged in a vertical fin structure at this point as this is are so small that quantum effects become relevant forcing reengineering manufacturers yes so you know it's a transistor if you look at the transistor picture it's got three different elements in it and over time they've been making it smaller and smaller and smaller to the point where the the ten middle layer which is which is really where the electrons transition has become so thin that quantum mechanical effects which is called tunneling actually takes place so tunneling basically you can imagine if you have a barrier and especially for a switch you want the barrier to stay there when you want it off and the barrier to be removed when you want it on but when you get down to the quantum mechanical level you have an effect called tunneling because electrons are actually waves and they spread out so they actually go past this barrier so in effect when you get too small you are now dealing with quantum mechanics and you can't really stop an electron from you know moving across all right exactly and you don't want it to move across I mean you want it to move when you want it to move you want to control that so you're basically in essence losing your ability to control a transistor as you get too small so what they're doing is that the transistors aren't flat anymore they still need enough of that middle layer so they're making it vertical in order to still have that layer but and then there's their instead of having n P and like this they're making it vertical with n PN on top and so now they have to fabricate chips into these 3-dimensional structures so more engineering and more complexity and I think I read an article that said that customers are actually finding the chip manufacturers are getting slower and slower and delaying their new releases which might be slowing down Moore's law um yes I mean you can there are different there are different ways of measuring it of course as you scale down and there's you know scaling is a factor you get four times as much computing power so if you see another chart you'll see you know computing power it would be four times but it's still scaling up the same way so some researchers are using carbon nanotubes and molybdenum disulphide transistors to allow them to go smaller but it is very clear that for computing to continue to make progress according to Moore's law there will need to be continued innovation and jumps to more or newer exotic mechanisms and this is where quantum computing could play a role so now imagine being at the cusp of this new technological revolution you so Richard Fineman at one of his lectures in 1981 mentions the above statement nature is in classical damage and if you want to make a stimulation of nature you'd better make it quantum mechanical and by golly it's a wonderful problem because it doesn't look so easy he was alluding to the fact that classical computers would not be able to model nature because at a fundamental level nature is quantum mechanical and highly complex only a computer made of quantum mechanical properties would be able to just stimulate nature we reduce the complexity in our mathematics or in processing requirements when we are simulating things like molecules or fluids to derive solutions that are good enough approximation of reality however what we are finding now is that by using the behavior of quantum mechanics it is possible to build computers that inherit some of these properties and allow us to reduce the scale and power needs but also give us exponential or computational power needed to solve our most complex problems there are some findings that even some biological processes leverage quantum mechanics there has been some papers that claim that photosynthesis in some bacteria uses properties of quantum superposition to efficiently transfer the light energy to the reaction center and our data processing requirements continue to continue to increase with needs for new drug discovery machine learning ai optimizing satellites reducing traffic congestion making airplanes more efficient and continuing to keep our data and communication secure the and meeting energy needs of the planet sure I can you know give you a little bit right now you know we already know that there are some problems we cannot solve with classical computers complexity theory basically divides up problems in different categories so most of our problems that we can solve are called P problems and they they they grow polynomial e with the number of elements so you know you take a network and you have ten people in the network and you have a hundred people in a network then you have a thousand and so on when you're trying to calculate something like their interactions that problem will grow exponentially so those kind of problems are beyond this polynomial expansion they're called they call NP problems where they grow faster than polynomial or they grow exponentially a lot of our problems whether you're looking at you know molecules or atoms in a fluid you know if you want to keep track of every satellite that's going in orbit as the number of satellites increase you're dealing with more complexity if you're looking at interactions between or communication between the satellites and you want to control something there you know those things become exponentially more complex so our computers you know as we scale it's you know you keep adding more transistors you can scale in a polynomial way but our problems are scaling is financially and it's not really the the size of the qubit or the size of the transistor that's relevant but the the ability as we'll get into the cubed over here the ability of multiple qubits to store an exponential amount of information and that's what gives us the exponential computational power so how do quantum computers work and before we really get into that it is important to wrap our heads around the concept of a qubit just like a bit was able to store 0 or 1 a qubit has the property of being in a state which is a combination of 0 and 1 or in a superposition of 0 and 1 one way to visualize this is to imagine a qubit as a pointer or an arrow technically a vector pointing from the center of a sphere which is called a block sphere in various directions around the surface of the sphere now it can point inside but that is a more complicated state and will not deal with that right now when the qubit is pointing to the North Pole and you measure it to see what value it has it always displays a zero and if pointing to the South Pole and you measure it you always get a 1 let's contrast this with a bit remember we use a transistor to create a bit and it was either a 0 or a 1 you can check by you know checking if it is off or on or if there's a voltage or not similarly in the qubit you would always measure a zero if it is pointing up and 1 if it's pointing down and this is a convention in a way to visualize so now imagine your vector is anywhere on the equator it is the same distance from the North and South Pole now if you measure it it will sometimes show a 1 and sometimes show 0 in fact it will act like a fair coin if you measure enough times you will conclude that you've got 50% zeros and 50% 1 values we say the qubit is in an equal superposition of States 0 and 1 okay now imagine your cubit starts at the North Pole that's at the zero state and you apply some energy to it so it moves only partially down the sphere now if you measure the cubit 100 times the + 25 show a 1 and 75 shows zero you conclude that the probability of zero or the zero state is 75% and the probability of one or the one state is 25% alright any questions that was a lot your if so you actually know how many possible states you could be measuring in my example you only have one qubit you would only get a 1 or a 0 so if I was to measure you know for a coin how many coin flips do you need to be convinced there's the fair coin maybe 100 but on the other hand if you have you know multiple qubits then you have hundred possible values measuring a hundred times it's not enough because you know you might only see one of your values once in a while and so you might have to do it you know thousand or ten thousand measurements to really understand you know what that state is yeah that is correct either with a regular bit you you always know what your value is however with a qubit once you measure the qubit you have lost the lost state of this qubit you know that's unfortunately the negative side of using a quantum computer yeah so there I mean there are advantages and disadvantages so when you have a qubit at the equator it's in equal superposition so it is a pure random number so even your computer the way you generate random numbers is not really a pure random number it's a pseudo-random number so some of the encryption schemes use or that are going into quantum computing are using quantum computers pure random number generation and you know there is no way to predict what the next number will be while you know with a with the student random number generator there is a chance of figuring out you know what your scheme is and and be able to decrypt that so yeah said that is definitely an advantage you cannot also clone a qubit you cannot take this state for example you know this this one over here that I have for example you cannot take this and copy it into another qubit you can't make a copy the moment you try to measure it you destroy it it's a very different you know technique or very different system that we're dealing with and it's not intuitive and it's challenging when you when you measure a qubit you basically lose the you know whatever superposition or whatever state that you had developed if you're doing calculations with the quantum computer and you're putting it in two different directions you're entangling multiple qubits but then when you measure the qubit it the act of measurement of a quantum mechanical element or particle destroys that information it's not like in the macro world where you can measure something you know how big is this or how fast something is going and you retain the property you don't really affect in the act of measurement one of the inherent infusing properties of quantum mechanics is the the very act of measurement even if it was a light measurement you're sending a photon to measure how far you know how fast the particle is moving that very act destroys that information and it's again it's fundamentals of quantum mechanics it is you know part of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle where you can only know so much information about a particle for example you cannot know the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time so you try to find the position you lose the momentum you try to find the momentum you lose the position so it's like it's a crazy world it's almost like getting into Alice in Wonderland you're getting down this rabbit hole where things don't behave the way we're used to okay so I just may want to make the point that however mathematically we can calculate exactly where the cubit is depending on what operations we run on it and amazingly quantum mechanics can be represented by linear algebra and as long as you do the math correctly you know what should happen with each qubit unless of course you have too many qubits and then you need a big computer and eventually you can't keep track of it even with a supercomputer so academically we do know what's happening but when you are when you're looking at a an actual quantum computer and you're using for example a 53 qubit quantum computer which you technically cannot keep track of mathematically on it on you know even a large server you have to have the quantum computer tell you what's happening but then you are dealing with its limitations and but mathematically we for a smaller number of qubits we can track all of the vectors and know where it's going and there's a lot of simulations out there okay so you do have to appreciate we are trying to control and manipulate spins of subatomic particles these particles are affected by the very atoms that surround them and hold them they are affected by radiation and magnetic fields in the surroundings classical computer started out with lots of laws and instabilities vacuum tube adding machines failed when the vacuum tube burnt out even early transistors had problems with wires detaching from semiconductor chips from the material chips would have low manufacturing quality where thousands would be discarded and stored so the competition could not get their hands on them but as time went on the quality of computer chips and parts increase now we expect computers to work without failure and it is quite amazing how even after millions of calculations per second no stuff fails and we get almost perfect computational power with our computers quantum technology is still very early in its evolution and qubits currently are not very stable the state of the qubit is constantly being impacted by the environment which can cause energy exchange and thus decoherence get philip kate fidelity is a term used to describe how many gate operations can be done before the information in the qubit is lost so we are limited in how many of those logical gates we can actually apply yes right and yep so the we get into Universal or gate computers versus annealing quantum computers the goal is for gate or universal quantum computers to make quantum computers that can actually do any kind of logic so yes in order to do you know our calculations like breaking RSA encryption is an example of a complicated algorithm and for that you need basically logic and lots of gate operations so we really are at that at that level where we are you know with the transistors as I was mentioning the adder the adder is a bunch of different logical gates put together that's where we're at with quantum computers we are really trying to create an adder or a multiplier you know technically it's like doing quantum Fourier transforms or certain algorithms but it's it's at that very micro level and there are programming languages but they are relying on research on how to really do these gate operations properly you okay the diagram show a visualization of how noise from the environment which can be like I mentioned back netic Fields temperature and other effects can cause the qubit to shrink or by defacing or depolarization so defacing will reduce the qubit along the equator depolarization we make the whole cubed shrink there's also amplitude damping which means the you know you had a zero and one state and now you're pretty much just seeing a zero state and the one state has kind of disappeared energy exchange from the qubit to a surrounding causes it to move from the one state to the zero State and not random noise from the environment affects the pure state we wanted even the control systems have noise and are not precise enough to [Music] so these control systems are not precise enough and therefore the qubits don't always end up where we want them they can overshoot or undershoot the location we want some of these systemic errors can be fixed by calibration however there are also special rotations that we can do that will ensure for these type of errors that the qubit arrives at the correct location other ways are to group qubits together so that if one fails it is possible to detect that failure and correct that qubit without any measurement again if you measure a qubit you destroy it so there are techniques without measuring to find out if something is gone-gone array we will talk about these logical qubits later basically the key ways for us to improve quantum computers is by is through making qubits out of stable material removing the noise from the environment improving our control mechanisms creating correcting pulses and grouping qubits into high quality logical qubits yes so yeah I really will get into you know something some of the environment that one needs to get to that level of precision so so how do we create a qubit I mentioned you can create a bit using a transistor but you can also create a bit of information using you know light bulbs on and off or raising your hand or lowering your hand or sending signals through wires like beep or no beep and use that as a to represent a one or a zero or you can use a long beep one or a short beep zero as a Morse code as in Morse code so in similar ways physicists and other researchers have found different ways to create qubits let's go through a few general examples to give you a taste of this physicists have known for a long time that subatomic particles electrons and neutrons have a property called spin it is not exactly like a spinning table but you can think of it like that when research has measured certain atoms that disco they discovered that there is a small magnetic field generated by electrons and even the nucleus you can use this property of the protons and neutrons inside the nucleus to move all of the spins in one direction and then detect the energy they transmit as they rearrange themselves this is used in magnetic resonance spectroscopy and some of the early experiments with quantum algorithms were done with these devices so I'm showing this the spin zero and one like that and again the it depends on how you're measuring it's called the basis that you're measuring and that's shown in the vertical solid line also the spin of single electrons of the outermost shell of an atom can be used as a qubit ions or charged atoms can be trapped in a magnetic field and the electrons can be moved up and down different energy levels so here I'm representing a lower energy level and a higher energy level and there's another energy level higher than that but what happens is they used designates some energy levels as zero and the one state so in ions you can the electron on the the outermost electron can be moved up and down to different energy levels to represent a zero in one state the two energy levels will behave in the same way as described on the Bloch sphere and this is used in ion trap quantum computers at ion cue and Honeywell you can also use the property of superconductivity so that's going to be down here in this case you can take special material cool it down to very cold temperatures and the material will lose its lose all its resistance to the current in other words current will freely move in that material this property is used to make a special circular or square circuit along with a small Junction called the Josephson Junction and using using the direction of the free current clockwise or anti-clockwise one can define qubits which state 0 or 1 so I'm sure clockwise or anticlockwise can be you know zero one keep in mind again that this behaves the same way as described on the Bloch sphere many of the leading companies like IBM d-wave Righetti and Google are using a type of superconducting circuit which is easy to make with existing semiconductor chip fabrication technology that is already available and has been perfected over 70 years but there are other ways to make qubits any questions okay so but there are other ways to make cubits including photons to lasers defects in a crystal like a diamond crystal with a nitrogen atom the nitrogen atom is a defect here there are unique energy levels due to the nitrogen atom that can be exploited to make qubits so when you have a nitrogen vacancy you actually get a very complex energy structure which is not the normal for just all carbon atoms and you can use that as a actually a more stable qubit however it is hard to manufacture another one is called a Marana fermion which is a particle that is its own anti particle and it's being developed by Microsoft and Purdue University however as I mentioned you can also just use linear algebra and your best computer to try creating a quantum simulator based out of where linear algebra is representing quantum mechanics and and a lot of companies have those available any questions here you you you you you you okay so so let me correct myself when in so when the cubit was in the at the equator and you measured it you get one value you get a one now you have destroyed the qubit but if you prepared it the same way again in which in other words you bring it back to the equator and then you measure it again you might get a zero or you might get a one so as long as you keep preparing it at the same way you can keep measuring it so you prepare you measure and you destroy it you prepare measure and then you destroy it again so if you keep so if you keep repeating the process you will find that you're getting random numbers sometimes you're getting a zero sometimes you're getting a one and you get 50% one and zero if it's at the equator but if it's anywhere above or below the equator if it's pointing more towards the south side which is more of a 1 then you will over time after many measurements you will conclude that you are getting more ones and less zeros so you can definitely use a qubit for a random number generator right now in fact there are chips available using qubits that can be used to generate random numbers and you cannot predict what gun number you're going to get whether you're going to get a 0 or a 1 so I think that was your first part of the question what was the second part you so cam can you repeat that yeah I I've actually seen algorithms where you can do basic math there are certain gate operations that you can implement to do addition find log numbers I don't think the research is very interested right now with can we do addition with a quantum computer because you can already do that with a classical computer and you can leverage the classical computer to add a number and then bring it into the quantum computer I think a lot of the research right now is trying to prove that there is a an advantage of a quantum computer where it can solve a problem that a classical computer cannot solve but that's not to say that once you have really good quantum computers and the gates have in and they have high gate fidelity in which me which means you could run a million different operations it's not to say that at that point people won't just put in all kinds of logic into a quantum computer which includes you know doing simple things like multiplication division and so on but I've only seen some samples of that okay thanks so let's go deeper into two kinds of superconducting quantum computers which are the most often used today and we will also talk about the ion trap which is a new type that is becoming available for for superconducting we are using semiconductors circuit board technology however there are you know some differences in the in the circuit on the top left you will see a representation of the Josephson junction so two of these so two of these are used between superconducting materials so there's a strip of superconducting material in a strip of another superconducting material and there's a Josephson Junction here and another one here it's really difficult to see but it's just a small line similarly over here there's one here and one here and then you've got a square circuit over here so two of these are used between two superconducting materials shaped in a circle or square collar squared this is kept at fifteen millikelvin for two reasons one is to bring out the superconducting properties where the current flows freely in both directions and the other is to remove the noise due to heat and vibration vibrational energy from the surrounding atoms note this temperature is just points one point zero one five Kelvin above absolute zero and thus it's also colder than the temperature of space this circuit is then used along with other control circuits and connections between the qubits so that they can be put in superposition entangled and interact with each other in with varying degrees of coupling or be manipulated in specific ways to represent gate operations so here's a diagram of the cubit shrunk down and there's 8x8 groupings of cubits over here and their various connections between them every cubit isn't really connected to every other cubit so there's some higher level of connectivity between these and then there's some connections between these groups to the other groups you know technically it's just not feasible to connect every cubit with every other cubit but that would be the ideal so in this diagram I'm showing two different kinds of quantum computers d-wave is a company in Canada that was you that use the research by a Japanese professor to create an annealing quantum computer and then IBM Google and Righetti on the other hand are using a similar technology along with control systems to create a universal quantum computer and this is a gate quantum computer so I'm going to go back to annealing so what is the kneeling in metallurgy and materials science annealing is the heat treatment that alters the physical and sometimes chemical properties of the material to reduce its hardness making it more workable it also allows certain additives to settle into the metal to create high quality alloys so in an annealing quantum computer qubits are prepared in a low energy state next any problem constraints are added as coupling strengths between the qubits then this system of qubits are exposed to changing energy configuration to a new energy state that represents the problem so in effect if this process was done carefully the qubits start from the original configuration and then end up in the lowest energy configuration of the problem in other words they end up in the minimum or typically close to the minimum of the problem we are trying to solve all right any questions there that's complicated all right so how does this help for many optimization problems or chemistry problems if you can create the energy function then you can you have an annealing quantum computer find the minimum energy which is very useful and for large optimization problems or large molecules very hard to do classically and as Ken mentioned I'm actually working on a financial optimization or financial portfolio optimization problems and you can go up to 30 assets on a classical computer but you start getting into thousands or hundreds of assets and you have covariance terms between the assets it takes you know a long time on a on a classical computer or server so the the gate computers shown in the middle over here represents the IBM v cubed chip you can actually kind of see this five different squares in there and those represent the qubits and their control systems around that these are the universal quantum computers and are designed to flip or entangled qubits in such a way that any logical operation can be performed these are technically more challenging and currently have less qubits than the annealing quantum computers the image on the right is the IBM quantum computer with its with a solution refrigerator casing removed the quantum chip is housed at the bottom all of the various tubes are used to bring control signals through the chip and take results from the chip each level from the top to bottom gets colder and colder so that the chip at the bottom is at 50 millikelvin alright so I'm going to move to the ion traps now so the bottom-left diagram here shows an ion trap it shows the magnets that hold the iron suspended a combination of their repulsive forces and the charging the changing magnetic fields keeps the ions equally positioned in a straight line as shown in this middle diagram over here you so here we have one ion in the trap the another ion and again since they repel each other they both the same charge they repel each other and and end up over there and then of course to introduce multiple ions in there and this is a diagram of a 12 12 iron ion trap and they're all kind of lit up when the ions are lit up due to emissions of a photon of light when the electron falls from the one state to the zero state it emits a photon and so it lights up and literally if you see if you can you can actually visually see the the ion and you know it's a one state of course it loses the one state when you see it and when it's not lit up they are at a zero State all right any questions there you the Google computer is a superconducting using semiconductor technology and yes iBM is the same you know it's a bit confusing quantum mechanics the the quantum mechanical properties of spin were discovered on particles but eventually what was discovered is that you can actually make a qubit out of a circuit just various other properties quantum mechanical these superconducting currents flowing in different directions so and energy levels so there's you know there's different ways to make a qubit it doesn't have to be physically an electron or a or a spin spinning electron okay [Music] you so on this chart I'm comparing the progress of classical computer with quantum computers in 9 to the top is the classical computers and the bottom is the quantum so we'll follow the yellow timeline for the classical computers and then match up with where I think we are at with quantum computers so in 1906 the vacuum tube is invented to boost signals and also act as a switch it was used in radios and vacuum tube base adding machines that were as big as a house it was around that time IBM's President Thomas Watson made the claim that I think there is a world market for maybe five computers now it is fair to say not many people would have wanted those in their house then in 1947 the transistor is created which leads to the first transistor based computer at MIT Lincoln labs in the mid 50's the first integrated circuit or chip is created in 1958 over here sorry over here leading to the first commission commercially available chip the Intel 4 0 0 4 which has 2100 transistors and that's where the blue line the blue less 19 [Music] 74 by and then by 1989 we have Intel 486 chip which has a million transistors and so on - now where we have AMD's and thread ripper or others with around 20 billion transistors right now we have about 5,000 qubit annealing quantum computers and so I've shown that way over here and around 50 to 70 cubed universal quantum computers now I've heard of larger numbers but sometimes they're announcements but we don't have access to them so I'm you know we've not played with them even though this is you know not an apples-to-apples comparison let's put the current computer around 1972 so what I'm basically saying is our quantum computers right now with about five thousand annealing qubits and you know 50 to 70 or even a hundred qubits with gate operations this you know it's about where the classical computers were in 1972 so this is very early in the evolution of computers and before many of the programming languages we now know before the internet before and definitely before any smartphones VR and AI so any questions there now I'm going to get into the quantum side so before reaching the so before reaching the time line on the quantum side over here it is important to note that quantum mechanics evolved from various observations and theories from the early 1800s to the early 1900s it started with the famous double slit experiment and blackbody radiation and cathode ray tubes leading to Max Planck describing energy packets or quanta and explanation of the photoelectric effect in 1927 Brussels at the most famous fifth Solvay conference on electrons and photons very prominent physicists were present including Paul Dirac Albert and Albert Einstein among many others there was a debate between Dirac and Einstein on the structure of quantum mechanics where Einstein did not like the law non-local interaction called entanglement and called it spooky action at a distance in any case direct kept coming back and explaining all of Einstein's challenges and though it was not official Dirac had won and the version of quantum mechanics we use now is based on his mathematical formulation no one can fully explain it but it works in fact Richard Fineman is quoted as saying I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics and there is an attitude in quantum mechanics when students try to ask their professors to try to explain quantum mechanics they are told to shut up and calculate so coming back to our timeline in 1962 Brian David Josephson produces the mathematics of Josephson Junction or the Josephson effect in 1981 richard fineman mentioned stimulating physics with a quantum computer in his lecture in 1989 Wolfgang Pauli invents the 3d quadrupole which is used to trap ions in the magnetic field and is used in the ion trap and originally in the atomic clocks in 1994 Peter shor shows I think it's down here this box over here Peter shor shows that qubits can be used to solve the factorization problem efficiently I faster and that is faster than the classical computing law of growver which is the next one over here laughs Grover creates a search algorithm two years later which shows which also shows a quantum speed-up by 1999 the d-wave company is created Mudbox here on the quantum annealing theory developed by Tadashi karo ASCII and edy show Hideyoshi nationally at Tokyo Institute of Technology and I've seen his lecture where he said when I proposed the concept of quantum annealing I never expected that someone will manufacture such a machine it's a crazy idea but they did it and they sold it so actually d-wave sold their first system for ten million to Lockheed Martin in 2010 would you like to get your hands on this machine so continuing on 2000-2009 Chad Righetti got completed with his PhD in physics and created Righetti systems in 2013 in 2015 inq was founded by Chris Monroe at University of Maryland and Johnson Kim who is a professor at Duke University their device uses the ion trap which is which was developed with the same technology as atomic clocks later IBM and others who had also been working on quantum computing internally started announcing their quantum initiatives IBM and Google are at fifty three qubits and seventy two qubits respectfully listed respectively and Intel is at 49 qubits I've seen articles of Righetti working on 128 qubits Honeywell also has an iron trap quantum computer but I don't know how many qubits that has while d-wave already announced it has released the five thousand qubit Pegasus annealing quantum computer so as you can see there has been great progress in classical computers but there is an equivalent race taking place now in quantum computers some of the advancement in our understanding of quantum mechanics and quantum algorithms have in turn helped classical computers in one case a quantum algorithm beat the best classical algorithm but then mathematicians went and changed their classical algorithms with the inspiration from new quantum techniques and turned around and beat the quantum algorithm so this back and forth going on right now toshiba has a quantum simulator that uses a classical algorithm inspired by quantum mechanics and uses classical hardware so it will be very exciting to see what happens in five ten or even twenty years and how quantum computing changes the world any questions you yeah I will get to that but yes right now the the growth has been faster than Moore's law for the number of qubits but again you have to look at whether you're talking about annealing or gate operations and there's you know there are other factors which I will get to in our last slide okay excuse me all right so why is the number of qubits important let's look at how a bid in a classical computer stores information each bit can have a value of zero one you can only store one value in it now if you have a chip with multiple bit register you can represent two to the power n binary values so if you have a register with two bits for example you can have 0 0 0 1 1 0 or 1 1 but in the register you can only store one value if you had you know three registers or three oh sorry one register with three bits you can store 0 0 0 1 up to 1 1 1 you can have the numbers over here 8 different values which is 2 to the power 3 but again you can only store one value in that register and similarly if you had a hundred bits you can still only store one value even though that would be a very large binary number now let's look at a qubit so each qubit as I said can be in a superposition of a 0 & 1 state it does stores the probability of how much 0 you have and how much 1 you have but basically you can store the value of two different states now so if you look at two qubits over here so this would be two qubits sorry this is one cubit Oh way back here one cubit and so it has 2 to the power 1 which is 2 you can have a 0 or a 1 which is basically a coin now if you had two qubits two to the power two which is four you can have the probability you can stall the states of 0 0 0 1 1 0 & 1 1 so this is similar to like a four-sided bias dice where you know will fall in one of those four places so thus with two qubits you can store four states with three qubits you can store eight possible values within the superposition of those three cubits for this you do have to have cubits that are connected to each other if not you don't get this effect perfectly there are ways to get around it but I won't get into that right now so here's the amazing thing quantum computers with 30 connected qubits so 30 is over there and [Music] the 30 connected qubits can have four billion different states which is about the size of the base pairs of the human genome so you could keep track of the values of each one of the base pairs and somehow use that to find what you're looking for that is also four times greater than the than every webpage on the Internet when you get to 64 qubits down there you are at 1.8 times 10 to the power 19 that is 2 with 19 zeros that is the number of grains of sand on earth we are already at 53 to 72 cubits so computers with their qubits in superposition have the potential to store a value for every grain of sand on earth now we are still lacking high fidelity qubits loading real-world data into qubits running long gate operations and interconnectivity between qubits but still if if you know those things worked out and you get to the last row which is 167 qubits you have the potential to have as many different value stored in superposition as the number of atoms on earth any questions by encoding the problem on two qubits either in an annealing computer through coupling terms or through gate operations on a universal quantum computer it is possible to leverage the high amount of states to produce an answer since all the states are stored in these qubits together they can be manipulated together in parallel to speed up finding solutions thus a quantum computer has some unique features that promise to give it exponential power over classical computers you okay so this is going to be the toughest slide where we're at the peak over here you I can continue if the class is you know willing to go over I've got three after this I've got three sides but I can go through quickly all right so so I'm going to go through this really quickly then I wanted to give you a flavor for how quantum computers actually work and this is for a gate operation and you know just keep in mind that this field is still in in development so if we start with all the way on the left you you Oh so at the first step the qubits are initialized to a zero state so they're all 0 usually when we start out and this one has four cubits at the state they're at the North Pole so yep so each of the arrows are going to the North Pole which is a zero state then we use the Hadamard gates which moves the qubits to the equator and now the qubits are in both 0 and 1 so since they're both 0 and 1 it represents you know any of the six numbers from 0 0 0 0 to 1 1 1 1 next we basically apply certain rotations around on these qubits so they they move around the equator we can do coupling terms where we couple the strengths between certain qubits depending on our problem we're basically trying to encode our problem into these qubits then we do a header mod again which rotates the qubits back up the north and south direction and then we measure them at the end we get some probability distribution and in this case I'm showing that we get 0 0 1 0 25 times and 0 1 0 1 75 times so that's I mean this is just a very quick example you know just to give you a flavor but all of this work is you know still being worked on and developed you you so let's let's say these qubits were actually representation of assets acid 1 as a 2 a 3 as at 4 this is the so this is so in this case which is 0 1 0 1 we would say that at least in this problem we're seeing that we want so 0 1 which is cubed 3 we want 3 and acid 3 and acid 1 and 25% of time it's saying that you want to have acid zero zero one zero so you want acid one but again there's there's a lot of manipulation that happens with classical computers right now so we we get some results we feed them through a classical computer we actually do gradient descend to move and we you know we we look at the probabilities we use that to determine where do we want to go next and use a classical computer to do great understand which you know quantum computers can do right now and then we go back in and change these parameters I've got these theta parameters in here and look at this huge multi dimension law in this case four dimensional space to see where should we measure again and through this iterative process you know they get they get a solution and I've only seen you know very few papers on financial portfolio optimization where they've used this technique and it's still being developed there's I don't think there's a perfect solution yet you so I already mentioned Grover's algorithm and so Grover's algorithm showed that quantum computers could be could do a search more efficiently than classical computers while Shor's algorithm showed that one could find factors using period or order finding more efficiently and thus break RSA encryption however the current quantum computers are not strong enough to factor a large number or even do a practical search quantum computers don't have any quantum Ram or quantum database they can be that can be used to do searches on there are ideas about this you know which are which are still in development quantum annealing we already talked about which is used to find the minimum energy and formalization problems the HH L algorithm is used to solve a linear set of equations we talked about the financial a financial portfolio optimization problem using a gate computer so in the last slide we actually showed a simplified version of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm or or Q AOA which is you know still being developed and then finally we have the variational quantum eigen solver which is another type of quantum algorithm which is used to simulate small molecules like lithium hydride and again quantum annealing has also shown that it can be used to find the lowest energy state or even larger molecules okay I'm going through quickly so I'm next and get to the next slide so dr. Harvey I think you mentioned that the class has been introduced to DSA you okay yep so it's definitely a threat to RSA and I believe I read that TSA would is actually even easier to decrypt so DSA is even more on the threat so you yep-yep-yep so yes I mean classically the classical algorithms can be improved of course quantum technology is a threat but that doesn't mean classically other solutions can't be found so in 2016 Nets publish an article that basically said that none of the major cryptographic algorithms are secure anymore including RSA and DSA as shown in this table over here but based on short-shorts algorithm it was essentially evaluated that eventually quantum computers would become strong enough to break RSA nist also solicited solicited ideas for secure communications in the post quant post quantum cryptography era these would be algorithms that might rely on quantum computers but basically they would not be able to be broken by a quantum computer or any other quantum inspired algorithm the table on the right highlights I wanted to go over this this graphic over here at the bottom real quick [Music] so assume that at some time in the future your see RSA is compromised and let's say C is 2030 now let's talk about the requirements of securing historic data in your company or government organization and that let's say that's P years does your security expects to keep all records from the last P years secure and let's say that's ten years so now hackers have been stealing data all along and have toward this information and are waiting for some method to decrypt it in the future so if you know if they have been storing this information and by 2030 they're able to to decrypt it so 2030 - and let's say your company's policy is you have to store information pass information and keep it secure for 10 years 20 30 - 10 is already 20 20 so your your data is already compromise basically you know with the with the anticipation that quantum computers would come come in in the future I will move to the next any questions there all right so this is the busy slide and it's the last one okay so let's get oriented to the axis the bottom axis shows the years starting with 2016 the left vertical axis the less left vertical axis is the number of qubits and the right vertical axis is the number of logical qubits so basically what I want you to do is when we're talking about [Music] computers that are not you know the quantum computers that are error-prone refer to the logical qubits and then you know if you get to a point where quantum computers are you know the error corrected then we can look at the the actual number of qubits over here and I'm going to say that it takes about 1,000 noisy cubits to make a high-quality cubit and that's how this table is set up so let's look at the dots at the the bottom over here on the blue the blue diagonal over here that is a current progress with annealing quantum computers even though there are many qubits they are not Universal and thus cannot break RSA encryption there's a smaller darker yellow band over here which shows the progress of the universal quantum computers as you know we are at a very early stage of point of these quantum computers and we have a long way to go I've also shown a so now I've shown this dash dot blue line this would be the equivalent of following Moore's law and as you can see we're actually going faster than Moore's Law you know if you were to extend this um I you know also its most likely that we will have challenges with scaling with these gate computers and so that might not actually go as fast but my taper off over here and in addition we are waiting for new technologies to come out like the ion traps and nitrogen vacancy centers and Marana fermions and they could come a little later but they could scale up faster so based on this based on this graph the earliest one could say you know you could break RC encryption with 1 million good quality qubits would be if these computers killed as fast as this and became high quality that would be you know really really early on but my thought is that that will slow down and so we need to look at the N plus F errors so if you look at the errors which is the logical qubits the earliest would be 20-30 for that gate computers might be able to break RSA and more conservatively if you think that they will not kill that fast and they taper off and we need other modalities to come in over here then it could be as far as 2048 by the time you know someone can break RSA encryption so any questions over there you Oh you so we have at least a decade for a quantum computer to get strong enough to potentially break RSA encryption but again keep in mind that at that point if they have all of your data from the last ten years they can decrypt that you know because if you haven't converted it to a new you know some secure mechanism and unfortunately if it's if they're stealing it off communication lines where you know they already have the data with them then it's already potentially compromised so you know that's where I think NIST and others are somewhat you okay alright alright so that was basically the end and you you sure different you're welcome thanks everyone thanks again you you you you you you you
