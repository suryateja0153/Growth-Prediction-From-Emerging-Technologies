 Welcome everybody, so I'm Eric Klavins I'm the  chair of the Electrical and Computer Engineering   department here at the University of Washington  um and today at 3:30 is our 13th annual lecture   in the Dean W. Lytle Electrical and Computer  Engineering Endowed Lecture Series and today's   speaker is Scott Aaronson and he'll be talking  about quantum computational supremacy and its   applications and since there's so much activity  and interest on campus and in the northwest   around quantum information science, we thought it  would be useful to add to the Lytle lecture event,   this panel discussion. So I'd like to also  welcome you to the very first ever Lytle panel   discussion hopefully one and we'll do this  every year from from now on. I wish that we   could all be here in person especially for  this event because it's one of the sort of   biggest highlights of the of the year  but as everybody has we've had to adapt   but you know in a way this format has its  own benefits because we have people from   all over the world attending who may not have  been able to fly out even in normal times. I'd like to thank everyone who's involved in  organizing this event especially the faculty host   and chair of the Lytle lectureship  committee, that's Maryam Fazel.   She's the Morty family endowed professor and the  associate chair for research in our department. So   thank you Maryam for all the  work that you've put into this. Let's see I'd also like to thank the panel  organizer for today that's professor,   Kai-Mei Fu. She brought together all the  speakers that you will be hearing from today.   She's the director of the optical spintronics  and sensing lab and she's an associate professor   in ECE and in physics here at UW and  she's involved in UW strategy for quantum   in many different levels. So she's for  example this the co-chair of the steering   committee for the quantum x initiative at UW  which facilitates and supports activities to   accelerate quantum discoveries and technologies  and Kai-Mei will also be a speaker in today's   panel so you'll learn much more about her  background and research in the discussion. And finally I'd like to  introduce Arka Majumdar. So he is   an associate professor in the ECE department and  also has a position in the department of physics   and he's going to be moderating today's panel  discussion. So Arka works on hybrid integrated   nano photonic platforms using emerging material  system. He's exploring applications in ultra   low power optical information science imaging and  microscopy. He's won several awards including the   intel career early facts faculty award and the  Sloan fellowship and most recently, an NSF career   award and so please join me in welcoming Arka  who is going to introduce and moderate our panel. Thank you Eric and thank you everyone  for joining this panel. We have four   very exciting speakers from university and  also national lab and also from industry.   Just- just reminder, if you have any questions  for the panel, please send it into the Q&A box.   The chat is not for sending questions so you'll  please send it to the question and answer box   if you have any questions for the panelists.  So our first speaker today is professor Kai-Mei   from University of Washington. So Kai-Mei,  do you want to share your screen and- You are muted. Yes I'm sharing my screen  right now. Thank you Arka. Okay great yeah so it's great for me to kick  this off before we hear from Brent from Pacific   Northwest National Labs, David bacon from INQ,  and Chris Foy from Microsoft. So my goal today   is to tell you a little bit about the research  that's going on in the Electrical and Computer   Engineering Department, including in my my own lab  as well as the steps that the department is taking   to grow in this area as part of an effort to grow  quantum information across campus and also across   the regions and give you some idea as well as,  how you can engage in this area in the future.   So this is a a general talk and so, of course  I- I- want to start out with- with just what is   quantum information science and technology?  In the very briefest explanation in QIST,   we replace the digital bit with which is zero or  one with the quantum bit, which is this vector   superposition of zero and one where alpha and beta  can be complex so for people that are joining us   after a break from undergraduate, this may bring  back fond memories. We can visualize or at least,   I visualize this- this quantum bit as being a  point on the surface of a sphere, where theta   is telling us the the relative amplitude of how  much zero and one we have and phi is telling us   the- the phase information be between these two  coefficients. So, now instead of just taking two   specific values, our qubit actually can take  on a value over this entire surface and this   fundamentally different computational paradigm  has been an intellectually rich curiosity since   the 1980s. So why the excitement now? I think  everyone talking today was excited long before   the 19th not- not long for the 1980s but long  before now. But- but there's a certain amount of   excitement that's happening right now in 2020 and  a few things that happened were first, that this   was really critical that quantum air correction  and fault-tolerant computational schemes were   developed which enable practical implementation.  At the very beginning, it was pretty clear to a   lot of physicists at least that computation  was just going to be doomed. A scalable   computation was going to be doing by heirs and  the theorists in this case came to the rescue but   the numbers that they gave the experimentalists  to achieve them, were ridiculously daunting.   Luckily, the theorists brought those numbers down  while the experimental were slowly working to make   their devices behave a little bit better and so  the second thing that happened where that qubits   capable of reaching this fault tolerant threshold  could be fabricated at least in the onesies,   twosies, fuzees regime and these- these systems  include superconducting qubits trapped ions and   silicon based quantum dots and then based  on these, there's been a massive expansion   of investment by government and industry which  helps us accelerate the- the advancing technology.   So what does quantum information help us enable?  One is quantum computing and I'm not going to say   much about those right now because I think we're  going to learn so much more from the Lytle Lecture   this- this evening. One is quantum communication  where by the laws of physics, you can securely   give two people a- a- a key- a cryptography  key in which they could communicate and this   is fundamentally secure by the laws of physics.  Another is quantum stimulation in which you can   trap atoms or mimic lattice type systems just  like the solids that- that exist all around   us but then actually control the interactions  and simulate what the properties of a material   might be and then the fourth one is  ,quantum sensing and metrology where-   where you can use these qubits as very-  very sensitive sensors and- and clocks   and we have some people working in many of  these different areas. I have a- a project   in quantum sensing; Mo Li, Arka Majumdar and,  Karl Bohringer are developing a platform for   controlling the massive number of atoms that you  would need in these- in these quantum simulations.   But the- the largest kind of heaviest  region area of research right now,   in the electrical computer engineering, is  in quantum- quantum networks and you kind of   see that I kind of smack that over computing  and communication in these areas. So what are   the applications for a quantum network? One is  long distance communication and then the other,   which is the more challenging longer term vision  is distributed quantum computing, where you can   see that you need a network to connect smaller  modular elements or computational modules.   Okay so that's kind of a flash overview of the  area specifically in the area of this quantum   networks and my research I focus on, what  actually is going to be a good node for a   quantum network. So this is a circuit diagram or  a quantum circuit diagram that it turns out can be   realized by making one of these qubit graph  networks and the question that- that I- that I   look at physically because I'm an experimentalist  is- is this node and one may think well you should   make the node an atom or- or an ion because  that's the quintessential quantum object and   it has a long quantum memory time and there are  companies including Dave Vegan's company which   is looking at using ions but I kind of do the  opposite where you can have a perfect crystal   that has atoms in specific spots and then just  take out an atom or take out a couple of atoms.   The crystal that I look at is diamond and the  particular defect is the nitrogen vacancy center   and in this case one of the carbon atoms  is a nitrogen and one of them is just an   empty- an empty spot and you can  look at the energy level structure   of this defect and realize the elements that you  need for one of these qubits in this network,   in this case, we have our zero and one states  where we can access that whole surface I told   you about for the qubit by using radio frequency  waves and we also have transitions that are   optical to an excited state that allows us  to make these links in this quantum network.   Of course the situation is much more complicated.  This is not the energy level structure of the NV   center. It looks something more like this after 20  years of material scientists and spectroscopists   digging around and looking for  all the possible energy levels in   all the processes that can be happening and I  think what what you can take away is that we   can take something like this figure what this  is like, what this looks like for a defect and   then we can create the simpler system over here  to actually do a quantum information protocol. Okay so these- these introductions  are supposed to be about 12 minutes   long and and then you have a few minutes of  questions and then we'll have a discussion at   the end. So I am going a little slow so  I'm going to go a little faster here... What I'll say is that we start  with that defect and in my group   we have to be able to get that photon out so I  work a lot on making integrated devices which   allow us to create our defect and then shuttle the  light that gets emitted on the chip as we seek to   start to connect different defects and this type  of photonic circuit that you see on the right   I would like to highlight was made at  the Washington nanofabrication facility   here here on campus in this case you have a  waveguiding layer a diamond with these quantum   defects and in this particular study these  are actually electrodes that are deposited   on the sample to control the frequency of the  light that's being emitted by the defects okay   the challenges for creating networks  computers is quite challenging they're going   to require engineering solutions defect creation  engineering the levels coupling different defects   robustness to the defects being at different  frequencies and these are going to require   something that's called quantum frequency  conversion changing one color photon into   another color photon all while mitigating against  loss and and device failure and this example in   this particular case is a project that arc and I  are working on where you can start with a defect   and try to efficiently collect the light that it's  emitting in the visible transmit it to telecom and   efficiently get it to an optical fiber where it  can then be used for communication this is a small   problem in this scale there's doesn't even  touch upon full systems architectures and and   the engineering challenges in quantum information  science and technology so with that I'm excited to   let people here know that UW is expanding with  a cluster higher in the college of engineering   where we expect to be able to have expertise all  the way from materials and devices where we are   we are well represented now up to software and  algorithms and if you're interested in learning   more about this you can go to the websites that  I have here to learn more about the searches   and we're also interested in training the next  generation of quantum scientists and and engineers   and so we are launching an NSF national science  foundation national research traineeship program   that will that PhD and master's graduate  students can get an option in quantum   information science and technology and work with  our industrial partners to get hands-on research   in this area for the expanding industry this is  all part of a larger University of Washington   and regional initiative I just want to point  out quantum x with with which Eric Klavins   talked about briefly this is where all the  researchers in quantum get together and advertise   news and events and you can come here and learn  what's going on and come into a seminar such   like as this which is advertised on the website  and also the northwest quantum network which is   a similar regional effort that that hosts  seminars and workshops in the area and was   founded by Microsoft pnnl in the University of  Washington so so with that that's at the end of   my talk and I'm happy to answer questions if  there's time for it before the next speaker. Thanks Kai Mei. So we now have  questions time for three minutes   for any specific questions to Kai Mei and just to  remind everyone that we will have like a longer   around 20 minutes Q&A session after all the talks  are done together. So I don't see any Q&A... One   thing that kind of if you can mention that what  is the like the biggest kind of number of qubits   in diamond NV centers and where is that going  on if you can tell a little bit us about that. Yeah so the biggest NV system  is one nitrogen vacancy   defect which is actually coupled to ten nuclear  spins and so this is like one of those little   modules that you can imagine where you have an  electron spin which is one qubit and I think it's   nine or ten nuclear spins which are additional  qubits now the challenge with this is that's just   one defect and the big challenge is connecting one  of these modules to another module so they've done   that with just or the the community has  done that just you know two envy centers   but that's not also taking into account the  nuclear spin environment so that's kind of   a technical answer but 10- but going from  10 to more than 10 is non-linear process. There's another question from Natalie. Does-  do silicon-based quantum dots require the   extremely cold temperatures like the  superconducting qubits right now? Yes they they do they I think there  was a recent result where they could   do some things at one kelvin instead  of 100 millikelvin but one kelvin still   pretty cold and the performance was not  as good as at the lower temperatures. Okay so I think we are we-  here's another question from   Mo... Could you comment on pacific northwest  strength in QIST as compared with other   unl centers including Boston,  Bay Area southern California So we have several companies here which  I think makes the pacific northwest   quite strong what we we've heard I would say the  Boston the Boston area but also the the northern   northern California area as well also has  strength so I think it's a point where   the pacific northwest may be slightly behind but  given but we're one of those big centers and given   the companies that are here and  our expansion for growth I think   we have the ability to become the number one  in in the country but we're not there yet. Thanks Kai Mei. So I think we will go  into the next speaker but if you have   any other question please feel free  to type- type in we will have time   at the end of all the- all the talks  to go over all the questions again. So we are our next speaker is Brent VanDevender  from Pacific Northwest National Lab. So Brent, you are mute and- Apologies I had to unmute and then share. I lose  my new button- ah where do we go- right there. How's that? Do you see my slides? Yes. All  right so Professor Fu talked about a- a category   of qubit devices called generally solid-state  qubits. I'll talk about a different candidate   technology for qubits called superconducting  qubits and in particular, I'll talk about devices,   I'll talk about a basic metric of their  performance called the coherence time and then   some work that I do studying how these devices  respond to natural radiation in the environment   and what that has to do what are the implications  for their design and their eventual use. So superconducting qubit device there are a  few flavors depending on what is quantized in   the circuit and how you read it out. So you can  see charge flux in phase qubits across the top.   They all have in common though, one thing that  they have at least one Josephson junction. So   Josephson junction is just this structure here of  superconductor insulator/superconductor sandwich. Such that in a circuit in a qubit  circuit you can set up like this   you have the Josephson junction itself it has an  inherent inductance and capacitance and then you   add some other inductors and capacitors  to make the cubic behave like you want   if you ever studied electronics you will recognize  this circuit as an oscillator that that is indeed   what it is but it's important that it's not just  a normal oscillator that you would get if you use   classical inductors of capacitors if you did  that you would get a harmonic oscillator where   the energy levels are spaced equally such that you  can't usefully address transitions between them   that they're all the same it's very important  that this Josephson junction is non-linear   the the inductance is non-linear such that the  energy levels are spaced unequally we call this an   harmonic oscillator you can address the  transitions individually and in particular you   can address transitions between the ground state  and the first excited state and use those as the   states of your cubit the zero and one couple of  references the the frequency of that transition   is in the microwave it's a few gigahertz and the  energy corresponding to that transition is only   on order of like 10 micro electron volts  so it's very small so you have to be very   cold and you have to really protect these from  interactions with the environment that will force   those transitions that you didn't intend we saw  a few minutes ago that you can represent this all   cubits are like this you you can represent their  state on what's called the Bloch sphere where the   the zero state is the north pole the one state  is the south pole in any other state generally   an ad mixture of those two is some other point  on the sphere represented by this orange vector   operations on a qubit are represented by some  operator which has the axis that you rotate that   vector around and the angle by which you rotate it  so for instance an x pi pulse rotates you applied   to the zero will rotate you by pi 180 degrees  around the x axis and turn you into a one state   you can do half of that pi over two about the x  x-axis and get into this mixed state of zero and   one and therein lies part of the magic of quantum  computing is that you can be in these mixed   states one of the most basic metrics of the  qubit any qubit is what we call its coherence   time and you can measure that you can quantify  that by by putting a cubit into its one state   and seeing what is the probability that it's  still there with that it has not relaxed back   to its zero state after some time t you do that  by applying an x pi pulse to the ground state   and then measuring at some time towel later  to see if it's still there and you just map   out the probability and characterize the  time in this example it's 85 microseconds now superconducting qubits have been following  a Moore's law and coherence time or had been at   least for you know since the turn of the century  they were only a nanosecond back in the early   2000s now up to hundreds of microseconds the  current world record is 300 microseconds and   I would say it's pretty clear that we've  fallen off this old Moore's law we're now   at best on a a shallower Moore's law but  still all of these even this world record   have followed from improvements in the  design of devices you can design them to be   impervious to noise from their environment  and also in the materials you use to   construct them so more pure materials  can result in longer coherence times   that addresses lots of sources of decoherence  which you can see on this top right diagram   the one I think the most about though is what we  call quasi-particle poisoning so quasi-particle   poisoning just refers to the fact that there  are in a superconductor electricity is carried   without electrical resistance because the  electrons at low temperature will pair up   and flow without resistance quasi particles you  can it's a technical term it's really just a free   electron to two free electrons from when you break  one of those cooper pairs those cause troubles   because they don't flow without resistance  they're dissipative they can exchange energy   in such a way that you can flip the state of a  cubic device if they exist and also they they   fluctuate in their number during a measurement  and so you get a kind of noise we call shot noise to to to to set the scale of how bad the  problem is we should talk about how many   you think should be there and this is just a  straightforward thermodynamics calculation using   some superconductor theory the the thermal density  this is quasi particles or free electrons per   cubic micron is just the density of states  capital n there's a delta this is what we call the   superconducting gap it's like the binding energy  for electrons to make one of these cooper pairs   and the temperature t so the superconducting  gap is 180 microelectron volts and excuse me   an aluminum which is a typical superconductor and  kt is 1.7 microelectron volts at 20 millikelvin   which is a typical temperature at which you  run superconducting devices and you'll note   that this thermal density is therefore suppressed  by an exponential factor like e to the minus 100.   plugging in the numbers you expect only 1 times 10  to the minus 40 free electrons per cubic micron at   device temperature there are way more than that  in real devices it's actually a general property   of superconductors you see tenths or excuse me  hundredths to hundreds per cubic micron not 10   to the minus 40 which is effectively known  at all to get this density purely by thermal   origin you would have to be at 165 millikelvin  which is much much hotter than 20 milligram   and so we call this quasi-particle poisoning  there are way more broken coupe repairs than   you think there should be based on the BCS theory  it's really a general property of superconductors   it doesn't matter the materials who's doing  the experiment nobody really thinks this BCS   theory is incorrect though and so we need some new  hypothesis that can explain this universal excess   there are not many things that are that universal  and not already ruled out but natural radiation in   the environment is one of those things and so we  actually did an experiment recently to test that   a little aside I'm a nuclear physicist so this is  very ordinary stuff for me I think a lot of people   though are surprised to realize just how much  natural radiation there is in the environment   you can take a standard detector this is a  piece of three inch by three inch sodium iodide   and just measure the radiation environment in  your laboratory and you will find about 10 counts   per second 10 radiation events per second from  potassium thorium and uranium that just exist   in normal materials and also cosmic rays and so  this is a spectrum of that radiation you can see   classic classic for people in nuclear physics  spectra of potassium Iranian thorium and cosmic   rays which go out to much higher energies and so  what we think is going on is all those different   radiations are interacting somewhere in the  device so this is like a side view of a qubit   this is extremely not to scale by the way  the silicon basically dominates the thickness   but these radiations can interact anywhere  in the device not necessarily directly in   the superconductor deposit energy that energy  can flow through the device through a number   of processes phonons photons eventually they  get into the superconductor where they still   have more than 180 microelectron volts so  they can break one of these good repairs we tested that by by operating qubit devices  so here is a real cubic device it's the tiny   little silicon chip in there blown up on the  right that's a photograph of a qubit device   with false color there's a there's a blue cupid  on the left and an orange qubit on the right   that will color code some data I'll  show you in the next few slides   and we took a piece of copper and made it  radioactive in the research reactor at MIT   and put it right on top of the qubit and that was  nice because that we made it radioactive such that   it has a half-life of just 12.7 hours that was  long enough for us to do some experience putting   it together cool down our refrigerator which takes  like 24 hours but then still have several days of   activity left so we can watch this source decay  away to nothing and see what it did to the cubits   what it did was it it it basically wrecked  their coherence time and so I'm plotting   here on the top not the coherence time  but what we call the relaxation rate is   just one over the coherence time so low  relaxation rate is larger coherence time   and you can see over the course of hours we  did the experiment continuously for two weeks   you see this relaxation rate going down and  coming back to normal as the estimated power from   radiation into the device decays away to nothing  they're not shaped exactly like each other because   there's a square root relation between the power  on the bottom and the relaxation rate on the top Formally we have a model so what we call the  polarization that this is the probability that you   stay in the one state after some time t is this  exponential function the relaxation rate gamma   has you know all those other sources of d  coherence I alluded to plus the the source   from quasi particles and the quasi-particle  part of that is just goes like the square   root of power the frequency of the qubit and  then some unknown factor a which absorbs some   fundamental constants and and basically our  ignorance of how well radiation makes quasi   particles in a device it's basically the thing  we're trying to determine in the experiment Put it all together this is the same  data as above but now I'm showing you   that relaxation rate versus the power into  the device so the power was going down to   the experiment so you can kind of think  of time as going right to left in this   and we can use this early time high  power region of our data when when this   the total radiation is dominated by the radiation  from the source to get a value for that parameter   and then extrapolate it and say okay what would  be the coherence time if you could remove all the   other sources of decoherence what is what is the  limit that radiation in the environment would set   and we find that at least for qubits of  the type we measured you're going to be   limited to just a few microseconds that's  not anywhere near long enough for the general   purpose quantum computing you would like to  do so you're going to have to deal with this That was a very high level description  the experiment there are many more details   in a paper we recently published here and I'll  just close by by saying you know what are the   implications of this so one of the the first  implication is that we you know we have definitely   discovered a connection between radiation quasi  particle and qubit performance it's actually a   little bit more of a general solution than that  quasi-particle poisoning is generically a problem   of superconductor I think we can say that natural  radiation from the environment is at least part of   the cause I'm actually comfortable with a stronger  statement that it is at least most of the cause um   and we did two experiments i only talked about the  one where we elevated the radiation we also did   an experiment where we shielded and reduced the  radiation and showed that the times went up now   the world record is 300 microseconds and i  told you that radiation limits you to only   three milliseconds so there's a gap there  and so the other result of our finding and   we didn't know this going in is that you know  radiation quasi-particle poisoning is not the   leading cause of decoherence right now something  else is the leading cause but if we want to stay   on Moore's law even that relaxed Moore's law  that that my earlier plot implied you know   we should be working on the problem after next  already and we are in fact doing that now and so   now that we know this is a problem we can do  more experiments to learn the microscopic details   which then inform designs of cubits that are  maybe impervious to these these effects and also   I alluded the fact that I'm a nuclear physicist  we can make devices that are less impervious   or you know less sensitive to quasi particles for  better QIS qubit devices but for me thinking about   things like detecting dark matter and neutrinos  we can also make much more sensitive radiations   where we can use those quasi particles as like the  information carriers and our detector technologies That's all, thank you. Thank you Brent. There's already one  question. so I think first let's do   a slide 13 it's millisecond or micro second I  think it is millisecond I think there's maybe- So slide 13 I think- it's- oops come  on yes- I think it's a 3.13 millisecond   yeah so- so- so the- the- the- the- the-  the limit rate is three- it's about three   to four milliseconds and- and I get that  by extrapolating... See the dashed lines,   it's where they would intersect. I'm sorry I  forgot to say this we estimated the natural   dose of radiation in the devices and where these  two points intersect which would be off the bottom   of the slide that's what gives you that about  three milliseconds okay and also in slide four. I think there is a question  about is x by the same as y pi? Yeah you can do a wi-fi pulse and turn a zero into  one also that would give you the same result okay   and while we're at that level of detail I realized  as I was showing the slide that that plus sign   maybe should be a minus sign I can't remember  what you get when you actually apply the right   x pi over two operator to zero so don't  copy this on your homework until you do it   I I want one so this as you're saying is small is  for the transparent qubit I believe but there is   like you know other qubits as well and also like  I mean if you think about topological qubit they   are also using superconducting system so is this  kind of a generic statement for any other system   or is primary to transmon qubit so so I believe  it is generally true that that radiation will   put energy into your device and break cooper  pairs if it couples into the superconductor   so far so I'm actually quite new to the cubit  world I've only thought deeply about the transmon   qubits I've worked with I believe it's generally  true for the other types of qubits but maybe   they're somehow less sensitive to the quasi  particles and so you know one of the informed   design choices you can make now  that you understand this is is   you know thinking about what's the geometry  of your qubit that would be less sensitive. Okay thank you Brent. Again you can put questions  in Q&A we are going to go to the third speaker   David Bacon from IonQ who previously  worked with super conducting system   in google so David go ahead Hi can everyone see my shared screen here let me   yeah I have it on a weird monitor so give me  just a second to you guys still see it now no   I always see this ah okay let me let me let me  just keep it over here then here we go I can I   can I can adjust so if I look a little bit to the  left you guys will know why so I'm Dave Bacon I'm   a software engineer uh actually so a little  bit different than the other people in here   I was previously at google and moved to iron q in  fact uh Kai Mei asked me while I was in the middle   middle of moving so we had to be careful about  what my affiliation was for a little bit which   is pretty funny um so I'm going to talk about  the quantum race and it's supposed to be sort of   uh uh you know sort of should it should invoke in  you exactly what I wanted to which is that it's   like the space race right uh and here's the famous  quote by JFK where he said you know we choose to   go the moon in this decade and do the other things  not because they're easy because they're hard   right I love this quote my favorite thing about  this quote though is not what probably everybody   else does is like what are those other things  right you have to go read the speech to see why   it makes sense he puts in a joke about Texas A&M I  think also in there which when you read it you're   kind of like that's a little out of place um but  you know the quantum world is engaged in a similar   very challenging process and you know uh  uh you know it's it's it's in some ways uh   you know more challenging in some ways than going  to the moon which sounds crazy but it's because   we're really trying to engineer effectively a new  phase of matter so this is sort of the way i think   about it is you know in these different phases of  matter which is a physicist way of saying you know   there are these you know a solid is different from  a liquid which is different from a gas right and   what's happening there is there's different robust  properties of the system that are emerging out of   of these systems at a large scale with a large  number you know if we have 10 to the 23 atoms in   in a system that's a huge number of things  but somehow these robust properties emerge   right and what the quantum computing world is  trying to do is they're trying to do a similar   thing we're trying to build a computer so we're  trying to build this phase of matter that can do   quantum computation and that should emerge by you  know some in some globally sort of robust property   um and that's that's a really challenging thing  right to sort of engineer or get to a new state   of of matter and and there's a sort of you know  in the early days and the stuff I worked on a long   time ago it was about sort of what is this thing  right like and and why does it exist and one of   the great discoveries uh in the early nine and  the mid 90s was that you could do uh this thing   called quantum air correction and that it would  allow you to to build this that there really is   some some way to sort of take a bunch of noisy  components and build this robust phase of matter   so what is this magic here's a picture of the  magic I crib this from Craig Gidney who is a   software engineer at google an incredible  guy we call him Craig the compiler   uh this is a picture of uh in space and time so  sort of going upwards this time and and sort of   the other two directions are our space and this  is a picture of doing a quantum computation   uh using this thing called the surface code which  is an air correcting code uh and doing this in   what people call a fault tolerant manner so this  is a pretty complex construction that ends up   doing some basic manipulation on your computer  so think about it you know at the lowest level   your computer is executing a bunch of instructions  this is like one of those instructions uh and this   is actually you know simplifying a lot of things  these are not you know like individual qubits here   you have to know sort of what's going on in this  picture but it's a very complex beast that we're   trying to build out of this thing um and so why  would you do this right like why would you why   first of all we you know we haven't really talked  about why we're trying to why people are excited   about this we can imagine Kennedy ask you actually  that he wants to build a quantum computer and I   won't try to do a JFK accent though I once did get  mistaken somebody thought I was a Kennedy which   I thought was one of the funniest things I'd ever  have in my life at a bar of course um so why would   we do this well there's pay dirt at the end of  this experience right quantum computers manipulate   quantum information they speak quantum and because  those computers can speak quantum uh they allow us   to to simulate quantum systems right and this is  really the killer app that a lot of people focus   on as one of the big payoffs for quantum computing  um and the number of places where you can apply   these simulations is vast and what happens is  we know that in the classical world as we try   to build larger and larger simulations of these  quantum systems our algorithms just don't keep   up right and you know it could be that there's  some smart algorithms but this has been a huge   issue for many many years and no one really  has made progress on that so there's a lot of   uh belief that that that the real way the only  real way you can simulate these larger quantum   systems is to actually use a quantum computer  so this is the painter that a lot of companies   are excited about in the long term there's other  reasons to believe it because there's a lot of   weird quantum algorithms that exist and so uh you  know this has set off a race uh and as as Kane   said earlier right like it's it's only recently  that you know this has started to come to the   place where we're or a point where we can start to  really think about trying to scale these things up   right uh I've been working I realized that  I did a calculation I first did uh I first   worked in quantum computing in 1996 as a like a  summer project so I if I calculate it I'm almost   at half my life's been working on this which both  makes me old and a little bit scared for how much   of my life I've been working on this uh but what's  happened in the last few years and the excitement   uh and sort of the reason i actually left quantum  computing came back was that we're now at the   point where we can really think about building  you know that sort of crazy contraption that   Craig had on the previous slide and that's because  our qubits are better and we're at the point where   we're moving to a place where there's a lot more  engineering going on to build these systems out   so Seattle as was asked sort of what's going on in  Seattle there are a ton of different players here   are some of the ones I've listed here uh here's  the quintessential tourist photo from Seattle   uh up on uh Kerry Park uh and uh you know google  has had a presence here I'm actually was leading   the quantum software team at google and I recently  switched so there's a new one there which is imq   and IonQ will be opening in office uh in Seattle  once offices become a thing again uh and so ions   imq is a company that builds quantum computers  based on trapping ions so here's a picture of an   ion trap you see a bunch of electrodes going down  to this little tiny region and what happens is you   can you can trap individual ions or chains  of ions into these systems so the electrons   that sorry the electrodes create a field so you  sort of have you know a well that these things   sit in you actually you actually kind of spin the  well around to keep things in there and you get   this chain of very nice uh ions that are that are  trapped and then you can do quantum computations   by sending in laser pulses to each of those  ions and so individual laser protons each ions   a qubit you can make those rotations that were  talked about earlier right and do each of those   and then you can actually get them to couple  because these things form a crystal and if you   have a crystal these these ions are repelling each  other but they're kind of pushed together right so   like this crystal thing if you poke one of them  right what's gonna happen well the other ones   are in this crystal they'll sort of like you know  wiggle as well and so by properly you know being   smart about it and shooting lasers that say two  ions at the same time you can do a you can do a   quantum computation between those two ions so you  can couple these ions together so INQ has traps   that are on actually on amazon's cloud service  that are 11 qubits right now and we're currently   working on a really cool 32-qubit uh system uh  which I hope will you know amaze the world so this   is a it's a new a new place new thing for for for  for Seattle and that that uh up until a few years   ago there weren't was an ion trapping quantum  computing company here but UW has like one of the   craziest things right like UW literally has  a Nobel prize winner uh or had right who   who you know was one of the sort of creators  and founders of ion trap quantum computing uh   and Boris Lindoff who was mentioned earlier at UW  has been doing uh trapped eye and computing here   for a while so here's here's uh here's professor  that's a new you know I did this like way before   before any of you did and uh these are the  absolute best chops of any professor ever   right so okay so then the sort of question that  everybody asked when we talk about these things is   who's gonna win the race right and I I my answer  is always like I have no idea right like I really   don't and I I just made a partial list of all the  things you might think through as you're trying   to think about a quantum computer and scaling it  up right so it's an immensely complex question in   sort of architectures and technologies and uh  superconducting uh circuits which I previously   worked on have a lot of advantages they have  some disadvantages as well and we're at this   point where where I think the next few years is  going to be sort of fascinating to see sort of   who can scale to the next scale of of building  these systems um you know how do we figure   this out part of me is I'm an engineer and more  connected some ways to the hardware these days   which is we really need to build these systems and  see how they perform and scale them up right so   put it in the blender and see if it works um but  I I'll tell you sort of the reason I switched over   to ions because I think it's an interesting one  to sort of give you some perspective about this   uh many years ago I would go look for faculty jobs  and it was brutal like nobody knew about quantum   computing it was very people were very skeptical  of it so there were these evil faculty that you   would talk to and you'd be like oh there's this  quantum computing thing and it's really great   and you would realize that that this idea of  quantum air correction which is a foundational   thing without air correction there really is  no scalable model of concomitating it wasn't   something like that that it spread into the you  know into everybody's knowledge of the world   and so in quantum computing what would happen is  that like we would always have this thing where   we'd have these conversations people would  raise objections but they wouldn't know what   air correction was so quantum air correction  for people in quantum computing is a shield   it's like you need to understand it right like  to uh uh you know to be like oh it you know   like if you don't understand that then you don't  quite understand what I'm even talking about so   so it was always used psychologically as sort of a  as a weapon in some ways now uh on the other hand   i think it causes a another sort of problem which  is that we think about air correction as the like   just get there and then boom everything  happens and i think that's also   just a myth because uh that's not really  how almost all technologies evolve   um and so in many ways what I think is the  proper way to think about this is is the you   know the real question between the different  implementations and approaches people taking   are is it going to be that you have a system  that's noisy and you build it up and you build it   larger or larger and eventually get to this point  where you can build a very large one and then all   of a sudden boom you have a really good robust  qubit in this like fault tolerance structure is   it going to be a phase transition in time right  it's all of a sudden that's going to happen and   there's some technologies where that's sort of the  way they're approaching it right like that really   they'll get there and then it'll all just start  happening there's another approach which just   says this is going to be a gradual process right  we're going to do a little bit of error correction   and then a little bit more and as we understand  our system maybe we can figure out air correcting   tricks that that nobody thought of because we  have a deep understanding of our own system   so so why that's sort of one of the reasons why  I'm switching over and working on these new ion   trap quantum computers they have disadvantages  they're slower but they have some really crazy   advantages when thinking about trying to  do this gradualism approach in particular   these ions that are all sitting in this trap if  you jiggle this one over here and jiggle this   one over here properly you can couple them  it doesn't matter that they're you know on   you know opposite ends of the trap when you lay  things out and say a super conducting uh circuit   a quantum computer your cubits only talk to your  neighbors right and this causes problems if I need   to do you know something here you know talk have  this Cuban interact with this one over here I have   to basically swap them till they get close to each  other and and then do the interaction whereas in   iron traps that's not true so very recently uh at  duke uh Chris Monroe who is one of the co-founders   along with ken brown uh their groups demonstrated  a fault tolerant operation using 13 qubits in a   trap so they've sort of made this first step  now there's it's a very first step it's a baby   step right it's not doing the full thing that it's  not Craig kidney's picture right but it's it's the   beginning of this step and I'm really excited to  be working on high ends because I'm I'm sort of I   truly believe that we might be able to do amazing  air correction things in the short term to sort   of make this gradual thing and not necessarily  rely on sort of the magic time when things happen   okay so that's sort of that's sort of the state  of the state of the world uh for my perspective uh   you know these these these highly connected traps  are going to be a fascinating architecture there's   a whole story i can tell you about the next step  which is we want to scale these up uh and when you   want to scale them up what you're going to do is  take these traps and build a modular architecture   so imagine you have these traps they have to  have little regions to move ions around because   you need to like say shuttle some over to do some  measurements on them and shuttle them back so so   there's an approach where you build everything  with shuttling things around on a big trip   but the approach that i inquire is taking this is  different it's this modular architecture where you   have that type of small thing for say you know  64 qubits or 128 qubits and sort of the smaller   quantum computer but then you hook them up sort  of more like Kai Mei had a picture of with these   networks right and it turns out that if you  can sort of get the quantum information into   photons and then interfere them you can create  entanglement between the traps and then you can   use this trick called teleportation great name  but it's it's bus Monday what it actually does   right uh to actually you know do transport quantum  information between these traps so there's sort   of this idea of like you want to get to the point  where you can build these little tiny modules that   you can easily manufacture they're small and work  and then scale it out in this modular direction   and that's the approach that imq is taking for  the long term process which is different than   the superconducting circuits where you think you  know there are actually similar approaches but a   lot more of is like scale this thing big build  a gigantic dilution refrigerator and you know   really focus on on on scaling that direction we're  doing the other thing we want everything small   and then manufacture a ton of them and connect  them up okay so that's that's mostly what i   always talk about uh ions are a fascinating  platform I think the the race uh right now is   engaged in the air correcting race that's sort of  the stage we're at and that will be followed by   the scaling race uh and so I'm pretty excited to  see who wins the air correcting race uh and then   you know who knows it could be that the scaling  race gets won by something else right like i   i think we're at a pretty exciting time for for uh  for the field of quantum computing okay uh thanks   David uh so I think we have time only for one  questions and the other question we can take in   the final panel so we'll start with the first  one um so is there a problem that is provenly   uncomputable on non-quantum computers that is  computable on a quantum computer and I think   here we are they are asking is not about the  speed benefit yeah cannot be done the answer   is that that that nobody right now it is not  thought that that is true um in fact you have   to really tweak the model of quantum computation  do that so computable and uncomputable uh is not   something that quantum computers really separate  right now um there are some weird versions of that   that I could I could talk about but that's not not  really probably what's what's asking here but um   you know the real reason that's true is that you  can simulate a quantum computer uh it just takes   you a long time right it doesn't change you know  we know that we can simulate it with just using a   polynomial amount of space but but uh but maybe an  exponential amount of time right and so it's that   separation is not in terms of computable versus  uncomputable but just in terms of complexity   thank you I think we'll go to the fourth speaker  and there's another question that you can take in   the final um Q&A session so our final speaker of  um to this panel is a Christmas boy from Microsoft   so Krysta great thank you let me share my screen  one moment find the right thing see if this works all right can everyone see this yes okay great  well good I guess almost good afternoon um thanks   for inviting me to this panel today I'm excited to  be here I'm the general manager of quantum systems   and software at Microsoft and I think actually the  the presentations we've had this this morning thus   far have gone in a very good order I'm actually  going to now target further up the stack and talk   about the types of problems we can solve with  a quantum computer if we're able to build one   that's fault tolerant so we've just gone through  different types of qubit systems and ways to build   a quantum computer and so now it nicely lands to  the top of the stack to algorithms and software   so first you know when we think about quantum  computing what we're really trying to do is   redefine in many ways what computing is and  this includes what we'll be able to compute   it includes what does it mean to compute we have  a whole nother' instruction set at our fingertips   that I think you've just seen with the other talks  and and with that we also have to redefine how you   program this and what the software stack looks  like what's the hardware how does that work how   do you control it how do you read out what does  it mean to have input output right so we're really   redefining so many aspects of computing and  then we want to bring it together with classical   computing so one important thing to remember is  a quantum computer isn't standalone right this is   hybrid the algorithms are hybrid the solution  is hybrid and really you should think about a   quantum computer as an accelerator that's in the  cloud right among many other types of compute   and when we think about what we want to solve  with that think about using both types of compute   in concert with each other or many types of  compute in concert with each other so when we   think about redefining computing i think you know  Dave just talked about Feynman and what we want   to do with a quantum computer you know the most  exciting application uh is really the simulation   of physical systems right being able to simulate  and model systems that otherwise are very very   hard to model efficiently or accurately on large  classical systems say even the top supercomputers   so here if we can better model physical systems  that gives us an opportunity to solve problems   like catalysis problems how can we better take  and capture say carbon dioxide perform carbon   fixation and convert carbon uh carbon dioxide for  example to methanol and that could help combat say   global warming right how can we better find a  catalyst to help produce artificial fertilizer   in turn that could really help our ability to um  to more efficiently produce fertilizer and then   obviously help with say you know agriculture and  crop production and similarly if we can model uh   different properties of materials say can we  take a material and study exotic properties   these problems are all very hard on classical  computing with classical computing and we   need something else so with exotic properties and  materials for example we could then understand is   there a is there a material that can super conduct  a higher temperature and this would be an unlock   for clean energy solutions for example and for  sustainability so these are all really compelling   reasons we want to build a quantum computer and  have a scaled up quantum system so that we can go   after these types of problems now with all these  problems one big caveat one big thing to remember   with quantum computers is you really should look  at small data problems and large compute problems   at this point we don't know a great way to  read in lots of data into a quantum computer   so these problems though what's nice about  chemistry and materials is it's really   a small data space but a large compute space and  this is where quantum computers can really excel   now with that i want to go into detail on  one of these catalysis problems so one of the   most exciting areas is computational catalysis  this is an area where we have we currently have   you know barriers in our classical compute we  can't get to the energy to the accuracies we   need we can't get to the we can't easily study  heavy metals for example and so forth in in in   such catalysts so in carbon fixation right we want  to design a chemical process that improves the   reaction right enables us to take carbon dioxide  find a catalyst that enables that conversion   um and and enables it say to convert to methanol  and and do this efficiently right so ideally that   catalyst can be reused it finds another carbon  dioxide you know reacts and and so forth right   so that we don't have to have lots of catalyst  molecules in the mix but so we want this efficient   you know conservative if you will process uh and  we want to be able to do this industrially so   currently you know studying this on on classical  computers on supercomputers this is this is very   inefficient and it turns out right if you look  at high performance computers there's many   cases where we can simulate chemical processes  efficiently using httpc using supercomputers   but when you have quantum correlations and you  need to understand those correlations and those   reaction rates well this can prevent and prevent  you from being able to understand those accurate   predictions right make accurate predictions  before you go build something in the lab right   ideally we make it all computational we automate  the process we can predict right and we we build   it in the lab last um so this is what we want  to be able to unlock and for certain problems   for example in the case of carbon fixation  studying these catalysts in high performance   compute environments is is too computationally  intense so we need a quantum computer right a   quantum computer can now enable us to study these  quantum correlations computationally so that would   be a huge step forward now the catch is that we  need a large quantum computer to do this right   it needs to be a full scale it needs to be fault  tolerant Dave just spoke about error correction   we need fault tolerance here to unlock this type  of solution coming from quantum acceleration   but what's exciting is it does promise to be  able to do that and it promises us to be able   to accurately predict properties of catalysts  carbon fixation just being one example but a   very compelling one so in the last several  years uh over the last decade really my team   and colleagues around the world have been working  together to advance these algorithms so you know   one one note we heard about the Moore's law of  save for superconducting qubits earlier today   but time and time again algorithmic speedups  can outpace Moore's law so don't don't   don't just rely on the hardware improving I also  want to encourage you improve your algorithms   so here's a good example of that uh if we can  improve our algorithms we can really bring down   the cost and the need for that hardware  to scale up so over the last 10 years   we've been able to achieve a 10 order of magnitude  reduction in the quantum algorithms run time for   solving computational catalysis types problems  this makes this a very compelling example now   a very compelling case a use case for quantum  acceleration for quantum computers and we did this   by using software tools a mix of software tools  and theory mathematical tools together right to   create these advances studying the bounds of the  algorithm studying the behaviors in simulation   programming the algorithm using tools for example  that we offer for example in azure quantum we've   been able to bring that down and so i think it's  a really exciting time to be studying quantum   computing both from the software side and the  hardware side because they're actually coming   together right we bring down the cost of the  algorithm we improve the hardware and that gap   is closing to where we can start to see examples  running on quantum computers so in this case we've   been able to bring the algorithms down from what  was a run time of say a billion years even on a   quantum computer this is considered efficient by  computer scientists polynomial time but you have   to remember the degree of the polynomial we've  been able to bring that degree down and now it's   roughly a month runtime on a quantum computer  assuming certain uh certain architecture here   so that's pretty exciting right but now we  still need a fault tolerant quantum computer   and we also need tools to program and test these  algorithms in advance understand how they work on   the quantum computer and so here azure quantum  is an example of a full stack cloud ecosystem   where now in the cloud right you have access  to quantum hardware you can try small examples   of quantum programs running on quantum hardware  um exciting to uh we're excited at Microsoft to   have IonQ is a partner in this so you can run  quantum programs on the ion q hardware Dave-   Dave just spoke about also on Honeywell hardware  and qci hardware those are another ion trap system   and another superconducting qubit system and you  can write one piece of code say in q sharp you can   use the quantum development kit the tools around  that to simulate the algorithm resource estimate   it understand it optimize it pass it through the  compilation stack and then execute against quantum   hardware so it's a really exciting time also as a  developer or an engineer to be able to test these   ideas in practice now to get there though i just  want to you know as I start to close out i just   want to mention we do need that fault tolerance  system we need to scale up systems to be pretty   darn large to run this type of carbon fixation  computation on a quantum computer so i want to   point out here if you look here at this graph  this is the air rate in the system versus the   number of qubits and roughly this is a you know  back of the envelope style plot don't take this   fully exact here but in the bottom right is  roughly the size of our systems and the error   rates we have today to run an application say we  need a hundred logical qubits and that's going to   require many many physical qubits and these blue  lines here show that right we're going to need   upwards of a you know roughly a million physical  qubits to run something like this catalysis type   of solution so we still have a long ways to go  to close that gap and i want to just encourage   all of us to lean in either on the software or  the hardware side and really bring this together   but we still have a ways to go we're at roughly  you know 100 cubits or less today we need to get   to a million we're at air rates or roughly 10  of the minus two 10 minus three today we need   to get to something that's more like 10 to the  -12 and we can do that through error correction   so it's really going to take a village to bring  this all together so it's exciting to have things   like you know the large investments like the  national quantum initiative that brings people   together from different communities different  backgrounds computer science physics engineering   chemistry right cryogenics materials science we  need everyone coming together to really advance   towards scaled quantum computing  and towards seeing quantum quantum   acceleration have an advantage i really like  to close just with this quote from bill gates   uh you know at the same time we want to close  this gap but we often you know we always as he   says we always overestimate the change that will  occur in the next two years and underestimate the   change that will occur in the next ten so don't  let yourself be lulled into inaction so I think   there's a lot of hope for what we're gonna see  from quantum computing over the next 10 years   and I'm just just so excited uh to see the  progress we're going to make together so with   that I will close thank you thank you Krysta  so I think there are already two questions   uh maybe we can take it that the full panel is  any specific questions from Christopher stark   um so I I have one question I mean so your uh  you show this algorithmic speed up right that   you have from like this like one billion years  to one month uh how hardware agnostic that is   yeah yeah so that's being cost out in that  case those those it's fairly hardware agnostic   in that we've taken into account you know a  rough run time we can plug in other run times   um the exact runtime I think it's you know  we set a certain logical clock rate so if   the logical clock rate is a little slower it will  take much longer and if it's faster it'll it'll   be faster but you know that that clock rate is  a reasonable clock rate save for superconducting   qubit systems or the type of systems we're  looking at with topological qubits so Andy   also has the questions are the recent algorithm  improvements you referenced predominantly coming   from mathematical advances in writing codes or  from better compilation of existing algorithms   well it's a bit of a um yeah it's a bit of a mix  right so um what i what i should point out is we   we program the algorithm for example and once  you program the algorithm you can look at the   sequence of operations and you can start to take  into account how you can better optimize that   sequence to both compress the number of operations  so reduce the number of operations by say changing   orderings and so forth but then additionally you  can also look at parallelism there and and also   see the other the other piece here is with fault  tolerance we also have to look at how you produce   those fault tolerant operations and you can also  change like the types of operations you're doing   and that can also help reduce the cost overall  um so a bunch of these are compiler style   you might call them compiler style optimizations  and then um and then additionally we also looked   at the bounds of the algorithm tried out  different um you might call them you know   different functions or different routines  different subroutines within the algorithm   there's a lot of different advances in in the  quantum algorithm community where you can do   use different approach approaches within  the algorithm different subroutines   to to achieve the same solution so we've also  played with those so those you might consider   more mathematical um options uh so both of those  come together to to enable the advances it's   not just one single change the algorithm that was  made here it's actually a sequence of many there's   probably 10 to 15 different different tricks you  might say that were applied here to to achieve   that reduction uh there's another questions uh  specifically the Krysta what about cost of quantum   versus ordinary computing are there proofs of  the existing or non-existence of fast algorithms   well we have um yes I mean we have so so here's  when you look at the history of quantum computing   I mean there's a couple things to call out  right often we've seen that okay you can have um   you know over the best known classical algorithm  you might have a quadratic speed up or a super   quadratic speed up or an exponential speed up  right or something something along these lines   so we have proofs of speed ups over the best known  or the existing classical algorithms right um then   in addition when you look at those algorithms  and you look at those proofs like often those   are proven in terms of bounds right or in terms  of complexity theory right uh and so when you go   to implement the algorithm it's also important  to take into account you know you actually have   to implement those underlying functions it's not  just the query calls or the oracle calls anymore   those are just you know you often cost an  algorithm uh first from the theory perspective   in terms of black box costs right we would call  it an oracle cost but we don't necessarily look   at the cost of that oracle so when we implement  the algorithm that's where things like q sharp   and the quantum development kit and being able  to program those algorithms is so important you   then go in and you actually write down how do  i compute this function on a quantum computer   what are the costs right and sometimes you you uh  you learn that that oracle function is actually   quite expensive even if you only called it once  if it's really expensive and it and it really uh   takes over the cost of the whole algorithm right  then then it may not be an efficient algorithm   anymore so there are are really uh careful we  have to be very careful to actually cost the   full algorithm out in terms of how it would be  implemented and look at all those costs inside   those oracle functions for example um to know if  you really still achieve a quantum advantage and   a quantum speed up in practice right when we  would consider in implementation on hardware   hopefully that yeah thank you christus i think we  are going to go to like all the questions to all   the panelists uh so this question from josh mead  i think it was asked during david david stock but   essentially is the computational complexity of a  warm molecule is less than that of a cold molecule so david maybe i mean you can i mean i could take  a stab at it uh it you know there there are less   algorithms known for so so the question is like  does a really noisy quantum system is it easier   to simulate and there are places where we know  if it's if there's a ton of noise the answer   is definitely yes um and this this this  is probably one of the least understood   trade-offs about about sort of systems that are  going on so to give you a concrete example of this   uh while i was at google they performed this  uh beyond classical computing experiment   where they ran a random circuit that was  very large and it was was hard to simulate   and this is a noisy circuit right uh and one of  the real you know one of the interesting things   that happened in that is that one of the things  they did is they went through this process of   like competing against the best algorithms in  the world so if you were going to simulate this   quantum computation on a super computer versus  what you did in the lab who's going to win right   and so you learned a lot about the different  algorithms that you're you're trying to throw   from the classical world to like simulate that  quantum system and a lot of the approaches that   people came up to sort of attack that were based  on the fact that the google system has you know   a particular geometry or uses a particular date  set but the one place where there wasn't really   an attack that worked particularly well was if the  note system's noisy and i think this is actually a   very fascinating question that we don't understand  exactly what's going on there we certainly know   that in this if it's really noisy then it is  easy to simulate so if it's very warm noisy   equals warm then yes we think that there might  be easier ways to simulate it um krista probably   has a better perspective on this because she's  she's been working on this from for a long time yeah i think um in terms of yeah you know  there's different uh we look at simulating   in terms of simulating noise we definitely  look at lots of different ways to simulate   the noise in the quantum system  that this is very challenging   all up you know there's different classes of  operations where you can simulate efficiently   on classical computers and then in other  cases right then when there's something   quantum obviously it's it's costly that's the  whole point of building a quantum computer um   so i'm not sure what else we want to add uh  what further to add here at this point so   there's another question um where does u.s quantum  computing stand with respect to china and russia man so that's a super complex question and  i'm not even going to attempt to do a ranking   i i know very little about russia but  china is widely known to be a powerhouse   in the field of quantum technologies and  i suspect that is part of the motivation   for our country being so forcefully behind  quantum information in the last few years it's hard to think of a time when we've had  such a big push in the us i mean it's almost   like that moonshot we had the jfa quote about  going to the moon this is like our version of   that moonshot there's a ton of funding in the us  behind this and i think it is to keep pace with   what other you know the european union is involved  in this too of course yeah so let's add like we we   don't know what's happening we only know what's  published right the people on this panel but um   you know china or groups in china have published  some very high profile papers and communication   and that definitely spurred people because this  was something that our country could understand   when they publish we can we can send the secure  key between a satellite and a ground station um   that was something that that perked up to people  that don't have training and quantum information   and and that changed the landscape a lot but if  you look at the technology in that demonstration   much of it was developed not in  china so so we still have like   you know we just didn't by we the united states is  not part of me but uh didn't put together all the   pieces and weren't striving to do that particular  demonstration at the time uh so there are two   questions from vishwas let's take the first  one how do you envision the classical computer   using the quantum accelerator distributing  itself across the temperature gradient from   room temperature to 15 millikelvin that is  will it suffice for the classical computer   to apart at the room temperature or are there  known applications that require lower latency   interaction and that's computing at like  lower temperatures like four kelvin or 77k   maybe I can take a stab at this one real  quick so you know I think there's a it's   important to think about the different types  of classical compute that are in the system   so first the the quantum computer is hybrid right  in terms of the algorithm itself we want to run   the solution or program we want to run there  will be both classical and quantum instructions   in that program right so first there's those  types of compute instructions right so that   are part of the algorithm then there's the  classical compute required to actually run   the quantum computer right how do we actually  tell the quantum computer to run its quantum   instructions we also need classical compute  to control the system and read out the system   additionally we talked about error correction  today throughout the panel error correction   requires a decoding algorithm and that decoding  algorithm is a classical algorithm right so we're   also running a classical algorithm that's looking  at the quantum computer getting signal the readout   signal coming right you're getting readout signal  you're taking in that signal and you're making a   pass to understand what's the best you know think  of it like a prescription right for for an ailment   you might have what's the best prescription I can  give you right now to help to help you feel better   right to help the quantum computer overcome its  noise so so we're constantly running that as well   in a fault tolerance system so so you have many  types of classical compute and these classical   compute systems can sit at different temperatures  right and not all quantum not all quantum systems   will be at really cold temperatures right that's  something to call out as well right the iron   trap system is very different than for example  the topological qubit system we're working on   so our system does sit at the mill kelvin  temperature range in terms of that quantum plane   where the qubits sit and so then you have to get  control signals through that temperature gradient   right all of that temperature change and there's  a lot of consideration in terms of thermal budget   in terms of noise right decoherence how will  it impact your qubits you can't heat up that   system so indeed some of that compute you want to  run in the cold in particular right when you're   controlling and reading out those qubits you  need some of that compute very near the qubits   or close in temperature to the qubits but some  of the compute at the algorithm level maybe even   the decoding level can sit outside the outside  of that cold environment and sit closer to room   temperature where you're you know where we all  live um so so you know you're going to tease that   apart and look at in terms of thermal budget and  noise what's the best architecture for all that   classical compute it's exciting just last year we  announced a cryo-CMOs system for control of qubits   and so this cryo-CMOs system actually runs CMOs  at you know at cold temperatures right you know   and it's it's divided from the qubit plane we run  a CMOs control chip we basically take a room of   electronics put it on a chip put it next to the  qubits and then we can control that qubit system   and that helps minimize also the amount you  know the number of wires you're having to run   into that fridge so if you're having to run you  know hundreds of wires into the fridge right it   could heat it up it also takes space so  with this new system that we um that we   published several months ago now we show that with  just three wires running into the fridge you can   you can achieve this cryo-CMOs control and  that can control tens of thousands of qubits so   there's lots of considerations in that classical  compute environment and then the thermal thermal   architecture of that yeah i think that's yeah  thank you um I'll take the next question to um how   do you see industry and academic labs cooperating  or competing in the quantum computing area so so one of the things that the us has done  to get forcefully behind these technologies   is set up there must be like a dozen new quantum  centers some funded through the department of   energy some through the NSF and they are  openly explicitly encouraging partnerships   between national average universities  and private industry and those have all   been set up now and it appears to me to be a  great model okay um thanks um can you speak   more on the different expectations for quantum  error correction algorithms for logical qubits   and for successful quantum quantum control schemes  for your hardware so it's sent to Dave but I think   other can also chime in maybe David you can  take it first yeah I mean so air correction's   a fascinating subject and I think it's it's um you  know the the thing that i think we what we don't   one of the things is is that we we we've spent  a lot of time thinking about different codes   that we could possibly use and different what  people call a threshold so the rate at which   if you're below the threshold and it's not just  a single number a crystal yellow if I say it's   a single number but there's some set of numbers  if you're if your system's below this and you're   there's this good region then air correction  sort of works as you scale the system up and I   think there's there's a lot of work to be done in  the near term to think about as we build this out   and think about different logical qubits than the  ones being considered there's a code the surface   code which dominates a lot of discussion because  there's a very good threshold and works really   well and I love the service code it's a beautiful  beautiful code but I I think especially in these   places where we have weird architectures it's not  at all obvious what the right code is going to be   and it's not just for ions whether you have this  interconnect there are other places where you   might think about reducing number of wires like  which Krysta mentioned right like you know if you   look at the pictures of Google's quantum computer  you'll see this amazing spaghetti monster of like   wires coming down right and literally you know  that's one of the main challenges for that system   is you know that just the amount of wiring getting  into the system is gigantic but imagine you had   you know a less number controlling more qubits  at the same time or something like this how do   we play these trade-offs so I think there's a  fascinating discussion about like how how that   architecture will will move forward and as always  I suspect that our current ideas will be looked   at in the past to sort of like oh what were they  thinking and that's why I'm I'm excited because   because these new things are coming right  thanks so there's another question is the   the quantum phase is an almost analog quantity  um is there a reason why we do not have many   analog classical computer now and I think this  kind of we're getting at the analog computers   are more efficient than digital computers for  some problems I am guessing the question is   for analog classical computer but maybe we can  also add like why not there is no place analog   quantum simulator my understanding is most of  them are digital quantum simulator so can anyone David and Chris I think you guys are the companies  for building content we could talk I mean the   you're probably I mean if you're you know the  simulation story is also very fascinating right   we have these systems we can build with large  numbers of qubits that can simulate other same   materials and you know the real question there is  are you doing exactly what you think you're doing   right which is a challenging question but you  can imagine that actually a lot of these will be   like some of the most fascinating useful things  in the short term if I can use a simulator to   simulate something related to high temperature  superconductivity that's an amazing system to sort   of be able to control and build and perhaps get  learning about what's going on without having this   more digital model of quantum computing so that's  one place where there's like a very positive you   know the reason these analog computers you know  the quantum computers aren't analog and we don't   see them all around is you know these systems  interact with their environment and they quickly   lose their their even their analog nature right  they really become kind of boring probabilistic   systems at some point and and that's sort of this  this this problem that like when you interact   with the quantum system it entangles with an  environment and loses its quantum quantum behavior   and so it loses that even that phase thing very  quickly okay I think this question probably bring   for you know you Chicago works closely with  argan and fermilab which are like fairly close   is it possible that pnl is going to create a  large quantum unit in put its own energy or maybe   a new national lab that focus on quantum would be  created here well you know we we have affiliations   there there's a there's an organization called the  northwest quantum nexus that involves Microsoft   and the universities in the northwest we are  also you know the lab is very large we are   we collectively at the lab are members of of  depending on which person up to three different   of these national quantum center including the  one centered at Argonne and so in a sense we   were already involved with those and at this time  I don't have there are no plans for anything new   beyond those I mean these new quantum centers are  the new big thing those are the partnerships right   so Krysta the cryosmus controller is it  developed by Microsoft yes yes we have so we have   labs around the world working on different  parts say different components in the system   and that controller was developed by David  Riley and our team at in Sydney, Australia   so he's located at the university of Sydney but we  have a team of Microsoft employees there working   and you can look up the paper on the  archive if you look up David Riley   you'll find it I think it's you know  one of the recent ones on his list there   so there's another comment but I think  we can ask this ques in a question that   from information theory when there has to be  some bit error rate and when it exceeds 0.5   it doesn't really work very well do we have  like a number for quantum that we can say David and Krista and I think Krista should  give a number just so I can hear her number   and then we can talk about  whether it's right or wrong so what was the is the number for the is it  the thr- are you saying threshold number or   the probability of I think it's a special number  I mean there's not a question it's a comment I   think but I think we can consider that what  is the threshold for meteorite for quantum   oh well it varies it varies in the early days  it was horrible let's just put it that way in   the early days the first codes and actually  there's a very interesting story there are   there are classical places where say you want  to compute in one dimension so you only have   one spatial dimension and you want to compute  classically right like I want to robustly store   classical information and compute and  it seems actually impossible because   in one dimension you only you don't have any way  to sort of know whether I'm in a sea of zeros or   a c of ones and it's actually possible to  do this and the threshold for that one is   I think it was estimated it's something like  it's some ridiculous number 10 to the minus   40 or something like that right so so we're  better than that one but people will give you   numbers that vary they'll say you know a half  a percent or they'll say it just depends on the   context that you're studying it too and that's  actually why it's kind of fascinating because   we sort of know that it's in some ways  context dependent so it may depend on   on what what's what what we actually do in the  in the real world when it actually comes down and   there's some beautiful papers actually about  that sort of problem like we really need to   build these things to understand what's going  on to see what the right code is to use so   yeah yeah I I agree with Dave you know I I did a  lot of papers in my earlier career on thresholds   and you know I say it varies because  depending which paper of mine you read   or paper in the community you read now right  there's been a lot more papers on this now   you'll see different numbers all over the place  and and that's because the assumptions are   different and so I I really I think of myself as  becoming more and more applied right I want to see   a quantum computer built and so we need to think  about a threshold right this this case where we   actually are looking at the architecture it's it's  run it's considering we're looking at the code   we're actually going to run we're considering all  of the environmental you know environment impacts   because that that matters right in practice we  can have a beautiful theoretical threshold number   but then in practice we may be  orders of magnitude away from that   and to really build a machine and scale up we  need to understand what that number's going to be   so it's an exciting time to move from that theory  where we have this beautiful theory that lays the   foundation and says hey it's possible we  can error correct yes okay and that error   correction you know that threshold in theory  isn't isn't so scary like 10 to the minus 40   um right you know you see half percent et cetera  right so so you know 10 minus 2 10 minus 3   in there you can you can you can actually error  correct that machine but you're going to need a   lot of qubits so I think it's a it's an exciting  time to really dig into the you know the guts of   that system and understand what the threshold  will be for these different architectures   and codes paired together there's another question  that does operating at higher frequency involved   trade-offs between operating temperature and  coherence times and if yes like kind of what are   the trade-offs and how it's going to be handled  yeah so like in the superconducting qubits you   know that that transition frequency is already  kind of large compared to the thermal temperature   so so that part is already solved but what can  happen is if you try to create or you try to treat   that qubit like like it's really just a two level  system you can fool yourself because you know   there really are those other levels and where it  comes in is in things like in the control pulses   you use to do like your pi pulses and so on you  know you're putting in a wave at some frequency   but you're turning it on and off very suddenly and  if you think about 48 transforms there are a lot   of other frequencies in that those frequencies  can actually drive you into that like two or   three state which are not useful cubit states  that you want and so you do have to watch out   for those limits built in the design and it's  built into the way they're operated and there are   some limits associated with them I I just want to  add that you know this what when people say oh we   have to work really really really low temperatures  otherwise we're going to have this thermal problem   this is not true of all physical systems that's  right so the other thing is you have to have a   coupling to your environment and that coupling  to your environment is not there you can work   at warmer temperatures and so it may be strange  but the NV center for example I was talking about   earlier its frequency is is three gigahertz  but it has a coherence time of one millisecond   at room temperature it can't operators at a  computer at room temperature because it turns out   to access that spin we have to go low temperature  through the optical transitions but but it can but   it it doesn't interact very strongly if in the  environment and so you don't necessarily have to   go to higher frequencies okay thank you everyone  so I think we had a lot of very good questions so   this maybe we are going to stop the q a right now  and then we are going to do close closing by Eric   okay great thank you that was super informative  and interesting thank you to all of our panelists   for all of the insights that you have and for  sharing your work we really appreciate your   being involved in this event and thank you to  all the attendees for coming and listening and   and asking good questions so um as you can see you  know quantum is totally happening in the northwest   and and actually the question to Kai Mei is  you know how that she answered we're poised   to become um definitely a world leader in this  area and and we're really really quite close so   I should mention also that that our department  electrical and computer engineering has two open   faculty positions we're looking for people  at the assistant professor level in quantum   information science and technology and this  is part of a university-wide strategy and for   our department it's it's part of a long-term  hiring strategy so these will be the first of   hopefully many um hires that we make in  this area and and ECE really wants to   fill in that gap in the stack that goes all the  way from the physics to the to the algorithms and   compilers I want to thank Arka and for and  Kai Mei for and Maryam for organizing this   event and I also really want to thank the Lytle  family and Louis Scharf and all the donors who   contributed to making today's events possible um  and I want to take thank Jessi and the- and Emily   and the advancement team and the PR team for for  organizing everything and don't forget that today   at 3:30 pacific time so if you're in a different  time zone that you have to add an hour or some   tracks um we'll have the the actual Lytle Lecture  and that'll be Scott Aaronson he's the professor   he's a professor um at UT Austin and the director  of their quantum information center and a really   really interesting and entertaining person um  so it'll be a really fantastic talk so please   attend that and i hope to see you  there so thank you very much again and   enjoy the rest of your your day  and think about quantum computing yeah you for having me on the panel  that was fun hi everyone thank you for   thank you thank you thank you this is great
