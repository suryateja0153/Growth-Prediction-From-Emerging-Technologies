 Google claims it has reached a key milestone using a quantum computer to complete a task that a classical computer couldn't manage achieving what they call quantum supremacy this would be the first time that a quantum computer has definitively beaten the best conventional computer it's something that physicists have been trying to do for years although not everyone is convinced that a normal computer would find this particular task impossible it certainly seems like the quantum processor solves it faster the task is a calculation that is not very useful it was designed just to demonstrate the quantum supremacy and was made to be especially difficult for normal computers to handle Google's quantum computer is called Sycamore it has just 53 qubits quantum versions of the bits that encode information and a computer these behave completely differently to regular bits and very hard to manipulate but in theory they should allow the computer to carry out certain kinds of calculations way faster than a classical machine the calculation in this test was to figure out the probability distribution of all the possible outcomes from a quantum random number generator because the generator creates random numbers using quantum operations simulating this distribution on a classical computer is extremely tough but Google's machine only needed to set herself up like the generator and then run those operations a bunch of times Sycamore produced an answer in just three minutes and twenty seconds but proving quantum supremacy means facing off against classical competition for that research has borrowed the supercomputing might of the summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee by breaking up the problem into smaller chunks and then extrapolating they estimate that summit would take 10,000 years to finish the same calculation if true this means that a quantum computer can do something that is in practice impossible on a classical machine quantum super embassy but not everyone agrees IBM is released a paper claiming that the summit supercomputer could actually complete the task in just two-and-a-half days by using a slightly different technique scientists will now scrutinize both camps calculations but even if IBM is right it's still significant the sycamore is so much faster than the supercomputer it's the first time that this kind of quantum speed-up has ever been shown it wouldn't be the standard definition of quantum supremacy but physicists think it's a big deal and although we're still decades from harnessing the full potential quantum computers and maybe years from doing anything particularly useful at all this achievement tells us that quantum computing is edging ever closer to those goals you [Music]
