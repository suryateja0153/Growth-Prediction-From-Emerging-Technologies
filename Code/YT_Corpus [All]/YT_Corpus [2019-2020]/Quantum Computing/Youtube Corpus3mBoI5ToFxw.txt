 um so um you we know about moore's law this moe's law uh is basically an empirical observation of how powerful our computers systems become um and what this law says um is since the early 70s for the last 50 years every 18 months every year and a half our computers have become um twice as powerful and what that means is over the course of uh 30 years our computers have become more powerful by a factor above about a million um and then over the course of 60 years we project our computers will be more powerful by a factor of a trillion but we see that the moore's law in in all practical uh purposes is slowing down because our ability to make the devices uh that form these computational machines the transistors smaller and smaller we're running into limitations you cannot make a transistor that is smaller than a single atom for example uh you know even with the moore's law even if this exponential uh growth in our computational capabilities uh there are important problems that will always become uh be way beyond the reach of standard computers and these are important problems like optimization material functions chemical structures logistics and you know these actually form foundations of many of the computational uh challenges and economic driving drivers of our of our economy today so um you know what uh can quantum computers do and where are we um and we believe that a very powerful point of computer when realized we'll be able to shed a lot more insight on how to tackle these important problems going forward um so i'm going to then tell you about some of the technology that we have been developing uh called the qb technology from inq and you look at this figure and there's a little chip and that chip looks like a little bow tie right that chip is about two centimeters on the side and you see a series of blue dots on top that is actually a blow up of the individual atoms that we trap um to use as quantum bits and there are in this picture there are about 80 individual atoms that we use as qubits the separation between the qubits is about um five micrometers and which is about 20th of the width of your hair and this 80 individual atoms occupy about half a millimeter of space which is you know very very small space half of just a this will be a half a millimeter i and that's basically where 80 quantum bits can reside and if we have a full if again full control over this 80 qubits that quantum state becomes much more complicated than what you can describe using all the classical computational powers that we have available to us today okay and we out of these uh we are building our capabilities to fully control and execute computational tasks on this on these machines um for example this is an example of how we manipulate the qubits so that picture on the at the bottom is our um is our chip that where we manipulate the qubits uh individual atoms are loaded in the loading zone and then we can actually change the voltages to bring these atoms together and here we're adding atoms one by one to a chain and we have uh programmed our system to to load exactly 23 uh individual atoms and they can be actually made prepared and get made available for for quantum computers so this is how we actually prepare our quantum register uh where are we today with this and what can this um what can this potentially do the the the challenge is we we all know about artificial intelligence or machine learning big data you know this is kind of has it really provided us with a very powerful tool um to control and understand and control um how things behave based on accumulative data okay so all of this typically start from the big data on the left um and this is where you know data is collected and this is enabled by the massive uh deployment of uh data collection devices like your your cell phones yeah and that um collects data uh from whether you're it's your shopping pattern or your your travel pattern whether you get onto a bus or or um or subway all of those transactions can be recorded um and then you accumulate this data that shows how people behave or for example um but that is just just massive data and you you cannot actually recognize um how what information that that data by itself is is presenting uh so what you need is you have to do the analytics and this is you you actually parse the data look at the data and and try to discover the patterns of what people are saying doing right uh for example what's the trend of online shopping this week or you know what where are people traveling um next weekend or during our chuseok break all of that analytics can be performed and from there we actually extract a model okay in this model um is a simplified uh framework to understand uh the behavior that is presented by this data okay so we have to once we have the data we have to uh perform the analytics and from the analytics we have to create the model and once you have the model then you can start to predict okay and that's kind of what the what the power of ai and ml machine learning is for example if you have a lot of collection of data of how young people listen to music and then you can actually start to recommend what this person would want next based on that pattern so the model allows you to predict um and then actually make projections of of what the future opportunities are what are some of the addressable uh applications that we can think about today um the quantum computers we have built are are highly reconfigurable because all of the computations that we do is entirely software programmed by uh tailoring the the laser pulses that we apply to these things um and then uh it is uh we believe that you can solve very difficult problems in in many industry sectors uh for example if you look at pharmaceuticals um you know that i think on on the first day professor hennessey mentioned that finding drug discovery is a very very expensive process today and that is because the drug molecules are basically quantum mechanical objects these molecules are structured and they behave due to the laws of quantum physics and just like quantum computers there is just so many possibilities that modeling these molecules with classical computers turns out to be extremely challenging okay so how do you search through a very large space of molecular structures that can actually perform certain chemical reactions to to kind of help with the therapeutics or diagnosis that turns out to be a very expensive proposition and we believe that a very powerful quantum computer can help understand those molecular structures extremely well and those molecular structures obviously are important in energy sectors and transportation sectors in energy sectors for example people are trying to understand how to build more efficient batteries how they can store and and more and more more energy and extract it more efficiently and those are typically based on chemical processes and there is a similar set of challenges in materials research transportation sector is very interested in this because well you know when you have traffic patterns or you you're trying to assign or design an airplane networks um the number of possibilities to create that that network is is very large and it's very difficult to sort through or parse through all possibilities and come up with the most efficient uh transportation networks so there's a lot of interest in the transportation industry uh to think about quantity using quantum computers to solve their problems and of course in finances the market models and portfolio optimizations these are are highly critical and also potentially profitable areas where the computational capability is not just not able to keep up with the opportunities the world knowledge forum
