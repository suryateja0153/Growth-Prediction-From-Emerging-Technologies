 all right good morning everyone it's my pleasure to be here today with you and to share some lectures and brian how do we pull up the lectures now all right perfect all right so thank you for coming to this lecture to learn how real qubits really work it's really my pleasure to be here today and as brian said i'll pause every 5 or 10 minutes or so to take your questions because the next three hours are really your time the next six hours of my lecture will answer what is a qubit the kind of superconducting qubit you may have already logged into in the cloud and experimented on how can you design control and measure a real superconducting qubit and also i'd like to focus on the question of why why are these the right important questions to ask i think these are valuable and practical stepping stones that you will need in your career in quantum to be successful and the next six hours of these lectures will give you the ideas and the skills needed to grow in this field so what lies on the road ahead for us today as you can see it's a windy road and we'll start over here at the very beginning and we'll chart a narrow path but a very deep and long path meaning we'll we'll go pretty far but start very introductory the first topic i'll get into is what's the big picture right going between your computer through a system in the cloud through some devices superconducting qubits in this case all the way to the bloch sphere or in other words how do we take the block sphere and actually realize it in practice and that will bring us to the second part which is quantum physics and the physics of real atoms the quantization of energy levels and the fact that there are actually no qubits there is no such thing as a real qubit in life there are only two level approximations where we can usually take two levels from a much larger system and pretend that it's a cubit but it works really well in the case of the kinds of superconducting qubits that you have been experimenting on and playing with that will take us into discussing what is the transmon qubit it's the prototypical or the main bread and butter super conducting uh quantum bit which implements these two levels that you play with and now also you can explore these higher levels using some new features like kisket pulse and that will allow you to take advantage of a lot more physics and potential that we haven't really been able to explore before with just two levels but we can now leverage the much larger space of possibilities now to really describe what a superconducting qubit is or what a real atom is or an artificial atom i'll go back and review the classical circa theory and the classical harmonic oscillator this will be very familiar to most of you but i'll try to add a bit of a twist to how we see it and try to build a little more intuition which can help guide us on our path leaping into the quantum unveiling the quantum oscillator or the quantum harmonic oscillator which will be the building block of all the tools and all the superconducting devices both transmog qubits the way we read them out the way we control and manipulate them and as some physicists like to think or say they're really only spins and oscillators and everything else just reduces onto a spin or an oscillator and finally that will lead us into the last hour of the talk which will be on the details of the transbon qubit going from the basics of how do we move from the harmonic oscillator to actually a non-linear or so-called and harmonic oscillator look at its wave functions the way it's described and then it's experimental signatures how would it look like in a spectroscopy experiment how do i control it to do a robbie rotation how do i calibrate it right all of the practical questions all the stepping stones needed to actually build uh the logical circuits that we implement the control not gays the the x the hadamards etc and also to take advantage of the more rich and dynamic space in which the qubit exists in libs and that will be for today and tomorrow we'll pick up with measurements now this lecture i view as both introductory and skill reaffirming meaning we'll take a big step back you don't really need to know much going in but we will go far we will go quite far that means that some sections will preview advanced material i'll try to label those and denote those with the donald uh newt's dangerous bent symbol so if this is the first time you're going through some of this material you can skip pastels or just take a cautionary sign here and the idea is that we'll use examples simple basic examples things you've probably already seen however these examples serve as stepping stones to very practical problems in the very practical way that we actually realize qubits and the idea here is to extract the macro from the micro the very simple things we will illustrate today really carry over and describe most of the physics of the entire field they're just the roots of it and everything else grows on top and so i will try to be as step by step as possible in the derivations and in the way i go from a classical circuit to a quantum circuit or from the quantum circuit to the transition spectrum and so forth of course please ask questions or write your questions down and post them in the channel brian will get to those get those two mias as soon as we can and finally this is very tightly integrated with lab work by dr nick braun and co i'll try to avoid the fire hose of information and someone shared this graphic with me when i was trying to prepare this lecture and i thought it was a good reminder to try to chart a narrow path and and focus on a few key points as much as possible while exposing you to the much larger picture so let's begin with the big picture i think all of you at this point from the first few lectures in the summer school have seen that a qubit consists of two energy levels typically denoted by a zero cat and a one ket energy levels were a picture proposed by newsborn in 1913. now you saw that this picture is a bit of an abstract thing and the way that these quantum states actually get represented or the really physical distinct number of distinguishable potential states are infinite and we can represent them on the bloch sphere now finally how does this very abstract picture of energy levels in block sphere actually occur in the cloud all right now this is a picture of a real device one of the devices i think you may log into and this is a fridge now not the kind of fridge of course you have in your home this is a very very expensive fridge that can go to very low temperatures for reasons that we'll see in a minute but the quantum bit the actual physical quantum bit sits at the very bottom of this fridge and everything else is input output wiring in the more recent days they have of course turned to look a quite a bit more stylish and this particular case housing this fridge was done by the same company that does nimona lisa and i thought that was very cute now what's inside of this fridge let's take one of these dilution fridges and zoom in unveil what's inside of it by removing the outer can and that usually shows us a picture that looks very much like this we call this the golden chandelier and this is a superconducting dilution fridge inside where you see a lot of cables going in and out it is actually gold-plated the point here is though that everything that is quantum really sits only at the very bottom in this little micro in this little shield at the very very bottom of the fridge and it operates at 15 millikelvin that's negative 273.13 celsius and we'll see why that temperature has to be so low now inside of this shield unveiling several other shields you see a picture of a chip like this this is a super conducting qubit chip and what you see here is a device with a number of quantum bits qubits which we'll delve into today which are housed on this substrate or chip back here which can be silicon or sapphire or some other dielectric and a number of readouts these squiggly superconducting coplanar waveguides indicate readout resonators and as i'll discuss in the rest of this stock the superconducting qubits are also a type of resonator a type of microwave resonator and in this lecture today we will focus on how do we create and define the quantum bit or qubit if i zoom in on the picture here it's this little structure composed of these two metallic pads connected by some sort of inductor or non-linear wire that it actually supports the physical picture of the block sphere and we'll talk a little bit about an intermediate step of the representation because these at the end of the day are oscillators microwave oscillators or electromagnetic oscillators oscillations of the electromagnetic field which we can represent using circuits perhaps the kind of circuits you studied way back when except that now these are going to be quantum circuits and we'll see how we can make a transition from the classical world to the quantum world and describe the very unique features of quantum with these circuits and how they allow us to support the hilbert space in which we do the logical computation and at the end of this lecture we will derive the hamiltonian which describes exactly how this qubit originates that brings us to circuit quantum electrodynamics and keep it in the cloud so let me give you the big picture of the summary of the flow you have a laptop which you might log into which can then send some information that controls a fridge inside of this fridge at the very bottom of this dilution refrigerator sits the qubit chip this cubic chip then allows you to support in the abstract sense here where we're now moving to the abstract electromagnetic circuits with electric and magnetic fields which themselves allow you to create this type of block sphere to con and then to control it manipulate it and so forth and they also allow you to measure it so that information can flow back from the hilbert space all the way through the circuit up the fridge and to your laptop and back and so this closes the feedback loop and today we'll focus on how the qubit originates from this circuit as well as how we can really connect the very physical picture to the very abstract hilbert space and i think this is the this is where i'll pause for questions so let's see brian if there any questions yet uh [Music] i want to remind everyone uh if you have questions about things not related to zlatko's lecture such as labs final project any of that please use the discord or email me we're not going to be able to spend time answering those during lecture so a first question we have here uh about um zach this is kind of a personal question for you but the question is what's your personal favorite flavor of super conducting qubit and why and maybe you could also add in if there's any cutting edge kind of super conducting qubits that uh that aren't fully functional yet but that you are really interested in maybe share some weight on those as well so that's an is an unexpected question thank you um i have two flavors i have the flavor that i like to sit down and and write everything about which is the one i'll describe in this uh discussion today it's called the transmon qubit uh it's perhaps the simplest qubit and i like the simplicity of it because it allows you to illustrate pretty much all the most of the general ideas very simplistically more generally yes i i like very exploratory super conducting qubits and most of the ones we haven't anticipated yet including the hybrid ones of course the fluxonium is a favorite of mine that i've you know measured and played with a lot uh and now people are very excited about the zero pi qubit and uh variations of it so that gives you a little bit of a flavor of it you know i don't get the ice cream with the one scoop but with the several scoops i love it all right i think that's one for now we'll let you go back to your lecture and find more questions later all right thank you and uh i'll try to point out some differences between maybe the very simplistic transmog qubit we have here which is the bread and butter and actually what you log into through kiskit but maybe also some of the variations to what other types of qubits look like all right so that brings us from idea to reality let's get into some of the concepts again the qubit implements two levels and a hilbert space all right these are two pictures that are interconnected for the more advanced of you have left a little question slash note down here for if you're interested in this now for the rest of us how do we realize um this these two levels in practice and so that will get me to talk about real super or real atoms and let me back up to get everyone on the same page so for the more advanced students i apologize but i hope this will get us all on the same page and all the way back to the origins of quantum physics imagine a cloud of atoms right each of these pictures here is an individual atom and this is essentially how all experiments in physics quantum physics were done until circa 1980. now you can take this cloud of atoms put it under subjected to some excitation such as a voltage source here and it will glow it will shine you can feed that light through some lens some thin ribbon and a prism the prism will split out the different frequency components of the light and what's what physicists observed is that the light that gets split out from the cloud of atoms comes out only in certain colors such as you know red green purple and so forth and so if you look at a spectrum of the light and this is an actual measured spectrum of h2 you'll notice that you get very discrete distinct colors lines this motivated people to look at very various atoms and they noticed that each atom had a different structure hydrogen had one set of discrete lines helium had a second set neon had a third set sodium a fourth and so on that led um bohr and company to propose that atoms are different from classical mechanics in that the energy can only take certain discrete amounts or levels can only be in certain discrete levels and this helps explain why the transitions appear in these discrete but not continuous emissions so the atom can only emit at a particular frequency because the energy can only be either 0 or 1 and not 0.5 nothing in the middle so to speak you know that's the colloquial language to say it of course you'll recognize this in the recent july 4th fireworks some of you may have seen and each of the different uh fireworks rep is has different atoms which of course give off a different set of frequencies all right and that brings us to the atomic energy levels and transitions an atom quite often for the electron has a potential energy landscape of one over r and so this is where you can write down the potential energy say as a function of the radius and it typically goes like something one over r where r is the radius between uh say the atom and the electron over here the atom nucleus and this potential now normally in a regular system the atom can have any energy it could be a particle here here or here the idea is that in quantum of course these energy levels are quantized denoted by these red lines now they're not just quantized in any way they're quantized in a very special way what we call an harmonic and harmonicity means that the energy levels are not spaced equally what that means is that if you apply a laser that shines some microwave light or optical light at the atom and the atom starts say in the ground state and is subjected to a force that tries to steer the atom from the ground state to the first excited state once the atom is in the first excited state because here i'll assume that the frequency of this laser is tuned exactly to the transition frequency between the first and zeroth level the atom can then no longer steer the atom from the first state to any other higher level here because of the antheminicity meaning that there's no level uh that the frequency of the laser can take this atom to that's up above where the height of this arrow represents the frequency of the laser that's very special because what it means is that when we shine this atom it really only acts or interacts when we shine the light it only interacts with the atom when it's in the lowest two energy levels and this allows us to isolate a qubit subspace right and for a real atom to really just work with the lowest two levels so that's the basic idea then how you take one of these um atoms into a two qubit subspace it's also very important that this atom is isolated from the environment so the thermal fluctuations and noise in the environment doesn't destroy the quantum coherence and quantum properties of the atom okay and the and its energy level diagram allows for very specific control and also for very high and good readout the atom in that sense is low loss however again main message here is that it's not a two level system and there are no two level systems in reality there's always a coupling to some other degree of freedom which really creates more than two levels and that will be exactly the case as we move into the superconducting world atoms are very nice however they come with certain properties and we'd like to be able to engineer everything about the atom so my personal flavor of atoms is artificial atoms created by electromagnetic circuits which can mimic the electromagnetic properties of atoms and also have quantized levels and so that will bring us into very quickly the next section brian are there any questions at this point uh yes i am going to go through and pick up we've got a lot of good questions but i think one that maybe we want to tackle right here at the beginning is actually i saw four or five people ask the same question about the chandelier itself you showed the gold-plated chandelier and you explained that this is our quantum computing setup uh but a lot of people actually didn't understand there's a lot of loops uh the gold itself uh yes exactly that picture uh so i was hoping if you could walk through and explain to people why it's gold-plated and what all those loops actually do yeah great question thank you so it's gold-plated because we like gold it's gold-plated because gold doesn't rust because gold is an incredibly good thermal conductor and because it's soft basically the gold has very nice material properties which are very nice for things like thermalization and preventing so why thermalization notice that at the very bottom here i said this operates at 15 degrees so 0.015 kelvin above absolute zero up here at the very top we operate at 300 kelvin room temperature there must be some source that's cooling this thermal load at the bottom to this temperature and that's in the mixing chamber which is i think somewhere here in the back in order to create a thermal link that can take away the heat from from this element to that cooling source we need to have a good conduction something that doesn't enter in that doesn't isolate between the very cold and the very hot and so gold is a very good thermal conductor and it allows you to press two metals very hard together and get a nice thermal contact whereas a hard metal usually doesn't allow you to do that it also doesn't oxidize very much so it it has a very thin oxide layer which you can break through easily which helps with the conduction all the loops also have to do with thermalization when things get cold they tend to change in size and as the fridge changes in size as you heat it up and cool it down it stretches and if you have a very taunt metal cable it can get snapped quite physically it can get pulled apart from its connectors and so the loops allow you to to give some mechanical flexibility or pliability to the cable as you have thermal shrinking and expansion thank you brian was that answering the question yep perfect back to you perfect all right okay so artificial atoms these artificial atoms will consist of capacitors and inductors and i'll you know spend quite some nice time talking about that now very much like the enharmonic degree of freedom the harmonic oscillator that is set up by an inductor and capacitor which allows electromagnetic energy to slosh back and forth between the capacitor which say has negative charges and positive charges flowing back and forth and we'll get into that in a minute it has a potential energy landscape that looks very much like that of the atom in a way except that it's typically quadratic in say the charge or in what i like to think of here is the magnetic flux across that coil this quadratic energy landscape also has uh only finite levels the quantum physics allows you to get into and will derive exactly what those are if we now couple this circuit to an input output transmission line something just like the laser that allows you to guide waves in and out of the structure to subject it to forces and control it you notice that if i send in a microwave or a wave at a particular frequency let's say omega 0 1 that's the frequency of this wave up here if the atom starts in the ground state then the microwave light has energy it can transfer a photon that takes it from the ground state over here to the first excited state now once it's in the excited state if i keep shining the light that laser can again provided another photon of energy that can stimulate it to go up to the next level and up to the next and so forth in other words i i have no individual control that allows me to isolate the lowest two energy levels here i cannot isolate this level and this level just like we did in the atom and that's because the spacing between these lines you notice is equal or harmonic in other words and that's why in this talk we'll introduce a non-linearity which will open up the potential and make it softer as the particle climbs in the in energy and so we'll make this inductor oops a tunable inductor a nonlinear inductor tunable in the sense that its inductance will change as a function of how much energy is stored in it and that will open up this potential and allow us to isolate the atom uh of the qubit in the lowest two levels and that's really the core idea of everything we'll discuss in the next hour and two hours and a half except we'll go through a lot more technical rigor and detail and physical pictures of how this actually happens and how do we describe it and what are the consequences and and how this really shapes what a logical qubit is for us today okay so then to summarize the very big picture overview there's the idealization of the qubit which has two energy levels say zero and one and this hilbert space is really realized in an n-harmonic oscillator which has transition frequencies between energy levels that are not equal to each other due to a non-linearity the way that that and harmonic oscillator is created and modeled is through a circuit which really describes a physical device real electrons moving in real metals and real real supported by real dielectrics and so we move from the level of idealization to the level of physical reality and in the following i'd like to spend a little bit more time discussing the physical reality and then take us all the way back up to the idealization in the rest of the talk for now i'll focus on these two parts and that brings us to circuit quantum electrodynamics where i'll give a bit of a macroscopic overview now you've noticed that we've moved away from spins quite a bit more and more towards oscillators and i like to discuss this joke with my friends there are two kinds of physicists those who believe all of physics is spins and those who believe all of oscillators all physics is oscillators maybe you can guess which one your host today is now as we saw the ingredients of circuit quantum electrodynamics really consist of microwave oscillators which come in a variety of shapes forms sizes and so forth such as these coplanar waveguide oscillators these squiggly lines here which we will describe today at the quantum level as well as these trans-bond qubits which implement the non-linear and harmonic oscillators which provide the actual superconducting qubit all of these might all of these physical devices we can represent with very simple lumped element model circuit elements such as capacitors inductors which you've probably seen in your high school physics class and of course josephson tunnel junctions a key ingredient to the non-linearity which is low loss and and very well behaved that i'll get into in the later part as well as the input output elements that can allow you to control and measure these and the goal of circuit quantum electrodynamics is to combine these elements just like you can combine the same ingredients and make them into a burrito or a taco or a different flavor of food in various and unique ways and essentially form the basis of most of our field now at this point you might be asking yourself wait a minute these are just circuits i've seen circuits what's so special about them how are they quantum well is your microwave quantum and you might say it doesn't you know you need low loss quantum systems are very precarious i need to have very little dissipation well a microwave is actually not too bad it has a quality factor of 10 to the four so the microwave mode in there is pretty high but it also needs to be isolated from the environment right thermal fluctuations need to be very very low relative to the frequencies of interest and this is why a microwave isn't the quantum object because the temperature is so much higher than the energy spacing between those levels so essentially all quantumness gets washed out very quickly a microwave is also not quantum because it lacks non-linearity and it doesn't have a lot of and we'll see that one more aspect that's important for circuit quantum electrodynamics is large quantum vacuum fluctuations and i'll define what those are in a minute so to get all of these nice properties we need superconductivity which will allow us to have small dissipation isolation from the environment it works at low temperatures already so that gets taken care of however we also need to have nonlinearity something that creates a non-linear potential so we can have anachronicity and for that we'll use the non-linear and very robust effect of the joseph centennial junction for which brian josephson which brian joseph predicted and won a nobel prize for and to give you a more of a picture of where does this all physically sit in the large scheme of things here's a picture you may have seen from nasa which describes the wavelength of electromagnetic light the frequency of electromagnetic light which goes all the way from sort of radio frequency up to microwaves to wi-fi and and goes into the visible light and all the way towards x-ray and gamma rays up here and we can relate the frequency to an effective temperature of the body through about through blackbody radiation or maybe through the simple equation here and i can give you an order of magnitude of where things sit the fridge has to be at the lowest temperature the environment in which the superconducting qubit operates sets at about 10 to the minus 2 kelvin so roughly here in the temperature range very very close to absolute zero the superconducting circuits we'll operate with have frequencies resonant frequencies on the order of 10 gigahertz which is about half a kelvin which is much larger than the fridge temperature but as you can see is really really low energy relative to visible light or really most of the other electromagnetic phenomena we see in our everyday life and the wavelength of these is about three centimeters the optical transitions you see in fireworks or are get controlled in atomic nuclei tend to be in the visible spectrum and have a much larger range but the photons and the energy we'll talk about today in microwave oscillators is is in that sense very low energy and in the next rest in the next slides i'll get into a lot more detail and for those of you who want to see more depth or follow up with more reading here a few references you can pause in the playback and dive into after this lecture if you're interested and that brings us to the world of circuit quantum electrodynamics and brian i think i'll pause and take any questions okay so one question uh before we dive into any of the hard science questions which i know are coming so if you've asked one of those already just hang tight um but just one final question kind of about the setup that we at ibm have chosen to use um one person was asking with all the different candidates why is it that ibm decided to go with superconducting qubits that's a good question um i guess there's a story there which may be written up somewhere but the the research group here of course um well ibm has a very long history with superconduct with superconductivity it really pioneered some of the early work on superconducting classical processors and and has quite a spectacular fab for super connectivity and a lot of expertise in this field so there was a natural point of connection and transition there from the early days of josephson junctions and a lot of the key research back in the day was done was done at the facility that we work at today and in the 80s and earlier days quantum effects in those junctions and those nonlinear circuits were completely ignored and really out of reach but with the advent of technology and science we were able to you know isolate those circuits minimize the noise reduce the temperature enough and start to understand their quantum behavior and show that in fact a super con a superconducting circuit a circuit which consists of billions of electrons can actually behave macroscopically as a single degree of freedom just like the position of the electron around the nucleus and these effects i think then led to um a very exciting new field which said wow you can suddenly create your atoms as you want artificial atoms in a way you can engineer the energy level diagram in any way you want something you can't really do with real atoms they come in the varieties that they're given to you and superconducting circuits have as i show at the end of this talk i had a tremendous trajectory in terms of their growth and coherence times and control parameters and of course they're in a way the most analogous to classical computers so you know naively you can see a path to scala to scaling to large architectures very quickly because they use printed or they use microlithography nanofabrication in very much the same way that conventional computers do and so that motivates a nice analogy between classical computers done with you know cmos technology and quantum computers which uh that when done with superconducting circuits are also on silicon chips and metals and so forth and i and i i think that you know they they are particularly exciting and very promising so maybe that gives you a bit of the flavor perfect good luck thank you very much okay good that brings us to the world of circus and to do quantum you often have to start with classical and in part that's because in quantum a lot of things have a really nice analog analogy that can be really understood in uh classical physics very well so we're going to spend some nice time on a classical oscillator which will really explain a ton about the quantum oscillator and we'll go over some very basic things you may have seen but with a twist here's a transmon qubit in the picture of a real device let me show you now a picture of a transmog qubit that i've drawn here as an illustration kind of zoomed in where you see that we have a substrate which is some sort of dielectric such as silicon there are two metal pads just pieces of metal on top of it just like a classical circuit so far that you might find in your iphone or android or what have you and somewhat especially these two metallic pads of the superconducting transmon qubit are connected by some sort of inductor which here i've just depicted for illustration purposes as a box and in general this will be some kind of nonlinear inductor as as a joe such as a joseph and tunnel junction which we'll get into later now let me give you a bit of a physical picture as to what actually happens and why this is an oscillator in the first place and what's actually oscillating these metal pads of course have many electrons and by applying an electric field across them you can create a displacement where you shuttle some of the positive or negative charges from one island to the other island and so these green circles here indicate a net positive charge the red circles indicate a net negative charge typically in one of these metallic islands they're about 10 to the 12 mobile electrons to give you an idea of how many electrons are involved in this now in practice this is going to be a very low temperature which means that these electrons condense into superconducting pairs so-called cooper pairs and they move without dissipation we can label the charges on one island as plus q and they can vary on time and the charges on the other island is minus q of course there's conservation of charge charge doesn't get destroyed or created so we can only slosh charges back and forth between the two islands through this little bridge this variable q which will describe the charges has support on the full real line of course an electric charge a net electric charge creates an electric field which in general depends on position and time it can oscillate and if you have an electric field that electric field can then be used to define a voltage between one pad and the other pad so i can say that the voltage here and this is not a detail you need to get very acquainted with i just want to illustrate the bigger point but the voltage here is related to how much electric field lines link one pad to the other pad and it goes from ra which is pad a to rb which is pad b it doesn't matter which way you draw it and the voltage is again a number between minus infinity and infinity now there is something very special about this particular structure and that's that because the frequencies we'll operate at are relatively low compared to uh to the inner modes of the structure in other words the wavelength will be very large compared to the dimensions of this little transbond which by the way is you know the dimensions here about 100 microns across so they're relatively small this transmon is these two metal pads are in the so-called lump element regime and we can model them as a very simple capacitor you've seen before feynman has a very nice discussion of how this happens between maxwell's equations and these this very simple relationship here where you can say that the charge in one island is related to the voltage by a value c where c is called the capacitance and it's a number between zero and infinity and of course we denote that in electrical language with a symbol like this if a charge moves from one island across the bridge to another island that creates a current defined by the positive test charge here moving across of course it leaves behind depletion and moving across to this island it changes the charge because charge is conserved we can of course write down this universal relationship that is valid for all quantum circuits which says that the rate of change of charge on the island is equal to the current in this case the current through this junction or equivalently that the charge is equal to the integral from the start of the world so to speak the start of the circuit all the way to the time t it's just integrating how much charge has gone left or right through this bridge keeping track of it in circa theory we keep the initial conditions uh fixed at minus infinity t minus infinity is just a label it could be t equals zero it's some reference state but we'll keep those initial conditions zero and the current of course is also on the support of minus infinity to infinity now for the more advanced of you who've seen some of this material before i'll just draw a cautionary tale that we have chosen the reference direction of the voltage and current opposite to each other and that's important for later writing the lagrangian in a nice way now what happens when a charge tunnels or travels from one side of one island to the other side of the other island it can create an electromagnetic field moving charges create magnetic fields and a lot of magnetic fields can create a magnetic flux the magnetic flux is we denote by this variable phi of t it can be related to the voltage across these two metal pads by a very simple relationship this is essentially a lumped element version of faraday's law of induction and it's a universal relationship one that holds for all circuits for all branches independent of their nature constitution the magnetic flux is again the time integral from the reference state to time t of the voltage just like the charge and similarly the rate of change of magnetic flux or how many of these electric magnetic field lines are here depends on the voltage between these two metal plates and we'll pick again for the initial conditions that the flux is at time zero equal to zero and the magnetic flux lives on an infinite support between minus infinity and infinity i'm emphasizing here the support of these variables where they're actually mathematically defined because quite often in circuit theory there's a question as to whether the variable across these two pads is compact or non-compact meaning does it go between 0 and 2 pi because these are superconductors or can you just use a variable that goes from minus infinity to infinity and there is a very simple again relationship that i recommend feynman's book on which describes that you can in the lymph element regime link the magnetic flux phi to the current that flows through this junction with l being the inductance and brian maybe i should pause and take any questions at this point yeah i'm looking through we have a lot of questions coming uh in at a pretty wide uh spectrum if you will of answers but i've seen a few people asking about the bridge that you're discussing right now in fact um i know this is probably a straightforward question but they want to know is that bridge itself acting as an inductor thank you absolutely yes so great question so this bridge here and i've purposefully not specified what kind of bridge it is because it could be anything it could be a linear inductor it's just a piece of wire it could be a jose and tunnel junction which is a superconducting element it could also be a nanowire it could be an atomic point contact it could be a variety of things but the essential thing is that whatever it is it has some relationship inductive relationship between the current the flows through it the amount of charge and the magnetic flux that gets established and and that constitutes an inductor so the the orange bridge here is the inductor awesome thank you good and um i see that we're coming up on 10 o'clock so i think maybe i'll take one or two more questions and then head for a 10-minute break sure let's do one more question i'm just going through i'm sorry uh going through right now um i'll give you the top voted question um can we use a quantum computer so it's a little off topic i apologize but can we use a quantum computer to find the path of least action in a lang lang gren language mechanics i'm sorry for mispronouncing that so poorly oh lagrangian mechanics i presume yeah yes that's that is and that is an interesting question well yes i you can set up an optimization problem um i i guess it depends maybe a little bit on how complicated your problem is but in principle yes we will get into lagrangians in a couple of slides after the break which will be our path and stepping stone towards the hamiltonian description first the classical hamiltonian which will very quickly turn into a quantum hamiltonian and that will lead us to describe exactly this structure you see here in much more detail of course underneath all the theory what i haven't described or won't describe in great detail is that we're optimizing an an action integral or a particular path although i will introduce the classical action angle variables very briefly which will talk about that which will be the analog of the quantum bosonic ladder operators the raising and lowering operators and a dagger
