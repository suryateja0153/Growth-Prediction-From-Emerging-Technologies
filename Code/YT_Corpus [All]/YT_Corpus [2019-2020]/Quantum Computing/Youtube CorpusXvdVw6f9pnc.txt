 hi everyone my name is Maryann I'm a former physicist turned data scientist and this is urine also former physicist and now he works in finance but I first want to know something about you how many people came here to hear about quantum computing oh that's good a lot how many came here to hear about cats ah even better even better one of you is going to be disappointed maybe both so the reason why we're talking about this is back when I was still in grad school there was some talk about quantum computers and well they used to say a lot of big things about quantum computing then already but the criticism was always ok but what can you do they will talk about yours algorithm and about factorizing prime numbers and how that would affect cryptography and then if you ask them all right but what does that do they could say well we can tell you that 15 is factorized by 5 and 3 and I would say yeah but so can i you know it's not very impressive but really why we're here is we we have this conference and there's all these talks that that are about making you more productive and about writing better code making fewer mistakes but we're we're getting all too good at our job you're all you're a way too good and all your code is way too way to error-free it does what you wanted to do you test it continuously you get great code reviews so we also want to add some more excitement in your lives by teaching you something that'll that'll make your code buggier and perform less well and more add more surprise to everything that you do so you're welcome we're we're here the hell so what has changed since we first heard about quantum computers and that we learned the magic fact that's 15 is 5 times 3 well this is quite timely because while we were preparing this talk google claims to have reached quantum supremacy so what quantum supremacy means basically is that are they found that they can now do something with a quantum computer that you couldn't do with a classical computer even a supercomputer so the holidays are coming up and I'm going to be going home and I want to buy my mom something different and I want to do something fun so should I buy her a quantum computer so the question is let's say I want to fork over I don't know how much it costs but let's say I want to fork over that cash what can i buy for my money so I've just made a spec sheet I thought you know that's how you make decisions what can you buy you know if you buy a classical computer and what can you get with a quantum computer so well should I buy her opponent computer its course you should all right well sell it to me well it's on the laughs you have to stand it until CPU probably in the laptop you're presenting it and that's exactly what you want it works but we all know it there's no fun take this guy on the on the right the IBM Q it first of all it looks good right intricate but they're only showing one tiny bit of it I'm sure it's huge and oh yes mess if you need some space but I think the interesting bit is it has not 64 bit but 14 qubits so it's the qubit is going to be the quantum bits going to be the interesting bit so I think you should try it out okay okay but the price is a little bit steep I know this about something new right it's always when you buy something new it comes with a high price okay okay but but I see something with a gate error I see a minus 21 a minus 3 I don't know it seems a little bit error prone to me let's talk about it later okay okay okay I'll start saving so what are these qubits that he was trying to sell me on well they're if you look at classical computer you all know they're bits 0 or 1 but a qubit can be a little bit of both so what does that mean we're depicting a qubit over there as a sphere so the state of a qubit is some value on that sphere and rather than 0 1 which are two discrete values the sphere is actually continuous so it can take you could say an infinite number of values so the trick here of course is you don't know what value it is until you measure it and in quantum mechanics mechanics measuring is actually interacting with the system and causing its state to change so when you measure it it's outcome will be either 0 or 1 so you're still again have only two states but if you do it many many times then depending on where it is on that sphere the outcome the distribution of the outcomes will tell you something about what the original state was not everything but it'll tell you something and that's also kind of the the richness that these qubits bring so let's talk a little bit more about what you can do with these weird quantum states on that sphere or first actually let's let's talk a bit about quantum states the quantum state itself so there was a famous physicist Aaron Schrodinger who had an even more famous cat so maybe the cat lover here are actually happy after all well until you see that vial of poison maybe he'll be a little bit less happy I'm sorry it might turn out fine so you have a cat in a box you cannot see it so that's important for quantum mechanics you want to not observe the state because observing is interacting and kind of destroying the quantum nature of that state so you have a cat and it's in this closed box that you cannot observe some process that can either not or that can happen or not some quantum mechanical process a good occur and if it occurs some lever will drop and the vial of poison will be opened and the cat will be dead I'm sorry or it doesn't happen and then the cat is alive so these are our two sorry so these are our two cases right that stays alive yet doesn't stay alive but the funny thing about an interpretation of quantum mechanics is that until you check so once you check it's either dead or alive I mean we know that I mean if we open that box we don't expect it to be in somewhere that we expect it to be either at our life but until you check it's both and that's the crux of that's the crux of the superposition this quantum states so what can we do with this how can we do something with these qubits and especially what what kind of things can we do that we cannot do with classical bits so here you see one simple gate and not gate that's a that acts on one qubit and it just negates everything it just inverts the state it does kind of what you would expect right so if you have a state pointing that way it points the other way and if you look at the probability measurements they are also inverted and there's other states like for example this rotation it's a rotation around the axis of measurement and you might expect something to change if you change the arrow but in this case you don't see anything so if you just do this and then directly observe it the there won't be a difference so the difference happens only if you do multiple qubit States gates so an example of a multi pubic gate is making entanglement so entanglement is a really weird quantum phenomena where two qubits kind of know something about each other even though you can't explain how so classical correlation typically involves some kind of information being passed in some way but quantum correlation or entanglement is something that can exist even if there is no causal connection between the two so you can have one cubed here another at the other end of the universe and they're entangled if you measure one you know what the other is even though the measurement of the one could still be random so here you see basically two two qubits you measure them individually you measure one it's zero or one you measure the other it's zero or one and basically all the combinations 0 0 0 1 etc all them are let's say equally likely this is just one one part possible States they're all equally likely no information about them whatsoever but you see the bottom one this is how we depict an entangling gates so what you see is I've painted the arrows orange but other than that the States hasn't changed of the individual ones if I measure the top one it's still 0 1 with the same probabilities if I measure the bottom one without having measured the top one for just measure the bottom one first it's 0 1 both can happen but then if I measure one and then measure the other actually they are correlated so in this case I've correlated them in a way that if one is 0 the other 0 if 1 is 1 then the other is 1 it doesn't matter what order you do it in so that's entanglement so now you're an is going to tell you about a real-life example that you could use this in it won't work great I'm just a homeless please alright ok thanks for putting up with the physics and now we're going to get the example so we have the super hard problem right so we have 8 dots here you want to group them in 2 natural groups so of course anyone can do it is probably even the cat if it's still alive can do it is but in general the in data science this is a problem we see often we have lots of points and then typically in high dimensions and it's actually an np-hard problem we have something like a means but it's only an approximate solution to the clustering problem what we want to show here the 2 concept to me and just Illustrated superposition and entanglement how we can exploit that to run it on an actual quantum computer and efficiently find good solutions so let's see how that works so let's go over it one more time so the nice thing here with what I depicted is basically all possible cluster configuration so if you have endpoints say 8 in this case then you have 256 and you load them all simultaneously in memory so that's something you can't do on on a classical computer well ok if it's 8 maybe you can but say if it's 53 qubits the one Google used then you have about 10 to the 10 possible configurations and no way you can load that in any supercomputer simultaneously but on the cool Google one you can do that so that is already a nice feature about the quantum computer but this alone will not help you a lot so what we need is actually entanglement so that is a way to add information to the system so on the right we see all qubits and their own some state but they're still independent but then you can add something like oh this line to somehow denote entanglement said they know about each other and then the superposition should actually change and should go to state that you're actually interested in so all right yeah we thought the bad cat you've talked about physics but I think this is a Python conference and we haven't really talked about that so last minute we thought ok well we have to do something about it so we hacked together a notebook and the great thing is IBM they they have actual computers that you can access on the cloud and they have even some packages for that which you can easily install that's all demonstrated in this notebook so basically what I'm going to walk you through is what I did is to run the clustering example on an actual quantum computer I'm not going to run it lies because I'm sure I will mess it up so I will just go quickly through it so this is basically it so actually this this graph this is so called the quantum circuit I actually generated that also with the same notebook so on the Left we create a superposition I just talked about then we have a few layers of entanglement and then we do a measurement and hopefully we find a good cluster so let's look one thing deep so I have all these purple boxes they're actually a sequence of smaller quantum gates so some of them are an already touched upon and this is what I needed to create some sort of entanglement it doesn't matter if you don't get all the details so here on the left you see actually the code I use it's pretty straightforward pretty much every line is a box there so that at another circuit so instead of saying and gate or whatever it's this disk wantem not gave me an touched upon and he showed another gay to create entanglement and I combined all these here and there is some parameters and I can use these parameters to tune how much entanglement I want or what type of entanglement so on the left here we see if you tuned it that way then if you measure one particle and it's zero then the other one will be zero if we go all the way on the other side if I'm measure zero and one then it will guarantee together one in the other one said it will have opposite spins and this is very useful if you want to implement this for clustering so let's let's go over the over the circuit so again we have to added a few lines of code and that basically gives you this first block and this just creates you the superposition says basically tells you load all possible configurations at once in memory all right so let's do actually a measurement at this point let's see what we get so what we have here is so this is an idea we still physicists but basically with all you need to remember on the last is the best cluster and then the right is the worst cluster and then we have these probability so if you do one measurement what is the probability that you get say the best cluster and it's below 1% and actually all of them are equally likely so at this point is just a quantum lottery we haven't gained anything you can just flip a few coins and try the configuration out and see oh this is my cluster and why well if this whole graph is empty that means there's no entanglement yet we have not supplied any information yet so it's actually not really surprising it doesn't work yet so now the next step all these pink boxes we basically take the code I saw above but again is straightforward so if we go back to our cluster one thing we can do on a classical computer I can compute the pairwise distances that is straightforward that's actually only a quadratic problem so you don't need a fancy computer for that and if the the two dots are too close together I want to entangle them that they end up in the same state so I don't know yet if they belong to cluster one or two but if I say that say this one if I measure that this one is say in the in the first cluster then it's very likely that this one should also be in the first cluster but could be that both of them end up in the second so we have not made any cluster assignment yet but only pairwise relations so okay we have added that information a to the system and let's see what we get all right this is starting to look better you see that now some states are more likely so the best one are we at four percent the some state we won't measure at all and you can see that so we have now some entanglement in the system but they're still at some places there's no entanglement where we don't yeah we have not fully exploited all the information yet so let's do just another layer and so now we take different pairs because before that we could basically split the system in exactly two sets which don't know about yet so by adding these extra pairs now everyone knows about each other so let's see what we get all right so now the best cluster is 12 percent or so that's that's not bad I would say in the worst classes really small and if you see the entanglement is it's decent spread out over the system so again I want to emphasize that this is all because we have only few particles a simulation right so normally you can't really compute all these things if you runs on a quantum computer so let's do this actually on actual quantum puter so I have already done that so all you need to do is you need to need to go to the IBM website you create some account you go line and then on the right you see some devices that are online and what the queue is so you pick one I picked the top one in this case and then basically you load up your circuit we had to define it earlier and then you run it and then we can see what comes out so let's see so this is the actual result so the blue ones that is the simulation and then orange is the experiment so the correlation between these two is 53 that's okay but something that doesn't look good at all if I look at the best state that's only two percent come on we had these eight particles and this quantum computer this this $5,000,000 thing that the best does is assigned to two percent probability to this state this is not really that impressive I would say and actually when I was playing around with this I initially had a better solution but then I thought let me clean a bit code bit and made small tweaks I thought this is better but then actually do soap went down and I spent a whole weekend trying to figure out what changed and then I did I was digging a little bit deeper and since we run this on actual hardware and let's see what the hardware does so on the IBM website you can actually basically get a configuration of the quantum computer and here you see these 14 qubits and you have two scholars in you scholars tell you what he the the gate areas so what my Anne was worried about at the beginning like oh yeah this is this gate the error is seems a bit high yeah it is actually a bit high and it depends on the actual say number for this you're quite a poor cubed but then the others a bit better so what happened when I changed my coat I my configuration changed over this and then I got a well was the alignment was last good so I have not done any optimization here so this is actually a real problem in one computers yet so that's why we haven't got amazing results yet that we need to tackle this somehow and that is both the challenge for physicists they need to basically improve the hardware but it's also a challenge for computer scientists because you can print it add a few extra qubit to do some error correction and I have not done any of the quantum correction I just did the plain vanilla one I thought okay intuitively works fine but yeah and then in practice slightly some more work to be done here are you telling me I should get my mom a book yeah maybe maybe hold on for now yeah hold on the quantum computer yeah okay so this is only one example but what I want to stress here I chose to clustering I don't want to that you walked out now and then you think I'm always using k-means who scikit-learn and now this dude is telling me and need to use a quantum computer no that is not a message and the only reason I chose actually clustering because it it is it's nice to illustrate the concept of superposition and entanglement on a quantum computer there are actually other interesting problems so let's let's look at a few of those so the first one that's what Moran mentioned so the short algorithm prime factorization that the record is now maybe 21 so so there's improvement right not not 3 times 5 by 3 times 7 but the second one is actually more interesting so normally if you want to say yeah for phone book and you want to look up someone's say you get the phone number you want to know who that person is this is an old school paper phonebook when I was in grad and undergrad we still had those then you need to basically do a linear search so that's an end problem but you can actually implement quantum algorithms where it's square root of n so that is a big speed-up and the other thing is I show the clustering but actually a lot of business problems that require solutions but finding the exact solution is np-hard but you will still need a good solution so the Traveling Salesman problem is a good example for that where I say some salesman needs to go to different cities and they want to find the optimal route and then you ask the mathematician so what is the best route and the mathematician says I don't know but still the salesman needs to go on the road and sell his stuff so you want to quickly find good solutions so that is in the same spirit as we did the clustering you could tackle something like Traveling Salesman or more general you can actually do many discrete optimization problems actually moran is working in a farm and she's thinking about actually whereas he needs to do a lot of optimization actually getting the quantum computer right so you're going to buy it for yourself all right thank you and I think I need to take one more slide yes cats is live any questions good news we have a lot of time so feel free who which brave cat wants to meow a [Music] one-minute okay we got what time for one cool cat there we go I was looking at MIT is course offering quantum computing have you guys looked at that and now so can you really use Python libraries node for quantum computing I'm not sure which exact MIT course this is another course on EDX that is a quantum machine learning that heifer relies on kyoya state of IBM so our talk is a bit inspired by that by that course actually anything Google is offering on the topic you know what they were saying this and they got supremacy on that that's Google sorry I don't think so sorry you're asking if Google open source there yeah is there any courses on that because Google is not claiming supremacy and quantum computing if you heard the news you haven't oh yes so that is the slide we started off with and so basically what they showed so they used 53 qubit and they solve the problems you can't solve on a classical computer but what they solved is they basically you have this problem in computer science where you have a random random number generator and you want to test how truly random that is so it's actually from a computer science point of view an interesting problem but it actually hasn't any applications as far as I know so they solved that problem but no business problems yet so yeah yeah they have to breakthrough congrats to them but we still need to wait for the first actual problem that we can solve without classical computer thank you that's right you
