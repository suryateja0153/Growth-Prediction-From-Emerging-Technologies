 light is one of the ways that we're looking at quantum computing we're angling for emphasizing one of the advantages of light which is that it's possible to do quantum computing at room temperature a topological fluid of light is a difficult concept it's to describe light that has structure so if you're picturing light like a flashlight and you know we all get that but if I told you that there were little whirlpools within the light and if you look close enough you could see all of them swarming around and bumping into each other sometimes annihilating sometimes making new ones that is light with structure we're treating light as if there are little exotic particles inside our goal is to understand this idea of these exotic particles of light and to see if there's some merit to building a quantum computer with these particles people look at these tiny little particles and try to make them do clever things we're trying to do that with these vortices with these little whirlpools of light and that's new [Music]
