 okay so let's continue with entanglement i mean you've already already talked a tiny bit about it so you already know i've seen already some one ball state so by definition if the definition is that if we have a pure state and i'm on purpose talking about pure state because i mentioned before that then it simplifies if we have a pure state on the systems a and b and if this pure state cannot be written as some state iron a and some other state on b then it is entangled uh well as i said before this was actually the definition of correlated but what i mentioned when we have pure states that are correlated they're always entangled well for mixed date there's a could be a difference but yeah so for now you can just if you cannot write it like this if we have a pure state it means it doesn't hang out and then a very specific there's very special states entangled states are the so-called states we have four of them and so these states are very special because they are maximally entangled and they build an orthonormal basis so that the fact that they're maximally entangled is something that i cannot explain you in detail now but just there's first there's some tests that one can do to check entanglement for example the most famous one is the so-called belt tests where we can make some measurements and look at some statistics and then calculate some values and we can do that with classical states and we know that for classical states we have bound in this case the most for the most famous ball test which is the chsh inequality we know that there's a bond of two but then when we do look at maximal entangled states or in general tango states they can be above that value and the maximal entangled states are states that violate the spell inequality maximally so they get the highest possible value so in this case they would get two times square root of two which is not too important but just it's states that under some kind of measures there's different measures for entertainment we can definitely not discuss them now but uh if we use these measures and we have the highest possible value then this is what we call maximum entangled but yeah don't worry about it too much we will now so i'll give you the definition of those four bus states the first one is psi zero zero that's the one that you have already seen for normalization we have one over square root of two and then we have zero zero plus 1 1. then the next one that we have is the state psi 0 1. it's given by 0 1 my plus sorry 0 1 plus 1 so in this case second bit is flipped or the first one then we have the state psi one zero well we have zero zero minus 1 1 and as you can easily check they're all orthogonal to each other and then we have psi 1 1 and here we have zero one minus one zero now a nice way to write them in general which is something that we will use for the teleportation protocol it's very handy to know how to write it in this form so if i look at the state psi i j so i and j can both be now either zero or one and in general i can write it as identity acting on the first qubit so i'm not doing anything with the first qubit and on the second qubit depending on whether on my values i and j i apply sigma x to the power j and sigma x and sigma z to the power i so if i have something to the power 0 if i is 0 then i'm have sigma z to the power 0 which is just identities i'm not applying if it's 0 it means i'm not applying that gate if the value is 1 it means i am applying that gate and then times applying on the application on the state psi zero zero so for example if i have the state psi one zero that means that i equals one j equals zero so i'm only applying the gate sigma z if i apply sigma z that means i'm getting instead of a plus one i'm getting a minus one so i have this minus phase here and if i apply for example an x gauge then i'm having a bit flip here so i'm changing this and this oh yeah i think you can easily check that this is true and now maybe an example that i would like to give you though is so this for example the first ball state is a state where we can tell that whenever i do a measurement and i measure that the first qubit is in the state zero then this means that the state collapses and the output will be zero zero if however i measure ring state one then i know immediately that the second then the out the state collapses to one one so i immediately know that the output on the second qubit will also be one and for the state psi zero one it's the same but with opposite numbers so i know for the state if i have the state psi zero one and i'm measuring the first qubit and it's zero i know immediately that the second qubit will be one and the opposite way this is a very strong correlation because i always one party always knows after measuring the state what the state of the other parties even if this other party is far away however this is not yet something that happens only in quantum mechanics actually i can also have such kind of correlation classically for example if i let's say i have two cards one black card and one red card and i give one card to one person and one card to the other person now if one person looks at their card they immediately immediately know what the card of the other person is and the opposite way so because they know there was one black and one red card once they look at their card they immediately know the other one so this is an example now of of a classically state of a classical state however the difference is that this would be a mixed state this would be a mixed state we would be either in zero one or in one zero but we would not be in a superposition and to just very quickly mention why this is different is that so the state psi zero zero for example that i looked at now it can be written as 0 0 plus 1 1 so whenever i measure in the 0 1 basis and i get 0 for 1 i will get 0 for the other one as well however i can also write it as plus plus plus minus minus so the strong correlation holds actually for every for every basis that i want to write the state in i will always have the strong correlation so even if i do an x measurement if party a a measures their qubit they know immediately what party b has which is something that okay classically it's not hard to make an analog but maybe if i have two cards if i have the black and the red card it would measuring in a different basis would be okay i have something that can tell me whether this card is blue or green and well in this case it would just output randomly one of the two colors because it's neither red nor black and then i would not learn anything about the other state as well so entanglement is a very strong correlation but just i i just wanted to make sure that this fact that both have zero and both have one it's not a purely quantum mechanical thing but if we talk about pure states then this is very yeah and this is this only happens in quantum mechanics anyway so we have this very strong correlation called this entanglement uh and we have these ball states but the question is how do we create now these bus states so let's look at the creation of bus states i will write you down a circuit and i claim that this circuit gives me the best state or any pulse state so i apply a hadamard gate which you have learned already and then i apply a c not gate which you have also already seen and i claim that now if i do these two gates i will get the state psi i j given that i and j are either 0 or 1. so let's very quickly make a table to see that this is true so the initial state i j um when i have one of the four basis states zero zero zero one one zero or one one and then i'm applying a hadamard gate on the first qubit so mathematically i would write hadamard gate on a times identity on b because at the same time when i'm just doing going here i'm not doing anything on my qubit b applied to i j so if i look at the first qubit what i have here is i have zero i had the first state zero zero turns into zero for zero plus one zero because the first qubit gets in a superposition of zero plus one and the second qubit stays in zero the same but just with uh for the initial state zero one the first qubit gets again in a superposition of zero and one zero plus one while the second qubit stays in the state one now if i have one the state one on the first qubit it will get into a superposition of zero minus one while the second qubit in this case stays in state zero and in the last case we also get the first qubit gets into zero minus one and the second one qubit stays in states one then we apply the c naught gate control on a acting on b and then i'm claiming i'm getting psi i j because if we know look now they see not gate we said if if the first if the control qubit so in this case the first qubit is in the state zero i'm not doing anything with my second qubit well if it's in state one i'm flipping the second qubit so instead of one zero i will get one one then in the second case always the first term here if the first cubit is in zero nothing happens if the first cube isn't one we flip the second one and also for the other two cases here we have the minus sign so we get that minus 1 1 and in the last case we get 0 1 minus 1 and again we have to flip 1 0 which is exactly our definition of the about states now this is how we okay so this would be psi 0 0 side 0 1 psi 1 0 and psi 1 1. but now we also want to look at the opposite direction if we just apply the gates the other direction so first the c naught gate and then the the hadamard gate this is then what we call a bell measurement well it includes also measurement then so if we have the state psi i j and we apply first the c not gate and then the hadamard gate and then just do a simple measurement in the 0 1 basis so this is just 0 1 measurement so measure a z measurement then because i'm going the way it going just can do the same calculations as before but i'm just going backwards so if i had the state psi zero zero before and i'm applying first the head of my gate first the c not gate and then i had on my gate i would get the state i would be here i would get the state 0 0. so the two measurement outcomes that i'm getting are just 0 and 0. if i have the state psi 1 1 i would measure 1 1 and so on so the classical outcomes by the way this is why i have two lines now one line if i have if i write down quantum circuits one line corresponds to a quantum a qubit well two lines correspond to classical bits or classical outputs outcomes in this time in this case so i have the classical outcomes i and j and then they correspond to a measurement of the state or it means that the state collapsed to basically to psi ij because experimentally if i want to do a if i tell you i gave you one of the four bill bill states but you do not know which one that is experimentally you can usually just do measurements as i said before in the z basis so you can just measure zero or one but you don't know if you just measure both and both give zero you still do not know whether you're in the psi zero zero state or the psi one zero state could be both and yeah if you just do one a single measurement without applying gates before you cannot tell which bus state i gave you in this case however you will always depending on what your outcomes i and j are you know exactly which ball state you were in before so yeah this is the way we then would then put a big box around it and just call it a bell measurement and that means exactly doing this as you will see in the teleportation protocol good now time for questions all right so hopping into our top rated question that we have right now uh can we only discriminate orthogonal quantum states so what we are looking at are we are looking at projective measurements where we always project onto orthogonal bases sorry well project onto orthogonal states that form a basis well we can also look at povms positive operator valued measures which is a generalization where you can actually have for example more different outputs than the number that the dimension that you actually have so you can have also non-author you can project also non-orthogonal quantum states this is something that we can just it's out of the scope of this lecture so we cannot um discuss it here but if you're interested in that i would recommend to look just google p-o-v-m great thank you and for the sake of time we're going to cap it at one question for now and yes let's continue with teleportation which is actually a thing and not just a science fiction not just science fiction but it actually is possible so the goal of our teleportation protocol is that we have two parties alice and bob and alice wants to send her possibly unknown doesn't matter she might not know what state it even is that she has so but she has a state phi which i call and now i have the index s that's the state that she wants to send to bob which is in sum uh in general we just write it a times zero plus b times one so a could not be the er like it could both be complex numbers so that we have general states so we have here the index s and she wants to send she wants to send that state to bob however she can only send him two classical bits and two classical bits even if she would know what her status it would not be enough because alpha can be any number between zero and one so two bits would not be enough to characterize any number so she cannot just tell him hey this is alpha and this is beta but there is another way to do it because they both share the maximally entangled state we just learned about psi zero zero on alice and bob so that's another qubit both have one part of this state one one qubit of this entangled state so that's the state zero zero plus one one which could have been created in theory long time in the past and then both of them got one of the qubits and traveled away with them and are not now in different parts on earth or one is maybe even on the moon of course experimentally not so feasible but yeah theoretically this could have done this could have happened a long time in the past and they just but they still share this maximum entangled state now the initial state the way we can i will give you very soon the protocol of how teleportation works but basically what it comes down to is just describing the initial state of the total system so if i look at look at all three qubits together so i have my system s which is in the state phi the one that i want to send and then i have my state psi zero zero it will say that alice and bob share and now i want to write this state the total state the global state of the whole system so i have alpha which comes from the phi times 0 0 0. so if i multiply both of the states that you can just see it on top if i multiply them both what i get is alpha times 0 0 0 on s a b plus alpha times zero one one plus beta times one zero zero and then plus beta times one one one this is not that helpful yet though what we want to do is we want to write it rewrite it a bit and this is how we can then read off how teleportation works in the end so i will show you i will just give you our slightly more complicated way to write down this initial state but you will see you can check later if you want to that this is actually the same status and the line above okay that's so i'm basically just adding and removing some terms or actually just adding for now terms um but you can see that some of these terms cancel if you um for example now if you look at the term that i just wrote and the term right above that oh wait right now okay screen is back if you look at what i just wrote and the term above you can see that we have two times the term of zero zero zero alpha times zero zero zero but then we also have this additional two here in the prefactor so that's the same term as we had before but then we have for example the term one one zero we have it once with a plus sign and once with a minus sign so it will cancel out so it's just a different way of writing it but it disappears if we the other terms all cancel and then the last terms that i have zero one on s and a minus one zero times alpha times one minus beta times zero okay now the reason i wrote it this way is because we can write it another way by noting that the first stage zero zero plus one one that is exactly our ball state psi zero zero however now not on a b but this is the bell state but on s and a and similarly the first when we have alpha times zero plus beta times one then this is exactly the state phi maybe a brand you want to scroll up a tiny bit so that they can still see the definition of the state phi yes there we go i mean might still maybe they might remember but yeah so this is our state phi but now it's actually the state phi on b because we i mean we didn't do anything we just rewrote it and this is on system b now the second part what we can notice is that this is now the state psi zero one the ball state on s and a tensor and on b we have alpha times 1 plus beta times 0 which is very similar to the state phi but the bits are flipped so it's the same as applying the sigma x gate towards state phi on b and we flip the bits and then we get the state phi now the third part we can write as psi one zero minus a and we can tell again the state looks very similar but it has a face flip so we have sigma z applied to phi and the last term we have psi one one okay and the last in the last part we need to we have sigma x times sigma z times phi because it's both the face and the bit that are flipped good so this is still the initial system at the initial state of our total system we did not do anything yet but just rewrote the initial state i mean this is of course now a superposition so we would not be able to measure any of that yet oh well if we measure something it will collapse but this is exactly that's exactly what we're going to do so now i'll give you the protocol so we have our two parties alice and bob that are spatially separated but let's share the initial state psi zero zero so one goes to ellis one goes to bob now ella says in addition her state phi which is the one that she wants to teleport to bob now what she does she has these two qubits and she in the first step she performs a bell measurement on those two states a better measurement is what we have just seen that's first applying it's applying the c naught gate and the hadamard gate and then measuring in the z basis then she gets two outputs i and j and she sends those two classical bits to bob and depending on what the output is bob applies sigma x to the power j and sigma i to the power i sigma z to the power i and then the claim is that then the final state that bob gets is state phi on bob system so let's look at in a table write down what we're doing so in a first step alice measures on s and a in the bowel basis that's the first step now we'll have to scroll down and up a couple of times i hope the delay is not too bad so let's say alice if alice does a bell measurement that means she knows that she measured either psi zero zero or psi one zero one or well one of the four by measurements both states let's say she measured the state psi zero zero we can have a look now at the initial state the initial state the last line how we wrote the last two lines and how we wrote the initial stage we wrote it as a superposition of these four different bar states times something similar to phi these four boss states are orthogonal so if we measure one we know that the whole system will actually collapse to that state times whatever we have then on b so if alice measures psi 0 0 then we know that immediately that bob state will be phi [Music] so we know that here we get phi if however alice measures the state psi zero one and with the same argument as it before we know from the initial state that then bob's state will be sigma x times phi okay and well we can do it for the electric states as well if she measures psi 1 0 bob state will be sigma z times phi and if she measures psi one one so if her two output bits are just one one she knows that bob's state is sigma x times sigma z times phi then in a second step alice sends her classical outputs i and j to pop because bob so far he didn't know even if alice does the measurement he doesn't know which state he's in because he doesn't know what the outputs of ellis were so in the second step she sends them to him so alice sends i j i j in the first case where she measures psi zero zero is first data i j are both zero and they are zero one either would be one zero or one one just as we saw in the measurement and then in the third step bob applies sigma z to the power i times sigma x to the power j to his cubit and thereby gets the state phi so this is the third step so if we now look at the table and the first case where l is just sent 0 and 0 bob applies sigma z to the power 0 times sigma's x to the power 0 which is just identity in the second case he applies sigma x in the third case sigma z and in the last case sigma z times sigma x now we knew no when we look back here to what bob state was if he applies identity to the state phi he's the state stays in the safe phi if he applies sigma x to the state which in this case was sigma x times phi then we have sigma x times sigma x which we learned before it's two times the rotation by 180 degrees so in the end it's they both cancel we have 360 degrees rotation so basically identity which means that we have we also stay with our state phi b same holds for sigma z and then the last case we have sigma x times sigma series sigma z times sigma x times sigma x times sigma z so we can first take the middle two red identity instead and then the other two so we will also get phi as final state so in any case no matter what l is measured after bob then does his operation he will have a state phi one thing that we should note though is that alice's state collapsed during the measurement so she does not have the initial state anymore i mean we know that because she did a measurement and then what she got were two classical outcomes either when she does the measurement her state collapses and she will get either 0 0 or 0 1 or one of the other combinations but she will not have the state phi anymore this is something that is actually expected that has to hold because of the no cloning theorem the no cloning theorem tells us that you if i give you an arbitrary state it's impossible for you to copy any arbitrary state so she cannot copy her state but if she wants to send it to bob it means that she has to destroy her own state or it has the state has to be destroyed somehow in the process it's impossible that she just copies it and sends it to she says she answers to bob because then they would both have it so she cannot copy her state but just send it to bob when she's destroying her own this is something that is actually very nicely done and also in a very famous movie maybe some of you know the movie prestige which is about two magicians and one of them is teleporting himself and there is also very nicely done that this person that is teleporting himself always makes basically copies himself somewhere else but then the original version of him dies each time and like yeah so they nicely implemented the snow cloning theorem um of course one has to note so this is now we call it teleportation but we do not actually teleport any matter we only port teleport the state you can also call it state teleportation because in the end it's the state that gets teleported from alice to bob but she does not send him matter but still it's nice that this is possible and not only is that a very theoretical concept but it has also been experimentally implemented already a couple of times by a couple of different research labs in china and i think the biggest distance was actually on the canary islands where they teleported for more than a hundred kilo over more than 100 kilometers the state one stage to the other so yeah it's not only theoretically possible but even proven physic experimentally which is really nice um yeah so now i would make the next break for quick questions before i will then tell you about the q sphere here we'll just jump into one question here while we have time the top loaded one it's a pretty broad question but how do we measure the given states physically yes someone gave a nice answer to that and it depends a lot on the physical implementation yeah so it depends on whether you have which platform you look at whether you look at superconducting qubits whether you look at iron traps whether you consider photons nv centers there's a lot of different platforms that you can use for quantum computers to implement quantum computers and i'm not an experimentalist so i must admit that i do not know for each of these platforms how exactly it works but um yeah you can have a look at some textbooks or i think yeah nielsen is a great textbook i can also highly recommend that one that was mentioned there um but yeah you can just it depends on experimental implementation what second to just describe to people when you say you're not an experimentalist what does that mean like what is your role and if they are interested in that type of thing what should they get involved with so what my background is you mean yeah just just helping people understand the role so i i'm a i'm a phd student in quantum information theory so i'm doing theoretical research so i'm working on quantum computing on quantum non-locality quantum thermodynamics so i'm trying to understand quantum effects for various different systems for example quantum networks how entanglement their behaves and what we can learn from that so i'm doing theoretical research which is different from experimentalists which are the ones that are actually building the quantum computers and that are reading out the states and that are well then proving all the things that i theoretically try to derive basically perfect thanks very much so let's dive into our end of the lecture now yes sorry we have to go very quickly now um i'm sorry i might take a bit of extra time but i will try to be fast so the last topic is the q sphere which i mentioned earlier when we talked about the cascade logo so we know that the block sphere can only illustrate the cube the state of one cubit so if we have multiple qubits we use in stitch the q sphere but nevertheless even though i just said we use it for multiple qubits let's first look at how it looks for one qubit because of course on the q sphere we can plot it for illustrate an arbitrary number of qubits so we can also illustrate one qubit so let's start with some rules basically so the north pole i call it this way because i'm sure everyone knows what i mean if i'm talking about the north pole of a sphere it represents the state zero while the south pole represents state one this is just as in the block sphere however one really needs to be careful to not mix those two up because everything else is very different and actually if we only look at one qubit we will have two at most two blobs so two like points on the sphere but they will always only be either up either on the top or at the bottom either north pole or soft but they will not be any anywhere else so even if we do some rotations as we did on the block sphere where we went to the if we play hadamard gate and then we go to the super position stage we've seen the second heard it looks like here but we will never be anywhere else but on the top on the bottom so we have these blobs and the size of them is proportional to the probability of measuring the respective state and then what is different very different now especially from the philosophy i mean first of all that we have different sizes but also we have different colors of the blobs and these colors are the ones that indicate the faces the relative faces and we always compare it to state 0. and ah so now i should actually import quickly a picture um these are the leg channels that you will get by the way so sorry i should have done that earlier maybe but yeah now here we go so you have the this is the diagram that tells us which color corresponds to which face so let's do very quick some examples i have the sphere here if i want to show the state 0 the stage zero i would just have one blob on the north pole that i just explained so this is state zero well here would be state one but there we have no blop because we're just in state zero oops if we're in state one we're in the south pole so this is state one then if we're if we wanna for example look at a consider superposition state let's say we consider one it's not equal probabilities but where we have for example one over square root of three times zero plus one over square root of two thirds times one then we have two blobs now we have one blob on the top which has a smaller blob than the one at the bottom because i told you that the size of the blob is proportional to the probability of measuring the state in this case we have a probability of 2 3 to measure the state on the top on the bottom to measure the state 1 and we have a probability of 1 3 to measure the state zero and the north pole so both blobs are also smaller than the ones we were looking at before because here it was probability one for each of the states and now we have this mixture now the superposition state and as a last example because so far i made all of them red because they were all none of them had a relative face first of all if we look just look at the single stage 001 they have anyway no face no relative phase so we have zero relative phase but then also the third example that i made i have a plus sign in between so it's just zero phase it's e to the power zero basically so we have had no face here as well and now in this case we have so we have e to the i phi equals minus 1 which means that here in this case because we have the minus one phase which means that phi our face is 180 degrees so it's high maybe here we should also this is pi so i have the state on the top and the state on the bottom that in this case uh equally likely because we have both of them have equal oh i actually forgot the normalization factor so both of them have probability one have to be measured but one is blue and the other one is red good now i hope this is clear of how it works with one qubit and now we can generalize this for n qubits and so for n qubits we have not only two basis states as we had now zero and one but for n qubits we have two to the power n basis states for example if we have let us consider n equal to 3 then we have a number of different states which i just color a bit now so we have the state zero zero zero as a basis state then we have the state zero zero one zero one zero and one zero zero and then we have the states zero one one one zero one and one one zero and we have the states one one the state one one one these are our eight basis states that we can that we have when we look at three qubits and now we plot these basis states as equally distributed states it's equally distributed points on the sphere where we have zero to the power n in this case would be zero to power three is on the north pole before we had zero in the north pole now we have zero to the power n on the north pole it's easy to remember and then we have the state 1 to the power n on the south pole and all other states are aligned on parallels so parallels are lines that have the same latitude and we align them in a way that the number of ones on each latitude is constant and it's increasing from north to south and i'll of course give you an example for that so we look at n equal to 3 because i just gave you the basis states for that one and now i told you on the north pole we have the state zero zero zero on the south pole we have the state one one one and now we have the other states are on latitudes so on some lines here in this case we have two more lines where we have an increase a constant number of ones and increasing so in the first on the north pole we have zero ones now here we have the states that have one one so we have zero zero one and the state zero one zero and the state one zero zero and then on the second latitude or a second parallel we have those states that have two ones so we have the states 0 1 1 and 1 0 1 and 1 1 0. as before in general the size and the color of the blobs are just as before so we again have the size proportional to the probability for example if we look at the state one half times now i use the right colors already zero zero zero because we always take the the color is depending on the relative phase compared to our state 0 minus 0 1 1 plus square root of 2 times i times 1.1 and now if we look how the state the other one if we look how the state looks like we have the probability one quarter to be in the state zero zero zero and here we have two lines because we have three qubits then we have the probability also one quarter to measure the state 0 1 1 which will be somewhere on this parallel let's say here and it has a blob as small as the red one should be the same size and then we have the probability probably of one-half it's twice as big for the state 101 which is also on this parallel let's say here and this one has a bigger blob so by the way the colors that i used before here on when i showed this they were not they do not have anything to do with faces i just wanted to show where the different points lie for the different base states there were no blobs it was just showing some locations but now here in this in the last example you will see the actual colors that we use to show the different states on the q sphere and um now i would quickly like very quickly just a few minutes show you how this looks like in kiskit good so i'm on the iqx so i'm on what i meant the ibm quantum experience which is very easy i can just create a notebook and now what i do in a first step i will very quickly go through a bit of kiss kit code here the first step i just import numpy because i need it later to use pi and so on then i will import from quantum circuit because i want to create a quantum circuit and i will import the state vector and plotting the q sphere this is just to because i just want to show you the illustrations of the q sphere with kisket everything else you will learn you will learn much more about quantum circuits later in the labs so what i start is by um i choose let's first start with one qubit such as n equal to one then i create a quantum circuit on this one qubit and actually enough and then i'm taking the state vector so this is i'm getting the state vector from my quantum circuit which i call qc so i'm getting this with this command i can print it so you see the state vector in the beginning and then i will plot it on the q sphere so uh oops i first need to import of course did not run the first line um sorry it's going to take a few seconds just taking ok so now we already see the state vector the state vector is just given by one and zero so you see the plus zero times j which the j is the i the imaginary i so don't be confused i don't know why it's j instead of i but this is just so we have this one plus i and the first entrance entry on the state vector and zero plus zero times i so just zero on the second one the state vector in the beginning is just one zero and we can see here on the q sphere we just have the zero state the north pole which is because we didn't do anything i just created a quantum circuit with one qubit and i did not do anything on that now what i can do instead is for example at this command here by the way the blue commands in case this is you're not familiar with that are things that i've commanded so they're not executed if you put this symbol in front then there's it's not gonna it's gonna ignore that line so now i've added here qc.h on state on qubit zero i'm counting my qubits from zero to n minus one so i'm applying a hadamard gate on my first qubit applying the hadamard gate means that we're in an equal superposition of zero and one so you can tell now we have a blob here and a blob on the bottom and the blob both got a bit smaller and when the equal superposition the phase is zero because both blobs are red and you can also tell the state vector now change to well 0.707 which is one of the square root of two and we have it here and there both entrance now what i can do is i can increase my number to plot the state on two qubits on two qubits the plot on the blob on the top is the state 0 0 now well this is now we're on the middle parallel we have the states zero one and one zero because we applied hadamard only to one qubit we have one qubit that is in a superposition of zero and one and the other qubit that is still in the state zero that's why we have that now we learned before how to create a boss state so let's try that the ball state means we apply first ahead of my gate on state zero for example and then the c not gate and c naught because the not gate is basically the x gate we write it as cx and so we have qc dot cx where now the zero is my control qubit i control on state zero i on qubit zero and then i act i have the target qubit as qubit one so if i apply this i'm going to get the ball state which is now now we can see we have a four dimensional state vector and the first and the last entries are both one over square root of two which is just at what we would expect and we can also see from the plot now if we plot the q sphere here we get zero zero on top and one one on the bottom and we have an equal support position and both are red if however i will now change i apply another x gate in the end to my one of my qubits then i will get the state 0 1 plus 1 0 so i'm having i'm rotating the states to be to this middle parallel because on this one we have zero one and one zero and we're not anymore on the what we had before if instead of as an x gate i for example apply a z gate then this means that we still have zero zero and one one but now the phase changed the phase change we have zero zero minus one one so we have the phase of pi so this thing becomes blue what we could also do is instead of plotting the q sphere we could plot our circuit just with qc.draw and then we see here this is what we did we applied the head on my gate the c not gate and then the z gate now if i want to increase i could of course also do that for more qubits let's say for six qubits if i apply the circuit if i make a circuit on six qubits i would just have in the beginning i would just have one blob at the top because it's all in zero but what i'm doing here is i'm taking all qubits all n qubits all six qubits and apply a hadamard gate on each of them which means that i get in an equal superposition of all possible states that we have on six qubits however the heart of my gate acting on state zero which gives me always zero plus one so i never have any face that is other than the zero phase so all points are still red this is maybe a nice illustration of how you can see that quantum computing how it scales up because you can see already on six qubits if i apply a hat on my gate to all six qubits i'm getting all those states now to make it a bit more colorful i can apply a face and now the face this time before i was just applying the z gate which is a face by pi by 180 degrees now i want to apply different faces and what i do here with this line is i apply a face that is in this case 2 pi over 6. so it will we will see 2 pi over 6 to pi is the full circle 2 pi over 6 if i applied once i would be in the yellow part if i apply it twice i will be in the green part then blue bright blue dark blue purple and then red again now if i what i do is i apply it in our an rz gate so it will always be applied to every one that i have and now on the first line i have one i have all the states like zero zero zero zero zero one that have one one on the second line i have those states that have two ones then three ones so what we see is if i plot this now i'm getting all the different nice colors getting like a rainbow here because the first line has one cubit in the state one and therefore rotation by pi over six two pi over six then on the second line we have a rotation by two pi over times two over six so two pi over three here we have a rotation by pi and so on and now as a very last thing i would like to show you the kisket logo because we discussed it also earlier and now for the kiskit logo it's actually a bit hard to interpret how it's supposed to be about what it is supposed to be because we have these super small circles at the top and at the bottom and we were wondering whether this is actually just the north and the south pole or whether this is another parallel now from our discussions and with j and how it was initially meant to be we figured out that these two small circles are supposed to be the north and the south pole so it's just some designers probably change it to be a circle instead of a point but so what we can see is we have three parallels so we know that we have in total four qubits then what we do in the beginning to get these to get the state where we have one line basically going through that basically like the diameter of a kisket logo of a sphere is by creating a gh set state the g8z state means i play hadamard gate on one qubit and then i apply a cx as c not gate on every qubit always controlled on this first qubit which gives me a state zero zero zero to the power six plus one one one one one or one so like the bell state but a generalized version of that which is what we call a gh set state and so if i do this then i'm getting that state this is the gss state on four qubits so you see we have the three parallels but there's no blobs on them but now i want to get move this point to the first parallel and this point to the second last to the second last parallel which means that i need to get one one here and one zero here so i apply one x gate on one of the qubits and if i do this oh wait actually i want to apply to qubit one then i'm getting this which is as close as we can get to the biscuit logo because we only have four points here that are here here here here so we actually do not get this angle if we use the kisket version of plotting the q sphere but yeah this is basically what the kisket logo is meant to be and yeah with that i'm gonna be i'm gonna be finished for today i'm looking forward to teach you much more about quantum computing and the basic algorithms tomorrow like we're going to talk about the deutschdosa algorithm and the robust algorithm tomorrow we will immediately after doing the theory for each of the quantum circuits we will directly show how to implement that with kisket so it will be more kisked than today today it was just an introduction and we just got to see the very basics and for kiskit
