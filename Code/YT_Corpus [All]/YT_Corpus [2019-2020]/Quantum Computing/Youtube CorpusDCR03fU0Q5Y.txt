 [Music] quantum is a theory that describes the behavior of microscopic particles such as electrons or photons or atoms and the laws that govern this behavior are very different from the laws that describe how everything in our world which we call the macroscopic world works therefore we need a different theory and that's called the quantum theory [Music] i think it's really exciting that we humans were able to develop a theory that is actually completely different from anything we experience in our everyday world because we are using this theory to describe particles that are invisible to us we've never seen them we can observe them indirectly but based on our observations we know they're completely different from us and yet we can develop an explanation of this hidden quantum world which tells us how the fundamental laws of the universe operate that's to me amazing [Applause] quantum computers are not just going to be yet another faster version of current computers they will operate in a fundamentally different level because they will be based on the laws of quantum physics and what that means is that we can do computing tasks that are outside of the reach of even the best computers today so as you can imagine that means we can perhaps be doing calculations faster things like searches which we know searching through big data is a huge application that's one example of how this will change how we interact with data or we can talk about communication so we want to make sure that all of the data we have is private and encrypted and quantum offers a way to build encryption that can never be hacked no matter how good the hackers are so that's yet another incredibly transformative example of how society can change [Music] whenever technology offers us enormous power there's always a reason to worry in the end how we use the technology is going to be in our hands i believe that there's a huge amount of potential good that this technology can bring to our society but given that you know there's always unintentional consequences if we work to address those risks ahead of time quantum can transform society in the way that we would all be included in this wonderful quantum revolution [Music] a quantum internet would be very different from the current internet that we all use and i don't think it's going to replace it because honestly we don't need a quantum internet to do emails or use whatsapp or anything like this what might happen is that there might be a quantum communication and encryption network that is working with the current internet to be able to improve privacy and security of all of our communications and a quantum internet in the far future might allow us to do things that we cannot do with current internet capabilities such as teleporting of information [Music] i think for the internet of things includes devices and technologies over a very large spectrum so we can't assume that quantum will impact it in just one way if i had to pick then i'd say that one of the things that it will certainly impact is all of the communicating that's happening between in the internet itself right because the one thing that connects iot would be all of them communicating in one network and and quantum of course is the one way to really secure such a network and build encryption and security and privacy into it in ways that we cannot do today so maybe that's the big impact [Music] quantum being a technology is basically going to impact us in whatever ways we as a society decide to use it and corporations will of course play a role in that as will governments as well individuals and researchers and everybody else who has a stake in this so i think the corporate world will have to think hard about what is their social responsibility we're talking about some of the biggest issues and biggest challenges that we face today such as security privacy healthcare the environment all of which may be impacted by quantum therefore i think i hope we can address this before the technology is fully rolled out rather than run to catch up and regulate and control later so i think there's a big conversation that we need to have where we talk about our responsibility as a society and not just corporate responsibility i think across the globe we have to have have conversations around this and that's not actually happening we're so excited about the technology but we're not talking about the impact and what our responsibilities are and i hope we can do that more [Music] quantum computers can potentially help us address some of our biggest challenges for example in climate change how do we use energy more efficiently on the other hand the computers themselves will be using significant amounts of energy therefore we have to be very careful about rolling out this technology in an energy efficient and responsible manner [Music] you
