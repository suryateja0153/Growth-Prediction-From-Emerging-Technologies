 From the first appearance of the phrase artificial intelligence in 1956 to 2016, the year when Alpha GO beat human AI has been the biggest trend in recent years even driving the fourth industrial revolution The AI-related technologies has been developed in various fields and continue to grow exponentially AI applications seem complicated but in simple terms it is mainly composed of two things : computing power and data And algorithm is the medium between data and application Among them, the computing power is very important A high-performance computing capability can accelerate AI to find the most suitable solution from a large amount of data in a short time IEI AI-ready solution is developed by integrating AI inference system with accelerator card and Intel OpenVINO toolkit IEI has a series of AI ready solution which can be applied in: hospital- DICOM image analysis inference factory- quality control traffic-LPR & fatigue driving detection Now, let me introduce these solutions one by one. About the quality control application in factories, I will introduce you two practical cases First is AOI detection Equipped with Intel Open VINO the TANK series embedded IPC can be installed with a VPU accelerator card to improve AI computing efficiency We also provide a storage server – the GRAND series for clients to easily access AI training systems to develop corresponding modules according to their needs It can not only improve the accuracy of detection but also improve the efficiency Another application is agricultural product defect detection The FLEX series AI computing embedded computer is also equipped with OPENVINO toolkit and a PoE Ethernet power card developed by IEI No additional cable is needed to connect the camera reducing labor or equipment costs FPGA accelerator cards can also be installed to enhance AI equipment deployment flexibility and improve detection efficiency In addition to the TANK series and the FLEX series mentioned above IEI also has the newly released AI embedded computer - HTB-200 Take hospital for example It combines the AI DICOM image inference with the server-specific Intel Xeon processor The PCIe slots in HTB-200 can accept FPGA, VPU, GPU accelerator cards to meet the demand of clients So that DICOM images can be input to the inference system Through the pre-installed AI inference model the abnormal area can be quickly highlighted Compared to the work done manually in the past it greatly simplifies the workflow of physician and improves diagnostic efficiency As for traffic application let’s talk about identification of license plates traffic flow and fatigue driving detection The inference system in use is the ITG-100AI an AI power box pc recently developed by IEI Its built-in VPU (Mustang-MPCIE-MX2) has high performance and high efficiency. A palm-sized AI box PC can be used as an AI inference system In this case the ITG-100AI can recognize the license plate distinguish between moving cars and scooters and count them for traffic flow monitoring Based on the situation, changes and adjustments to the recognition value can be made IEI also uses this system to detect eye blinking and yawning to identify fatigue of long-distance truck or bus drivers It also can detect driver’s eye gaze to identify distraction of driver and trigger an alert to warn the driver if necessary The detecting value in system can be adjusted according to clients’ needs. In short, with the pace of technological change such as 5G, algorithms, edge computing AI applications are constantly accelerating and the scope is continuously expanded to various fields. In the future IEI will continue to work hard to develop and integrate AI software and hardware combine edge computing AI inference to create smart factory smart IoT, smart healthcare and so on for helping industries use IEI products to become more competitive in the AI-oriented world.
