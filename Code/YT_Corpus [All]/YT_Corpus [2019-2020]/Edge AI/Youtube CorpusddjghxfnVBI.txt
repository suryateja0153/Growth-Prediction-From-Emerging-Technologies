 joining me now are an edge cloud at VMware and also Patrick Kelly who is founder and principal analyst at Apple door research been very nice to meet you and perfectly good to see you again see you go you Patrick I start with with you first and that is why is AI attracting more attention today can't operators use the same technology they're already using yeah we've kind of looked at this market we did some recent research there's three things going on one is data is more accessible certainly in the Communication Service Providers environment and probably most people have heard of the V's volume variety and velocity there's a lot of data out there so AI needs data to train the models and probably more importantly you need a continuous feed loop into the AI engine to improve business business outcomes second thing is the compute technology the processing power and the affordability to run on machines now these machine learning algorithms is it's dramatically lower and you're getting higher processing power so if you if you think of what Nvidia and Intel is doing with GPU and GPUs tensor processing units that's the second factor the third is machine learning algorithms are widely available both in the open-source community but also via commercial suppliers like Ohana and and some of the things that VMware's doing in that space the other the other thing that's that I see is important for search providers is their major drivers for investment in AI are largely driven because the technology advances in their infrastructure so if you look at 5g and just clarification of the network it's becoming much more complex AI sort of helps call the data and provide insights that normally traditional tools can't provide second thing is the emergence of new business models such as edge cloud this creates opportunities for the use of AI and then effects if you look at op X it the OP X side of the equation and it's operators is three times capex so what they're looking to do is utilize AI to lower their overall operating expenses and Ben what are you seeing why is AI attracting so much attention today the complexity of the infrastructure that operators are building out is ever-increasing so you would see that maybe five eight years back he would deal with much smaller amounts of spectrum today operators have five six seven frequency bands and even just getting low balancing right across these bands proposes completely new challenges that are very hard to control without using artificial intelligence um Patrick what are some of the key focus areas in network operations and planning for CSPs in AI okay I think the use cases that we see the highest investments in AI probably over the next two to three years would be in isolated false and serviced impacting events so we've seen some use cases where you're getting a 20 fold improvement in that area already today the other big thing as I mentioned earlier is more accuracy and predicting demand of network capacity so if you look at something like cloud it's very elastic it's dynamic if you can start to predict what your capacity needs are it helps in that just-in-time model some other things in the planning and in the operations area would be looking at fraudulent transactions as an example of predictive maintenance and avoidance of unnecessary truck roll it's still problem with a lot of service providers where they're spending a lot of money doing a truck roll and only to find out that the problem wasn't properly diagnosed Patrick I understand you've done some recent research into some of the near-term applications and use cases that you see 4G and 5g advanced analytics enabling one of the big ones is subscriber level visibility and the way we kind of look at this is the ability to predict subscribers have poor quality of service it's not identified with some of the traditional monitoring or SLA tools so if you look at PM tools as an example those sample sets are usually 15 minutes if you really want to improve subscriber level visibility you need to get them down a much shorter shorter intervals and I think AI can help there the other thing is interference detection in Iran you know some of these problems that we see in terms of being able to predict interference in the ran by cell site and you know which customers are impacted that's another area I think it's right in this space Thanks and then there's obviously a lot of areas and applications that that can be enabled here through through AI yeah that's correct so on one hand clearly as Patrick mentions there is a lot of subscriber insight that that needs to be provided but at the same time also it is the foundation to enable new services so I'll give you an example more and more operators have SD when software-defined wide area network services that they are offering and these software-defined plan services they rely on fixed but also on wireless connectivity so think of this as one option of his fixed wireless access so how can you now actually steer traffic intelligently over the wireless network and it might require much more fine-grain insight at the same time it is also enabling what we're doing from a service assurance standpoint and service assurance really driving it much more end-to-end and so I'll take the example of a well known service such as voice over LTE where today you would see that there is a lot of focus on monitoring that service on the core side so you're virtualized IMS how is it performing you might be looking at city traces and such customers however realize or the communication service providers that realize that such a service comprises of many parts the user equipment itself your cell phone the radio access network the mobile backhaul all the way into a more centralized location where you would see a underline Network overlay Network a hypervisor to virtualize I worked relized IMS this is a long chain of services and to really understand how the end-to-end service experience is many systems actually need to be monitored and so it becomes crucial to marry such data to collate such data together to get a complete view on the customer experience so bank can you discuss some actual deployments yes certainly I will reference a large Tier one network operator in Asia PAC region nationwide deployment with north of 10000 Dino bees Gino bees they're running this nationwide so all the trace information from Ino bees Gino bees is actually flowing through the platform and the anomaly detection and root cause analysis identifies problems of sorts like interference detection this could be internal as well as external interference detection that is causing subscriber impact but it could also be in very congested areas where load imbalance effectively is detected and route cost and recommendations are being done to actually balance certain parameters or configure certain parameters such as subscribers that are further away from a cell core get balanced sooner to a higher frequent to a lower frequency band so there are also data science applications for this particular customer where we are seeing that they Anna science teams actually would want to do then also post analysis so batch analysis on top of their data like but the real-time aspect of the platform is very front and center so what does VMware bring to the table what are the some of the advantages that your your honor solution offers in summary subscriber level inside in real-time what service that they're experiencing anomaly detection who cause analysis impact analysis and then the recommendation these are things that span across operations as well as organization and leading hearing teams well Ben and Patrick thank you both very much for joining us today thank you thank you thank you very much you
