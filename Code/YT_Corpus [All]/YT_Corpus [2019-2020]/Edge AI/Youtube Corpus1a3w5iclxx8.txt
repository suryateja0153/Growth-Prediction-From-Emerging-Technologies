 I welcome back again cat thanks for being on the show again cat KC from CS disco she's a cheap product innovation officer you see that right chief innovation okay products here though they call her chief they should so we're gonna talk now in this last part of our series on artificial intelligence about some of the challenges of organizations that don't adopt and don't get on board so what do you see the the potential risks and pitfalls are for law firms that don't begin to embrace some sort of some form of technology assisted review or artificial intelligence to help speed up the review process well at a very basic level clients are getting smarter we've got clock we've got clients talking to each other more and they've raised their expectation of how their firms are going to be competitive and it used to be if you were big law firm a you would always have this corporate client for every antitrust case they would always go to you but now I was getting dozens of RFPs where they're asking me what technology are you using how are you driving innovation how are you driving efficiency because there is a higher expectations of competition between outside counsel that maybe wasn't there a few years ago and so the client expectation is driving this appetite to investigate key discovery and AI based innovation in a way that wasn't here a few years ago has there been any industry research that has attempted to benchmark what the costs of a case using an AI platform speed-up review verse not to your knowledge you know I can speak from disco and we see about a 60 percent reduction in time to evidence to production and that translate into dollars and so I mean 60 percent savings on the 80 percent of a case that is review is this substantial the thing that I think is most important is cost savings bank but getting evidence quicker yeah of the essence that is the thing that is paramount because a lot of these company I I worked at a company that had very big budgets but no amount of money no amount of people was going to be enough to get these insights I needed before the meet and confer or before I had a critical filing with the government of must and so getting evidence quicker so I can start building my case was the differentiator yeah certainly if you're you're working for a company facing a DOJ inquiry knowing you know the good the bad the ugly as soon as possible can help you make better decisions for your clients which might involve you know settlement yeah you know there have been many recent settlements recently from big companies that didn't want to get well I swear one of my favorite ones I used tons of different AI and analytic tools I had a big bank that had been fined billions of dollars and other big bank was they had hired on people in that same group and they were wondering if they would be subject to the same investigation so I did some social network analysis who was talking to who with what frequency I parsed Bloomberg chat I parsed audio logs and I used everything to keep triangulating down until I was able to identify the bad actors saying the bad things and the map at destructure data to show they didn't do the bad things and my company wasn't on the front page of The Wall Street Journal my company wasn't find so it it ends up being very compelling even early an investigation certainly responding quickly is important now have have you seen have you seen any success stories as it relates to companies embroiled with data breach incidences that have used your your platform to help get ahead of I mean PII so personally identifiable information is something that you're going to have to notify if there's a breach so if someone say your Equifax not that I'm naming them but it's a you're a big company with a lot of personal identifiable or health information you need to identify it quickly notify these people and their specific timelines tools like discos help you use algorithms to find that quickly and act upon it otherwise if you're looking at a hundred million records there's no amount of humans that could go through that in a timely manner where you're going to comply with your time obligations and so it's it's majorly impactful that's certainly well are there any other things you want to say on the show before we wrap up you know I adapt that the reality is no one wants to be the buggy whip maker and attest the world the time to start investigating and vetting and ensuring that the tech you're looking at isn't hype is now because in a year or three years or four years you might be behind the curve so find your resident dork ask questions dig into the tech and now is the time it's probably worth while you know without being you know biased towards what vendor why not take a case try out disco try out another offering to see what really works I mean you had the benefit of you were you were on the other side working for the law firm shopping for vendors fifty-five vendor RFP I've seen everyone I've looked under every hood I mean there's a reason I went to disco but the other tools good out there I think you want a toolbox with lots of different tools if you're a hammer everything looks like a nail let's be honest litigation is always bespoke so you want lots of tools that can help you address it great well thanks again for being on the show this is great
