 Let's talk about money. Customer  acquisition retention and engagement can   drive up costs and threaten margins. So when  it comes to marketing automation solutions,   marketers must make smart decisions, like  investing in effective solutions such as Edge AI.   Like me, your JedAI, cloud-based marketing automation  solutions cost a fortune in integration efforts,   and resources for processing storaging and  transmission, all in order to understand if a   user's digital interactions can predict whether  they will click on an advertisement for water.   What a waste! I just wait until you finish  your morning jogging and ask if you're thirsty.   Those solutions have ongoing costs for crunching  the data of millions of users, but I just have   to take care of you! I don't care about all  the others, by sitting inside your phone and   doing all the calculations in my artificial  intelligence head, I make decisions on the   spot, while running smart algorithms with less  than one percent of battery consumption per day.   That means that I cost a fraction of what they  do, plus, we get to become soulmates. We all need   to watch our budgets these days, if you're  in marketing, you need to be smart, JedAI smart.   Anagog is Reinventing Real-World Personalization.
