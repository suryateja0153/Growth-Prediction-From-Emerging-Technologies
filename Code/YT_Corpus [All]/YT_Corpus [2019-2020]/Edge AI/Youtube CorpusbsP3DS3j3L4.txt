 Companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Trader Joe's, illustrate how corporate culture can turbocharge results. On the other hand, a toxic culture can destroy a company, think Enron or Mirmax. Corporate culture matters. But how do you measure it? The Culture 500 analyzes over one million Glassdoor employee reviews. In these reviews, employees provide nuanced perspectives on what's working in their corporate culture and what's not. Taken together, these reviews provide a database of nuanced insight into the corporate cultures of largest companies in the world. The culture 500 is novel in four main ways. Firstly, it uses Glassdoor data, which is an incredibly rich and large repository of cultural information. Secondly, it utilizes cutting-edge, natural language processing, combined with human expertise, to create a high level of accuracy in coding reviews. Thirdly, we identified the nine cultural values that companies listed the most and that have the greatest impact on results. Finally, the Culture 500 covers companies that collectively employ thirty-four million people, which is equivalent to about a quarter of the total private sector employment population of the United States. Corporate executives can use the Culture 500 index to benchmark their own company's culture against competitors and best-in-class companies. You can use the data to highlight areas of cultural strength, identify opportunities for improvement, and test whether their company's walk-and-talk by living out their stated values.
