 i'm 22 have normal hearing and can't live without hearing aids but on hearing aids just for all people with the hearing loss find out the answer to that question and much much more in this episode of hearing tech news with mark trong so let's answer the question why does a 22 year millennial love hearing aids first of all i did lie when i said i don't have a hearing loss but day to day it doesn't really affect me and that isn't even the reason why i use hearing aids for the past few years i've been looking for a headset which allows me to stream music all day long whilst still being able to hear what's going on around me apple airpod pros came pretty close especially with the transparency mode however you always still feel like there's something in your ear and you kind of want to take it out after a few hours and it only lasts maybe four to six hours hearing aids on the other hand fit seamlessly over your ear putting most of the pressure on the actual ear itself whilst remaining really really discreet on the front and after about five to ten minutes you don't even realize that they're on to be honest it did take me about a week to get used to the thin sound when listening to music which comes about because these are tuned more for voice but i did find that it was really really good for podcast listening especially in quiet environments if you are however looking at getting the best in audio fidelity you'd still be better going with something like an airpod or just headphones so starkey was nice enough to send me out their latest livio edge ai hearing aids for me to test out and apart from the extremely long name one of the features really stood out to me is the direct audio streaming being a samsung fanboy this was one of the differentiating factors that they had over the competition only about two to three out of the six to seven hearing aid companies at the moment do direct android streaming and also the iphone streaming is absolutely fantastic if you want to find out if your phone is compatible with these hearing aids pause the video now having tested these hearing aids over the past two weeks i found that the iphone connectivity is absolutely fantastic even with my old iphone 6s however i did find that when i was using my s9 the connection was patchy to say the least it would bounce from left to right yeah the connectivity isn't just isn't that good we will have to wait for android to release bluetooth le audio across the board to see better android connectivity so if you are an android user i'd say your mileage may vary depending on the phone you have and depending on the connection as these are the first hearing aids i've got to demo i can't really tell you how the other companies are faring with iphone and android however briefly try my grandma's signing installation connects i have found that the ipad and iphone connectivity is absolutely fantastic similar to starkey's connectivity with iphone but on android they do require an additional box and that connectivity is pretty much the same and patchy even with additional device all right so just to go through some of the specs the rechargeable options last for they say up to 24 hours i've had these on all day everyday streaming music for three to four to five hours without any issues and the hearing aids with the traditional button cell battery are said to last four to seven days depending on your power requirements and the amount of streaming you do each and every day so if you're looking to get the rechargeable version i just recommend putting it on your nightstand with the charger each and every night and you should be good to go so at this point you may be asking yourself mark how do they actually sound in real life and to be honest i can't really tell you i don't have a significant enough hearing loss to really test it out fully from my rudimentary testing it does work pretty well in background noise and other clinicians have told me that saki have one of the nicest salon profiles but to be honest i i can't really tell you alright so let's talk about app functionality so if you go into your app store and type in thrive hearing control you'll be able to download the thrive hearing control app the starkey app for hearing aids both on iphone and android and just click open and you'll be greeted by the home screen the home screen gives you a few controls so you'll see two sliders one for the right ear to decrease or increase volume and one for left ear and here's a small trick i found out the other day if you actually drag from the middle of the screen between the two sliders you're able to control both of them simultaneously so that's really helpful if you're trying to raise or reduce the volume at the same time you can do that through the app so additionally you have memories at the bottom so you have normal music stream boost and any other controls which your hearing provider has given you and at the at the top this is what separates starkey from the rest it's their thrive score so the thrive score is made up of two things the body aspect and the brain aspect so the body aspects made up of steps exercise and standing so the more you step exercise the stand each day you can increase the score and this is trying to help integrate healthable features so that you're keeping you both healthy as well as hearing better and in the brain score it's made up of use engagement and environment so use is talking about how many hours you have had your hearing aids on each day engagement is about how much you've been talking and environment is just all the other sounds which is going into your hearing aids the thrive app also has some really cool options like fall it's curing kit anywhere which is telehealth um as well as a self check if you're hearing it i'm working can do that as a translation and transcription feature which uses the hearing aid microphones to translate to transcribe the people who you're talking with in real life as well as find my hearing aids so for any of you who've ever used an android iphone you'll know that you can if you've lost your iphone you can use another iphone to go and find it and this is similar to that so those are some really cool features baked into the app let me know if there were any features or information which i missed out in the comments below i'll be
