 so what does visAI platform offer so we say platform offers algorithm   blocks or algorithm accelerators so  we have done work and we have created  some blocks like people counting  congestion detection social distancing  checkers so these are blocks which  we have trained and these are models   which will work with uh with the deep stream and we have trained  this for a particular data set and  if if anybody has the requirement for   people counting for a different situation  these models can be retrained or can be  used for their applications as well so  this is what we call as algo accelerators  and if these are mainly used for  people who do not want to develop the  algorithms from scratch rather they  have a requirement and they want to pick   something which is existing  which is available in the   available with us and which we can  fine-tune for your final use case
