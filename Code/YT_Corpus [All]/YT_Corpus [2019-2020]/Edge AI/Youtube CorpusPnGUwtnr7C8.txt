 right camera interface for your Application. generally, sensors comes with MIPI Interface, uh then if you need it in a USB interface this MIPI data has to be converted into UVC packets and send it across, or if it is a Gigi then you would have to make it as an IP packet and send it across, again the for the GMSL it has to be serialized and send it across so maybe is the natural interface of any camera system. So reliability wise me is the most sturdy interface, when it comes to GMSL, GMSL can be used for for a longer distance, when it comes to MIPI it can be supported up to uh 30 to 50 centimeter, but, when it goes for a longer distance like applications like fleet management you may not be able to use mp interface right away you will have to convert serialize the signals you can use GMSL. Then the in terms of bandwidth MIPI provides higher bandwidth just to give an example if you want to 4k 60f frames per second maybe would be the only option. USB if you want 4k 30 fps USB the next better option. And GMSL or you can go for 4k 30 or 1080p 60 is possible but when it comes to gt uh usually you won't get that much of bandwidth. for longer range GTU would be the better option, it can go for several meters GMSL can go up to 15 meters, then the USB by default it supports up to 1 meter, but there are cables which can support up to 5 meters as well. For multi-camera MIPI would be the better option then the next better option is GMSL because these processors provide multiple interfaces for MIPI cameras when it comes to USB if you connect multiple cameras assume if you are going to use a surround v system and if you want four or five cameras per system uh, if you connect all these cameras into the same interface USB 3.0 interface is going to the bandwidth going to be shared and you may not be able to get enough frame rate from all these cameras. GMSL is just a conversion between MIPI and GMSL also again you can have multiple cameras with the GMSL interface as well.
