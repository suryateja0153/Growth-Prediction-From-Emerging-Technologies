 so today i've got something to share with  you guys that can really change how designers   approach a design i've been granted  access to some cutting edge technology   which is going to help designers refine the  artwork on the basis of whoever views that   artwork within the first three to five seconds so  this a short period of time in that first three to   five seconds when somebody views your designs is  really fundamental to the success of your design   thereafter so i'm going to run you through this  software and how it can help you in this first   three to five seconds of people viewing your  work and why it's so important so vas is a   really really nifty and a new program it uses  complex algorithms to determine where a viewer's   eye is going to travel and how they're going  to perceive your design in that short period   of time at the very beginning so the initial grab  or the initial attention hook is really crucial and also it's important to know how  to guide your viewer around the design   so there are four key elements involved when  talking about this kind of initial three to five   seconds those biological markers are first edges  and then we have contrasting colors mainly red   and green contrasting and then blue and yellow  and then of course intensity and finally human   faces now this is universal to everybody around  the world no matter where they are from their   culture or anything else that you can think of  this is something ingrained into human psychology   it's hardwired into our brains and so wouldn't it  be really useful to have a software or a program   that can help us kind of engage a viewer and  hack into their you know responses in his first   three to five seconds when someone looks at your  designs so vs by 3m comes in both desktop and also   a built-in photoshop extension but let's take a  look at the desktop version first and foremost   so on the website it states that the accuracy  of vs is 92 which is very very high and so   here is the photoshop plug-in download and we're  going to take a look at that later okay so once   you've signed up and logged into the desktop  version you simply need to upload a design   and there are categories for you to choose from  such as print design packaging even the ability   to analyze how efficient an email is going to  be so that's obviously going to be really great   for those of you who are marketers or focus on  marketing via emails because you can actually   learn how efficient your emails are in terms  of grabbing attention but i'm going to take a   look at a landing page website that i've mocked up  today there are five key sections that vs looks at   and the first is the areas of interest  that i'm actually going to come back to   later but as you can see here on my heat  map it shows the probability of areas of my   design that are going to be noticed within the  first three to five seconds now the hotter the   color is the more interest or the more chance  that a viewer is going to stay on this spot now hotspots are a lot like the heat map but  instead of just colors we are given a probable   percentage which dictates you know what's the  likelihood the viewer is going to stay or notice   this part of your design now if you are making a  landing page with key information you of course   want to make sure that is seen and also noticed so  this really does help now the next section is the   gaze sequence which is one of my favorite parts of  ves so did your eyes actually travel from one two   three to four when you looked on my landing page  it most probably did and again leading your viewer   around your design is key to ensuring your viewer  has comfortable flow and the message is delivered   properly so lastly we have visual features which  is going to make some more sense in a moment   so i'm going to head back to  my design and re-analyze it   so before you actually analyze the design you  can highlight an area with this tool like i'm   doing here i can then tell vas that this is  a face or i can actually draw a box around a   specific area of interest to me the designer so i  might think it's important for the viewer to look   here and then to pay some attention so now when  i come to analyze my design this area of interest   as a whole is given a probability score and 81 is  pretty good but it could be better so what i could   do maybe is to work on color contrast or something  else to make sure it's more visible to the viewer   but yeah coming back into the visual features we  can see the overall score of my area of interest   it has a pretty high score on edges yet the  color contrast and the lack of faces brings it   down of course i don't want to add faces to my  topography but i could work on the contrasting   color and intensity somewhat so that was a desktop  version but wouldn't it be cool if you could use   this tool whilst you're actually designing well  the photoshop plugin can be downloaded here and   it's pretty straightforward to install so let's  head over to photoshop and see it in action   so i have a new landing page design here and i  can access the plugin in the top drop down menu so again i have a choice of categories to  choose from and if you want to make an area   of interest like we did in desktop version you  actually need to use the rectangle tool like so so analyzing my targeted area we can  see that the visibility score here is 68   which is okay but it certainly could be better  as a designer it tells me that i need to work   on this area in terms of visibility and in the  heat map of my design most of the attention is   over to the phone on the right and that might not  be the desired intention that i want to achieve   so it might be something to think about and change  and hotspots are giving me real-time information   on what the probability is of each section  grabbing attention in the viewer and again   there could be a lot of work to actually  focus on my design to make it more efficient   and my gaze sequence i wouldn't say is ideal and  i would need to make some adjustments maybe have   the phone on the left and then the text content  on the right so that way the viewer does travel   from the left to the right and then also make  the text more visually contrasting and appealing   so vas is all about giving yourself some real time  data on how your design is measuring up in terms   of being effective and attention grabbing in those  first three to five seconds and having it plugged   into photoshop is really useful so the first  three to five seconds are often that initial hook   that designers and marketing agencies really  want to make use of this doesn't apply to every   single aspect of design it does apply to some  aspects more than others such as marketing web   page design brochures you know things that need a  call to action or something like that and on this   channel i have spoken a lot about hierarchy and  how to lead a viewer around your design well this   tool literally shows you your artwork in real time  and how it's actually stepping up to the plate and   meeting or not meeting those preferences there is  a promotional code that i can give to my followers   that will offer five extra free trial credits  and that is when you sign up to vas for free   when you do sign up for free you have 10 credits  but you're going to have 15 if you use my code   thomas to redeem this offer now you can find  the link down below and head over to vas
