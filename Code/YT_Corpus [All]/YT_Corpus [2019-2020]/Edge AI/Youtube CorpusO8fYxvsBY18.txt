 Over the last four years edge computing has become one of the fastest growing software architectures. Changing the current cloud centric design it is relocating applications and services on the edge of a network closer to the users premises instead of doing all of the process in a cloud core. At Konica Minolta Laboratory Europe in collaboration with King's College London we have developed an edge cloud solution that we are calling LightEdge. LightEdge will enable our Cognitive Hub to serve as a federated system capable of orchestrating AI services and agents in between device edge and cloud. Distributed cloud architecture has become a go-to solutions for low latency applications. Combining software-defined networking and distributed cloud architectures allow us to reduce latency particularly for applications that require real time interaction such as robotics and immersive experiences. At King's College London we are collaborating with Konica Minolta in developing edge cloud solutions that could be applied to a very wide range of applications. Our focus here is mainly on integrating powerful tools of software driven networks and artificial intelligence in the design and development of the edge cloud. Applications who benefit most from this design are those who are in need of low latency and high bandwidth at the same time and the range could really be wide and span from teleoperation and guidance of a robotic device in remotely to for example immersive video object recognition, human detection in environments with very limited connectivity. This has been a very fruitful collaboration with lots of interesting outputs and I would strongly encourage you to follow our results. Giving shape to ideas Konica Minolta
