 next up is chris anderson chris is the former editor-in-chief of wired magazine and the ceo of 3dr i am a fan of his work with the diy community through the diy drones and diy rubber cars initiatives and looking forward to hear about racing rubber cars and how we can all use ai on edges devices welcome chris hi i'm chris anderson ceo 3dr and one of the founders of the diy robocars racing league and today i'm going to talk to you about how we use small-scale racing cars to teach and explore deep learning ai and some of the new techniques you've been hearing about elsewhere at this conference so we uh we call these uh robocars and the way we should think about you know small scale is this this famous quote from uh from chris dixon that from andreessen horowitz the vc firm the next big thing will start out looking like a toy and you know you probably think of things like um you know gpus which started as you know for for video games and you know some of the early robots were toys as well this is something i got a lot of experience in because you know we started that more than 10 years ago with drones at the dawn of the sort of smartphone era the year that the iphone came out in 2007 there were a bunch of other things that came out that year there was uh arduino there was the maker movement there was 3d printing and i had the time had well still have five children and was trying to get them interested in technology and so i thought to myself well you know robots and they said well you know we got lego mindstorms and it wasn't as exciting as they they'd hoped and so i said what about flying robots and they said well what does that mean and i wasn't quite sure so google flying robots turns out it's a drone google drone what's a drone it turns out it's a plane with a brain what kind of brain autopilot how does it work turns out many of the same components that's in a smartphone sensors gps wireless cameras things like that so we just uh we just decided to do it and did it on the dining room table first with lego and then started a community called diy drones do it yourself drones which at the time seemed crazy drones were military industrial they were weapons they were aerospace they cost hundreds of millions of dollars and you couldn't have one now how could you diy and the answer is you just use these same parts that are in your phone and just assemble them differently and here you can see the picture of our first uh production line um where our children or some of our children are assembling kits with like literally lego parts um to sell at a maker faire um it was a robotic blimp um and this you know this and this uh you know this seemed silly it seemed like a toy but the community grew very quickly became one of the largest robotics communities in the world and literally um five years later um by 2012 the um this was a you know one of the largest um drone production facilities in in north america um continuously coming out of this open source people just hacking together bits and pieces and it just got better and better and better and um you know today the drones that you can buy and uh you know in any store and that you're familiar with all emerged out of this diy movement so we you know the future of aerospace turned out to be bottoms up turned out to be you know sort of open source turns out look more like silicon valley than it did like the traditional aerospace industry and that was inspiring but that was 10 years ago now we fast forward and you know the drones are done they work but cars autonomous cars self-driving cars are not done you don't have one probably i don't have one at least not a full-size one and it's a you know they're they're not ubiquitous and even if you you know even if you did have access to one is probably because you work for google or uber or you know or tesla and um you know and they're not maybe fully self-driving yet and then certainly not racing so we thought well let's do the same thing let's put the letters diy in front of robocars and see what we could do by once again using these easy accessible technologies to explore cutting edge technical problems so this is the way we started in a big warehouse with lines painted on the on the ground and you know the jankiest things you could imagine um but over time it got better as you might imagine and um i have uh madame conaway from from databricks was one of the founders and he uh came up with a project they called donkey car and him and his uh his his uh his co-founder there have one of the early donkey cars and donkey car was the notion of using a raspberry pi and a deep learning framework in this case you would gather data um by driving it manually around a track um and then you have a pair of um images and inputs and then you would upload the that pair of the two data sets to the cloud where it would train a deep learning algorithm a deep learning model and then you would download that model and then run it in real time um so the car could drive autonomously this is called behavioral cloning you're basically copying a human uh driver and so and you know it evolved a little bit and today donkey car looks like this and it's a very popular framework that is you know that is pretty easy it's just an rc car it's a 3d printed shell it's a raspberry pi or a jetson nano and um and a camera and you know it's super simple and yet it's very effective and it goes and it goes quickly as i'll show you um in a moment and so the enabling technologies here were like tensorflow um the fact that we have you know a deep learning framework it's easy to use and runs well in the cloud then we have you know python of course which we use as our as our is our overall glue framework and then you have very cheap powerful single board computers like raspberry pi and jetson nano and now there's others you know coming out um from uh from google with the coral framework and and and others so this is this is really why it's possible to now do diy racing cars in the way we did diy drones rather than the iphone which we had in 2007 we have this this category of ai technologies including the cloud that allows us to do the same thing now and so we said well okay you know we're doing it in small scale but remember this could scale up and this is one of our easy you know earlier um experiments putting it on it on a go-kart what's funny about this particular example is that um the uh the the the guy uh the crash test dummy in the uh in the go card is uh carl bass who at the time was the ceo of autodesk um he and his son had designed this go card and then he allowed us to sort of take away the human driving elements and basically replace replace him with a uh you know a computer vision deep learning uh self-driving framework and all he had was that red button on the steering wheel all he could do was kill it um the rest of it he was just a passenger um as he drove around now fortunately we uh you know nobody got hurt and uh it all it all worked fine but this is just an example of how we can sort of diy right up into you know things that could carry carry a person um this here is an example of a donkey car running now um at the aws the amazon aws conference and as you can see it goes it goes perfectly fine um it's trained to do this on its own and um you know that's about i would call half speed we now go much much faster but you know what's interesting about that is that um is that it could go anywhere it's been trained to look at lines look at you know whites and yellows and things like that look at cones and and just extend that to real world examples and we're going much much further than that now to introduce other technologies beyond even cameras to go to go further this is an example of a um of another another kind of approach um in this approach this one looks um up and is looking at cones um and it's looking both up at the at the lights and uh down to the cones and what it does it does is it localizes itself on the track based on where it observes these cones and then creates a particle filter and you know sort of estimates its position so that's another really cool technique that actually just used traditional computer vision no no deep learning this one at all but it's very effective on this course where you do have where you do have cones and you can see it's doing about 10 miles an hour in real real time but remember this is like a one-tenth scale car so it's like 100 miles an hour in scale speed um the uh another example here is it's just so showing how we how we map what we're doing to what the full scale autonomous cars are doing so just to give you an example of our cars since you know sort of technology suite versus a google waymo technology suite and as you can see you know google waymo car which probably costs a million dollars has more of everything it has more we'll use one or two cameras they'll use you know five or more we use something like a raspberry pi or a jetson nano and they'll use lots of nvidia tx2s and xavier's and beyond we might use radar probably not they use lots of radar we use 2d lidars that cost 60 they'll use 3d lidars that cost 70 000 or more you can't buy them they're custom lidars um we can use gps outside they use gps maybe theirs is better um we use wheel encoders they use wheel encoders we have imus on board which we can use for inertial sensing so so do they we use things like tensorflow opencv pi torch things like that they use the same frameworks but they're doing you know more custom code our simulator is based on unity their simulator is based on unity and ours cost you know two or three hundred dollars and there's there's you know like like a million so it's relevant what we're doing here seems like a toy but it's extremely relevant to what's going on in the real world and and it's more than just you know a sort of a a a faded approximation of what they're doing in the real world by racing by going head-to-head and going fast we're actually doing something they're not doing and when you think about it the history of automotive innovation has always come through racing you know le mans formula one indy 500 all the car companies test their develop and test their new engines transmissions bodies everything on the racetrack except for self-driving cars self-driving cars are all about safety not performance and yet when you think about it performance can be a way to achieve safety you know right now when a self-driving car isn't you know isn't quite sure what to do or in sense is a collision it'll just put on the brakes and so as a result they're extremely conservative drivers on the road and right now we're already seeing here in the bay area where we have a lot of self-driving cars in in in r d and they're causing traffic jams it's actually slowing down traffic because they're so conservative but as you know there's other ways to avoid an accident one can just be nimble you can very very quickly steer away um and so you know that's that's an approach that that racing allows us to explore aggressive driving as a way to achieve safety which is to say avoid collisions as opposed to very conservative driving plus you know we're just exploring a dimension of self-driving cars that isn't being explored well anywhere else um you know we i mentioned that we use simulators and this is sort of an example of how we do it this is really the golden age of simulation we have not only you know amazing game engines with unity and unreal we have the ability to run them in cloud so you know we not only have gpus but we have cloud-based gpus we have um you know the ability now to to script these things with you know because they have fantastic physics engines and they become photorealistic and the so-called sin to real gap is shrinking very quickly in addition um now that you know we're in covet and quarantine we've actually been doing a lot of our races and simulations so it's really given us an opportunity to not only improve our simulation but also include people who can't be with us in person so we run these virtual races online and people from from around the world um you know japan we have number our what our our team lead is from france and we have you know throughout asia and latin america we have participants so that's fantastic and then finally the great thing about simulation is it allows us to move beyond behavioral cloning to reinforcement learning and reinforcement learning as you know is one where where you basically you know give the give the the code give your algorithms some goals you know stay on the track avoid the cones etc so these are getting punishments and rewards and then you run it you know thousands and thousands of times against the very different scenarios and um and then it creates the weights based on based on that whichever combination of of outputs led to the highest rewards and fewest fewest punishments um that you know that's something that repetition you know being able to create lots of different scenarios and run lots of different uh training runs is really difficult to do in the real world um and yet in simulation we can you know synthetically create any number of scenarios and run massively parallel um races and to build these reinforcement learning networks and then transfer them to the real world where presumably they would they would do as well and if they don't we can do better so this is an example of just the uh you know our our simulator simulating a real world case uh real world course rather in colorado that was called the autonomous vehicle competition it no longer exists in the real world but it does now exist in simulation um so i want to talk a little bit about the the different approaches we use um there's basically four different kinds that uh of robocars that we that we that we work with in their community um there's traditional computer vision and openmv which is a very inexpensive single board computer camera combination costs about sixty dollars um that's sort of a you know the easiest way you script in micropython it uses basically the opencv you know framework and that's in a classic computer vision a very good way to to uh to to go fast although sometimes can be inflexible you have to tune it for whatever the the lighting and shadows might be um at the moment there's a lot of custom ones that involve um you know either computer vision code or deep learning code sometimes bring in lidar sensors bring in multiple cameras stereo vision sometimes depth cameras uh come things like the intel realsense um series and um and you know the one i showed you before that was looking at cones it's called cone slam uh slam means simultaneous location and mapping and uh so those are very interesting experiments in in novel techniques then there's behavioral cloning which is donkey car we just talked about that and there's reinforcement learning which is um some of the some of the other techniques uh from from companies like amazon that i'll talk about in a second so those are the kind of different approaches and it's not like one that's better than others um any one of them could win um as it happens right now uh computer vision just because it seems to be tuned and uh in the custom tech cars which are super tuned uh seem to be going faster but there's no reason why the others couldn't couldn't catch up and for example here's here's the here's our our track record um what you have here is the the the red is the computer vision approaches the blue is the deep learning approaches you can see over time there's you know sometimes one is faster than the other what's interesting is that we've also timed the fastest human or fastest human we know on the course and you can see that um earlier this year the uh computer vision cars became faster than the faster fastest humans and the deep learning cards are probably going to get there as well on any given um you know race it may be that the deep learning networks or models are not as well trained as they as they might be or they haven't had as much training time as they want so but we expect that both computer vision and deep learning will surpass the fastest humans um on any track that we know um uh this year and um and that's because they're just they have such fast reaction times um you know they're thinking in terms of you know milliseconds and uh humans who are who are forced to work you know to make it apples to apples to make the humans work with a first person view goggles so they both have the same view from the car the humans are looking at the camera looking through a camera the ai's looking through a camera when the camera's down that close to the ground it's quite hard to to figure out where you are and so the humans really are just cannot compete with deep learning in that in that scenario um there's been a lot of technologies i think i i mentioned some of them before like like tensorflow etc but when you think about it we're having a very similar moment to what we had with the iphone um the iphone introduced you know mem sensors and arm core processors and gps and batteries and wireless networks and all sorts of all sorts of great technologies where it's now suddenly super cheap because of the scale of smartphones and now we're seeing these other enabling technologies doing exact same thing for autonomous cars we have really great depth sensing and um and motion capture technology with the intel realsense series um lidar which used to cost 70 000 or more uh 2d lidar um is now under 100. at a 10 meter range and you know as much as 10 000 points per second the single board computers are fantastic um you know the raspberry pi 4 was our was in three and four were our starters but now the jets nano which is designed for deep learning has now cost us 59 which is just kind of incredible um and then we have um you know the these integrated computer vision cameras which is a camera plus a chip which is running typically micro python and some sort of computer vision framework these also cost about sixty dollars and you can you can raise it basically that's all you need to run a car um and you know as a result we now get all the stuff that you know the real world autonomous cars get we get um we can localize ourselves we can do deep learning they're running linux they're you know we have the ability to do segmentation object and you know um detection everything you've heard about you can now do you know on your desktop you know for just a couple hundred dollars and the software of course is what is what drives it not just the um the deep learning frameworks but also the simulation and the cloud compute that makes it possible to to collect data on the edge and then train in in the cloud this is example of what a what a virtual race looks like you know today um and this is just uh one of our one of our races it's um uh we call this the pandemic um edition so um uh this will show you how we race head-to-head and the two cars will actually um be starting the same time both running autonomously and you know doing multiple laps they run into each other it's like mario kart cart but um you know but all in autonomy um now you may have heard that there is a full scale there's probably several full-scale um autonomous car racing leagues and um yeah the one that's uh perhaps most famous is robo race and um so there is absolutely an autonomous car racing league however because these cars are full-size and so expensive they're like a million dollars each they've been extremely reluctant to um uh to to do uh the uh head-to-head racing like you're like a real race um well they do head-to-head racing you actually have a driver in the car and when they don't do head-to-head racing um you know when they're doing just time trials they'll do it autonomous but it's not been working out all that well and you may have seen just this very week that there was a um a time trial in the uk and this is the second race of the of the of the event and it starts and goes straight into a wall now my sympathies we do that all the time it happens maybe somebody just forgot to start the model glitches etc the difference is that that's a million dollar car they just ran into a wall as opposed to a hundred dollar car that just bounced off and you know a bit of a bit of foam so if you're going to make mistakes it's a lot easier to make mistakes um when there are cheap and uh and safe and done in a uh a in an indoor track where nobody gets gets hurt um so just to show you that just to prove that we too um crash a lot i wanted to show this this video which is uh what we call the um the demolition derby at the end of the race we make all the cars run together and it is a complete fiasco and you can see that cars not only hit each other they hit you know spectators here's a kid who's amazingly manages to not fall down um but is complete chaos um and it is super fun and nobody cares who wins and as you can see we have participants who range from eight years old to 80 years old some some of them are you know our middle school students and some of them work for google um and it's really you know there's something for everybody and the crashing in our case is a lot of fun rather than an embarrassment on uh on on on youtube um so i mentioned this is just us starting as a community but we've inspired some of the biggest companies in the world to do the same thing now amazon video and intel all have um diy robocar projects um the amazon wants an actual product uh called deep racer that um that you can buy and um they have an integrated with their sagemaker um uh environment um this is uh training and simulation environment nvidia has uh you know is in their with a jets nano has come out with uh two cars one jet bot which is designed to you know to be slowly kind of looking through uh driving through a simulated village or kind of a small scale village doing a stop signs and pedestrians then they have a racing one as well called jet racer and intel just released one called openbot which um which uses your smartphone um as the brain and and and camera and um uh again it's already you know it's all trained the software is ready to be to be loaded on your on your smartphone and all of them recognize this is a great way to learn ai and to experiment with um with edge compute um doing ai in the real world on low-cost devices um in the you know that aren't necessarily connected to the internet all the time but do have the ability to go to the cloud for for training now if you want to get started um you don't even have to build your own one there's a number of uh doi robo cars out there that you can you can just buy that a great way to explore explore some of these techniques here um uh the three that i highlighted and like uh there's a really cute one called the uh the zoomy um which is a raspberry pi zero uses the jupiter um you know framework and python and computer vision and and and deep learning and that's again a little bit like that jetbot where it navigates a little town and like a lego scale uh town and a great way to teach very fun for kids um there's another one called the the tinker gen mark which does the same thing a little bit larger and um you know a slightly more powerful uh processor um again comes with pre-trained networks and computer vision etc and then if you like the jetson um you know jetbot or the donkey car you can actually buy those pre-made from a company called wave share and you can just google that and you can find uh the link but so that's basically the you know the the way you can get started you you know you can do it in your backyard you can do it in your in your in your in your basement um tape on the ground chalk you know anything the point is is that you know autonomous cars are now within reach and with that comes all of the most advanced computer vision deep learning training techniques that you read about but now you don't just have to read about anymore you can do it yourself um ai's is is you know as you know the future but ai in the real world is really the future and everything works in simulation nothing works in the real world the first time this is a great time to really uh you know stress test your understanding of ai of model creation of training techniques with real world data and have a lot of fun while you're doing it so with that thank you very much and i think we're later going to have a a ask me anything session where we can explore all the all the questions you may have and here's some links you can use to get started thanks again
