 Hi everyone, I am IEI’s PM Wilson Today I am going to introduce our new edge computing system the tank-880-Q370 It integrates Intel coffee lake and coffee lake refresh CPU and features rich I/O multiple expansion slots and hot-swappable HDD bays supporting RAID mode It is a great edge computing system with powerful performance and flexibility expansion Now let me go through the detail features and application of the TANK-880 Now as industrial 4.0 continues booming it is not just merely how to put your machines together but how they can communicate smartly to run your production line with more efficiency and accuracy As you know that people nowadays are looking deeper in the industrial 4.0 going more for AI, machine vision, and deep learning These technologies require a large amount of data to get the analysis done Edge servers are physically close to the systems or applications that are creating the data being stored on, or used by the server So basically edge server plays a role to make the computational decisions ahead of time sending only filtered data to the cloud saving both time and money Our TANK-880 could work as an awesome edge server It has high performance CPU, rich I/Os and contains multiple expansion slots for add-on cards such as Mustang AI accelerator card and POE card to run AI inference models assisting your cloud to reduce workload and get data organized and filtered faster What is IEI’s new system design trend? Firstly, let me briefly explain the AI edge computing market which is estimated to grow rapidly in the future The edge AI computing market is expected to grow from 610 million units in 2019 to reach 1,559.3 million units by 2024 and at a CAGR of 20.64% during the forecast period The key drivers for the market’s growth are growing demand for low latency and real-time processing on edge devices and emergence of AI coprocessors for edge computing Furthermore, underlying opportunities for the edge AI hardware market include growing demand for edge computing in IoT and dedicated AI processors for on-device image analytics. Second part is multiple LAN ports design It is inexpensive, highly reliable and easy to install and maintain Therefore, our new product TANK-880 is equipped with triple LAN ports supporting high speed communication between devices and easy to segment into intranet and extranet for security Third part is multiple expansion slots for add on cards It integrates 4 PCIe slots, including one PCIe x16 one PCIe x1 and two PCIe x4 Users could install the card they need such as graphics card, capture card, PoE or AI accelerator card to enhance system function and performance and it allows system to be customized, upgraded and repaired for faster time to market Fourth part is four 2.5” HDD bays with RAID 0/1/5/10 support it could recover the data when HDD is damaged and protect a large amount of data for analysis on edge side What are other onboard expansion slots in the TANK-880 The TANK-880 reserves up to 120w internal power for add on cards Users can install IEI AI accelerator card and POE card at the same time to make it an AI inference system with PoE function Multiple expansion slots are available on board for different expansion demands such as PCIe mini for I/O expansion dual M.2 M key for storage and M.2 A key for WiFi & Bluetooth The TANK-880 adopts Intel coffee lake and coffee lake refresh CPU It features HDMI and DP display ports and triple LAN ports, rich I/O interfaces such as 6 USB ports and 4 hot-swappable HDD bays supporting RAID 0/1/5/10 Dual DC power input supports wide voltage from 9V to 36V, wide range operating temperature from -20 to 60 degree The TANK-880 has high performance and flexible expansion it could be added with various peripheral cards based on customer requirement to reduce customization time and cost It is suitable to be used as an edge server and AI inference system in smart factory This is the end of this brief introduction of IEI new edge computing system the TANK-880.We hope you have enjoyed this section You can also follow IEI’s other social media accounts to get the latest product information and company news Don’t forget to click like for this video and subscribe our channel for more exciting updates See you soon, bye
