 Let's see some of the application and what kind of system we can use so based on our experience we do have customers in most of these applications so for telepresence or a facial detection or facial recognition application the amount of algorithm will be the horsepower needed for the algorithm is very less and we can go for a cost-effective option like nono this and now but in terms of if it comes to smart surveillance or smart parking lot, you may need to download a lot of data from the cloud and you will have to compare it so, in that case, you can go for Ex2 when it comes to sports vision or multi-camera system you can choose a Xavier NX one of our customers has integrated up to six cameras to Xavier NX and for surrounding system example fleet management, you can go for Xavier so you can have all the six cameras stream the stream at the same time and also you can run the inference engine on top of it.
