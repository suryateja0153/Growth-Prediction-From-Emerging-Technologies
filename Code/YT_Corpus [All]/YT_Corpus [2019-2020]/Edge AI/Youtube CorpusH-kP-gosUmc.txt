 uh as a developer as an engineer  if you're going to start your first   edge ai development or a product  development how will it look like   so in broad terms this is how it is going to  look like you have to go in and pick a board   development board which has the  jetson as well as the camera inbuilt  and then choose a model that you want  to work with so in in for example  if you're going to do people detection it  could be peoplenet or yolo from the open  source so you pick up a model ai model  and then you work with it you first  evaluate it on this platform to see  how it works and how it works for your  particular use case and obviously it's not  going to be a perfect fit it will not work 100   but you will you will be able to  appreciate some of the algorithm working  and you will you will also see where it  is lacking so that is the time when you  go ahead and tune this model for your  requirement you have to figure out  what is what is not working then tune the  model accordingly and also train the model  for your with your database so that it  it starts bringing in the accuracy that  you require the first thing that you have to  start with is uh making a proof of concept  have a goal uh for your algorithm and  then see how much you can get there with  your dev kit an existing uh model uh and  a camera and then fine-tune the algor  the model or the algorithm and if required  if you understand that it is going  to be a big problem or if it's if  this particular existing model is not  going to solve your problem then you  could go ahead and think about designing  your own model and trying to resolve  the problem because in most ai cases an  existing model with fine tuning and  training it with the right kind of data   is the final solution for most of these  applications and once you have a proof of  concept which works to your requirement  and it works to your accuracy levels  then you could go ahead and design  the final product or solution   so before before we close this  webinar i would like to show how   the first two steps are done and i'll show  you a video of how we did it like choosing  the right development kit a hardware  and a camera combination and  then using an existing ai model okay so i'll  show you a dev kit so this is a rudy nx kit   which has a nvidia xavier nx inside  it and this is from connecttech and  we have connected our sturdy cam which is a rugged camera which has connectivity  over gmsl to the rudy nx box so  once we connected this we attached  this to a vehicle and we took it out on  a ride to a road so that we could capture  the video and we could also do some live  inferences so if you order such a kit and a camera   once you get it you can use deep  stream and run one of its samples   in like two three days so that's what we did here and i will show   you how that looked at first okay so please  be aware that the video i'm going to show   has a deep stream working on it but again it's not an optimized or a ready to use   application that we are showing so we are  showing what we you would see on day one   of your development so the reason  why we are showing this is to  to emphasize that this is a  great starting point so you have a  starting point where you have a model  which is working you have the camera  and the hardware everything with you   so that you could start your development  from here so let's watch this video
