 REMOTE LOCATIONS.   MIKE W.: HE IS A BIT OF A RENAISSANCE MAN. YOU CAN OFTEN FIND HIM COMPOSING MUSIC IN HIS OFFICE IN CAMBRIDGE. A FACULTY MEMBER AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, HE HAS DEGREES IN ROBOTICS AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING FROM ITALY. AND NOW HE’S CEO OF EX-SURGICAL, COMPANY BUILDING A PORTABLE ROBOT THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED INTO BATTLEFIELD OR REMOTE LOCATIONS TO PERFORM SURGERY.  YO UHAVE THE PATIENT IN A HOSPITAL, WE CAN HAVE A SURGICAL ROBOT GOING TO THE PATIENT. MIKE W.: ON THE OTHER END OF THE ROBOT, MILES AWAY IS A DOCTOR SITTING IN THE CONTROL PANEL THAT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE AN OVERSIZED VIDEOGAME. FROM HERE, THEY CAN CONTROL DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS ATTACHED TO THESE ARMS AS A SURGERY DICTATE.  WHEN THE SURGEON MOVES, THE SAME SURGICAL INSTRUMENT. MIKE W.: ROBOTS ARE BEING USED IN OPERATING ROOMS BUT DOING IT LONG DISTANCE PRESENTS CHALLENGES. ANY TIME YOU SAID A COMMAND TO SOMETHING VIA THE INTERNET, THERE IS A DELAY. THAT DELAY COULD CAUSE AN INSTRUMENT TO MOVE OR CUT TOO FAR.  BUT IF THERE IS A DELAY IN COMMUNICATION, THERE IS A DELAY ON YOUR PERCEPTION OF THE CONTACT SO YOU MICRO TO THE TISSUE. MIKE W USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THEY CAN ANTICIPATE THAT TO LATE AND TEACH THE MACHINE TO MAKE THE CUT MORE PRECISE. THE INSTRUMENT SENT SIGNALS BACK TO THE FINGERTIPS SO IT FEELS LIKE THEY ARE INSIDE THE PATIENT’S BODY.  THIS IS AN ENDOSCOPE. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT CAMERAS. MIKE W.: USING THIS AND THOSE TWO CAMERAS YOU HAVE A THREE-DIMENSIONAL VIEWING. RIGHT NOWT’S WORKING TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE ROBOT TO THE SIZE OF A SUITCASE. AS THEY IMPROVE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND TRAINING THE ROBOTS, HE THINKS IT IS POSSIBLE THE MACHINE COULD ONE DAY OPERATE ON ITS OWN.  SO, WHY ONO A SURGICAL ROBOT THAT CAN BECOME BETTER THAN THE SURGEON OR MATCH THE PERFORMANCE OF A SURGEON IN THE NEXT 30 YEARS. EMILY: THIS IS INTERESTING BUT THE IDEA OF SURGERY WITHOUT A SURGEON. I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS SCARY. MIKE W.: I HAVE T ADMIT IT SEEMS FAR-FETCHED BUT 30 YEARS AGO, THE IDEA OF A SELF DRIVING CAR SEEMED FUTURISTIC. TODAY, THEY ARE MAKING TEST RUNS. IT COULD BE THE SAME WIT
