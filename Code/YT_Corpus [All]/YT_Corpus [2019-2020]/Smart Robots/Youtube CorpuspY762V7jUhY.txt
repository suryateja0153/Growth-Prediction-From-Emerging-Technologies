 what if the robots were coming but not coming for your job with a long history with robots in a sense there are a mirror to ourselves the ancient Greeks told a story of Pygmalion whose statue came to life while da Vinci is said to have built a mechanical knight in the 18th century a chess-playing robot known as the Mechanical Turk amazed the courts of Europe until the game was up in 1816 Mary Shelley was so inspired by tales of a clockwork man she went on to write Frankenstein and so the fear began robots is evil Cowboys or terminators from another time we built them loved them and load them there were our devices desires and dreams and yet in this moment of crisis something strange occurred that line between fact and fiction suddenly started to blur crop spraying robots disinfecting cities and crowds more robots retrofitted with the UV lights food delivery robots delivering meds and supplies everywhere robots checking temperatures delivering groceries and saving lives an army of machines repurposed and released not to take our jobs but to serve alongside what if the pandemic was a preview of something new imagine a vast number of robots not just a few a trillion trillion robots of every size shape and scale from tiny nanobots in our blood to autonomous ships under sail an interconnected empire of intelligent machines are very business systems now come to life their sensors actuators and processes now our hands and eyes and minds this is not a vision of our end it's a glimpse of an automated world a symphony of machines orchestrated for our every need there's a robot revolution company but it's not one we should fear the new world needs new jobs and that means transformation is there or tomorrow surgeons wield scalpels or just focus what should be done will factory workers toil on assembly lines or just monitor digital ones will couriers still deliver boxes or just maintain a squad of drones or truck drivers still drive trucks or run autonomous ones in a world of a trillion robots what we do will need to change buildings will rise in the night kitchens will run in the dark factories will never stop nor delivery rates drop transport will appear when you need to go without you having to ask automated systems will transform every single activity and every single task the rise of the robots is not what it seems so what if that was your real job figuring out what we can now do in an age of smart machines
