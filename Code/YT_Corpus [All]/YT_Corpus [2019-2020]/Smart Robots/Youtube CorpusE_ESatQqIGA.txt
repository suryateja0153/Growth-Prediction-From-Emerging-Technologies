 [Music] swim robotics is an emerging field it has been around for about 15 years now and technology is only starting to give us the basic building blocks to be able to build many robots and do that in a reliable way so that we can start to build swarms that are also reliable for robotics is heavily inspired by swarm intelligence the intelligence that is displayed by social animals so social animals are ants bees termites but all of these animals have in common is the fact that they can behave as an individual but at the same time form a smart super organism that can act in a very intelligent way current robotics is focused on the pacification of programs for individual robots and this is a problem where we want to program for hundreds or even thousands of robots and that's why I create advanced composites which is fundamentally programming language for populations of robots there are two ways to think about how to control swarms one is to control groups of robots and the other one is to control individual robots the point of bias is to allow you to think at both levels and you as a programmer can decide which level is the most comfortable one of the biggest challenges that I find the most fascinating is to be able to create a sort of collective of robots that display a level of intelligence that is not available to an individual robot the benefit would be enormous because for instance this would open the road for treatment for Kenton's because we could send in the body very simple robots that individually would not be very effective because they displayed this level of collective intelligence they would be able to collectively find the location of cancer and then attack it specifically we are working on human swarm interaction and the idea is to have the users specify goals for the group of robots rather than for individual robots in the specific example that we're working on is collective transport we want to have the robots autonomously coordinate to move a large object in a specific location that is dictated by the user so personally I'm interested in disaster recovery I'm especially interested in creating a sort of ecosystem of robots that can be deployed in a disaster location where there's no infrastructures or no communication no way to collect information in an efficient way and deploy robots in such a way that they can collect this information they can recruit more robots to save victims if found and in general they can do tasks that would be too difficult or too expensive or too dangerous for an individual to work I absolutely love what I do working on topics that can have an impact especially making people's lives better is probably the main motivation to work on any technology and it's one of the main reasons why I chose to work on these things rather than others [Music] you
