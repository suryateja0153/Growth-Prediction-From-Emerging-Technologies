 in July of 1999 Sony gave tech lovers the perfect gift to kick off life in the new millennium the first robot dog for the home I beau stood for artificial intelligence robot but when pronounced in Sony's native Japanese the word also means buddy pal or more sinisterly accomplice and even though it costs $2,100 and was only sold on the Internet again back in 1999 Sony sold 5000 I bows in its first week flash forward 20 years and the newest I bow just clumped his way into my home hi he's sophisticated smart and so lifelike he'll wag his way right into your heart which is exactly why those who buy him should be careful [Music] many think my AIBO review sample came from Sony with an unexpected treat the previous reviewers profile hadn't been cleared so he already had a sex mail a named Trotter and a glimmer of personality ci Bose designed to learn over time over a period of months even years to complete the illusion of a puppy that gradually grows into a dog the Trotter is still young with what seems to me like only a few weeks of accumulated experiences so his behaviors are unpredictable but it's clear he hears and understands the commands I give to him but sometimes he disobeys what are you growling for no growling bad ok sit down sit down if this sounds frustrating yeah it can be but that's by design like a real puppy Trotter is difficult because he hasn't been trained yet it's a different kind of frustration than when G Bo can't understand a verbal cue or vector constantly drives himself off a table keep those robots in mind folks because I will be coming back to them I bow is in some ways a more pure form of social robot than I've used because he hasn't had any practical skills grafted on at least not yet this is a robot made purely to be your pal not to tell you the weather wake you up in the morning at least not when you want him to he barks he wags he trots oh I just got that when his two hours of battery charge are exhausted he's designed to walk back to his charging pad on his own which he accomplishes about half the time the wide-angle camera in his nose and the time-of-flight sensor in his mouth give him vision and depth perception so he can play with his bone and ball and avoid falling off high places most of the time when I said this robot is sophisticated I mean it you see this camera at the root of his tail that will eventually help I bow map the ceiling of your home to help him navigate using a technology called slam popularized by robot vacuum cleaners I those eyes are OLED displays expressive and playful and they don't really flicker like this that's a trick of the camera I bow has capacitive and pressure sensors in paws head and back so Trotter can tell the difference between a pat and a whack and four microphones - so he can discern between vocal praise and vocal scolding hi hi all this input from you he feeds to his servers in Sony's cloud to apply those lessons and grow his personality and therein lies a problem folks I just published a video titled it's time to stop buying social robots the reason I took that stand is because they're just too good at convincing us softy humans to welcome them into our hearts which means they're almost guaranteed to break our hearts when the company's behind them go out of business take G Bo incorporated when it went under its eponymous robot became a shell of its former self and I was affected enough by that to make a few nariyal almost reverential video about with Anki robotics now out of business it's robot vector struggling to avoid the same fate now I don't expect Sony will go out of business anytime soon but you know corporations are fickle at some point the company might start to wonder how much money it could save by shuttering its robot dog division that exact thing already happened once yep back in 2006 Sony cited poor sales for its decision to discontinue I bow breaking the hearts of a generation of owners a lot of the old message boards are still up from those times and mining them is actually a fascinating bit of web archeology fancy bitmap wallpapers and all and when Sony formally halted support for I bows the ones that were already purchased in 2014 a cottage industry of a bow repair shops sprung up to keep repairing the aging pups now look you may find it difficult to understand or even absurd that people form real emotional bonds with robots but it does happen and when they stop working the grief is real too now that said we have to give Sony the credit it deserves continuing support for a terminated product for seven years shows rare compassion for the users and in that same spirit Sony's trying to turn the cloud to its advantage by get this letting you back up your I bows entire personality to the servers it would be like if you had a USB port in your sternum and could backup your soul that way if something happens to your puppy well you can buy a new one and download your old high bows personality into it that connection to the cloud has via Wi-Fi or LTE with three years of connectivity baked into the cost of AIBO expensive sure but the kind of person willing to drop almost 3GS on a robot companion is the same person willing to do that more than once if it means they don't have to lose their friend I asked Sony what happens if I bow loses touch with its servers like if we say it was discontinued again and the company said I bow relies on the servers to remember tricks and to learn over time but not to function on the day-to-day so no sudden doggy death I bow certainly has his problems Trotter is a clumsy Walker his singing to himself can get on your nerves he's on things in occasion and his companion app is truly terrible like if the adoption process for a real dog was as convoluted as I Beau's initial setup no one would own a pet but if for whatever reason you can't or won't get a biological buddy and you have twenty nine hundred dollars to spend on an artificial one AIBO is the only social robot I've used that I can still recommend you're still at the mercy of a big company but Sony's track record is better than anyone elses at this point and even if the worst happens and servers get turned off your dog won't die it'll just stop learning and at some point don't we all hi event alert folks if you like drones you're in for a treat on Friday July 12th I'm headed down to Brooklyn New York to check out the BMW formula e drone racing league event live and in person don't miss it follow me on instagram at the mr. móvel folks if you want to learn some more about social robots check out my two videos on Gebo and one on vector our IP x two at the mr. mobile on youtube and please subscribe tech videos like this get your servos spinnin this video made possible by a three week i bow review device loan from sony no copy approval was granted and no compensation was provided until next time thanks for watching and stay mobile my friends you
