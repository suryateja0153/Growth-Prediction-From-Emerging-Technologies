 everybody it's no one from tested here and today we're gonna be building and testing the Robo master s1 this is the new RC robot from DJI now you might know DJI as the makers of drones multirotors gimbals cameras but not a lot of people know that over in shenzhen they've been running the Robo masters competition for the past couple years this is a massive event where students from universities from all around China come together and basically build robots in this real physical real time strategy game the robots are engineered with AI with these blasters they go around these huge arenas and it's a massive massive event and so this is the first consumer product it's an educational robot that's inspired and based off of the lessons learned from the Robo masters competition and it is of course a kit just look at this you've got tons of parts there's the chassis the wheels the motors with built in speed controllers you have the body plating there's the blaster there even some hip plates to know when you're being hit and of course an fpv camera there's gonna be so awesome let's get to building so that was the build and first of all this was so fun to put together it took about two hours all the tools from the screws this drivers all the cables are packed in that box and instructions are are pretty clear there's a jig for these wheels and actually on the side of these these are actually target plates behind each of these chassis armor plates what you see in this light here is a sensor pressure sensor as well as a light sensor so you can engage in some fun combat and some tooling with other tanks it all connects and is controlled via an app so there's a new Robo Master's app by DJI and from there you get as you would expect fpv driving so have it loaded up right now and I found the latency to be really really good it's using probably the same digital signal technology over Wi-Fi either over through your router or direct connection to the robot as the other DJI fpv camera systems and so very low latency and of course you're not flying this several hundred meters away this is gonna be contained driving around in your room or your backyard or in some type of gymnasium I was able to pilot this completely just using fpv and it's two sick controls so you have lateral movement as well as gimballed movement you can see some of the gimbal movement here it's all analog you move as slow as fast as you want and it turns right here but it's really that lateral movement that really impressed me cuz as you can see these are Mecca number wheels if you don't know what those are they're basically a wheel design that has omnidirectional movement you can see that along with this one axis of movement these wheels don't actually pivot there's no system in place here they let this the wheels actually turn individually and that's part of the elegance of this design as opposed to at rational car or RC vehicle you're not steering by turning the front two wheels left and right instead each of these these wheels have a series of rollers and that allows for not only lateral movement I can move this left and right and strafe essentially but then a combination of different speeds and forward and backward movement from each of these wheels allows for turning and the turning is super smooth the whole drive system is super smooth I was shocked turning this on on the slowest most basic speed house pontiff it was because it's running these brushless motors and speed controllers from all the years of experience that DJI has developing those technologies on their drones all of that is inherited onto this Robo master s1 so very very satisfying driving experience with the app or an optional control pad accessory and driving via fpv in fact I they use the same type of mental gymnastics looked-after v and not look at the vehicle because I have this running around the room and going all different types of orientations now above the main chassis of which there are those four armor plates there is this blaster system which is on the gimbal and the blaster is really cool cos has dual functionality it can work either as an infrared blaster system it fires just a little bit of a beam right there or actually can fire these gel pellets and these gel pellets are very soft they're not like BBS or not like airsoft pellets they're almost like a little harder version of a Tapioca palek boba milk tea pellet and so very easy to squish and you actually reconstitute these by soaking them in water for up to four hours and put it in a hopper in the back and then you can fit up to eight a four hundred of them and here and drive them around and hit the other targets and their safety measures in place so you can't in it very high no more than ten degrees up and down before you fire one of these pellets well the most fun just using the infrared laser from the front to go hit the other targets and speaking of targets there is computer vision on the robot masters it's a camera here Karamazov that only allows you to record video at 1080p 30fps to a micro SD card or to your connected mobile device but also allows you to recognize human objects recognize gestures the same kind of things that DJI drones could previously recognize could follow you around but also recognize tracking markers so it includes a set of these paper markers you set them up and it allows you to do things like have a race whether it's a time trial where you have Li set up and run around see how long it takes for you to capture each of these or we have multiple roller masters you can actually then have a race a course and then drive around find the targets and there even some targets allow for power-ups for speed boosts and armor to really make it like Mario Kart but a physical vehicle RC vehicle in real life it's so much fun just driving this around again the control systems are super responsive and because there's analog controls I can move as slow or as fast as I want but the robot masters s1 is also made as an educational platform and that's I think their primary intent and so there is a system in place for you to program movement actions program a little bit of AI into the robot and it's super simple it uses either scratch or Python and with scratch blocks it really is ass dragon drop they have parameters for the computer vision parameters for the sensors for the the hit detection for the orientation of the gimbal and you can do things like design Juke maneuvers or if you have a pellet hit on one of the targets you can then have it spin around and fire back in the other direction all sorts of different things that you can command and we just basically scratched the surface of the programmability of the Robo masters of course with every RC device one of the considerations is battery life includes one battery with this and charge it takes about an hour and a half it gives you about an hour of charge which I found was plenty for driving this around the place where I wish I had more battery life was when using the programming because I want to debug the program the actions if I'm spending 15 or 20 minutes creating a sequence I don't want to have the the Robo master off and on and switch it back on and do a test and there's no virtualized version of it in the app yet that I know of so it kind of sucks I need to leave this on while I run the debug for the operations but I think they will sell extra batteries and for driving around for going into some competition an hour of runtime is actually pretty good all this right now I I'm impressed that they got all this technology in on this kit that's super fun to build and all the technology onto something that's basically five hundred dollars I can't imagine another company putting out all this tech on this an RC device for that price I think that DJ's getting a lot of benefit from all their engineering and all their experience working on drones into putting it into a device like this I was kind of skeptical going into this build why is DJ I'm making this RC vehicle when their expertise expertise is in flying cameras these great drones that can capture amazing video and it kind of makes us to share a lot of the same basic technologies from the computer vision from the gimballed systems so the motors and the speed controllers and fpv controlling and I'm having a ton of fun with this again we've barely scratched the surface with robot masters and we're gonna get another one of these units and do some actual programming and do some trials and do a little bit of head-to-head competition with these and we'll be back with a future in-depth test in the future but if you have questions about the roller masters s1 and place them in the comments below I'd love to answer them and I can't wait to get this back on the road you
