 [Music] technology in 3pl why successful companies are using collaborative robots Texas recently shares six insightful and interesting reasons why technology drives top performing 3pls demands for faster and 100% accurate fulfillment along with the ever-changing automates are increasingly pushing 3pl resources leading 3pls attract retain and even delight their customers by actively evaluating and implementing various technologies are part of their reengineering process there's one new technology that I honestly believe will have a significant impact on 3pls today I'm talking about the rise of the flexible modern collaborative robot or Koba traditional robots are stationary one on machines kept behind protective barriers tirelessly performing lifting and placement tasks like pilot is a ssin of goods for shipment or accurately and consistently performing welding whereas these bots today they're mobile autonomous vehicles moving goods around the facility paired with intelligent self learning software using that traditional model automation in the warehouse is a large expensive automated storage and retrieval system or a SRS with a large crane moving up and down an aisle plus miles of sortation conveyor systems all speedy items from pickers to pack stations and then onto your shipping dogs these are a huge investment and occasionally a massive failure so these systems they may be still valid for the dedicated operation of a large established shipper but they're typically not justifiable in that flexible dynamic environment at most 3pl the focus for automation in the 3pl warehouse today is on an army of these smart new bots that can flexibly grow and shift with the needs of their clients EMRs or autonomous mobile robots are increasingly called cobots and that for collaborative robot being adopted in a way that allows cautious 3pls to dip their toes in the water and scale up as they prove their value and their worth in recent years the world of robots has changed greatly these autonomous cohorts are given the ability to map their environment localize themselves and then navigate to a stationary material handler to perform a task like a pick an order or counter bin or even put away a receipt this concept of collaborative work between a material handler and a robot makes it possible for the 3pl to economically use this flexible automation and if you pull the roof off a cobalt enabled warehouse it looks more like a beehive or an ant farm of movement rather than a set of busy highway interchanges the BOTS and these bot systems are becoming smarter and smarter using software that learns from their activity and this makes their continued use increasingly efficient as an example studies show that there's often a 2 times increase in picker productivity from picker service by a cobalt compared to their old fashioned standard picking process so this flexible and cooperative approach to robotic technology in 3pl it's the wave of the future and if you couple this with the other six reasons we highlighted in this Texas white paper on why technology drives top-performing 3pls then you've got a great start on a business case for adopting technology into your 3pl I build them be and I hope you enjoyed this Texas supply chain blog thank you [Music]
