 we human beings always has a desire to make something to replicate ourself or the outside world for example like a few hundred years ago we start to make these sculptures and about 60 or 70 years ago we start to make use conversions which means ourself but you will really look at a biologic in down there's a something that extreme is more extremely smart to control a lot of jobs but it is on our scale we are not good at reach the micro and the nano scale for example the white blood cell they can move around and hang bacteria and pathogens to make your hair's healthy so this is something that motivated me to similar body is there any way we can build machines which mimic is a white blood cell which can move around in your body and to make you healthy you read my cruddy story I went to a set of micro bus which could move by a lot of different measured and particularly I invented a micro rockets which can move in gastric fluid so the specific application what I did is that I allowed antibiotics which is used to treat bacterial infection on this micro bus so once this my antibiotics loaded microrobots entered the store mark they can react with gastric fluid they can move around and shoot the stomach lining which improves retention of this drug in your body in this case it can improve the therapeutic efficacy and occurs bacteria six times more efficient than conventional treatment so by doing so we can get rid of the high dosage medical medication and also we can reduce the use of antibiotics and then in the future we envision that a lot of this micro bus will be use the many parts of your body to treat disease with high precision and a minimum side effect [Music] [Music]
