 [Music] all those chairs curated in a quiet office ever imagine robots sitting on them though roboticists are developing new softwares and algorithms every day in order to advance mechanisms in their inventions today we are in a world where machines can do almost everything humans can and certainly a lot more with so much potentiality aren't they ready to replace us astonishingly han and sophia a pair of robots trained to behave like humans debated about the future of humanity on a live show they made predictions like by the next 20 years they would be able to undertake every human job in the world and discussed about the limitations we had by showing off their advanced intelligence before going on further about how they could take over the world isn't this giving you chills if you want to watch the entire debate check out the link in the description box below however there are perspectives which take many factors into consideration for instance the money involved in making each robot to take over the world robots would have to be present all over the world but this can't be easy because the expenses are in billions moreover users say that future robots will be evil and have an ulterior motive like us humans who want to rule the world it is in our imagination that robots desire the same thing we do another controversy is when considering that robots do in fact manage to replace our jobs the economy might drop because people will lose their jobs and resist from purchasing anything hence businesses won't gain profit and would have to re-hire humans despite the proficiency androids still will be powerless when it comes to imaginative and ingenious jobs like authors artists or mathematicians labyrinthine and calculative jobs like judges economists or diplomats compassionate jobs like counselors social workers or nannies as perfectly educated and trained machines they are likely to enhance the quality of labor leading to producing goods efficiently and increasing productivity with the higher rate of production comes in increased gdp by 2030 we'll lose 20 million jobs to automation although there will be a creation of an estimated 133 million high-paid jobs to reach this advanced phase that we are in right now humans went through almost everything for hundreds of years and here we are where our creation is threatening its creators do you think bots will take over your job if you like this video give it a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe to our channel and share this video and we'll be back with another video next thursday
