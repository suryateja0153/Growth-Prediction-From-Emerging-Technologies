 How difficult is making a robot  So today i will tell you How you can yourself make robots from your home  so please do watch this video till the end and it it is helpful to you pls dont forget to subscribe to us So lets start the most important thing needed to start robotics development is the idea - the concept of the robot it means what your robot will do and how will it be done for this first research robotics concepts on google  but to better understand the concepts search robotics on youtube  on youtube you will exactly understand the concept in action the concept of robots in action the concept of robots in action  all youtube robotics videos cannot be made at home for example this one this one will require a million dollar budget & setup so you need to search concepts that can be made at home for such robot concepts & ideas visit nevonprojects.com robotics here you will find only those ideas/concepts that can be made at home now that the idea/concept is final so now we need to research on the parts needed to make it the first thing would be chassis- robot body second thing would be motors to provide movement to the robot next thing would be electronics components to drive/control motors the last but most important one Microcontroller- Brain of the robot Now we have the parts list but where will the parts come from these parts are not locally available but you can get all these online at nevonexpress.com for low costs  for robot chassis selection first thing to consider would be is your robot going to be on terrain or off terrain on terrain means it is made for plain ground off terrain means made for rough surface like agricultural/mountain region next thing to consider is that will your robot carry any loads like water tank or a robotic arm to be mounted on it for such robots you will need a heavy load chassis a wide variety of robot chassis are available at nevonexpress as you can see this is a rough terrain robot made to run on uneven surfaces difficult roads, rocky terrain etc the chassis of such robots is specifically designed for this purpose now for motor selection you need dc motor for body movement so keep in mind the motor power/torque & speed/rpm you will need  apart from this if you need any other movement you can go for servo motors lets proceed to electronics part you will need sensors, resistors capacitors diodes n more components for making the electronics circuitry now the most important part for the electronics board is the microcontroller to choose controller what you need to consider is no of sensors and motors in the robot for example this atmega 328 controller is available for cheap here along with its pin diagram and development video  lets move on to development process first we have to solder the components on pcb then we connect the robot chassis motors to pcb then we connect the robot chassis motors to pcb then as we want the robot to function we program the microcontroller accordingly the robot is assembled and ready it is now time to test it.for testing we need power and for that we need to select battery you can either select LIPO batteries which are light but expensive you can either select LIPO batteries which are light but expensive Or you can use LEAD ACID which are cheaper but heavier robot testing is repeated multiple times  you have to test the robot each time and make improvements after testing n number of times you finally get a successful working robot i hope this video will help you make robotics projects and if you like it pls dont forget to SUBSCRIBE to us
