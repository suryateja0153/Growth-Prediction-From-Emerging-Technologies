 robots are programmed to carry out a specific function now researchers in Arizona are developing a new generation of machines that can do more News fights Jessica Tony shows us how they work Ising a ball through a hoop might not seem like a complicated task but it is pretty impressive when you consider this robot learned how to do it all by itself so we provided only the goal we did not provide the way to achieve or the means to achieve that going assistant robotics professor Hanna Beth amor leads a team of researchers at Arizona State University where they're developing machines that can learn instead of being programmed to carry out a task the robots use machine learning a combination of algorithms and sensors that makes them teachable the robots can adapt and react to a situation like this robotic arm that tries to catch a ball by anticipating where it will be thrown it doesn't always get it right ah close ideally the robots would not take day or week for this but rather a couple of hours the technology is helping developers design smarter robots take for instance this robot that can learn the floor plan of a house or a business and be taught to pick up misplaced items it finds researchers say a device like this could one day clean your home machine learning is also being adapted for medical use this robotic prosthetic can analyze the nuances of how its user walks and adjust as needed it's learning the relationships between the human and how it should react researchers believe the teachable tactic will ultimately help both man and machine learn to interact the robots learn in a way very similar to how a child learns the developers say this research will lead to smarter machines for the home work and recreation 4wk RG news 5 I'm Jessica Tony
