hoping it will help inspire people about the possibilities of robotics number five digital humanoids digital human beings look and act like humans but are entirely virtual one example is samsung technology and advanced research star labs neons ai powered beings with unique personalities and looks in a bid to make science fiction a reality samsung's future factory star labs has developed neon ai-powered virtual beings that look and behave like real humans these artificial humans are not designed to answer any questions like artificially intelligent ai assistants like alex or siri but are supposed to show emotions learn from experiences and have real conversations each neon is computer generated and not necessarily based on real people and each can be customized for a different role like a virtual doctor or yoga instructor the neons are still currently in their early development phase acting mainly as ai chap it's in human-like form the technology platform powering the neons is called core r3 which stands for reality real-time and responsive and employs behavioral neural networks evolutionary generative intelligence and computational reality inspired by the rhythmic complexities of nature the platform allows neons to react in less than a few milliseconds when a question is asked in real time an additional platform still in development called spectra will complement core r3 with more artificial intelligence machine learning emotions and memory the end goal of this technology is to be able to connect the brain to an external device to form a brain machine interface eventually lead to a future of superhuman intelligence number six robotic bartender chyme is a gastrobid aim to disrupt the hospitality in fodm beverage sector it is developed by
