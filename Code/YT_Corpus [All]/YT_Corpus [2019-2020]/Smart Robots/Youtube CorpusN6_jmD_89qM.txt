 welcome everyone to the third event of the robotics today seminar series today we are from excited to house professor Allison Nakamura from Stanford as our speaker before I introduce Allison we as the organizing team acknowledge the events that are currently unfolding in the United States we are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life due to racial violence we're speaking about the lives of Sturge Floyd Ahmad our burry Brianna Taylor and Sean Reid among many others we condemn these recent appalling events which are sadly not isolated but represents systemic issues of racism inequality and injustice we recognize that these issues are laid bare right now in the US but can be found in countries all around the world we stand with the protests that are happening right now in the United States and condemn the excess of police violence the protest gives give us hope hope that we are unified by common values and that real change is possible we created a seminar series as a means to bring the International robotics community together during this worldwide pandemic that has physically distanced us upon reflection we recognize that our community is not doing well when it comes to being inclusive to diverse voices from roboticists from a variety of backgrounds countries races and genders well we have some outreach programs for example for women and robotics and engineering we are lacking a broader set of measures as present as present in other communities this is a shout out to organizations like AR for all and black in AI what can we do to change the current status quo what can we do for the robotics community to embrace its richness with the seminar series we commit to diversify the voices typically heard in robotics and elevate new voices we will actively solicit suggestions for speakers from a diverse set of institutions and organizations we welcome suggestions for speakers from you you can send us names using the forum at the bottom of the seminar web page well this is only a small step we will leverage the large attendance to seminar series to foster a discussion about how to make the robotics community more inclusive if you have suggestions please also contact us through the forum on the seminar website with these words it's my pleasure to now introduce this week's speaker professor Allison Okamura allison did her undergrad at UC berkeley and her PhD at Stanford University both in mechanical engineering she is now a full professor in the mechanical engineering department at Stanford University her best-known work is on developing the principles and tools needed to realize advanced robotic and human machine systems capable of touch interaction particularly for biomedical applications such as tell operated robot-assisted surgery more recently Allison worked on software what's the type of Robo technology that I find just mind-boggling as none of the good old robotics principles actually hold soft robots have abilities that are hard to are sometimes impossible to implement on traditional robots yet they also open up many new challenges for exciting research direction which is what Allison is going to talk about today so welcome Allison thank you very much going to share my presentation I thank you all so much for inviting me here today it's an extraordinary thing that the organizers are doing with this seminar to bring us together and as Jeanette mentioned coming together is even more important now in the face of the racial injustice and challenges that people inside and outside our community are seeing and I'll actually have a few more words to say about diversity in the field of robotics at the end of my presentation but for now let me talk a little bit about my my motivation I've always been very interested in human machine systems because I'm just interested in people as I am and robots and the field of soft robotics as jeanette described is a growing relatively new field that I think has incredible potential to help people but it also has so many challenges that sometimes we don't know where to start so my talk will not just describe some specific projects in my research lab but also some thoughts kind of a position about how we should think about soft robot design and also thinking about applications and trying to make practical systems that can help people so the field of soft robotics spans so many different types of robots they can range from robots that are mostly traditional and stiff that have soft joints to robots where even the electronic components or the control components are effectively made of fluids and soft as well and along this spectrum you can find robots that are made soft both by their fundamental material for example many of the rope the robots shown in these images are made of elastomeric materials which are highly stretchable 300 percent more or higher strain but also you can have robots that are effectively made soft by their structure they're long and they're thin or they have soft joints and specific locations and this this sort of gives a design space that is quite varied and quite complex to consider another point is that these software materials the materials themselves they can be flexible and or they can be stretchable you can have material that are actually quite flexible and bendable but don't stretch and in fact the most of the materials that I'll be discussing today are in this class whereas there are also many soft robots made out of these stretchable elastomeric materials and the reason we think that we would like to have robots have these soft features is adaptability to the environment we get a lot of inspiration from biological systems ranging from plants to animals the potential for safety when you interact with people a soft robot might be lighter weight lower therefore lower inertia on contact and have less sharp edges and then finally although not always true there's also the potential to reduce cost with these soft robots and this will also get to issues of accessibility I'll discuss a bit at the end so when we look at what are the advantages of hard robots and soft robots and what are the fundamental structures of course there are many different types of robots but let's think about your traditional serial chain manipulator type robot here in a hard robot you have these localized joints which can swing quite a bit in in various directions but you have these stiff members the linkages soft robots tend to be more of a continuum nature that is they curve over a large space which can give them challenges with achieving particular work spaces with their tips but do allow them to navigate through environments perhaps in a more elegant and smooth way than a traditional hard robot so to give examples of this the localized joints of hard robots they allow sharp turns that lets them sometimes get places where a soft robot might not be able to go if it doesn't have the ability to curve sharply at a particular location on the other hand the bending and the softness of a soft robot will allow navigation that is perhaps safe for both the robot and the environment when you're operating in cluttered areas and the thing that I would like to be pushing a bit towards the end of this talk not that it's something we've fully achieved yet is that we could get the best of both worlds by having soft continuum members and also localized joints where they're required and we'll start to see some movement towards that in some of the more recent work so the focus that all have in the field of soft robotics is continuum robots and these are characterized by long thin members and are typically associated with manipulation tasks of course there are many other types of soft robots but and also many a more continuing robots than what I've cited here but it's an example of the types of systems that have been built by researchers all over the world in order to get this kind of continuum behavior some of them being classical soft robots others actually incorporating joints and pneumatics so the types of projects I'll be discussing today I'm going to pick out three in particular and I'd like to think of them as a continuum of continuum robots and the continuum that I'm talking about are first of all in material so in these three projects I'll be looking at devices where the material is inherently relatively stiff versus the other two examples where the material is relatively flexible but we're also going to look at the ways in which these materials are used within a structure in a case where the material is very stiff the only way in which the robot becomes soft is by the structure and the shape of it allowing it to be flexible you can have also robots like the middle example where the material and the structure is flexible and cases where although the low-level material might be flexible they're arranged in this relatively stiff structure and all these examples will hopefully enlighten some of the advantages and soft and hard along the way and I'm going to start with a project that's a few years old now but I think is a nice context for this area of work which are soft durable patient specific medical robots and the motivation for this type of research again thinking about the humanitarian aspects how do we actually create soft robots that are useful for people is that we can compare this to existing clinical devices such as this teleoperated da Vinci Surgical System which is useful in many medical procedures but you could kind of consider it to be a template surgical system in that you have a relatively limited set of tools and instruments and much of the way the operation is done has to be adapted to the robot and a challenge the humanitarian challenge for these types of systems there are many marginalized patient populations that cannot actually take advantage of these kinds of robots examples are children whose Anatomy is quite different from that for which the robot was designed as well as obese patients or other patients with comorbidities where access actually requires more adaptability and flexibility than what traditional robotic manipulators allow so in order to think about making this more patient specific design how do you make a personalized robot for someone who needs to have a surgery we start with the person and the data all show in these examples actually comes from a nine year old boy who had a kidney stone this particular picture is actually my own nine-year-old son not the patient from which the data was taken in this picture he's doing his favorite shelter-in-place activity which is playing Minecraft on the iPad we're working on that but what I wanted to communicate here is that when it comes to medical robots these are real surgeries on unreal people although not in this particular case well what you do when you start this kind of procedure is you perform a scan of the patient in this case the t CT scan that identifies the location of the lesion or in this case a kidney stone and then you can develop a 3d model of that specific patient and these images may look different from ones that you have seen before because most of the image you see will be see in the past are probably from adults whereas this one is from a nine-year-old boy for whom a da Vinci surgery wouldn't have been the right size and then what we're interested in is having this data this amazing information from the images of the patient in order to go through a design process and in that design process the surgeon now becomes a designer of the patient specific robot that we would like to use so this is an interesting thing for me as a mechanical engineer I think if you are a mechanic engineer several decades ago you would probably know very well how to fix your car I frankly don't know how to fix my car in large part because cars are so electronically controlled that they are closed off to the user even to an expert it requires a very specialized knowledge and really equipment in order to do anything with a car these days so in the same sense surgeons are now cut out from the design process of the surgical instruments that they use and so we would like to bring the surgeon back into the design loop and give them the tools to do that and this is something that we can do in a patient specific design workflow once the surgeon and I'll talk more in a minute about how this is accomplished but once the surgeon has come up with their desired design we fabricate the components of this relatively soft robot and then we drive it using a robotic base that can be used to control the device as it goes into the patient so let's talk about some of these components first I think it's important to discuss the type of robot itself you could probably go through this process with many different types of robots but what we've used are concentric tube robots the images here are shown using nitinol which is not being used for its shape memory alloy properties but rather because of its super elasticity and that is the nature of softness in this system this super elasticity allows these pretty curved tubes to be inserted and spun with respect to each other in order to create this tentacle-like behavior that you can hopefully see in this video although I'm sure it's a bit choppy over over zoom now in this kind of system I should note that it was inspired by previous work on steerable needles which were designed to go through tissue in this case concentric tube robots are designed to go through lumens or work in open space and there's been pioneering work on this type of robot from Bob Webster and people from Pierre du Pont's group and and many others as well so given this type of robot we have this design process that I mentioned allows the surgeon to be in the loop so my former PhD student tiny Morimoto here is demonstrating selecting a set of points where she would like her continuum robot to go and then the concentric tube robot is automatically designed using some somewhat complex kinematics given the fact that the bending of this robot occurs through material interactions of the various tubes and she's demonstrating how it can be moved around now normally in this design process what Tonya would be doing is designing the robot inside in 3d of the model of the patient but actually in a 2d video presenting to other people it's really hard to have situational awareness so here she's designing the robot and checking it outside of the virtual patient body so once that design is initialized it can also be optimized either through manipulation by the clinician themselves or by an automated system and this is actually a choice of the amount of automation versus human controlled design and you can simulate the robot afterwards and make sure that it's not moving and hitting for example soft tissues that you don't want it to make contact with so after this process we designed this and tested this obviously with people in the lab but it is really critical that clinicians can use it so this is one of our clinician collaborators dr. Shea who is a pediatric urologist who actually got us the scans of the patient the nine-year-old boy that we were trying to design the robot for my computer seems to be hanging a bit so I'll talk a little bit more about this and see if it recovers so once you go through this process of designing the robot we then 3d print it while I mentioned earlier that night null has been used as the material for many of these concentric tube robots and it has a lot of great advantages processing nitinol is actually relatively challenging night and all itself is in it because of its super elastic nature requires very large heat and/or voltages applied against it in order to set it but pcl a 3d printed plastic which is also biodegradable can be simply printed on a MakerBot and so this can be done in the lab they can also be sterilized and this can be used to make the tubes and kind of be made to order right after the design process occurs and once that happens it can be integrated into an actuation system in this case we took advantage of the flexibility of 3d printing to create a somewhat novel waffle gear approach to insertion and spinning of each of the three tubes and demonstrated that you can make this compact lightweight system handheld mounted on the base of another surgical robot like a DaVinci teleoperated robot and that you can reach targets within a few millimeters even without closed loop control so this is with open loop just using the kinematic models applied to these concentric tubes and in practice I should say it's unlikely that the system would be running autonomously it's going to be teleoperated for safety much as current teleoperated surgical robots are done so what we've been able to do is not yet apply this to patient that is still coming but we've actually effectively 3d printed a nine-year-old boy patient and the relevant organs based on the models that we had originally so we can identify various components like the liver the kidney itself and the tumor located in the kidney we can model this and as well as the obstacles that we have to go around like other organs and the the ribs in this case so what we can do do is use an off-the-shelf haptic device as a master manipulator and we can control the different degrees of freedom I won't be talking about it much here although an important future work for soft robots inand ongoing in many research groups is how do you control the many degrees of freedom of such a robot what is the right human interface if you want to teleoperated and in this case we had various tubes and buttons that are actually akin to many surgical robots that are used today so we've been able to demonstrate this in terms of going around different obstacles and reaching targets but as you can see due to the nature of this robot going back to my point earlier about not being able to make sharp turns this type of concentric tube of two robot well being very thin because the actuators are all off board at the base and so what goes into the patient is very small we still have this limitation that we cannot make very sharp sharp turns and that actually creates some limitations to it's possible work space as you can imagine so what we're going to start to do now is explore some other types of robots where we start towards being able to make sharp turns on soft continuum robots and the first example of that is a set of robots that grow by tip aversion and what I mean by tip aversion well first let me say what do you mean by growth what I mean by growth is systems that effectively extend their length not by just being pushed in the way a needle might be but rather by actually adding material to the tip there are many things in nature that do this and as shown in the bottom picture here lines which is why we call these vine robots has been a great inspiration for us so one of the ways in which you can extend the tip of something and have it still be a soft robot is do a process called aversion so in this somewhat hiccupping video hopefully you can see that we have a soft plastic material akin to the material of a ziplock bag formed in the shape of a tube and new material is fed through the center which you verse or flips inside out at the tip in order to lengthen and if you're having trouble picturing how this works perhaps you've played with a water snake toy they're really fun these are basically elongated toroid and in fact some people have made robots like these water snake toys I think mark mark Jim who's a visitor today a panel of guest panelists today has has made such robots in our case though rather than making a toroid we simply want to grow ours as long as possible and so we keep extending the tip rather than having it flipped back to the base and this can growth can happen extremely fast so here are a few more videos which demonstrate how this actually is achieved in a system how do we make this a deployable concept well you can create a spool of this state of Walled plastic material in a tubular shape put it in a pressurized air chamber flip over the top in an inversion and then apply air pressure which will cause it to grow and when you do this you can create unsupported vertical growth as shown in the top right video until eventually if buckles and falls over but it's a pretty amazing extension given the softness of the material and it's also possible because it's somewhat white lightweight and then when it's on the ground it can really go on until basically you run out of plastic which is what happened in this case so here we're seeing the school unwinding from a very compact package at the base and on the right we're sort of walking the path that the the robot followed in this case I should say though is it a robot it's really just a plastic bag filled with air that's being pressurized and going wherever it wants to go following the favorite moniker of soft roboticists of embodied intelligence but hopefully you can see in this video that it has managed to snake its way through some interesting obstacles such as a series of pipes they're about to come up just simply by bouncing off of the obstacles in the environment and continuing to want to grow and these are the pipes right here the video that I've seen so how do we make it a robot if this is a simply a plastic bag filled with air well you need to be able to steer it and controlling the direction of growth can be done using many different mechanisms our group and other research groups have tested various mechanisms and some are permanent which can actually be a little more efficient in terms of space and weight but for the most part you would like to have reversible direction change and for that we've built on some work done at MIT with pouch motors and we've created series pouch motors which are now mounted along the side of the robot and basically act like pneumatic tendons in order to shorten the length along certain sites of the robot and this is reversible and it's also a soft actuator such that it doesn't impede the inversion process and the robot can still grow so when you combine this ability to have pneumatic actuation for steering as well as growth you have this powerful ability to reach two targets in your work space in what some people seem to think is a pretty creepy pseudo biological behavior and all of the videos shown here are actually autonomously controlled based on a camera that's mounted on the tip of the robot and although of course these shortly that such robots can be teleoperated as well and for many humanitarian purposes we will want to tele operate the robot because we don't yet have the situational awareness to fully control a a soft-bodied robot in many environments so I want to point out that this pneumatic actuation method with series pouch motors is not the only way to control growth direction or steer it another is through tendon routing which does have advantages in terms of larger forces and being able to achieve larger curvatures so this is where this idea comes in that we need to have sharper turns in our soft robots in order to reach a desired workspace and while these are not 90-degree turns it's much tighter return than what we can achieve with a typical a typical pneumatic type actuator and if anybody is interested in how we've used these types of actuation in order to make antennas that change their shape that's actually an RAL paper that also has a presentation at a kura from my postdoc Laura bloomin shine so what are the applications I think the most exciting thing for me about this project although I get pretty geeked about the mechanism being kind of interesting is that there are some really interesting applications these robots can get into places where even many other soft robots can't go they can go through rough environments and even be punctured but still keep going because the material doesn't slide with respect to the thing that poked it and so whatever poked it effectively fills the hole and so it doesn't leak too much and then you can do things like deliver sensors through the tip one of my favorites is the video on the upper right which is our firefighting version of the robot remember that these robots are extremely cheap they're basically plastic bags filled with air and so if you would like to fight fire with it you can put a mix of water and air inside pressurize it and then the fire will melt the plastic and the water and air will come out at the desired location all of the examples on this slide are preformed robots that is we basically use tape in order to shorten the plastic in certain areas in order to have it achieve some desired shape based on what we know in the environment and that's also the case in this lower-left video where we're doing a simple manipulation task of growing around a valve and then pulling from the base in order to turn it one of the exciting things here is despite the fact that it's a soft robot because it's soft in terms of its flexibility and therefore it bends very easily but it's not actually stretchable you can pull from the base and the robot is actually quite strong in tension can be even stronger in tension if you run a string through the center and so because of that we're allowed we were unable to do this kind of remote manipulation task the last point I want to make which was showing on the video on the lower right is that you can also use obstacles in the environment to help you turn and so you can if you're aware of the environment you can do some planning the robot can take advantage of its softness this embodied intelligence in order to achieve its goal with actual actually very minimal actuation so those are all exciting applications which many of which we think can benefit humanity and things like search and rescue as well as medicine and I should note that medical applications are being explored by Elliott Hawks at UC Santa Barbara and Tania Morimoto at UC San Diego and the other application where we put this into practice has been archaeological exploration I'll see if I can get this video to continue playing great maybe not so great I will tell you about it as it attempts to play so this is something my student Margaret Code did where she took the soft green robot to an archaeological site in Tamim in Peru and was able to tele operate it into very small tunnels which previously are almost impossible to get into and this allows you to take images and even retrieve artifacts in locations that were not previously accessible so all of these really these examples I've given so far most of them are about navigation and I had one very simple manipulation task but in order to be useful for people we really need to think about how these kinds of soft manipulators how manipulators can be formed from these types of soft robots and one of the challenge that's probably pretty obvious to you by now is that it's not very strong in bending and so my student Brian doe has developed jamming techniques that the layer jamming that helps keep the robot stiff where desired and so a jammed robot can be made straight if desired compared to a nun damn right that will bent the other cool thing about this jamming technique or really any technique that allows you to selectively make parts of the robots more stiff versus more soft is that you can start to achieve these sharper turns that I mentioned earlier we're desirable so for example if you start with a long robot that has a tendon pull on one side or both sides you can unsticking a particular area of the robot pull on that tendon and then it will effectively turn or buckle at the point where you unstick and it and then you can rista fin it pull on a different tendon and then buckle it at a different point and therefore you can start to get these moveable placeable joints on the robot that starts to give you some of the kinds of dexterity you see in traditional hard robots but still enable the sort of soft robot behaviors that were also seeking to maintain now eventually what we would really like to do is real manipulation that is be able to pick up objects and move them around you could even extend this to in hand manipulation if you imagine multiple of these robots at this point where we're nowhere near making at each complex systems quite that small but this involves adding grippers to the end-effector being able to control curvature versus straightness where we want to and a couple of these are very recent works one of them being presented recently at a kura and and others that are under review so this is how we're starting to get towards manipulation and even being able to control the shape with more fidelity than has been achievable previously so all of this is pretty exciting but one of the things that I'm most excited about now is work that was very recently published about shape changing robots that are in a truss form factor and this word isoparametric I'll explain what I mean by that very shortly so these types of robots are inflated beam robots just like the vine robots I showed earlier the inflated beam is is the underlying component but now we are putting this into a truss form factor and trusses have certain advantages so many people this is just a small spattering of the example of prior work that's been done on trust robots but the traditional truss robot is based on the idea that you have joints which are connected by members that extend their length the difference or are soft growing tress robot whose video is extremely jumpy so you're probably not seeing it move much is that these members actually change in length and let's see if we can explain that better on the next slide so one of the key goals for creating a robot that will serve humanitarian purposes and move around in our environment is that we do have to remove the tether of the pneumatic system so many many examples of course of soft robots ranging from plastic ones to deformable ones is that they all have these tethers going to the pneumatic actuator base so for example compressor and this is something that we would like to avoid so rather than extending the members which requires additional pneumatic pressure so it requires more volume of air because air is compressible we have an approach where we would like to form a trust from a single continuous member so one inflated beam that we Bend together and instead of trying to actually extend the different lengths of the members we take a point which forms a joint and we move that joint around so that's the fundamental insight is that we make the joints move relative to the structure so that you can have a constant volume constant perimeter inflated beam and that's where the isoparametric comes from so in these cases you have this joint which can slide back and forth and move relative to the structure so this isoparametric robot the reason why it's called isoparametric is that pair the pair here is it's not with an EI it's with an e referring to the word perimeter and the idea is that the perimeter of one of these inflated beams remains constant and then the volume of air in the beam also remains constant and this allows it to change shape significantly just by moving the joints but not actually having to tether it and get additional air pressure and of course a key point here let me look at these different components and then I'll make my key point there's an inflated fabric tube in this case several of them attached together we have roller modules which create these movable joints and this is what I was referring to earlier in the talk about being able to take us off the robot and give it sharp turns these roller modules are allowing that in addition we need universal joints that connect the different tubes together in order to get a trust like shape and a last point is making these roller modules is not trivial it's actually very straightforward but making it happen in the real world actually requires a lot of analysis and careful experimentation to figure out how you can travel over the tube with a reasonable amount of friction so locomotion wise this trust robot can do it and it can do it well it's untethered which is pretty exciting it's not the fastest robot you've ever seen but it does allow itself to turn and rotate giving these different giving the different changes of the locations of the roller modules we also have some compliance of the overall system because the different members are inflated beings they are somewhat soft that said in order for the whole device to have the structure that it needs to have to maintain a trust their inflated to relatively high pressure say compared to our growing soft robots it might just be one or two psi in this case you mean need tens are possibly even hundreds of pounds per square inch yet still the robot is overall quite safe a person can even sit inside of it and jump on top of it as has been demonstrated by our students the robot itself can also use its softness to help it pick up and grasp and even do a kind of in hand manipulation of objects as we've shown with a basketball another cool thing about this type of robot if you think about the joints as being something that you can attach onto any inflated beams is a sense of modularity you could take something that was a three triangle truss robot and actually turn it in or 3d truss robot and turn it into a planar type of trust robot as shown on the left or you can use just one big beam as shown on the right and it can change size and change its shape depending on how you've mounted and connected the various roller modules so that's pretty exciting and so what we're getting towards here is the best of both worlds a robot that has some inherent underlying softness but one that has these sharp joints give it effectively some more dexterity like that which traditional robots have so these are three types of soft robots or continuum robots again with various properties of hardness and softness and their ability to create joints and the applications for the first two I found quite a bit the first one being patient specific medical robots the other one being a wide range of things ranging from manipulation to search-and-rescue the Tres Romo is going to have applications in exploration possibly even in space on other planets it has advantages of when you deflate it it becomes very small and relatively lightweight compared to other robots its size but it can be expanded to fill up a large space but that said all of these systems are ones that while they're shows initial promise there does still have to be a lot of work to make it done to be something that will truly help humanity so I think this is a call for not just robot assist everywhere as we notice the constantly a problem or a challenge but it's off robot assist to think about how do the systems actually evolve into something that can be practically used by human beings and speaking of human beings I really want to spend some time thanking the amazing people who have worked on these projects so first of all this is a set of folks who have been primary researchers on the projects that I just showed and I'm first listing people who have either already left my lab and have independent faculty careers or careers at other places as well as people who are just about to to leave the lab and I want to thank Tonya Elliott Laura Joey Ming and Nathan for everything that they've done in our group in addition in our larger set of soft robot projects I wanted to acknowledge the current students who working on these Fabio Margaret Nathaniel and Brian who aren't really yeah carrying the torch and pushing forward this technology and all of these folks have really deep humanitarian interests and would like to see these robots being used for good and then faculty collaborators Jonathan Shawn Mac and chief on as well as some others who who just yet we didn't have time to talk about those specific projects here and in all of their students who I'm not able to mention who have contributed to these projects working this group of people has just been extraordinary and then to my overall research lab group also known as the charmers we're known as the charm lab the collaborative haptics and robotics in medicine lab and the charmer is an amazing group of people who support each other they relish and their diverse research interests and are exploring this field together and with that I want to say a few things about the importance of humans in the field of robotics of course it's not just about humanitarian applications but also I think it's really important that we think about who does this research for me working with a diverse group of students and that diversity coming from so many directions whether it be gender or race or ethnicity sexual orientation socioeconomic background or nationality having a diverse group of people come together and work on robotics problems not just for funding or for to write a paper but because they would like to see how this work will impact their communities and how it will affect the lives of their children and in future future people throughout the world this is what brings me to work every day I do love robots i geeked out over there it's but what I really love the most is the people and I really want to emphasize how the diversity of this group is is what I think allows us to do a lot of the great great research that we're we're lucky to be allowed to do with that I want to thank everyone for listening and if you're interested in looking at more or getting a better view of our videos through our youtube channel you can go to charmed sanford edu thank you all right that's great thanks Alison that was a fantastic talk on thanks for being so personal and thanks also for pulling through their technical glitches with the interface sometimes with the videos so nicely um so I guess we're going to transition now to the to the panel discussion and very quickly we have in the panel today well Jeanette Luka Marco and myself and students mangu on Rachel and Neha which they've been paying attention and we continue paying attention to all the questions from the audience and we have a special guest today a special expert which just like Allison has been coming up with unique mechanisms throughout his life Markham thank you for being here he is with the mechanical engineering department and the rector of the grass Club and actually doing now sabbatical at Stanford so he maybe have a inside scoop on what's going on in Allison's laughs mark you wanna take it with the first question sure thanks I want to say how that was a really interesting talk there the breadth of the types of things that are you are doing is really interesting and I'd love to see that say I have I've been told by the moderators that I have to be relatively quick so I'm going to reduce my my four questions my five questions - just - and hopefully they'll be quite good the first thing is just following up on your the diversity part which is super important you have this also wide range of devices and applications and they're very different there's a lot of creativity going on in those types of things as you do the design does the diversity of the students the people that are involved how does it impact the design work that you do in terms of how you come up with things yeah thank you for asking that so I think the projects in our lab are in large part very student driven what I try to do is give as much freedom as possible to the students and the postdocs to engage in research directions that are of interest to them and a lot of the time that means being able to pivot and start exploring a new topic which was not your original goal so one example is when Elliott Hawks was first would first develop our ideas related to the the vine growing robot with tippy version we were at that point trying to do a completely different project and come up with soft linear actuators and Elliott mean Elliott probably came up with 20 different designs and I said that one well totally useless for the project that we were trying to solve is totally awesome and and if you like to explore it go for it upon which am listed about half my lab to switch over to vine robots and start exploring that topic this does create challenges in that you'll have to figure out how are you going to pivot funding how are you going to find opportunities for students to do this but to get more and more to your point you know this is sort of how it happens organically but but I do think a lot of the reason it does happen is because of the diversity of people involved and some of the ideas in our lab some of the best lines have come from high school students who intern for the summer because someone comes in with a different perspective or has not come from the same background and doesn't inherently feel or say see the same constraints or even the same opportunities as other people do that gives them a unique perspective and we're so lucky to be in a field like robotics which takes all comers there are so many different types of skill set so many different types of ways in which people contribute to the field you know we know robot assists who are psychologists so we never have bought us with your computer scientists and we know robota suspend all their time in a machine shop there are so many different ways that you can contribute and it's a field where almost no idea is bad it's a it's a creative field and for that creativity to flourish you really have to have people that are not all coming from the same background thanks hundred percent I'm bored with you that I believe exactly all that something if it's okay for me I'd like to ask a technical question also this is the last question the interesting thing about the soft robots the extreme side you got like an octopus right very very soft all muscle they can apply forces I want to focus on forces questions basically on forces I know you've shown the vine robot a point like lifting really heavy objects by getting underneath em and using pressure but I'm wondering whether focused applying focused forces like turning a bolt you know might be slightly different in nature if you look at animals that can apply focused large forces they have bones usually muscles and bones together do we need to have is it way is there way we can do things that are I mean you're talking about doing both but bones and muscles is that the only way are there other ways yeah that's a great question I you know there's definitely a trade-off between hard and soft and as soon as bones you may not be able to have the same type of navigation capability and so my view is it that likely will be application specific but I think a good place to start is to say if you do have a robot that is it's soft in what directions is it soft and what directions is it hard so for example this idea that a vine robot these plastic sheets of material there are very strong in tension and you have the potential to paralyze them right you could wrap multiple times around an object and then that parallel miss also enables very large forces but that doesn't necessarily mean that you can do that you know in any direction and any degree of freedom and so I think you have to decide where say you know this is my robot this is the set of materials I'm going to work with and I'm going to be able to channel the directions and then in the direct channel the forces in the directions I need to versus where am I going to need a new actuator or some kind of underlying hardness to to the structure thank you thanks mark feel free to jump in any time to ask another question or clarification so let me the question that I had in mind I think is related to last marks question and now that I'm thinking about it maybe it is the same one I don't know but I'll do it anyway so in your talk you make an explicit distinction between material and structure right and I guess that is a useful distinction when we're trying to do analysis or conceptualising sort of inventions where do I have to come up with a a new idea for each one of those two is that also a limitation is that a point where the distinction between what is material and what is structure becomes diffuse and there is no special distinction especially in the context of like 3d printing techniques now that more flexibility yeah that that's that's a great point so all models are wrong but some are useful and maybe this is one of those one of those models so I do think that there's concepts like metamaterials especially which actually emerge these ideas of structure and material and in that case it kind of flips my my interpretation on its head where you have individual components which are effectively thought of as having structure and then together they behave like a material with new interesting properties and I think a good example of the structural versus material kind of integrating into one would be oxidic so-called exotic materials you know definitely there are people that develop the materials themselves that are authentic so these are materials for those who are familiar with the term that don't obey Hasan's ratio and so as you push in one direction rather than expanding in the other direction they might compress in the other direction to put it to put it simply but many roboticists release people who would call themselves soft roboticists are coming up with different designs for structures that enable this authentic behavior which is thought of as a material behavior so there's definitely counter examples and you could certainly blur the line also through through smart materials which change their material properties which on be the need to rely on a structure to get a certain property right thanks of that one thanks I'll listen for the for the great talk and for the very interesting discussion I had a question actually about perception and still estimation so you think the slides example in which the robot we same with a camera pointing to the object it has to reach can complete you know complex tasks however you know of course in general if the robot has to navigate among the obstacles you know it will require extra safety complex exactly and reverse active sensing an estimation estimation including the configuration of the soft rubble itself so my question I guess it's a two-part question but you know my question is what are your thoughts on future research directions for steel estimation probably set to the next receptive sensing for soft robots and I guess a related question which is another angle on the same question is in which sense morphological computing which is this capability of leveraging mechanical aspects 12 the control set of things can mix till estimation I don't know either easier or harder I don't know thank you fantastic question thank you very much for asking about it yes I really did not talk about sensing at all in my presentation and that's a huge challenge a huge opportunity so what we focused on so far from sensing has really been about using the robot to deploy a sensor right a camera just you know to get an image of the environment and maybe to be involved in the control but really the point is to see where it is that your awareness that you're exploring we're doing a project now of going into the borough of California tiger salamanders and adding on temperature and humidity sensors and so really the robots purpose is to deploy those sensors but in order to control the robot I think this is kind of a debate that I think what soft robot Isis would agree exist in the community in that a soft robot purist might say well you you don't need to do precise control so you don't need to have great Xterra perception or even proprioception because the robot is just going to bounce around and wind up doing what it's supposed to do due to its embodied intelligence now for a lot of practical applications I I don't necessarily think that that you know that can't really be the universal answer so what we do need to have is first of all sufficient proprioception that you know when the robot is stuck are not growing in our case in the way that it should be and then be on the point of teleoperation you'd say you need sufficient proprioception an Xterra perception to give the human operator enough of a sense of telepresence a kind of situational awareness in order to do the control that they want to do as you probably guessed from my talk you know I'm not really a planning person although I collaborate with fantastic people who work on those topics so what I typically do is rely on the the human operator to look at that sensor information and effectively do that state estimation and make those decisions but when it comes to planning in unknown and in cluttered environments a combination of proprioceptors that tells you what is the actual shape of the robot and and its location in space relative to objects as well as Xterra perception that lets you know about sort of the contacts with those objects is going to be important and there are so many different types of sensors that creative people are exploring to do this but at this moment most of them frankly are just not yet practical to be integrated into these kinds of robots like they create too many wires they're too heavy they need to have specialized conditions under which to operate and we are constantly looking for sensors that we can add and have collaborators that we're exploring that with but but it's very challenging and so in large part we'd like to see how much we can get away with without doing sensing thank you okay hi so thank you first of all for your very insightful talk so far you haven't received a controversial question yet so it's my turn until has to do something magical is it to what extent soft robots address key application needs to example consider any diplomatic robot you see an application where these robots would present an optimal trade-off between you know amount of ability complexity robustness and so on yeah that's a great question so going into environments that require inspection is oftentimes not achievable with other types of robots so I'm just going to say inspection very broadly and this could be the search part of search-and-rescue it could be going into a mineshaft to observe it it could be going into the engine of a jet in order to do inspection these are things that are now not possible to do with a lot of rigid robots either because of their size because of their mode of locomotion like it's maybe not practical to send a drone in or the holes are too small or even a rigid type of snake robot to make it in and this soft robot you know will be able to enter those enter those spaces and make the kind of turns and exploit the environment and not be damaged by the environment other types of robots so I feel like if there's any sort of key general type of application it would be inspection at this point I think that hasn't happened in terms of seeing products and application because the robots typically aren't able to carry a payload rarely see soft robots carry a payload and one of the things that I'm not sure why it took me so long to realize this but I feel like very recently I noticed that most soft robot grippers and manipulators you see them pick up objects but you never see them put them down like they drop them into a trash can or they drop it into a paper bag but the ability to pick up and have sufficient control to put something down it's going to be another issue so inspection I think is something that's a low enough bar to achieve because you don't actually have to manipulate something carefully you just have to get sensors into different locations and soft robots can do that and they can carry sensors that have are effectively really small payloads so that's I think the first set of applications that just press really hard on this topic of course when you design a robot you also have to take into account power consumption so you have to bring with you a battery so that dramatically increases the system engineering and you know but I come from a space robotics domain where when you start putting together all these requirements then more complicated exotic solutions often times become less feasible so do you see that once we really have to fill these robots soft robots facilities and a good solution in spite of all the challenges that figure robotics represents so that's a good question I think you might be making an underlying assumption Marco that the soft robot will inherently have more complexity or require more components than more traditional robot which which I think is not true the video that I wasn't able to really play of the archaeological robot parts of that video show my student Margaret just piling the robot into a wheelbarrow carrying it out to the site having a very small portable compressor to provide the air and essentially plugging it in and doing it in the field at high altitude you know very far away from the comforts of home and and so we've shown that it is possible to kind of put these into a space where I feel like maybe that complexity isn't necessarily very less but at least the the weight of the system is much less than a similar robot that might be able to be built and maybe it wouldn't even be possible to have those same capabilities okay great thank you hi Allison one of our questions from the audience from anonymous is what kind of modeling approach can be used to applied to these growing robots such as how to describe the shape changing and how can these and all those be used for control great thanks a lot I called me on my equation free presentation I think I didn't have a single equation in there yeah absolutely so let me just talk about the spectrum of answers so then there's the soft robot and body telogen people that say you don't have to have a model if you design it right it's just going to do the right thing but I'm not going to push that argument any further there are many cases of course where you have to have have to have a model so and then within those modeling modeling methods you have you have a huge huge range so for example Christian draya's at in RIA and and collaborators have made very sophisticated finite element method or boundary element method models which are computationally intense but but can accurately describe both stretchable and flexible types of soft robots it does require quite a bit a kind of low-level mechanics base as well as computational knowledge to put those tools together in order to do those kinds of simulations and they've done a fantastic job of making their work available to the world and I think the world needs to catch up in terms of combining mechanics knowledge and computer science knowledge which is not often taught to the same people in order to make those types of models more ubiquitous and another challenge that those models still have is interaction with contact with the environment and in context might be able to model one row on in free space but it's more complex when you have multiple contacts and then there's this whole range of similar simplified models one of the recent robotics automation letters best paper award honorable mentions is looking at more continuum models that are kind of based on simpler equations and finite element or like continuous models that can be used to describe how things Bend and those have been applied mostly to continuum robots like the type that I described when you get to truly soft volumetric robots then we still don't know I think how to extrapolate those models into that into that space so that said the answer really is that there are many different types of models I think to the to the level that you're willing to either have the expertise or to tolerate errors people in a sock robotics community they pick and choose different different types of models but almost all of the subsistence I've showed we've had various different types of models that we've tried to apply to them and most of them are not really used in low level control but rather what they're used for is to optimize a design process or to understand the function of the design great then a final question for Michelle are there any research directions and soft robotics where micro electro mechanical systems are being thought of as an underlying building block oh that's a great question so the question is about men's being a building block to to soft robots so I this is definitely not something going on in my lab but of course there are great many a fantastic robotics group working on on MEMS based robots I think the challenge is there's two main challenges one is challenges of scale right how do those actuators become integrated into a robot that is trying to operate at a larger scale and can they be used as actuators can they somehow be integrated into into sensors as sensors yes as actuators maybe not maybe the idea there would really have to be about what are new types of stuff robots that are smaller and on the scale of MEMS rather than trying to apply MEMS to this other scale another challenge that I totally did not highlight in my talk because I was not referring to elastomeric soft robots is that when you have very stretchy materials like elastomers and very soft plastics their interface with the hard materials which would be what amends typical MEMS device would be created from if it's challenging to have that interface between something that's very stretchable and something that doesn't flex at all and this is a constant challenge in building soft elastomeric robots and so thinking about how a MEMS device wouldn't just rip itself out of something that's that's stretching a lot I think it's an open problem am i next I think mention the mutants question yeah so I have a question from an anonymous audience this is related to the model question but more general so the question is what is the theoretical framework and challenges for the white robots oh great so for the vine robot I would say that at least in my research group I don't think that we have a a single theoretical framework we have different ones so for example we list submitted a paper that's really trying to understand the shapes that can be achieved through tendon actuation and it's totally geometric and kind of kinematical and all about just shape and not much about say dynamics or forces on the other hand we have another paper under review which is trying to understand the dynamics of these vine robots because and this is a really an open challenge which is that there may be some really useful behaviors that could be achieved by kind of ballistic motions I kick you throw really fast maybe you could grow across a gap that you would otherwise fall down into - due to the weight of the robot but understanding those dynamics so that you could shoot across would be critical and and for that we've been trying to base it more on classical models like the robot equation but I should say that because of the continuum nature of the robot that is is still a pretty challenging approach so understanding shape understanding dynamics and how both of those can be integrated - with control are open challenges and maybe give a hint at the types of frameworks that can be used but there's no one unified master framework that we're using here okay kind of following on along the lines of the previous two questions I'm wondering so there are some clearly difficult issues with modeling and the theoretical aspects you know there's a reason why we do rigid body models cuz it's easy on the other hand a lot of the robots that you build I mean there are some real hard design issues getting them to actually work how did you like that joint on the truss robot the one question a simple question is which do you think is harder and maybe another just following on that is more like what can you give an example of another example of the tricky design problem of know-how what makes it hard yeah that's a great question it's all hard I guess and then how you frame the problem may be may be they can be made easy but I would say when it comes to the mechanical design of many soft robots there there is the sort of optimization approach you're using something like the sofa framework from inria another guy named my name earlier where you can do very you know a careful optimization in you know in a virtual space first and then try to implement the robot and that's one approach but a lot of it is prototyping in the lab with glue and popsicle sticks and for some people that works really well and that's actually an interesting challenge for us I've taught a software lab for humidity class or freshman at Stanford cocoa design with Laura bloomin shine and in this class our challenge was to take you know the design approaches that are used by PhD students and postdocs in the lab and how do you translate those to someone who maybe has very little or even no physics background and for that it's been a lot about how do you just define what our basic mechanical principles which are advantageous and and how do you use those to create new ideas and these freshmen came up with amazing ideas and I should add a very diverse group of freshmen did this once they were taught just a few of the fundamental mechanical principles which is a combination of understanding the mechanics and potential models as well as having an intuition for how those things behave physically so both of those parts can be difficult as you get more complex but I think we have found ways to break it down in order to give people a good starting point not sure if that fully answered your question feel free to follow up that was good I have a kind of a one last quick maybe it's a good question kind of along the lines of what Marco was saying to me a little bit more conscious not so controversial whether you live a controversial admit just pushing things on the truss robots we have trusses usually because I mean in buildings and then you know in engineering you have trusses because you want something strong but light right it's a frame discussion yes a structure can I'm worried that with a soft robot soft truss robot do we lose something because it's soft in terms of the strength to weight ratio when we look at soft trust robots yeah absolutely soft robot that I described as isoparametric robot it um we're basically treating it like a rigid robot we inflate the beam sufficiently that they are effectively rigid and to the extent that they're not perfectly rigid it's not going to be as structurally rigid and and as kind of see from that perspective and the only place in that robot where the softness is good is the fact that these rollers can go along and bend it and change that kind of virtual joint location so that's kind of the only plus I thought maybe the only obvious plus for softness in in that robot otherwise the softness there I would say it's disadvantageous for a typical trust application and so I think that trade-off being able to significant shape change which you would not be able to have in a traditional trust and even many traditional trust robots but also you know have some challenges yeah creating generated enough force on their actually there's for you know building type trusses but that that is is probably the trade-off there so the only the main advantage of softness is is being able to create the virtual joints something about the compliance of the robot but your sorties mean you don't want to compliance no but I mean the thing you got to get is a huge range of expansion to compression ratio with the soft joint which you cannot get with let's say a piston which is really well another people go yeah thanks my guys a mark has designed some absolutely amazing trust robots some of them based on a kind of zipper growing robot design which has been very inspiring to our lab thanks I have another audience question from Jen do you have any suggestions or criticisms to make it more provoking for the direction of using deep learning for soft robotics oh that's a great question I myself I'm not a kind of learning person and I'm trying to get up to speed but it's definitely not not my training or my field and indeed we have been interested in understanding when and where learning is appropriate so I feel like there's two places learning can be used one of course is a very high level like with any robot and so without separately categories categorizing soft robots all the ways in which learning is good and bad and challenging and helpful that occur with traditional robots also occur with software life but I think the thing that's specific to soft robots is that the challenging mechanics the difficulty of modeling the physics the question is when do you go to a learning method to understand those underlying physics of the robot and that's actually something I personally struggle with I'm not sure if my graduating Nathaniel is what right now but he recently proposed ocean we use learning for this aspect and and in that case but we should be able to come up with like a real physics model in that case and so I'm kind of pushing for us to come up with a model based on the mechanics but that said there are definitely going to be cases where it gets beyond our ability to really model and simulate and in that case the challenge becomes how do we acquire the data necessary to do learning how many times can we take a physical system and take data on its behavior in order to populate that model whatever it is we're typically going to need more data than most real physical robots are happy do we maybe maybe industrial robots can do it but most soft robots are not really even purpose-built to to last in order to make that many I guess repetitions of movement alright it's time to wrap up I would like to thank you again Allison for her very nice overview for the field of soft robotics and for sharing her perspectives on a number of important items Allison is actually one of the leaders of the bodies community and she's going to have an open session on Fri on Thursday 11th so you may want to join that open session organized within a craft if you want to talk to her directly and in particular if you may want to share with her some suggestions about how to make the robotics community more inclusive better in German are basically following the discussion that Jeanette had at the beginning Oh like I would also like to thank Mike for being our guest panelist this week next week we're going to have another exciting talk while anti dragon on human robot interaction so we look forward to seeing all of you next week thank you and have a nice weekend thank you
