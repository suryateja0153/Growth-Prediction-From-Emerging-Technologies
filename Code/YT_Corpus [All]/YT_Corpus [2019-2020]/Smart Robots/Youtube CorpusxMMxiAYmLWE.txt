 hey guys it's justine and today we're gonna be unboxing something that will help you clean your house robots [Music] so i have the irobot roomba and the irobot brava jet my sister actually has this one and she has been saying how amazing it is so i'm really excited to check it out a huge thank you to irobot for sponsoring this video i cannot wait to have a clean house i have purposely been not cleaning the floors i mean i'm saying purposely but just like i really just haven't actually cleaned them so this is going to be great because there's a lot of dirt all over the place but don't worry we're also going to show you how it can disappear very quickly let's unbox it's been a while since i've been like super excited to unbox something i mean i do unbox a lot of stuff but this is gonna help me keep my life in order and clean oh this is its base station the real question is what are we gonna name it seriously really exciting i've been spending so much more time at home and to be able to have sort of the heavily trafficked areas clean consistently throughout the day especially the entrance to my little backyard area because the dog is constantly in and out of there all day long so this will be able to know my high traffic areas and take care of it for me i wonder if you make a good dinner companion how's your conversational skills mine are pretty poor look at this let's get it set up and then i'll unbox the bravo jet while this is charging [Music] okay brava jet oh look at you this is really sleek looking and we've got the base station [Applause] cables oh look at this this is a washable wet mopping pad and here's a couple of the single use wet mopping pads here's a sweeping pad so we have a sweeping pad a mopping pad and a washable now we need to find a home for this and then we're gonna set up the app and get these all synced up so we can start some cleaning so i've read all my directions i have the app downloaded these guys are all plugged in and now it's time to set them up let's set up the vacuum let's name it roomba mama press and hold spot and home spot at home okay i've pressed the buttons oh setup is complete welcome to the world rumble mama this is the best thing i've ever seen in my life maddie please we're doing a software update get hyped so the update for the roomba mama is ready so this is just about ready to clean i'm gonna set up the mop then start this clean while this charges it's all a process but this is gonna be great because once these are all set up everything will basically be automated and i won't have to really do anything what should we name this one how about baby brava there we go connect to my wi-fi once baby bravo is connected to your wi-fi i love these names this is the best part about it that's interesting so depending upon which pad you install into the bravo jet it'll automatically put it in that mode there's different automations that you can set your robots up to do so you can actually have it set up so that when you leave the house the robots will know that you're no longer here and they'll start cleaning so that you can return home to a clean house i also love that this has integration with alexa and google i'm like i always bring my voice down like so they can't hear me she heard me she already heard me so with that integration you'll be able to communicate with your voice through those devices to have them clean a specific room or just clean the house so we're about to do our first clean and this has no map data of my house so we need to do this first clean so that it's able to kind of get its bearings so first things first roomba mama let's get this party started [Music] [Applause] this is you this is your first time [Applause] it's learning it's learning [Music] i love that he's like not even afraid of it he's like all right i have a busy schedule and i also have a dog who frequently tracks in dirt and makes a lot of messes i can easily set a schedule so they can clean specific rooms on certain days or just clean every room with imprint link technology roomba and bravojet are able to mop my home and clean without me having to do anything it's really cool because it's able to imprint smart mapping to be able to learn its way around my home i do have two floors in my house so this could also learn my upstairs as well as the downstairs you can choose a room to be cleaned in the app and you can also use smart home integration with amazon alexa and google roomba clean my kitchen i love that you can make keep out zones these are virtual boundaries so i can make sure that my dog's food and water dishes are off limits you can also add clean zones for a place that might frequently need cleaning like the kitchen island or the front door there's an all new updated app that lets you build out your own map and customize it with room dividers labels and zones you can also add favorites so with one tap you'll be able to clean your preferred room or highly trafficked areas it's also always learning your space and it keeps evolving the more you use it [Music] i'm so entertained i've been watching this thing the whole time it's navigating around everything like it found its way out of so many obstacles it went under the couch and then came back out and made its way around the garbage can i went upstairs to play video games and then i got a notification that said roomba mama was completed so i clean this entire downstairs return to the base by itself to do a charge and it also empties itself so when it returns it'll actually empty itself from here into this bag originally i was going to do a dusting first with a brava jet but the roomba did such a great job of cleaning that we're going to go straight to the mopping you also have an option to add some of this bravo jet solution this is some cleaning solution that you can put into the reservoir along with some water which is in here oh tank guide look at this instructions everywhere lift the handles remove the tank and we fill this up so here's the mopping pad this is one of the one use wet ones and this little cardboard here that you install right into the bottom this will determine what mode that it places itself into automatically then we'll put in our water tank ready to wet mop it automatically identified which pad that i put on and now we're gonna mop everywhere time for cleaning time for cleaning i brought in my sister i mentioned her before because she actually has one of the irobots as well so i wanted to show her the new updated app because you don't actually have it yet the one that i'm using right now it's in beta and i'm testing it so when i showed it to her she's like wait i don't have any of these features well i thought it was just like an example and i'm like wait that's the layout that's so cool yeah i don't have that that's really neat so yesterday i filmed the unboxing of the setup and then i realized when i was going to finish this video that i still needed to make sure that the robot was doing some more training and it had some more time to learn my layout so i did that and i basically lifted up everything i i feel like a quick little video but i put everything up so that it could completely really learn the whole area so i put like my trash can up i put like everything away so that it would know the full layout and then once i put those things back down it'll know that they're there but i wanted it to be able to get a sense of the entire layout so let me show you this here it is these are my two rooms so this is kind of like the kitchen area and my living room it's very yeah i know we can go in and customize oh that's so cool okay so this is downstairs and then we're gonna hit next and so this is saving everything that's cool yeah i don't look at this i don't have that i just i turn it on and i can like set a schedule but this is cool look it's letting me set up room since it already divided it says room obama tries hard but doesn't always get rooms exactly right please review and tweak as needed oh honestly it did a pretty good job to be honest with you this is good look we can add a divider if we wanted to oh my gosh and i can just turn it like that did you guys see that look at this i'm turning it this is fascinating i know now we can label each room oh i can't wait until yours updates to this it's gonna be cool tap a room to label okay okay let's call this let's just call this kitchen kitchen kitchen's nice very generic just this is the kitchen here we go living room there you go you can set up favorites so i can just vacuum everywhere or i can add my own favorite so i can set up the kitchen what color should kitchen be really a purple okay then you can set up to mop after i know i know i know i'm shocked and then we're gonna click them off after nice now because you already cleaned it look at this choose the mop oh my gosh so i can also set a schedule which is kind of cool because if i wanted this to clean up basically like after my day of you know existing and making messes in my house yeah i can set it to start how about like nine o'clock yes that sounds good and then we can also do an automation so if i want to enable this it'll know that whenever i leave it can just start cleaning so that when i come back it'll be nice and clean that is pretty cool you can also set up zones so maddie's food and his dish is usually like over there look at this i can zoom in whoa and we can add a keep out zone that's really cool i know it's probably about that much maybe okay so we're gonna save it because i don't want his little food dude no it'll bump it yeah or the one time he was eating dinner and the vacuum was coming and he's just like so unbothered by it i'm like buddy move move maddie get out the way i'm eating leave me alone so thanks for joining my video yeah i was excited when you told me i was like you've done a lot of cool things but i was really excited about this and when i told her there was a brava jet that mops lost my mind thank you guys so much for watching i put a link in the description if you guys want to check out both of these the irobot roomba and the irobot brava jet i'm obsessed now you're gonna have to get yourself a grab a jet i know it's so cute i love it i'm just kidding should i just have them clean again yes
