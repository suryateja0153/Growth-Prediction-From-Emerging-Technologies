 in our quest to build robots with artificial intelligence we face five distinct challenges the first of these is a problem of the robot being able to see you can put a camera on a robot but that just gets you data the robot has to discern what all that data is when you look inside your refrigerator you see a bunch of items but a robot just sees a bunch of pixels millions of specks of light in color it doesn't know what a shelf is or a drawer or a can or a jar it just season and differentiated massive pixels how do you even start to make sense of that how do you go from those numbers - that's a gallon of milk it's quite difficult the number of things that go on in your brain when you look in the refrigerator is complex in the extreme a description of how your mind performs that minor miracle would require pages of techno babble about polygons and cones and layers the way you can for instance identify the architectural style of a house or tell a duck in flight or how you tell twins apart or any of the other hundred similar tasks that you effortlessly do is the envy of AI programmers everywhere if you're interested in artificial intelligence visit genome comm or check out my new book the fourth age smart robots conscious computers and the future of humanity
