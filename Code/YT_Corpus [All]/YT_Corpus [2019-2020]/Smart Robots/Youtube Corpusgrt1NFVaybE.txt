 [Music] hi everyone today we are going to present you industrial automation robot called Eva and we're showing you how it's remotely controlled by a team there IOT the robot is operated by a Linux operating system and has our team variety software pre-installed with this you can remotely access the user interface to remotely assist remotely operate and remotely troubleshoot to device a robot like our Eva here is used in manufacturing factories to automate tasks like steering liquids every two hours so you can preload sequences on the robot and automatically trigger them with team variety in a situation where something goes wrong an engineer would receive an alert he can then connected a robotic arm from anywhere using TV royalty once connected the engineer can check all the sensors the operating system the log files and set up a test sequence to see why the alarm was triggered this would reduce the mean time to repair and the likeliness of failures you can wrongly assist your customers who are standing right in front of the machine by remotely connecting into the robot arm interface by doing so you can guide your client on how to properly operate the machine and set parameters all without having to physically be where the customer is therefore being able to assist remotely with to your IOT is enabling you to reduce waiting times increase customer satisfaction all this while reducing costs with TV IOT you can collect valuable sensor data from the robot arm such as the operating time of the robots to monitor wear and tear of the Machine as well as the productivity and also improve critical processes what you can see on the user interface is a different position and angle of each hinge in the different operating modes the data is submitted to the TeamViewer cloud where the data is aggregated visualized and can you managed by setting thresholds to each parameter and the previous year's senior was known for connecting to desktop devices such as computers now with TV era you can connect anything anywhere anytime even a device without a desktop we provided the most satisfying digital experience for you and your customers you
