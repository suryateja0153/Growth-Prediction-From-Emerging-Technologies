 try to imagine this robots roaming the aisles of a grocery store might sound like science fiction but you can expect to see self scanning robots sell floor scrubbers and other technological innovations at San Antonio Walmart's in the near future this is all part of an investment meant to save customers time and money Sara Costa shows us some of these automated machines that are already in a New Braunfels Walmart and she also talks with a local professor about what this means for the future of the retail industry meet bossa nova he's at the Walmart in New Braunfels he roams the aisles of Walmart making sure shelves are fully stocked he can even read if people are in the aisle where he will politely stop scanning so he doesn't get in their way bossa nova is part of the 265 million dollar investment Walmart is putting into new technologies in its Texas stores the goal to provide quicker and better customer service about three times a day for about three our periods bossa nova goes down every aisle scanning items telling associates what needs to be restocked before something that may have been stocked tomorrow or later in the day now can be within minutes of it coming in we know that hey this is out on the shelf someone's going and bringing it out the New Braunfels Walmart is considered a technology store trial running the latest innovations but you'll see more bossa Nova's in area San Antonio Walmart stores along with other innovations like self scrubbing machines or self-checkouts and Walmart online pickup tower but what does this mean for future jobs I mean there has to be a shift 200 years ago we put a paddle wheel in a river and we started to have machinery rather than human horsepower director of the MBA program of the University of Incarnate Word says machines taking place of human workers is something we've been seeing for centuries he says this is just another migration shift in the retail industry to seeing more technology in stores to keep up with consumer demand this is a migration and I don't know it feels like it's gonna be a pretty quick migration though it's not gonna be a hundred year period we're gonna have to be we maybe in five or six years the store manager at the New Braunfels Walmart says the machines will not be replacing store associates it's not necessarily replacing anything we're still manually taking this stuff down but it's definitely about efficiency and then helping customer service Robert says whether we see less jobs in the retail industry in the future or not the human touch will always be necessary there's gonna be a need for some compassion and somebody that can make a decision and it doesn't work off on an algorithm that's gonna have to keep going on Sara Costa joins us live now tonight so Sara you went to New Braunfels Walmart so when can we see bossa nova that's the name right can we see bossa Nova's in San Antonio Bosco's are actually pretty cute by the way okay well you've already seen some of those large orange online pickup towers you can't miss them there as soon as you walk into the front of the stores those are ready in a lot of the area San Antonio Walmart's as well as those self scrubbing machines that clean the floors automatically it looks like someone's actually driving them but no giant Roomba yeah basically yeah giant Roomba but the bossa nova is you'll actually start seeing those rolling down the aisles throughout San instating Antonio stores throughout this year okay they called boss for short stay tuned I guess well actually it was really funny every store is encouraged to name their robot and this one was named Texas Walker Ranger protects all right okay Texas Walker Romer I guess I'm gonna roam off
