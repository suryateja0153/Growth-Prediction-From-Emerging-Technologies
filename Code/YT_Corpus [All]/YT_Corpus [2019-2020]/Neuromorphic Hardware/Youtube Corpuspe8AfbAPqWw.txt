 a memristor a portmanteau of memory resistor is a hypothetical nonlinear passive to terminal electrical component relating electric charge in magnetic flux linkage it was envisioned and its name coined in 1971 by circuit theorists Leon Chua according to the characterizing mathematical relations the memristor would hypothetically operate in the following way the memristors electrical resistance is not constant but depends on the history of current that had previously flowed through the device ie its present resistance depends on how much electric charge has flowed in what direction through it in the past the device remembers its history the so called non volatility property when the electric power supply is turned off the memristor remembers its most recent resistance until it is turned on again in 2008 a team at HP Labs claimed to have found chewers missing memristor based on an analysis of a thin film of titanium dioxide thus connecting the operation of rerum devices to the memristor contact the HP result was published in the scientific journal Nature following this claim Leon Chua has argued that the memristor definition could be generalized to cover all forms of to terminal non-volatile memory devices based on resistance switching effects 2 also argued that the memristor is the oldest known circuit element with its effects predating the resistor capacitor and inductor there are however some serious doubts as to whether a genuine memristor can actually exist in physical reality additionally some experimental evidence contradicts truest generalizations since a non-passive nano battery effect is observable in resistance switching memory a simple test has been proposed by person and dye Ventura to analyze whether such an ideal or generic memristor does actually exist or is a purely mathematical concept up to now there seems to be no experimental resistance switching device rerum which can pass the test these devices are intended for applications in nano electronic memories computer logic and neuromorphic neuro memory Steve computer architectures in 2013 hewlett-packard CEO Martin Fink suggested that memristor memory may become commercially available as early as 2018 in March 2012 a team of researchers from hrl Laboratories in the university of michigan announced the first functioning memristor array built on a CMOS chip topic bag ground in his 1971 paper sharor extrapolated a conceptual symmetry between the nonlinear resistor voltage versus current nonlinear capacitor voltage versus charge and nonlinear inductor magnetic flux linkage versus current he then inferred the possibility of a memristor is another fundamental nonlinear circuit element linking magnetic flux in charge in contrast to a linear or nonlinear resistor the memristor has a dynamic relationship between current and voltage including a memory of past voltages or currents other scientists had proposed dynamic memory resistors such as the master of bernhard woodrow but you are attempted to introduce mathematical generality memristor resistance depends on the integral of the input applied to the terminals rather than on the instantaneous value of the input is in of arista since the element remembers the amount of current that last passed through it was tagged by two ER with the name memristor another way of describing a memristor is as any passive to terminal circuit element that maintains a functional relationship between the time integral of current called charge and the time integral of voltage often called flux as it is related to magnetic flux the slope of this function is called the memory stance M and is similar to variable resistance the memristor definition is based solely on the fundamental circuit variables of current and voltage and their time integrals just like the resistor capacitor and inductor unlike those three elements however which are allowed in linear time-invariant or LTI system theory memristors of interest have a dynamic function with memory and may be described as some function of net charge there is no such thing as a standard memristor instead each device implements a particular function wherein the integral of voltage determines the integral of current and vice-versa a linear time-invariant memristor with a constant value for M is simply a conventional resistor manufactured devices are never purely memristors ideal memristor but also exhibit some capacitance and resistance topic memristor definition and criticism according to the original 1971 definition the memristor was the fourth fundamental circuit element forming a nonlinear relationship between electric charge and magnetic flux linkage in 2011 Sher argued for a broader definition that included all two terminal non-volatile memory devices based on resistance switching Williams argued that mram phase change memory and rerum were memories two technologies some researchers argued that biological structures such as blood and skin fit the definition others argued that the memory device under development by HP Labs and other forms of rerum were not memristors but rather part of a broader class of variable resistance systems and that a broader definition of memristor is a scientifically unjustifiable land grab that favored HP's memristor patents in 2011 Muir Falls and Schroder noted that one of the early memories two papers included a mistaken assumption regarding ionic conduction in 2012 Muir Falls and Sony discussed some fundamental issues and problems in the realization of memristors they indicated inadequacies in the electrochemical modelling presented in the nature article the missing memristor found because the impact of concentration polarization effects on the behavior of metal - titanium for oxide - x - metal structures under voltage or current stress was not considered this critique was referred to by Val of a al in 2013 in a kind of thought experiment Mia Falls and sunny furthermore revealed a severe inconsistency if a current controlled memristor with the so called non volatility property exists in physical reality its behavior would violate Landauer's principle of the minimum amount of energy required to change information states of a system this critique was finally adopted by Dai Ventura and person in 2013 within this context Mia Falls and sunny pointed to a fundamental thermodynamic principle non-volatile information storage requires the existence of free energy barriers that separate the distinct internal memory states of a system from each other otherwise one would be faced with an indifference situation and the system would arbitrarily fluctuate from one memory state to another just under the influence of thermal fluctuations when unprotected against thermal fluctuations the internal memory states exhibit some diffusive dynamics which causes state degradation the free energy barriers must therefore be high enough to ensure a low bit error probability of bit operation consequently there is always a lower limit of energy requirement depending on the required bit error probability for intentionally changing a bit value in any memory device in the general concept of memory stiff system the defining equations are si Theory YT equals g ex UT UT x equals f x UT displaced I'll begin aligned Y T and equals G must be FX UT UT dot math B FX and equals F math B FX UT and aligned where UT is an input signal and YT is an output signal the vector X represents a set of n state variables describing the different internal memory states of the device X is the time-dependent rate of change of the state vector X with time when one wants to go beyond mere curve fitting and aims at a real physical modeling of non-volatile memory elements eg resistive random access memory devices one has to keep an eye on the aforementioned physical correlations to check the adequacy of the proposed model and its resulting state equations the input signal u t can be superposed with a stochastic Tam XI T which takes into account the existence of inevitable thermal fluctuations the dynamic state equation in its general form then finally reads x equals f x you see plus she t.t displaced i'll got math BF x equals f math BF x UT plus she t t where she t is eg white gaussian current or voltage noise on base of an analytical or numerical analysis of the time dependent response of the system towards noise a decision on the physical validity of the modeling approach can be made eg would the system be able to retain its memory states in power off mode such an analysis was performed by dive enter and person with regard to the genuine current controlled memristor as the proposed dynamic state equation provides no physical mechanism enabling such a memristor to cope with inevitable thermal fluctuations a current controlled memristor would erratically change its state in course of time just under the influence of current noise dive enter and person thus concluded that memristors whose resistance memory states depend solely on the current or voltage history would be unable to protect their memory States against unavoidable Johnson Nicklaus noise and permanently suffer from information loss a so called stochastic catastrophe a current controlled memory stick and thus not exist as a solid state device in physical reality the above-mentioned thermodynamic principle furthermore implies that the operation of two terminal non-volatile memory devices eg resistance switching memory devices bream cannot be associated with the memristor concept ie such devices cannot by itself remember their current or voltage history transitions between distinct internal memory or resistance states are of probabilistic nature the probability for a transition from state I to state J depends on the height of the free energy barrier between both states the transition probability can thus be influenced by suitably driving the memory device ie by lowering the free energy barrier for the transition I J by means of for example an externally applied bias a resistance switching event can simply be enforced by setting the external bias to a value above a certain threshold value this is the trivial case ie the free energy barrier for the transition I J is reduced to zero in case one applies biases below the threshold value there is still a finite probability that the device will switch in course of time triggered by a random thermal fluctuation but as one is dealing with probabilistic processes it is impossible to predict when the switching event will occur that is the basic reason for the stochastic nature of all observed resistance switching rerum processes if the free energy barriers are not high enough the memory device can even switch without having to do anything when a two-terminal non-volatile memory device is found to be in a distinct resistance state J there exists therefore no physical one-to-one relationship between its present state and its foregoing voltage history the switching behavior of individual non-volatile memory devices thus cannot be described within the mathematical framework proposed for memristor memory stove systems an extra thermodynamic curiosity arises from the definition that memristors memory Steve devices should energetically act like resistors the instantaneous electrical power entering such a device is completely dissipated as Joule heat to the surrounding so no extra energy remains in the system after it has been brought from one resistance state she to another one XJ thus the internal energy of the memristor device in state she UV T she would be the same as in state xj UV t XJ even though these different states would give rise to different devices resistances which itself must be caused by physical alterations of the device's material other researchers noted that memristor models based on the assumption of linear ionic drift do not account for asymmetry between set time high to low resistance switching and reset time low to high resistance switching and do not provide ionic mobility values consistent with experimental data nonlinear ionic drift models have been proposed to compensate for this deficiency a 2014 article from researchers of rerum concluded that stru curves HP's initial basic memristor modeling equations do not reflect the actual device physics well whereas subsequent physics based models such as Pickett's model or Menzel's ECM model Menzel is a co-author of that article have adequate predictability but are computationally prohibitive as of 2014 the search continues for a model that balances these issues the article identifies chang's and yack optics models as potentially good compromises martin reynolds an electrical engineering analyst with research outfit garner commented that while HP was being sloppy in calling the device a memristor critics were being pedantic in saying that it was not a memory stir in the article the missing memristor has not been found published in scientific reports in 2015 by von Garin mang it was shown that the real memristor defined in 1971 is not possible without using magnetic induction this was illustrated by constructing a mechanical analog of the memristor and then analytically showing that the mechanical memristor cannot be constructed without using an inertial mass as it is well-known that the mechanical equivalent of an electrical inductor is mass it proves that memory are not possible without using magnetic induction thus it can be argued that the variable resistance devices such as the rerum x' and the conceptual memristors may have no equivalents at all topic experimental tests for memristors chewer suggested experimental tests to determine if a device may properly be categorized as a memory stir the Lissa du curve in the voltage current plane is a pinched hysteresis loop when driven by any bipolar periodic voltage or current without respect to initial conditions the area of each lobe of the pinched hysteresis loop shrinks as the frequency of the forcing signal increases as the frequency tends to infinity the hysteresis loop degenerates to a straight line through the origin whose slope depends on the amplitude and shape of the forcing signal according to chiral resistive switching memories including rerum MRAM and phase change memory meet these criteria and a memristors however the lack of data for the lissajous curves over a range of initial conditions or over a range of frequencies complicates assessments of this claim experimental evidence shows that redox based resistance memory rerum includes a nano battery effect that is contrary to Chua's memristor model this indicates that the memristor theory needs to be extended or corrected to enable accurate rerum modeling topic theory the memristor was originally defined in terms of a nonlinear functional relationship between magnetic flux linkage Phi M T and the amount of electric charge that has flowed QT F Phi M C Q T equals zero displaced I left mathram Phi underscore Matt from mt q t equals zero the magnetic flux linkage Phi M is generalized from the circuit characteristic of an inductor it does not represent a magnetic field here its physical meaning is discussed below the symbol Phi M may be regarded as the integral of voltage over time in the relationship between Phi M and Q the derivative of one with respect to the other depends on the value of one or the other and so each memristor is characterized by its memory since function describing the charge dependin rate of change of flux with charge M Q equals D Phi M D Q display style M Q equals prac Matt from D Phi underscore M Matt from d qu substituting the flux is the time integral of the voltage and charges the time integral of current the more convenient forms are M Q T equals D Phi M D T D Q D T equals V T hi t display style M Q T equals C frac math from D Phi underscore M Matt from DT Matt from DQ mathram DT equals track v TI t to relate the memristor to the resistor capacitor and inductor it is helpful to isolate the term M Q which characterizes the device and write it as a differential equation the above table covers all meaningful ratios of differentials of I Q Phi M and V no device can relate I to DQ or D Phi M to DV because I is the derivative of Q and Phi M is the integral of V it can be inferred from this that memory census charge dependent resistance if mqt is a constant then we obtain Ohm's law our T equals V T I t if mq t is non-trivial however the equation is not equivalent because Q T and M Q T can vary with time solving for voltage is a function of time produces V T equals M q t hi t display style V T equals M q TI T this equation reveals that member astons defines a linear relationship between current and voltage as long as M does not vary with charge non zero current implies time varying charge alternating currents however may reveal the linear dependence in circuit operation by inducing a measurable voltage without net charge movement as long as the maximum change in Q does not cause much change in M furthermore the memristor is static if no current is applied if I t topic 0 we find V T zero and M T is constant this is the essence of the memory effect the power consumption characteristic recalls that of a resistor I to our P tea equals I tea Vee tea equals I to tea cute tea display style P T equals AI T V T equals I carrot 2 T M Q T as long as M Q T varies little such as under alternating current the memristor will appear as a constant resistor if M Q T increases rapidly however current and power consumption will quickly stop MQ is physically restricted to be positive for all values of Q assuming the device is passive and does not become super conductive at some Q a negative value would mean that it would perpetually supply energy when operated with alternating current in 2008 researchers from HP Labs introduced a model for a memory stance function based on thin films of titanium dioxide for Ron raff the memory stints function was determined to be M Q T equals R o F F 1

resistance state Ron represents the low resistance state new V represents the mobility of dopants in the thin film and D represents the film thickness the HP Labs group noted that window functions were necessary to compensate for differences between experimental measurements and their memristor model due to nonlinear our own ik drift and boundary effects topic operation is a switch for some memristors applied current or voltage causes substantial change in resistance such devices may be characterized as switches by investigating the time and energy that must be spent to achieve a desired change in resistance this assumes that the applied voltage remains constant solving for energy dissipation during a single switching event reveals that for a memristor to switch from Ron to Roth in time ton to tov the charge must change by delta q equals q o n- cough e s w i-- t c h equals v2 t o f f t o n d t m q t equals v2 q o f f q o n z q AI q M Q equals v2 q o F F q o n D Q V Q equals V

from DQ v q equals V Delta Q substituting V topic by Q M Q and then d QV increment Q V for constant VT o produces the final expression this power characteristic differs fundamentally from that of a metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor which is capacitor based unlike the transistor the final state of the memristor in terms of charge does not depend on bias voltage the type of memristor described by William ceases to be ideal after switching over its entire resistance range creating hysteresis also called the hard switching regime another kind of switch would have a cyclic amp cube so that each off on event would be followed by an on-off event under constant bias such a device would act as a memory stirrer under all conditions but would be less practical topic memory Steve systems the memristor was generalized to memory Steve systems in Tua's 1976 paper whereas a memristor has mathematically scalar state a system has vector state the number of state variables is independent of the number of terminals to reply this model to empirically observed phenomena including the hodgkin-huxley model of the axon and a thermistor at constant ambient temperature he also described memory Steve systems in terms of energy storage and easily observed electrical characteristics these characteristics might match resistive random access memory relating the theory to active areas of research in the more general concept of an nth-order mam restive system the defining equations of y t equals g x UT UT x equals f x UT displaced I'll begin aligned Y T and equals G Tech's BF x UT UT dot x BF X and equals F Tech's BF x UT and aligned where UT is an input signal YT is an output signal the vector X represents a set of n state variables describing the device and G and F are continuous functions for a current controlled memory stiff system the signal UT represents the current signal I T and the signal Y T represents the voltage signal V T for a voltage controlled memory stiff system the signal UT represents the voltage signal VT and the signal Y T represents the current signal i T the pure memristor is a particular case of these equations namely when X depends only on charge X topic q and since the charge is related to the current via the time derivative DQ DT I tea thus for pure memristors F ie the rate of change of the state must be equal or proportional to the current I T topic pinched hysteresis one of the resulting properties of memristors and memory stiff systems is the existence of a pinched hysteresis effect for a current controlled memory stiff system the input UT is the current I T the output YT is the voltage V T and the slope of the curve represents the electrical resistance the change in slope of the pinched hysteresis curves demonstrates switching between different resistance states which is a phenomenon central to rerum and other forms of to terminal resistance memory at high frequencies mem restive theory predicts the pinched hysteresis effect will degenerate resulting in a straight line representative of a linear resistor it has been proven that some types of non-crossing pinched hysteresis calves denoted type ii cannot be described by memristors topic extended memory stiff systems some researchers have raised the question of the scientific legitimacy of HP's memristor models in explaining the behavior of rerum and have suggested extended memory steve models to remedy perceived deficiencies one example attempts to extend the memory stiff systems framework by including dynamic systems incorporating higher-order derivatives of

memristor revived when an experimental solid-state version was reported by our Stanley Williams of Hewlett Packard in 2007 the article was the first to demonstrate that a solid-state device could have the characteristics of a memristor based on the behavior of nanoscale thin films the device neither uses magnetic flux as the theoretical memristor suggested nor stores charged as a capacitor ders but instead achieves a resistance dependent on the history of current although not cited in HP's initial reports on the titanium for oxide memristor the resistance switching characteristics of titanium dioxide were originally described in the 1960s the HP device is composed of a thin 50 nanometers titanium dioxide film between 2 5 nanometers thick electrodes one titanium the other platinum initially there are two layers to the titanium dioxide film one of which has a slight depletion of oxygen atoms the oxygen vacancies act as charge carriers meaning that the depleted layer has a much lower resistance in the non depleted layer when an electric field is applied the oxygen vacancies drift see fast ion conductor changing the boundary between the high resistance and low resistance layers thus the resistance of the film as a whole is dependent on how much charge has been passed through it in a particular direction which is reversible by changing the direction of current since the HP device displays fast ion conduction at nano scale it is considered a nano ionic device memra stance is displayed only when both the doped layer and depleted layer contribute to resistance when enough charge has passed through the memristor that the ions can no longer move the device enters hysteresis it ceases to integrate Q equals IDT but rather keeps Q at an upper bound and M fixed thus acting is a constant resistor until current is reversed memory applications of thin film oxides have been an area of active investigation for some time IBM published an article in 2000 regarding structures similar to that described by Williams Samsung has a US patent for oxide vacancy based switches similar to that described by Williams Williams also has a US patent application related to the memristor construction in April 2010 HP Labs announced that they had practical memristors working at one nanosecond approximately 1 gigahertz switching times and three nanometers by 3 nanometers sizes which bodes well for the future of the technology at these densities it could easily rival the current sub 25 nanometer flash memory technology topic polymeric memristor in 2004 Krieger and Spitzer described dynamic doping of polymer and inorganic dielectric like materials that improve the switching characteristics and retention required to create functioning non-volatile memory cells they used a passive layer between electrode and active thin films which enhance the extraction of ions from the electrode it is possible to use fast ion conductor as this passive layer which allows a significant reduction of the ionic extraction field in July 2008 erican and Fontana claimed to have developed a polymeric memristor before the more recently announced titanium dioxide memristor in 2010 a leave art gamrat vuillaume al introduced a new hybrid organic nanoparticle device the n om Fe T nanoparticle organic memory field effect transistor which behaves as a memory stirrer and which exhibits the main behavior of a biological spiking synapse this device also called synapse turth synapse transistor was used to demonstrate a neuro inspired circuit associative memory showing a Pavlovian learning in 2012 creepy Pradhan and toza described a proof-of-concept design to create neural synaptic memory circuits using organic ion based memristors the synaptic it demonstrated long-term potentiation for learning as well as in activity-based forgetting using a grid of circuits a pattern of life was stored and later recalled this mimics the behavior of the v1 neurons in the primary visual cortex that act as spatio-temporal filters that process visual signals such as edges and moving lines topic layered memristor in 2014 besan ave al reported a flexible memristor device comprising a moocs moss to hetero structure sandwiched between silver electrodes on a plastic foil the fabrication method is entirely based on printing and solution processing technologies using two-dimensional layered transition metal dye chalcogen IDEs TM DS the memristors are mechanically flexible optically transparent and produced at low cost the memory steve behavior of switches was found to be accompanied by a prominent man capacitive effect high switching performance demonstrated synaptic plasticity and sustainability to mechanical deformations promised to emulate the appealing characteristics of biological neural systems in novel computing technologies topic Oh Tom wrister Tom wrister is defined as the electrical devices showing memory Steve behavior in atomically thin nanomaterials or atomic sheets in 2018 G in blue Al first reported a universal memristor effect in single layer TMD mx2 M topic mo W and X s che atomic sheets based on vertical metal insulator metal MIM device structure these are Tom wristers offer forming free switching and both unipolar and bipolar operation the switching behavior is found in single crystalline and polycrystalline films with various metallic electrodes gold silver and graphene atomically thin tmd sheets are prepared via CVD MOCVD enabling low-cost fabrication afterwards taking advantage of the low on resistance and large on/off ratio a high-performance zero power RF switch is proved based on Moss twoa tom misters indicating a new application of memristors topic ferroelectric memristor the ferroelectric memristor is based on a thin ferroelectric barrier sandwiched between two metallic electrodes switching the polarization of the ferroelectric material by applying a positive or negative voltage across the junction can lead to a two order of magnitude resistance variation refer on an effect called tunnel electro resistance in general the polarization does not switch abruptly the reversal occurs gradually through the nucleation and growth of ferroelectric domains with opposite polarization during this process the resistance is neither Ronal rough but in-between when the voltage is cycled the ferroelectric domain configuration evolve allowing a fine tuning of the resistance value the ferroelectric memristors main advantages are that ferroelectric domain dynamics can be tuned offering a way to engineer the memristor response and that the resistance variations are due to purely electronic phenomena aiding device reliability as no deep change to the material structure is involved topic carbon nanotube memristor in 2013 a gay F Blin of Al reported observing memristor effect in structure based on vertically aligned carbon nanotubes studying bundles of CNT by scanning tunneling microscope later it was found that CNT memory stove switching is observed when a nanotube has a non-uniform elastic strain delta l0 it was shown that the memory stove switching mechanism of strained SNT is based on the formation and subsequent redistribution of non-uniform elastic strain and piezoelectric field add F in the nanotube under the influence of an external electric field e X T topic spin memory stove systems topic spintronic memristor Chenin Wang researchers at disk drive manufacturer Seagate technology described three examples of possible magnetic memristors in one device resistance occurs when the spin of electrons in one section of the device points in a different direction from those in another section creating a domain wall a boundary between the two sections electrons flowing into the device have a certain spin which alters the devices magnetization state changing the magnetization in turn moves the domain wall and changes the resistance the work's significance led to an interview by I Tripoli spectrum a first experimental proof of the spintronic memristor based on domain wall motion by spin currents in a magnetic tunnel Junction was given in 2011 topic memory stance in a magnetic tunnel junction the magnetic tunnel Junction has been proposed to act as a memory stir through several potentially complementary mechanisms both extrinsic redox reactions charge trapping de trapping and electro migration within the barrier and intrinsic spin transfer torque topic extrinsic mechanism based on research performed between 1999 and 2003 Bowen al published experiments in 2006 on a magnetic tunnel junction mtj endowed with by stable spin dependent states resistive switching the mtj consists in RS RTO three stow tunnel barrier that separates half metallic oxide LS MO and ferromagnetic metal COC are electrodes the Mt J's usual to device resistance states characterized by a parallel or antiparallel alignment of electrode magnetization are altered by applying an electric field when the electric field is applied from the COC R to the L s mo electrode the tunnel magnet resistance TM r ratio is positive when the direction of electric field is reversed the TMR is negative in both cases large amplitudes of TM are on the order of 30 percent are found since a fully spin-polarized current flows from the half metallic Ellis mo electrode within the Jolly air model this sign change suggests a sign change in the effective spin polarization of the stove see OCR interface the origin to this multi-state effect lies with the observed migration of CR into the barrier and its state of oxidation the sign change of TM r can originate from modifications to the stove see OCR interface density of states as well as from changes to the tunneling landscape at the stove see OCR interface induced by Crocs redox reactions reports on MgO based memristors switching with in MgO based mt J's appeared starting in 2008 and 2009 while the drift of oxygen vacancies within the insulating MgO layer has been proposed to describe the observed memristor effects another explanation could be charged trapping de trapping on the localized states of oxygen vacancies and its impact on spintronics this highlights the importance of understanding what role oxygen vacancies play in the memory stove operation of devices that deploy complex oxides with an intrinsic property such as ferroelectricity or multi ferocity topic intrinsic mechanism the magnetization state of our mtj can be controlled by spin transfer torque and can thus through this intrinsic physical mechanism exhibit memory Steve behavior this spin torque is induced by current flowing through the junction and leads to an efficient means of achieving or MRAM however the length of time the current flows through the junction determines the amount of current needed ie charges the key variable the combination of intrinsic spin transfer torque and extrinsic resistive switching mechanisms naturally leads to a second-order memory stiff system described by the state vector ax equals x1 x2 where x1 describes the magnetic state of the electrodes and x2 denotes the resistive state of the MgO barrier in this case the change of x1 is current controlled spin torque is due to a high current density whereas the change of x2 is voltage controlled the drift of oxygen vacancies is due to high electric fields the presence of both effects in a memory stiff magnetic tunnel Junction led to the idea of a nanoscopic synapse neuron system equals topic spin memory stove system equals a fundamentally different mechanism for mem restive behavior has been proposed by person and Devendra the authors show that certain types of semiconductor spintronic structures belong to a broad class of memory stiff systems is defined by turin kang the mechanism of memory steve behavior in such structures is based entirely on the electron spin degree of freedom which allows for a more convenient control than the ionic transport in nano structures when an external control parameter such as voltage is changed the adjustment of electron spin polarization is delayed because of the diffusion and relaxation processes causing hysteresis this result was anticipated in the study of spin extraction at semiconductor ferromagnet interfaces but was not described in terms of memory Steve behavior on a short timescale these structures behave almost as an ideal memristor this result broadens the possible range of applications of semiconductor spintronics and makes a step forward in future practical applications equals Topic self-directed channel memristor equals in 2017 dr. chris campbell formally introduced the self-directed channel SDC memristor the SDC device is the first memory stiv device available commercially to researchers students and electronics enthusiasts worldwide the SDC device is operational immediately after fabrication in the germanium selenide active layer GG homopolar bonds are found and switching occurs the three layers consisting of germanium selenide AG germanium selenide directly below the top tungsten electrode mixed together during deposition and joined lee form the silver source layer a layer of tin to solenoid is between these two layers ensuring that the silver source layer is not in direct contact with the active layer since silver does not migrate into the active layer at high temperatures and the active layer maintains a high glass transition temperature of about 350 degrees Celsius 662 degrees Fahrenheit the device has significantly higher processing in operating temperatures at 250 degrees Celsius 482 degrees Fahrenheit and at least 150 degrees Celsius 302 degrees Fahrenheit respectively these processing and operating temperatures are higher than most ion conducting chalcogen ID device types including the s based glasses eg GES that need to be photo doped or thermally annealed these factors allow the SDC device to operate over a wide range of temperatures including long-term continuous operation at 150 degrees Celsius 302 degrees Fahrenheit topic applications Williams solid-state memory stirs can be combined into devices called crossbar latches which could replace transistors in future computers given their much higher circuit density they can potentially be fashioned into non-volatile solid-state memory which would allow greater data density than hard drives with access time similar to DRAM replacing both components HP prototyped a crossbar latch memory that can fit 100 gigabits in a square centimeter and proposed a scalable 3d design consisting of up to 1000 layers or one pet of it per cc in May 2008 HP reported that its device reaches currently about 1/10 the speed of DRAM the devices resistance would be read with alternating current so that the stored value would not be affected in May 2012 it was reported that the access time have been improved to 90 nanoseconds which is nearly 100 times faster than the contemporaneous flash memory at the same time the energy consumption was just 1% of that consumed by flash memory memristor patents include applications in programmable logic signal processing neural networks control systems reconfigurable computing brain computer interfaces and RFID memory Steve devices are potentially used for stateful logic implication allowing a replacement for seamos based logic computation several early works have been reported in this direction in 2009 a simple electronic circuit consisting of an LC network in the memristor was used to model experiments on adaptive behavior of unicellular organisms it was shown that subjected to a train of periodic pulses the circuit learns and anticipates the next pulse similar to the behavior of slime moulds physarum poly Cephalon where the viscosity of channels in the cytoplasm responds to periodic environment changes applications of such circuits may include eg pattern recognition the DAR PA synapse project funded HP labs in collaboration with the Boston University Neera morphix lab has been developing neuromorphic architectures which may be based on memory stiff systems in 2010 versace and chandler described the monitor modular neural exploring travelling agent model monitor is the first large-scale neural network model to implement whole brain circuits to power virtual and robotic agent using memory Steve Hardware application of the memristor cross bar structure in the construction of an analog soft computing system was demonstrated by Marek biotin shower Archy in 2011 they showed how memristor cross bars can be combined with fuzzy logic to create an analog memory stove neuro fuzzy computing system with fuzzy input and output terminals learning is based on the creation of fuzzy relations inspired from heavy and learning rule in 2013 Leon Chua published a tutorial underlining the broad span of complex phenomena and applications that memristors span and how they can be used as non-volatile analog memories and can mimic classic habituation and learning phenomena according to our live market research memristor market was worth 3.2 million dollars in 2015 and will be worth 79 million
