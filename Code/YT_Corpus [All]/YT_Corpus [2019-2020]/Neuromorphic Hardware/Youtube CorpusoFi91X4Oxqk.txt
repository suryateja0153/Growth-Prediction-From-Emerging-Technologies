 With Intel's new Tiger Lake processors Users of Alexa for PC can expect a bunch of benefits. Intel and Amazon have had a really strong partnership over the years and it was instrumental in bringing voice to the PC. To provide users with a seamless Voice Forward experience that takes advantage of all the unique capabilities that a PC can provide. We partnered with Intel to use their super resolution AI feature that Intel's launching with Tiger Lake to upscale low resolution video feeds that are coming in. The benefit for users is that when they're receiving a call with Alexa the quality will be much higher. Alexa is trying to push the ball forward in bringing voice to PCs. Playing music or controlling your smart home, placing video calls. Intel's new Tiger Lake processor will help users access all of the convenience and utility that Alexa provides. It's fundamentally different than the way they use PCs today and I think that's what we're really excited about.
