 the Intel 80,000 188 microprocessor was a variant of the Intel 80186 the 80,000 188 had an 8-bit external data bus instead of the 16-bit bus of the 80186 this made it less expensive to connect to peripherals the 16-bit registers in the one megabyte address range were unchanged however it had a throughput of 1 million instructions per second topic description you topic features and performance the 80,000 188 series was generally intended for embedded systems as microcontrollers with external memory therefore to reduce the number of chips required it included features such as clock generator interrupt controller timers wait state generator DMA channels and external chip select lines while the N 801 8/8 was compatible with the 8087 numerics coprocessor the eight OC one eight eight was not it didn't have the esc control codes integrated the initial clock rate of the 80,000 188 was six megahertz but due to more hardware available for the microcode to use especially for address calculation many individual instructions ran faster than on an 8086 at the same clock frequency for instance the common register plus immediate addressing mode was significantly faster than on the 8086 especially when a memory location was both one of the operands and the destination multiply and divide also showed great improvement being several times as fast as on the original 8086 and multi bit shifts were done almost four times as quickly as in the 8086 topic end of life along with hundreds of other processor models Intel discontinued the 80,000 188 processor the 30th of March 2006 after a life of about 24 years equals equals notes
