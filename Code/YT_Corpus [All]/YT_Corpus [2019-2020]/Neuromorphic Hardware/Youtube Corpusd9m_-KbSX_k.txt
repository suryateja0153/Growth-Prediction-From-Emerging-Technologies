 AV1 is a next generation video codec technology. This allows users to stream high-resolution video in the Google Chrome browser on thin and light laptops while being power efficient. The Alliance for Open Media released AV1, for use by anyone, royalty free. This year has really taught us the importance of video conferencing & video calls both for work and pleasure. Google and Intel have been working together to insure that AV1 can be implemented very easily both in software and in hardware that provides smooth streaming at high resolutions for all users. AV1 hardware on Intel’s 11th Generation Core processors with Iris Xe graphics allows users to stream high-resolution video while having less data usage on their metered data connections so they can save money. Google Duo added AV1 this year to bring AV1 video calls to users using as low as 30 kilobits per second. We hope that Google and Intel’s investment into AV1 hardware on the 11th Gen Core processors is really going to be used by many streaming video providers as well as video conferencing technology across the web. Google and Intel’s partnership with AV1 has really helped us bring better experiences to users all over the world.
