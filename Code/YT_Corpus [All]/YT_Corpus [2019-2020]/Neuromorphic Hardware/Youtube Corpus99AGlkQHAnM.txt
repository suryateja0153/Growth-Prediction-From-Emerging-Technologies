 [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, hey, hey. I'm so proud and so excited to be here with you all. We want you working with us on the journey, giving us input, giving us feedback, helping us develop together. We want to hear from you directly. You guys are why we are here. I'm very excited to talk to all of you today about our new UI Intel Graphics Command Center. It was important to us to get it out early and start feeling the feedback and seeing what's really critical to people, and what's intuitive, or not intuitive about a UI for graphics. We have the pleasure of launching our Ice Lake, our 10th generation core. And I think you guys will all be happy to know it has our new gen 11 graphics engine in it. So this-- this is the razor blade stealth, based on Ice Lake 10th generation processor. It runs at 25 watts. This thing is badass. I want to invite to the stage, a very special guest of us from Creative Assembly. He's the Director of Rendering, Tamas Rabel. Creative Assembly's partnership with Intel goes back a long time. We have worked together on many successful games in the past 10 years. We have worked really hard to give something new and, you know something fresh to the players. But what we would like to share with you today is about the future. I was on a stage in GDC together with Cristiano, and he revealed the first concept of the design. But we told him, you know, Cristiano, this is cool. Can you actually create for us something going beyond that, something in the future? Look at this one. [GASPS] This is truly amazing. Mr. Chris Hook! Ari, dop you realize we're going to be retired by the time we have to deliver these [INAUDIBLE].. You are telling me that I'm old? No, my friend, I'm telling you that we're old. It's more than a journey. It's an odyssey! Woo!
