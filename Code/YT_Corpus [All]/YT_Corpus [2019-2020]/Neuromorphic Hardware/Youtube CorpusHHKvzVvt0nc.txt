 david thank you very much for uh joining me in this podcast and i want to introduce you a little bit so david hambling is a journalist and author based in south london specializing in science technology and strange phenomena and you're also a physicist right oh yeah that's my background my degree which was a very long time ago now was in physics yes the first time we spoke was in uh this summer and that was when i came across a series of articles written by by you while i was researching on topics reported by leslie keane uh on the new york times there were some articles on the pentagon ufo videos which i then discussed in my podcast and then with the chat this summer where you told me about an article you wrote on a usa navy laser that creates plasma ufos what was that patent about uh yeah indeed this is it's part of a long-term effort to protect aircraft against heat-seeking missiles and there's been several technologies which have been used in the past particularly flares the idea is you eject a hot flare and that then distracts a missile away from the aircraft or there's also towed decoys which are laid out on a long cable but obviously those both have their disadvantages so the idea was to use a laser to create an object mid-air that would attract the heat-seeking missile and they use this using what's known as a um laser-induced plasma filament and the idea is that if you have a high enough intensity laser it can actually cause the air to glow and you with by focusing the laser correctly you can have that occur at a distance of tens or hundreds of meters away and by using a series of laser pulses you could create a shape mid-air so in the instance of the navy patent the idea was that you could create essentially uh a ghost aeroplane that would look more like an aircraft than the real target and would decoy uh incoming missiles away from it but of course this technology would have lots of other applications in that if you if you happen to want to create a glowing ball of plasma that looked like ufo so basically you can do very weird maneuvers with this kind of technology you could have something that moves like zigzag or yeah it it doesn't need to obey the same laws as a uh as a physical object it's more like a shadow if you shine the beam of a torch of something you can have that circle of light moving around wherever you want it's exactly the same kind of thing but that's was only the the latest patent the the american military had been working on related technology for about 40 years and the russians possibly even slightly longer than that though they were using microwaves rather than noises i mean because you are ionizing the air then you should be able also to pick up maybe an infrared signal from this kind of ghost image so the thing would appear in the in the detection systems of aircraft yeah well and another interesting thing is that the plasma is um radio opaque it reflects radio waves so you could have something that would show up on both radar and infrared imaging uh and which was also visible as a ball of light so you could create something that looked very much like a real solid object uh except there's really nothing there and it can just appear or vanish as ufos tend to so this would be something of something of this world rather than out of this world very much so i mean there's the even more bizarre version uh of this they worked on uh which is known as sometimes called the voice of god um because it's not a uh a continuous ball because it's actually a series of flickering uh plasma that comes and goes uh and every time it appears you get a slight sound and the idea was that by modulating the frequency that it appears you could actually carry a modulated signal so you could have a human voice being carried by it so what you have is effectively a talking fireball and in the very original idea of this uh and this is going back about um 30 years um the idea was to overall people with this who think that it was something spooky or supernatural um but it's actually there is now a version of that which has been uh developed by the us marine corps as a means of conveying voice commands to long range that they've demonstrated it's not very good but it shows what the technology will ultimately be capable of that's amazing if you want to be a cult leader uh yeah i think that's that's the the kind of thing they might have had in mind uh so you also spoke about uh other instances of uh unidentified objects and there have been reports of ufos flying around restricted areas such as nuclear power plants and you wrote an article about a case of five or six drones flying over the palo verde nuclear power plant in the u.s and that was in september 2019 now the strange thing is that these drones were flying longer than 30 minutes which is weird for commercial drones so what do you think was happening there uh well from the size of them they were reported as being uh more than three feet across so these are obviously much bigger than the normal consumer drones but well within the size range of commercial drones that's all that are used for carrying cameras um but rather than just being a few hundred dollars drones like that are several thousand dollars and clearly someone had the money to be flying a fleet of those uh over payload verdi they hung around and they apparently surveyed the place for something like half an hour and then they went away and the security forces were unable to ascertain where they'd come from so we have no idea who was behind that um but the equally strange thing was the next night they came back and did the same thing again that's not the only nuclear power plant that's been there's uh the freedom of information uh act requests have shown that they have literally been dozens of incursions like that sometimes with one drone occasionally with three or more at the same time over nuclear power plants all across the us and the vast majority of these are unsolved and nobody knows who's behind them or what they're doing so maybe it could be some some other adversary power trying to test the security of these facilities or a lot of people assume it's the some arm of the u.s government who's carrying out its own tests just to see what happens um but it's clearly someone with money so it's not just a few hobbyists messing around because it's a lot of drones it's a lot of expensive drones and it's all the way across the us um so there's clearly something rather bigger going on though inevitably i did actually have someone email me and say no they're not drones they're ufos it would be a sort of a penetration test if you are talking about network security yes exactly it could well be something like that uh and one of the curious things is that the the nuclear authorities have said that there is no threat from the drones uh they are doing very little about taking additional security measures they don't seem bothered at all because their theory is that um nuclear power plants are corrected by protected by several feet of concrete so they don't see that there's any real danger which may turn out to be a very naive view we are talking about drones but uh there are different types of drones you can have flying drones you can have drones on sea on land how would you define a drone what's a drone a lot of people don't like the term at all but uh you could use it to apply to any unmanned or remotely controlled system yeah yeah and you wrote a great book i read your book called the swarm troopers how small drones will conquer the world it's a great work and you make some very good points about military drone technology and future developments can you briefly tell me what was this book about at the moment the drones are beginning to have quite a significant impact on warfare at the moment the chief users are the us air force and the cia who've been using them for what are called counter insurgency operations so that's very low level conflicts where you're dealing with insurgents and terrorists uh that's well short of uh an actual hot war um but we've also seen very recently in nagorno-karabakh where there have been drones making a significant impact on the battlefield and a full-scale war and that's kind of likely to happen more in the future now the the big drones like the reapers that the u.s air force use go for 20 30 million dollars a piece whereas small drones like the consumer drones made by dji the sort that you can buy over the internet um those are only a few hundred dollars so you could literally buy tens of thousands of these uh for the cost of one reaper and you can do a lot of damage with 10 000 small drones yeah so you mentioned the reaper you said it's very expensive i mean a reaper would cost i think you so you mentioned 20 millions can be even more than that so it's about a third or a quarter of an f-35 fighter jet right i've had some interesting discussions with uh general atomics who make it about what the exact cost is uh and it does get very complicated um but uh somewhere well over that and uh i haven't the uae have just bought some uh i would have to check how much they're paying a unit but i bet you it's a lot more than 30 million a time and i guess you can customize them depending on what your needs are uh yes and that doesn't make them any cheaper either what's the state of the art of drones uh big drones at the moment um so the big drone something like the the mq-9 reaper is about the the most advanced thing there is out there um in terms of military aircraft it's very low performance uh it only goes at about 300 miles an hour it's not stealthy uh it's really more like a world war two aircraft in terms of performance but what it really has got is endurance it can circle over a target area for a very long time with an endurance of 40 hours or more now going ahead from this they're looking at stealthy jet fighter type drones but that's still somewhere ahead and in terms of cost i mean you can keep improving and improving these these drones until they get so complicated and so expensive that basically there was a guy that wrote the sets of sets of rules these are yeah augustine's laws yes by 2054 the air force and navy were only able to afford a single aircraft between them uh and in many ways his uh he works uh on both sides of the uh defense business both as a contractor uh and for the military and he saw that there is this inexorable rise of price of military systems that uh the there is a tendency for them to just shoot up in price uh partly because the government will always pay and there's no incentive to keep costs down uh and one of the interesting things is that that's in stark contrast to consumer electronics where things do tend to get cheaper over time and you can now you get increasingly more capability for the same price year on year and when you compare those two things side by side one of them is going to tend to lose and uh i mean there seems to be a solution to this uh large and expensive hardware and in fact rather than focusing on the development of single offensive and highly sophisticated machines uh there are people talking about the distributed approaches you wrote an article about this uh this talk there was a talk by timothy grayson from darpa where he spoke about mosaic warfare i use this mosaic as opposed to jigsaw so can you tell me briefly what's this concept of mosaic warfare and distributed approaches um the idea is that you can have your uh war fighting capability and particularly for him what he's talking about uh is sensing so that's the ability to see what's happening cameras and radar and other sensors and your communications and then your weapon systems rather than having it all in one big box like say a single aircraft flying overhead you could have lots of different devices at different levels so you could have unmanned sensors on the ground you could have small ground vehicles you could have small drones and you could have larger systems orbiting overhead you can build up this whole collection of things and then depending on the mission you can slot in more at whatever level are needed so you can have more radar sensors or more thermal sensors or more acoustic sensors and like a mosaic you can build it up to match whatever the particular mission requirement is and instead the jigsaw that's a very it's not flexible at all because you can only place a piece of jigsaw and the problem is the piece is only slot together in in one way so if you you've got to have this piece and then you've got to have this piece whereas with mosaic everything is it's like open source everything can plug into everything else and it all networks very tidily and that gives a lot of redundancy so if you lose one bit of it you can work around that whereas with a jigsaw when you lose one piece the whole thing's ruined i think one of the main problems with this mosaic warfare is that when you have different pieces of hardware it's very hard to make them communicate to each other because they have a communication infrastructure the software that that is very different is not done to communicate with other hardware pieces for example you you can have the situation where you have two airplanes made by two different companies and there is no way they can talk to each other uh and unfortunately certain amount of that is because that's the way the aerospace industry works uh as with computers nobody there wants it to be open source because what they would much prefer is to lock customers into buying their equipment so once you buy the aircraft you have to buy all the ground communications equipment to go along with it and then you're incentivized to buy the missiles from the same company because the missiles can talk to the aircraft and everything else goes from there as soon as you go open source and have everything communicating to everything it destroys their whole marketing strategy the problem then if you have open source is also that you might be able to hack these systems isn't it uh it shouldn't so long so long as you've got decent um a decent firewall between you and the outside uh it doesn't shouldn't really make any difference um but security is a huge issue uh and that that does tend to uh lie at the center of a lot of drone communications activities so basically that concept that this distributed approach is that you instead of having big devices uh big airplanes big whatever you could have smaller devices that work together and that are uh i mean you can dispose you can sacrifice one or two or ten or whatever the system will still work you spoke about that and another similar concept is also the ocean of things uh the ocean of things is a a program by darpa as and that's a very distributed sensing approach so again rather than having one or two large sensing devices the idea is that you have thousands of these floats which are distributed across the ocean and each float has a number of sensors on it it's um mainly it's it's like a floating mobile phone because it's got the mobile phone type capabilities in terms of having gps and communications and a camera and a tilt meter and things like that but it's also got an underwater microphone on it so it's able to detect any vessels going by it's able to see things under the water that it will not communicate with the other floats nearby one of the things one of the unusual things about the ocean of things is that all their data is going back to a satellite they're not networking it because they found that was too power hungry so the all of the sensors in ocean of things uh bounce the signals back to a satellite and then a cloud server puts together all the data from all of them and builds up a picture about what's happening on above and under the ocean and you also wrote about another type of underwater device that works more or less as an rfid but using uh sound waves using sound rather than radio waves uh yeah this is that's a new backscatter device and the interesting thing about that is that it's basically harvesting the ambient sound from the ocean um the the acoustic background noise and it's then using that to charge its batteries and also to transmit signals out so it's a battery-less system it doesn't require any external power source it's just powered by the ambient sound and that makes it very rugged and very reliable in theory it means it can sit on the seabed or on a float indefinitely and just keep on working and again that can be used for communications and you can network a load of them together to communicate over a long distance and you can use those as sonar sensors and because they can be made cheaply the idea is that you could sow the sea with many thousands of these and they would all connect up and they would then uh combine to produce an image of whatever was traveling around uh on and under the ocean and you can use them for multiple purposes for example monitoring uh the sea temperature for climate change you can use it to monitor the animals in the in the sea not only for military purposes so there are multiple applications for this absolutely and that's one of the big arguments for ocean of things as well that it will be collecting a lot of weather and oceanographic data and darpa are making efforts to make sure that all gets shared with uh scientific organizations across the world they're making that all very open source which in one sense is very nice of them but in another sense uh it gives perfect cover so it uh allows them to put their senses everywhere and say no this isn't really uh military spying on you this is just harmless scientific senses uh which interestingly is something that the military have been doing for a very long time so there is long history of military technology being transferred to civilian applications there is that as well but there's also a long history of the the military using for example in the 1950s uh they sent balloons with cameras floating over the soviet union which they claimed were just uh for sensing cloud formations and weather monitoring but which are actually trying to take pictures of uh russian nuclear installations so the opposite in this case um well not totally dissimilar yeah um so can you tell me what's the advantage of having uh small portable and cheaper drones for military applications if you're a soldier one of the things you always want to know is what's happening on the other side of the hill uh and because the last thing you want to do is actually stick your head up and go over and get shot at while trying to look whereas drones give you the perfect way of seeing everything that's going on around you you can send a drone up and it can then take video of everything in the surrounding area you can send it over obstacles you can send it to the other side of the the hill you can look over walls you can look down streets you can look on top of buildings so small drones are extremely handy as a means of seeing where the opposition is without them being able to see where you are and that's extremely useful and that's why some military are producing their own drones and some as the israelis are are simply buying commercial drones and issuing them to infantry units to give them their own organic uh air reconnaissance units so and that's a way so that even at the the lowest level soldiers can have their own aerial reconnaissance so what do we have at the moment what are the best uh small and portable military drones it depends who you mean by we but one of the the most commonly used by the military uh is the raven drone used by the us army uh and that's a lot more expensive than uh a sort of small quadcopter but uh it looks like a model aircraft it's got a wingspan of a bit over a meter and that can fly around for about an hour and a half and as well as a camera it's got a thermal imager so it can get um images of what's happening even at the dark or through fog or smoke the one you just mentioned i guess it's a it's a glider it's a glider drone uh well it's it's it's a powder it's powered glider yes effectively yeah so there are different types of drones there are quadcopters and we are more familiar with the quadcopters because those are the commercial ones basically but those ones can only fly for let's say 30 minutes or so that yeah that's about to for a yeah for a consumer quadcopter uh 20 30 minutes is is usually about the the maximum uh whereas a fixed wing one can fly for several times longer and also quite a lot faster so it gives it considerably more range and endurance i mean if we want to improve the flight time of these quadcopters what do you think we should do um the problem is with with any kind of helicopter type device is that unlike a glider it has to work very hard just to stay in the air uh so it's got to constantly shift a lot of air and that makes it inherently quite inefficient um so the ways around that uh are mainly just find ways of recharging it um so one of the the most common things used is a drone in a box stripe solution there are several of these out there at the moment there's an israeli company called arion produces so a very effective one and that is effectively a base station on the ground that the drone can land on and recharge itself automatically so rather than having a very long endurance it can just keep coming back and recharging itself and there's a number of projects as well for vehicles that the so you'll have a ground vehicle with several drones so that it will launch one drone off uh when that one runs out of power it'll send another one off to cover the same area and the first one comes back and recharges so you have this constant stream of drones going out there so it can maintain a drone eye in the sky indefinitely even though none of the individual drones have that long of an endurance or you could work with the power uh type of power that the drones use at the moment we have batteries standard lithium batteries but you wrote an article where you mentioned uh cia project aquiline uh we're in the 70s they were planning to use drones propelled by nuclear batteries yes i mean that's uh ultimately that's one of the uh best ways of powering aircraft i mean you've have to remember this is uh back at the time they are also looking at nuclear-powered bombers and various other things given that the military already have nuclear-powered submarines and nuclear-powered aircraft carriers uh it didn't seem quite so outlandish the the nuclear-powered drone would be a slightly different prospect though because um there's much greater chance of it crashing and and problems uh however there is actually a company that's working on a similar concept at the moment uh who believe that by using uh beta voltaics which is a sort of power system driven by radioactive decay they can get uh enough power to um have a compact power system to drive a drone so the idea isn't completely dead the problem with this nuclear batteries is that they are not very efficient that that's my unders i'm not an expert but they are not very efficient i think the efficiency is something around us six five percent or something like that that's certainly one of the problems um nuclear batteries there's only a tiny tiny handful of applications that they're actually used for they're used for satellites and space probes the russians bizarrely use them for lighthouses out in very um distant locations out in siberia um which i didn't end well one of them got attacked by some people who were scavenging for scrap metal so the russians then had to track down some highly radioactive material that had been stolen when they uh stripped this place drones different drones have different uh capabilities i mean if you if you think about a fixed wing drone it can fly for a long time but uh the amount of maneuvers that can do it so it's very limited but if you think about quadcopters quadcopters can go through through trees they can go inside the forest they can go even inside houses and buildings but now they're trying to expand these capabilities and build the thing things like perch and stair drones like spider-man drones with uh quadcopters yes you're quite right the the ability to go inside buildings and to maneuver around indoor spaces uh is a key advantage and that's not just for the the military uh i recently wrote a piece about uh drones that are being used in mines and they're being used to travel through old mine workings and spaces that are unsafe for human exploration but you can have a drone that can wander around and map and see there and test the gases and one of the things is because there's no radio communications underground the drone has to be smart enough to be able to find its way and explore autonomously and then as you say perch and stare that's a good way of coping with the limited endurance of a quadcopter drone by simply finding a flat surface and sitting there it can remain as basically like a fixed cctv and that way it doesn't actually use any power and you could also have sensors to see maybe what's happening inside the building what's happening inside the room uh yep there are indeed some there's uh through-the-wall radar um which allows them to basically pick up movement on the other side of a wall uh and the the so-called life detection radar um which is actually triggered by heartbeat so they can see whether there are living people inside one of the uses of this would be in a emergency situation so you could tell whether they're people who needed rescuing inside a burning building obviously the military are also very interested in this as a means of determining whether there are potential insurgents uh or other people inside a building that they're planning to clear and there are also other types of drones combined with missiles the so-called kamikaze drones there's a switchblade the 600 if i remember well um yep the the switchblade has been around for about 10 years which is used by uh american special forces it's a small tube launch drone uh you fire it from a little thing like a bazooka but it's very small it only weighs a couple of kilos and that after launch it pops out wings and that can then fly around again beaming back video and you use it to locate a target and when you do find a target you line it up in the crosshairs and press a button and the drone then locks in on that and crashes into him and destroys it with a target with a warhead which is basically like a hand grenade okay so i would like to talk about a little bit about uh china uh so china is a big topic it has been a big topic since the beginning of uh the trade war with the us there are tensions in the pacific ocean and also more recently with the with the pandemic so the predominance of china i mean in terms of commercial drones and also military drones do you think it represents a risk for for the west um i think it represents a problem uh in the sense that because these drones are very cheap and convenient um a lot of militaries have been using them and also a lot of insurgents have been using them the the i think the biggest surprise uh was when the isis insurgents started using chinese drones to drop grenades on iraqi and american forces in mosul obviously anyone can use them it's very advanced technology it's very convenient but the problem is that dji the company who makes these things is essentially answerable to the chinese government so any data that gets picked up by those drones dji may be able to hack dji may be able to tell where drones are there is potentially a huge huge security risk there um so the american government among others has told everyone to stop buying dji drones while they try to find an alternative so yeah i mean there were similar problems with the chinese mobile phones and about the data breach and the yeah exactly and there's the same issue about whether whether it's safe for huawei to be part of our national communications infrastructure um because in theory the chinese government could demand that huawei cooperate with them parrot was recently selected by the usa defense innovation unit as a major drone supplier well they've selected a whole load of them they've now opened up a new standard called blue suas which is sus is small unmanned aerial systems and the idea is rather than being relying on a single supplier they're going to have just a basically an open source system which all different suppliers will produce hardware that will fit into so it's it's a sincere effort to get themselves out of this historic problem of being locked into large military contractors and one of the big problems is that unfortunately none of the companies involved has anything like the industrial clout or the r d base or the experience of a company like dji i think when in the west in let's say usa or even uk europe we have capabilities to build highly sophisticated small drones i think the main problem is the cost of labor and maybe procurement i mean chinese can leverage the very cheap labor cost and they can procure materials and electronics so easily because everything is made there i mean if you think about shenzhen everything is there yeah one of the big advantages of of building in shenzhen is that they are close to lots of other chinese electronics companies and dji from the start they realized that the best way to do it was rather than just building a drone and then sticking a camera onto it and sticking communications onto it was to have everything totally integrated so they were able to go to manufacturers and they actually have chips that are specially built to their specification for their drones by chip makers and that's partly because they're doing it in such huge volumes because they're ordering a million at a time and partly because they are closely integrated under the chinese system uh so they they've got companies who they can work with them who they they know and can trust and it's very difficult to get there outside of china and equally right from the start they threw a huge amount of research on it dji has about 1500 people in their research and development department which is just massively greater than any small startup is ever going to be able to match yeah do you fly drones yourself are you a drone pilot i'm not a real drone pilot no i'm i just like the occasional toy drone yeah i've got an inspired one here okay how have you found it the thing is that i mean when you get dji drones uh if you if you are interested in filming and all these things you can get uh i mean that's the best stuff you can get out there i mean you can get now you can get an inspire 2. with the inspire one that i have you can film in 4k raw 12 beat with the inspire 2 you can even film with better cameras i think they even have full frame sensor and you can use this stuff for films and if you want to go for something better you can go for a matrix 600 if i if not wrong and you can mount a red camera you can mount a big canon camera there but if you go for pirate there is nothing like that that's a problem no i and uh i think parrot will have trouble competing with them in the open market i mean it's interesting that their nearest american competitor 3d robotics uh went out of business or went out of the drone business several years ago uh it's just very difficult to compete with people like dji the only thing i found annoying was the customer service which is totally rubbish that's totally rubbish yeah but they are a huge success because they do they give you a capability which people just didn't have before before the only way you would have to get that kind of shot would be to rent a helicopter uh or in some cases to rent a crane and those are just fantastic amounts of money whereas these days uh the world is full of amateurs who are able to shoot these incredible um movies with overhead imagery and drones flying over buildings and through forests and and other things which would simply be impossible without this type of technology have you heard about the those people doing experiments on insects to control how insects fly um yeah this is the american military have been pursuing this for quite a few years it it's all looks fairly gruesome but part of the idea is that you can insert a microchip controller into a chrysalis and then as the adult insect forms you could the uh chip will have connections inside its brain and they have been able by using electrical impulses to steer an insect to the left to the right uh it's not exactly remote control but it gives some idea of the the kind of thing that they're after um it's all all at a fairly basic stage um but it's a an indication of an interest more than anything else i don't think there's any any actual capability out there what's more interesting in some ways uh is what's known as biomimetics which is copying biological systems for drones so all the way far as back as the 1970s the cia developed a drone which was essentially a copy of a dragonfly and that was able to fly and carry a camera they didn't know how the aerodynamics worked or anything they literally just copied a dragonfly similar approaches have been used more recently and they're getting a much greater understanding of how the the flight dynamics work but in some cases you're seeing quite a convergence so you're now looking at drones that look a lot more like living things uh in china allegedly the government does use spy drones that look just like birds but given how much the chinese government spies on its population anyway i'm not sure whether that's really necessary for them okay yeah in terms of unconventional drones there are also other types of unconventional drones like boat drones or usbs and i think you wrote an article about usbs operating in australia but then there were also usbs operating in iran i guess um yeah i mean lots of people are now similarly with aerial drones the technology is now there so it's now possible to exploit that so you can have something that can do a mission which would previously have taken a manned boat with several crew which is an expensive piece of kit with a lot of running costs and you can just have a small unmanned boat doing the same task and sitting out there in the ocean um for days or weeks or months to do the same thing and then communicating back generally via satellite so that's the capability you're seeing not just with america and britain and china but also uh with all sorts of countries like australia and turkey and israel and in the very near future everyone is going to have their own robot boats and so before you mention the so in terms of unconventional drones uh drones by used by terrorists you mentioned the isis in iraq uh trying to retrofit the i think it was phantom drones with the grenade drop systems but there is also the case of the houthis from yemen who successfully attacked uh saudi arabia with the homemade drones yup the abcake oil processing facility in saudi arabia was effectively put out of action by an attack by 20 or so of these essentially garage-built drones which came from the houthi rebels in yemen they clearly had a lot of help from the iranians and there was engineering and support from that side but these are basically very crude very cheap garage-built devices that are capable of carrying out a strike over hundreds of kilometers and doing tremendous industrial damage and that was a bit of a wake-up call as to just how much of a threat there were particularly because the facility was defended by some very modern air defenses which completely failed to deal with the attack yeah then system like uh i mean in israel they have the iron dome um an iron dome would be wouldn't be effective against these small drones i don't think so because those are too small probably isn't it iron dome is actually one of the better ones iron dome is is quite well geared up to deal with a range of different threats um but something like the american patriot system which was one of the ones they had at ab cake it's only really geared to deal with fast high-flying threats and threats like cruise missiles something that's very small and slow and looks like a bird on radar it wouldn't be so good at and that's one of the big problems they're having so what do you think what uh what what would be an effective strategy to to disarm small drones trying to cross a border what would you use there well there is a you might say a mad scramble among the defense establishments of the world at the moment come up with uh effective counter-drone defenses particularly in in what they call class one class two uh these very small quadcopters uh and fixed-wing drones the problem is that they're actually very difficult to shoot down um because they're very difficult to see uh with just with a machine gun or a rifle or something like that it's possible to shoot them down with missiles but missiles are very expensive uh on one occasion we believe the israelis did take out a small quadcopter with a three million dollar patriot missile which is clearly not a a viable long-term approach um jamming is very effective because all you need to do is break the link between the operator and the drone and with the dji ones they will normally automatically return to base but if you will also jam the gps so it doesn't know where it is uh it will just land softly on the ground so jamming is actually quite cheap and quite effective and there's a lot of these drone gun things being marketed for defenses for this kind of low level threat for something that's simply a commercial drone using standard radio communications but that type of jamming tends not to work against military-grade drones which have got um much more robust communications which can't be blocked that easily um then moving up from there you're then moving to the really advanced stuff and two of the ones in the pipeline are high-energy lasers and high-energy microwaves um there are a lot of laser systems out there uh in a sense this is a godsend to them because we've had lasers for um 60 years now but they're they haven't actually managed to reach power levels that can do any damage to a tank or a ship or an airplane but they are powerful enough to shoot down small drones so there are lots of 10 20 30 kilowatt systems out there which are being marketed as anti-drone systems and they do a very good job of that and they have very high precision deliver effects at the speed of light and they are quite deadly against small drones but they are extremely expensive and there's a real question as to how many drones you're going to be able to shoot down before they overrun you and the the the advantage of directed energy weapons is that you don't need to reload them you just need to power no yeah you've got an infinite number of shots uh it's extremely accurate so it's a lot easier to shoot down a target two kilometers away than it is uh with the machine gun uh the ammunition is extremely cheap costs nothing it can be linked to a radar or other system to give you very high precision um so and there's very little unlike um bullets there's very little risk of collateral damage one of the systems the americans uses thing called phalanx which is a 20 millimeter rapid fire cannon which is very effective against um things like missiles but the problem is it it fires a spray of these 20 millimeter bullets into the distance uh and those are going to ruin someone's day if they land anywhere near them whereas with a laser it only hits what you aim it at uh and it shouldn't do any damage beyond that so let's talk about the swarm drones and what are the current capabilities of the west in terms of swarm drones a swarm is simply a large number of relatively simple units that are able to carry out complicated coordinated actions just by following a few rules swarming technology is a lot of it draws from nature so this is from the way that flocks of birds fly or that shoals of fish swim so they can all move together without crashing into each other and the whole thing can change directions smoothly and seamlessly so it's that sort of approach the advantage of a swarm is that you can have a hundred or a thousand or even more small drones uh all carrying out a task and they don't require hundreds or thousands of operators you just need one operator to say go over there and the entire swarm can then obey commands so it's got a huge potential for allowing the deployment of what the military called mass it means you can have large numbers so it means you can have large numbers of drones but with very simple command so that's quite appealing so what are the technical challenges in the development of swarm drones um this is it's getting smart enough swarming algorithms and the the way the command and control works is quite tricky so particularly if you want a sub swarm to break off and go off and do something else or if you want to have a second swarm join in and become part of it so the the swarm interface is a big challenge there as to how humans can effectively deal with it um but there are um you see a lot of these drone light shows at the moment um using a thousand two thousand three thousand drones that's not actually a real swarm because that's all centrally controlled all the drones there are getting their orders from a central controller uh real swarming is where each of the drones is independent and is making it up its own mind um just based on what its neighbors are doing that's a bit trickier um but the technology is moving fast um the an israeli company launched their first commercial swarming software so that's for uh operating swarms of drones to do things like agricultural or industrial surveys or search and rescue but there's a lot of work in different parts of the american military and the chinese military in terms of putting together swarms of drones that will be useful not just for scouting and for finding the opponent but also carrying out attacks on them autonomously so the main advances that we need are in terms of software basically and probably computing power within the drone itself so the drone itself needs to be needs to carry out all the computation required to behave within a swarm so you don't want to use you don't want to use maybe external communication systems like you don't want to use maybe gps you don't want to use a central control station you want to do everything within the drone exactly you want to have as much of the processing carried out on the drone as possible uh and that one of the things that's helping with that a lot at the moment is so-called neuromorphic computing which again uh is copying from biological systems and those are the buzzwords like deep learning gets thrown around a lot that's just a very efficient algorithmic method of doing things like recognizing objects uh or learning how to fly for example could be done by a deep learning system and because there's a lot more neuromorphic chips coming onto the market that's greatly increasing the the capability for this type of drone we even have them and in some mobile phones right uh yeah exactly the the last two or three apple phones have had these uh bionic chips in them which have a uh a dedicated deep learning process or as part of them and that makes them supposedly thousands or millions and of times more efficient than a normal digital computer for doing things like facial recognition or converting text to speech so what are the current capabilities of adversary counters if we can call them adversary countries i mean i'm talking about the russian china because in terms of their swarming drones yes uh well the chinese military have flown um what they say is the the largest ever swarm uh of small drones and they're certainly looking at uh using that type of swarm as a way of countering america's advantage uh in particular items so they're looking at drone swarms to neutralize american aircraft carriers and air bases for example and that's highly significant uh on the battlefield the chinese recently um showed video of a barrage drone launcher which is a vehicle that can fire off up to 48 drones at a time and they say that you can combine several of those so you can launch a swarm of 200 drones all together at an enemy target and with existing air defenses 200 drones would completely overwhelm them there's nothing currently that's uh able to deal with that number of targets at once but what happens when the number becomes very high like i'm talking about 10 000 drones or something like that there was an article that spoke about drones as uh weapons of mass destruction yeah yep that's when drones get really scary when you start looking at thousands tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of drones um because in the the simplest case if you just have a drone with an explosive warhead each drone can kill one person so a swarm of 10 000 drones can kill 10 000 people and that's vastly more destructive than anything else in the inventory at the moment um simply because it's such an efficient device as a killing machine and there are arguments that drone swarms of that type should be legally counted as weapons of mass destruction and that there should be controls over them as there are with nuclear chemical and biological weapons simply because they are so dangerous and because of the risk of proliferation because unlike nuclear weapons which require a very advanced scientific establishment to develop anyone can develop a drone swarm um and simply acquire drones and the software and put explosives on them uh and build bigger and bigger and more destructive swarms so the the potential is there even for relatively minor nations to have huge destructive power capable of killing um very large numbers of civilians yeah and there was a netflix show about that i think it was a black mirror yeah black mirror didn't it did an episode about that um there's also a video called slaughterbots on youtube which was put out by the campaign against autonomous weapons showing very much this idea and that if the technology of having small drones that can autonomously track down and kill people gets out there uh it will have almost unlimited potential for destruction um though in fact simply drones attacking people may not be the worst aspect of it what would be worse if you had smart drones which were able to do things like uh start fires and attack industrial infrastructure you could get um much more damage done yeah and what are the ideas at the moment in terms of uh stopping uh these large swarm drones what what are the ideas at the moment well stopping them is they're very difficult to stop one at a time so individually shooting them down is challenging one approach is using high power microwave weapons um which effectively burn out the electronics and uh raytheon have a system on that the us army have a system for that um these are reasonably effective uh at destroying electronics and they've done very well in tests uh what we don't know is how easily drones can be shielded against this sort of effect uh and the potential for collateral damage this technology has existed actually for many years but one of the reasons why it's never been deployed is because of the risk that it could harm other electronics um and the military is highly dependent on this sort of thing and one reason why they won't ever put a microwave weapon on an aircraft is because of the risk of damaging some of the aircraft's own systems so there may very well be issues with that the other way is fighting a swarm with another swarm and having interceptor there are already some interceptor drones out there and if you had a swarm of them they would be able to take on an incoming swarm particularly if they are smarter than the drones coming in and are able to anticipate what they're going to do so you could have a situation uh where your defenders were able to very efficiently take out the attacking drones but equally you could have a situation where if the attackers are smarter they might be able to evade the interceptors so i think it's going to be very much a software race between attack and defense on that yeah so it seems that um i mean that's that's the kind of uh perception that some people love is that the ultimate uh battleground seems to be between rival software engineers not between soldiers and pilot basically uh yep it's it's in many ways it is heading towards that situation yes did you see the alpha dog trials alpha dog fight trials yeah so this was um seeing how well uh a piece of software could compete against a a human pilot uh and they this is about the third year they run it uh and so before it's just been the the different ai systems competing against each other but this time round they had the the winner of that uh in a simulation flying an f-16 against a highly trained human pilot in a simulated f-16 and the uh the ai one five out of five rather easily and there's a few questions about that and whether it's an accurate simulation and whether that tells us anything about what would happen in the real world but it certainly looks like the ai has got to a point where it's uh highly competent at dog fighting everybody talks about ai i would call it a machine learning because i mean i don't think there isn't much of intelligence in those things because those things do what software engineers write them to do they learn things but they don't take initiatives for initiatives we still have humans the argument about uh whether machine learning counts as ai or in fact what ai is uh is going to go on for a while i think so yeah i think that's a discussion that will certainly go on but yes but yeah there's an argument for saying it's not showing any real form of intelligence it's just very good at what it does and there was there was also another thing about this dog fight that they were using f-16 that didn't they couldn't use like f-35 because of uh security or because of uh i mean those f-16 they are all the uh fighter jets so yeah yeah it's it's an aircraft from the 1970s so uh most they could share all the information about its performance very easily whereas with the f-35 or some of the more modern ones a lot of that is still secret another interesting thing about the f-16 is that they've actually converted a number of the old f-16s for unmanned operation and those are mainly there as aerial targets for air-to-air combat training but if you've got a an unmanned computer-controlled f-16 you could quite easily put your ai if you want to call it that uh dog fighting pilot in there and turn that into a robot dog fighter you end up in a situation like a terminator or something like that yeah but it's interesting there's actually a follow-up to the alpha dog fight uh because people were saying that part of the problem was that the uh the human pilot was doing everything he'd been trained to do whereas the ai pilots were behaving like video gamers and they were just using the system to its advantage so there's actually going to be a rematch between the ai and uh a human who's the winner of a gaming competition to see whether gamers are better than human pilots so david i wanted to ask you one thing do you only call do you mainly cover uh stories from usa do you cover the uk at all or i mean do you do anything about it um yeah i i i cover the world us uk russia china yep um but the americans tend to be the best communicators uh whereas particularly for military stories it's very difficult getting anything out of the establishment over here uh okay david thank you very much for uh for doing this and uh yeah i hope the next time we won't have any pandemic so we can meet here in cambridge that would be great if we could do that thanks very much thank you very much
