 AV1 is the latest video codec designed specifically for video over the internet. At YouTube we're always looking for new technologies to give our users the best experience. With AV1 we can give our users less banding, less blurring, & less blocky video, all while using 20 percent less bandwidth. As Intel brings this technology to our users this is a great win for the ecosystem. In homes where multiple devices are streaming simultaneously AV1 helps by efficiently utilizing bandwidth during times of congestion. It can mean faster video load times, less network usage, and better looking video. Through this collaboration with Intel we can bring the latest technology to our viewers and our creators. AV1 is baked right into Intel's Xe which means you can watch YouTube's best quality videos on the go while making the most out of your battery performance. With the expected bandwidth savings on AV1 users on constrained conections can potentially unlock higher resolutions through more efficient video delivery. We can serve our users higher quality videos than ever before, just the way our creators intended. Together we can collectively push the boundaries of the video experience
