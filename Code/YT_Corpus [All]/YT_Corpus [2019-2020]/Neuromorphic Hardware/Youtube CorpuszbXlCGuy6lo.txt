 optical or photonic computing uses photons produced by lasers or diodes for computation for decades photons have promised to allow a higher bandwidth than the electrons used in conventional computers most research projects focus on replacing current computer components with optical equivalence resulting in an optical digital computer system processing binary data this approach appears to offer the best short-term prospects for commercial optical computing since optical components could be integrated into traditional computers to produce an optical electronic hybrid however opto electronic devices lose 30% of their energy converting electronic energy into photons and back this conversion also slows the transmission of messages all optical computers eliminate the need for optical electrical optical a io conversions thus lessening the need for electrical power application specific devices such as synthetic aperture radar SAR and optical correlators have been designed to use the principles of optical computing correlators can be used for example to detect and track objects and to classify serial time-domain optical data topic optical components for binary digital computer the fundamental building block of modern electronic computers is the transistor to replace electronic components with optical ones an equivalent optical transistor is required this is achieved using materials with a nonlinear refractive index in particular materials exist where the intensity of incoming light affects the intensity of the light transmitted through the material in a similar manner to the current response of a bipolar transistor such an optical transistor can be used to create optical logic gates which in turn are assembled into the higher level components of the computer's CPU these will be nonlinear optical crystals used to manipulate light beams into controlling other light beams like any computing system an optical computing system needs three things to function well optical processor optical data transfer eg fiber optic cable optical storage eg CD DVD blu-ray etc substituting electrical components will need data format conversion from photons to electrons which will make the system's slower topic controversy there are disagreements between researchers about the future capabilities of optical computers whether or not they may be able to compete with semiconductor based electronic computers in terms of speed power consumption cost and size is an open question critics note that real-world logic systems require logic level restoration cascade ability fan-out an input/output isolation all of which are currently provided by electronic transistors at low cost low power and high speed for optical logic to be competitive beyond a few niche applications major breakthroughs in nonlinear optical device technology would be required or perhaps a change in the nature of computing itself topic misconceptions challenges and prospects a significant challenge to optical computing is that computation is a nonlinear process in which multiple signals must interact light which is an electromagnetic wave can only interact with another electromagnetic wave in the presence of electrons in a material and the strength of this interaction is much weaker for electromagnetic waves such as light than for the electronic signals in a conventional computer this may result in the processing elements for an optical computer requiring more power and larger dimensions than those for a conventional electronic computer using transistors a further misconception is that since light can travel much faster than the drift velocity of electrons and at frequencies measured in th Zed optical transistors should be capable of extremely high frequencies however any electromagnetic wave must obey the transform limit and therefore the rate at which an optical transistor can respond to a signal is still limited by its spectral bandwidth however in fiber-optic communications practical limits such as dispersion often constrain channels to bandwidths of tens of GHz only slightly better than many silicon transistors obtaining dramatically faster operation than electronic transistors would therefore require practical methods of transmitting ultrashort pulses down highly dispersive waveguides topic photonic logic photonic logic is the use of photons light in logic gates naught and oor NAND nor xor xno are switching is obtained using nonlinear optical effects when two or more signals are combined resonators are especially useful in photonic logic since they allow a buildup of energy from constructive interference thus enhancing optical nonlinear effects other approaches currently being investigated include photonic logic at a molecular level using photo luminescent chemicals in a recent demonstration with litski Eyal performed logical operations using molecules and sir topic unconventional approaches you topic time delays optical computing the basic idea is to delay light or any other signal in order to perform useful computations of interest would be to solve np-complete problems as those are difficult problems for the conventional computers there are two basic properties of light that are actually used in this approach the light can be delayed by passing it through an optical fiber of a certain length the light can be split into multiple sub rays this property is also essential because we can evaluate multiple solutions in the same time when solving a problem with time delays the following steps must be followed the first step is to create a graph like structure made from optical cables and splitters each graph has a start node and a destination node the light enters through the start node and traverses the graph until it reaches the destination it is delayed when passing through arcs and divided inside nodes the light is marked when passing through an arc all through a node so that we can easily identify that fact at the destination node at the destination node we will wait for a signal fluctuation in the intensity of the signal which arrives at a particular moment in time if there is no signal arriving at that moment it means that we have no solution for our problem otherwise the problem has a solution fluctuations can be read within photo detector and an oscilloscope the first problem attacked in this way was the Hamiltonian path problem later other problems have been tackled in this way the simplest one is the subset-sum problem an optical device solving an instance with four numbers one a-two a-three a-four is depicted below the light will enter in start mode it will be divided into two sub rays of smaller intensity these two rays will arrive into the second mode at moments a 1 & 0 each of them will be divided into two sub rays which will arrive in the third node at moments 0 a1 a2 and a1 plus a2 these represents the all subsets of the set a1 a2 we expect fluctuations in the intensity of the signal at no more than 4 different moments in the destination node we expect fluctuations are no more than 16 different moments which are all the subsets of the given if we have a fluctuation in the target moment B it means that we have a solution of the problem otherwise there is no subset whose sum of elements equals B for the practical implementation we cannot have 0 length cables thus all cables are increased with a small fixed for all value K in this case the solution is expected at moment B plus an asterisk a topic wavelength based computing wavelength based computing can be used to solve the three SAT problem with n variables M Clause and with no more than three variables per Clause each wavelength contained in a light ray is considered as possible value assignments to n variables the optical device contains prisms and mirrors are used to discriminate proper wavelengths which satisfy the formula topic computing by xeroxing on transparencies this approach uses a Xerox machine and transparent sheets for performing computations KSAT problem with n variables implausible z' per clause has been solved in three steps firstly all two-carat and possible assignments of n variables have been generated by performing and Xerox copies using at most 2k copies of the truth table each clause is evaluated at every row of the truth table simultaneously the solution is obtained by making a single copy operation of the overlapped transparencies of all M clauses topic masking optical beams [Music] the Traveling Salesman problem has been solved in by using an optical approach all possible TSP paths have been generated and stored in a binary matrix which was multiplied with another grayscale vector containing the distances between cities the multiplication is performed optically by using an optical correlator topic optical Fourier coprocessors many computations particularly in scientific applications require frequent use of the 2d discrete Fourier transform DFT for example in solving differential equations describing propagation of waves or transfer of heat though modern GPU technologies typically enable high-speed computation of large 2d DFT s recently techniques have been developed that can perform dfts optically by utilizing the natural Fourier transforming property of lenses the input is encoded using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator and the result is measured using a conventional CMOS or CCD image sensor such optical architectures can offer superior scaling of computational complexity due to the inherently highly interconnected nature of optical propagation and have been used to solve 2d heat equations topic izing machines physical computers whose design was inspired by the theoretical izing model called izing machines yoshihisa yamamoto pioneered building izing machines using photons initially yamamoto and his colleagues built an izing machine using lasers mirrors and other optical components commonly found on an optical table later a team at hewlett-packard labs including Dave Kyle Pinsky developed photonic chip design tools and used them to build an izing machine on a single chip integrating 1052 optical components on that single chip topic see also linear optical quantum computing optical neural network photonic molecule
