 good morning welcome to Pike's webinar on spectral electrochemistry we have a special guest today Ian Burgess Ian's a professor in chemistry department the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon Canada and he's also a founding member of the Jackfish sec over the past dozen years Ian's research team has been optimizing an electrochemistry cell for a TR Sierra's experiments using the pike v-max as its optical platform and this cell that they developed is called the Jack fish so over the past couple years the jack fish team has taught me a lot about electrochemistry and they're so willing to share their expertise so because of their efforts they've really brought a valuable commercial product to the market so I'm very excited to have Ian with us today I've been looking forward to this webinar for a couple weeks now so before I turn it over to Ian just a couple of housekeeping businesses we're gonna hold all the questions until the end Ian has one of his Jackfish partners monitoring the questions so during the webinar so you can submit those at any time Ian Burgess will address them or Ian uncut and Vogue will address them during the webinar so at this point I'd like to turn it over to Ian thank you for joining us this morning my pleasure thanks very much Jenny for giving me this opportunity and today I'm going to present some stuff related to getting the most from your electrochemical ATR CRS experiments so if I can just toggle through the screen so there's Jenny's picture there's my picture and I'll just go through my own title slide and jump right in with an outline of today's webinar so I'm going to begin with talking a little bit generally about infrared spectra electrochemistry and I'll just sort of describe the differences between so called internal reflection base techniques and external reflection based techniques and then I'll talk a little bit about some examples of ATR CRS applications and then the majority of today's talk will be really spent designing key aspects related to designing and optimizing your electrochemical ATR CRS experiment so let's start with a little bit of an introduction to two types of spectra infrared spectra electrochemistry and one of the I would say more early adaptations of spectra electrochemistry in the infrared was the so called external reflection technique in this technique you're using an infrared transparent window of relatively low refractive index so something with a high AR transparency such as calcium flora you
