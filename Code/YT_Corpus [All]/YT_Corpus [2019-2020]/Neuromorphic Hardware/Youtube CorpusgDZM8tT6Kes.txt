 you [Music] and now I would like speaking of great people and kind people and nice people I would like to introduce christos papadimitriou I'm you know I'm really really thrilled and honored that he agreed to come and speak to us for this event he's really a giant in computer science and one of my heroes and he's one he's won the canoe surprise he was one that john von neumann medal he's won the godel prize he's the fellow of the ACM fellow of national academy of engineering a member of National Academy of Sciences an Academy American Academy of Arts and Sciences he's also a longtime friend and has served a lot at dyemax he was on one of the original boards for dyemax and so I have this email from Christos to Fred from 1997 giving his evaluation of how well died Max is doing in research he's written five textbooks many many are technical articles on many topics he co-founded my field algorithmic game theory he introducing the first worst case analysis of worst case of equilibria and and the price of Anarchy as a grad student he settled the complexity of euclidean Traveling Salesman problem and then much more recently settled it for Nash equilibrium and he has eight honorary doctorates in addition to his PhD at Princeton he's also a novelist he's written three novels one of which is logic comics a graphic novel I have a copy here it this one's personally special to me I got a copy when it first came out and my daughter was my younger daughters kind of interested in graphic novels so I started reading it to her it's not really it's not a kids book but if she was eight at the time but so we're kind of glossed over some of the more adult type issues but it's really she found it fascinating and I kept reading it for I think that was probably a year or so where like she wanted to read this every night at night and and for some reason she got really interested in the barbershop paradox we I think I still have a bookmark that page we kept going back to the barbershop paradox and rereading and rereading it so this one is special to me and I have a few copies so I Christos has graciously agreed to sign some copies so he'll sign mine for my daughter so thank you and but he also and a few of you have said they would want a copy already but if anyone else wants a copy a signed copy of logic comics I have a few copies so let me know so with that I'll I would love to have Christos come up and we can get started on his talk on brain computation excellent so thank you very much I'm delighted to be here I I have been involved to die max I mean no sir is not you agree do people at all times of my career in the nineties die max was the game I hope much to dynamics and of course I have been we have a long history of collaboration semester thanks that's that's these are two amazing groups to make sure great so I'm glad to help one one question that is probably in your mind is why would the computer scientists work of the brain okay you know and you're right I mean oh so so and you're right I mean no computer scientists work on other things right I mean oh so and we did we did for the longest time okay so so for the first six decades of our field we worked on the computer okay we were obsessed on for the computer so we also you know we were so obsessed to computer that we made the mistake of naming or disability so but so it's in retrospect it's it's very strange that such a large group of intelligent adults was was so stuck up with a computer but we were okay I was okay so you know we thought it was amazing so even though we did we understood computation like was never understood before you know this was six long years of incredible work very creative work we solved we solve problems that that it was very very you know databases compilers you know that it was a major major intellectual engineering feat and then of course it all and that you know because what happened is that is that the internet came okay and and we immediately realized that that was the whole point okay you know that the computer was the gadget that brought us and this is what this is what we were interested in and of course you know so work when when when when we when you focused on the Internet's or even you are my mind wandered okay because because I mean oh it's easy when you are doing you know you know basically you go from you know it see it's an easy step to go you know actually I don't think that many of you realized how similar the universe is with the internet okay you know so you know it okay so they're the same thing alright so and this is something that that has been called the lens on the sciences you know computational algorithm aggression of the science or computational other than pseudoscience and by this I mean the following Sorvino in simple terms that that occasionally when there is you know in a challenging problem is challenged several problem in sciences of all kinds social biological and so on and physical if the computer scientists or you know looks at this problem occasionally not not always not even often okay but occasionally unexpected progress happens okay and and and and the three key is I mean know if I can sort of you know simplified a lot is to fantasize that this scientific object be the universe sell the market so you know that evolution is trying to compute something okay you know so and and then use our insights of what it means to compute things right you know so this is this and this is that what I'm going to this is a trick I'm going to play with the brain and before that let me just tell you a couple of things I mean oh that's you know in game theory and economics you know as you know you know one of the one of the most important you know you know in some sense or you know the the birth of the new era of economics you know you know it was was a 1950s when when John John ash approved this famous theorems or you know that not all games have a Nash equilibrium and this this was in some sense the start of modern economics part of the part of the reason is that is that our own the brave were inspired to prove their theorems but not only that sort of you know it was it was in some sense it economists got got a license when the thing about something to say let's see what happens at equilibrium okay you know and this and this is this was an important methodological theoretical tool okay so um and it turns out you know that that that finding our circulatory the intractable problem and this in in to a large extent cancels this you know in other words this life license is temporarily revoked okay so you know for computation original so that's that's a nice that's a nice compliment for computation alright so and another another something else is is that you know looking at evolution from with this computational lens you know you realize and expect the things for example but the Volusia population of genotypes is equivalent mathematical equivalent to the genes of the of the of the of the species playing a game okay and the strategies the game are the alleles of every gene and the probability which they play the strategies are the frequencies of the alleles in the population play the genetic pool of the population and it's a repeated game because it is the repetition of the generations of the rules of the fish species and and the amazing thing that is played through multiplicative ways updates okay adaboost okay so that and this is and this is a I mean you know I remember I remember my co-author and this who mentions irani telling me you know once once we realize that this is how evolution works or you know this is a useful mathematical reviewable origin he told me you know crystals now I have much more confidence in evolution so another thing that you guys get out of this or you know if you if you you know just by applying convex programming gravity you see something very interesting that that every gene in every generation what it optimizes is a trade-off between cumulative Fitness and a little entropy so in other words diversity of the population genetic diversity is one of the things that that are being explicitly optimized you know evolution okay so that these are all things these are all insights that were just a few equations away from from the standard mathematics population genetic mathematics but so we know it to computer scientists or to the to gets to get to get to them so frankly you know so this is this is the question that I'm either studying okay how does the my you know how does behavior cognition intelligence language okay how do these things come from molecules cells synapses wet stuff okay you know so and and you know the way I see it you know you know you know the way visualize this question is like I call it the the sunset from the brain for from the Berkeley Hills question in the following sense that every time I see this and I had opportunity to see it many times in the past you know what comes to my mind is why isn't everybody stop what they're doing okay you know and come here the city's right so you know so when you work on the brain really so no you look at other people we say wow strange they're working on other stuff oh yes yeah so okay about five years ago would sound of Impala we decided to to seriously look at this problem and that the first thing you do is you you you you buy this book okay so you know five summers ago we did you know we did so that's called principles of neuroscience it's called for debates it's all the candles smart book okay so you know so it's it's a beautiful extensive compendium of what is known about the brain and sorry no it's every every four years it's been written and as a result it becomes 200 page sticker okay you know so anything about it that's not right okay you know the title is principles of neuroscience right I mean oh so principles as time progresses you destroy yourself Samuel so when the Greeks decided to find the principles of new geometry okay you know they ended up with four lines right um no condom hey so uh and and and so I mean oh this you know there's something wrong here you know is end and my hero is Richard Axel now my colleague in Columbia Columbia put this very you know when I read this I said Wow sort of you know I could not I could not pray for something for something better for my research program for axel to say okay so he said the following in an interview we did not have a logic logic a logic for the transformation of neural activity into hotel I viewed asserting this logic as the most important feature future generation you know saw Direction research Direction neuroscience so I mean oh this amazing this man who is who is sort of you know the the the the Pope of experimental neuroscientist right I mean oh so he's telling us that that we don't have so you know is he telling us that what you need is a formal system right so in order to and and so the question is what kind of formal system would fill this bill okay and and that's what I'm you know I have an idea okay you know that's what I'm going to present okay so it is clear we know that's this is what this is what I'm after good so let's start somewhere really humble okay you know so this is this about fruit flies okay and and they have they have an apparatus they have already have a nose okay so you know and they have a way of remembering smells and it's the following I mean oh there are there are 50 kinds of others okay so and and there are there are receptors that that that neurons that actually sends these orders and eventually their projects that to these neurons feed us 50 neurons and then something very interesting happens I mean old something that computer scientist immediately saw you should sit up on their chairs right let me know there is a projection from 50 dimensional space to 2002 the dimensional space in a random projection randomly projected to much higher dimension four times higher and then another very interesting thing happens okay very computer science II to that there is a very sir there is a inhibitory neuron here which once excited by this by this havoc that happens here it it very immediately intervenes and comes them down and out of these two thousand neurons only the fifty I believe at the hundred sorry the hundred highest one survived in the rest you know in other words becomes a zero one okay so you know it becomes a zero in vector and and only the top hundred are chosen and everything else is goes back to zero so so this is the this is the process and it's really worth you know it's you know in some sense it is it is the base of what I'm going to tell you okay we call this random projection followed by cap our PNC 100 winners out of 2000 okay so that's okay ah okay interesting question how do we know that this is a random bipartite graph okay and you're not going to believe this okay but-but-but-but six years ago this man axel did it okay created this bipartite graph so this is this degeneracy matrix okay and and the bottom line is sorry no the past it flew through all kinds of statistical tests and it is a random bipartite graph okay so you know with biases in the degrees all right I mean other than that it's it's it's it's it's a random bipartite graph and in fact it is in the left nostril of of the of the of the of you know it's the left-right are different different species have different and so so I mean oh it's sort of amazing that random is so important that this critter probably has it's the DNA a random random number generator okay so you know so this is you know it's it's it's it's mind boggling I'm you know so and randomness of course is the base of what I'm going to tell you and by a random projection and cap I mean the following that you have that you have a Bernoulli shower okay so you know where you get you get something that looks like this and then out of this and you know you take the highest K okay and that's and that and this and everything else this becomes one where everything else becomes you know that's okay good so one amazing thing that was that was you know does good you know Sanjoy Dasgupta and a couple of us and his cohorts from from San Diego they wrote a very interesting paper three years ago that basically they proved essentially that that it preserves a similarity right I know that but what I'm saying is that if you have a to similar smells okay well measure of similarities their intersection then the output will be two for other similar smells okay equally similar okay so and that's sort of that's it that's an image from generation it was an empirical observation in their paper and in fact they noticed that it has it has better property better recall properties then sort of done the very clever sophisticated algorithm came out of Stanford MIT of sort of locality preserving hashing okay so well and this was this was a very interesting surprise and in fact very zen the underlying mathematical reason okay that that the intersection of all these sort of you know in other words if alpha is the is the degree of intersection the percentage of intersection of the two smells okay the percent of the intersection of the two of the two sets of neurons that that is going to record them is is this okay and this looks like a very nonlinear function except that for the for the values of N and K for the fly it turns out that this very linear okay okay and and and in fact we suspect that this is not necessary you know that this is the right the right answer no in fact empirically if this is the 45 degree that says that it's exactly preserved this is what the sliders okay so it's very very very close but enough of the fly right I mean oh let's let's do something else so you know the question is that some single model was happening mammals so I mean also it turns out that it does and there is no evolutionary connection sort of you know that there were two independent discoveries are very similar very similar mechanisms except that in the mammals there is there is a catch and this cat is sort of the beginning of my story okay you know so so it turns out that that again mammals have you know further for example the mouse this is the head of a mouse it fifteen K 1,500 kind of smells okay we have 500 smells okay we lost a thousand okay because don't need them okay so but but the Mamas have fifteen fifty thousand smell 1,500 smells different different utterance that they can be and they have different 15,000 different different cells that are all factory receptors right I mean oh and and they're all in the roaster you know in our nostrils we have we have we have billions of cells okay and each one of these cells specializes in one of a 500 500 smells all right I mean oh so and then if we smell something these goals you know this project these neurons projects or actions to a place here is all you know it's like a pea-sized part of the cortex called the olfactory bulb okay the factory bulb has is is divided into glomeruli and so for example ammonia sort of you know is is projecting to one glomerulus so and and and and then the interesting stuff happens okay and this is something that again axial in a paper he of his in in 2011 and that was always an inspiration for us I mean Oh described and basically what happens is that these projects to this ancient form of cortex called the telephone cortex in other words where the the neurons here their axons go here many other places but most significantly here right amino and they're they create a permanent smell which a permanent memory which then it's transferred elsewhere and and go throughout okay but but let's let's look at this particular mechanism how it is done okay and and here is how this is described in the in the discussion section of that later another that may cause a small subset of beautiful cortex neurons to fire inhibition triggered by the sympathy of this activity that's exactly what happens in the in the in the in the fly will prevent further firing so it's going to be sort of you know a particular set of near that fire but then now comes the interesting part as this small fraction of cells will then generate sufficient recurrent excitation to recruit a larger population Munoz here's the secret mammals in in flies you know these two thousand cells they were no there were no axons going the worldö connections between them there are synapses between them here there are recurrent synapses okay and so the thing will not stabilize alright I mean oh these small fraction cells they're going to recruit more okay because now there is a very simple synaptic input from these new things right and this will be so it will move and then move again and move again in the extreme some cells would receive an Africa and people to fire without receiving initially input ok so so if there's something very interesting is happening here so let me let me you know imagine that you have a set of spike in neurons all right I mean oh that's I think that this is you know so this is Megan is very that I propose is very general okay I mean oh that's this is something that mammals do okay that we do alright and that's the following that if we have a memory of this a set of spiking neurons okay and this neuron spike in some area okay over brain and this is a different area such that there is a bipartite graph over recurrency neck actually the random bipartite graph okay random is very important what I'm going to tell you and then a random no bipartite graph okay between the recurrent graph between in this area what will happen is that in the beginning as in the fly something will come up okay bye-bye precisely by a random projection and cut but then these will start firing okay also and now the whole this whole area is going to receive both input from here any buffer there and as a result there going to be a new set of winners right I mean oh and there will be this and now these two are going to fire this is going to be forgotten and lost these two are going to fire and as a result a third one we'll come okay and and so on okay so the curve and the crucial question is will it converge so is there something that is there a stable member going to be formed and it turns out that that and also does it does it reverse a similarity before telling you the results are just a little suspense let me tell you that I mean oh maybe this is one of the most interesting parts of what we are doing we have a model of the brain okay sort of ambitious and silly as it sounds right I mean oh so you imagine you'd have a finite number of brain regions each contains and neurons inhibition means that in each one of these regions only k out of n and think of K as square root of n fire okay some pairs of areas are connected by directed BNP graphs okay bipartite random graphs and all of them are connected recurrently by directed GMP okay and that's the model okay nothing else all right I mean though the question is what computation can be done with this model okay that's that's damask and and and suppose that neurons firing the skillet steps which is amino the influence of dyemax immediately right I mean oh so it's you know it's not true it's you know it's one of these assumptions that it's both is both extremely useful and productive and also indefensible okay you know so you know but they don't fire you know but but suppose they do they are selected by random projection and cut and the cap we assume that this area these these arrows can be enabled and disabled okay that that there is some control somewhere that this and then you have plasticity that's another that's the new that's the new element of what I'm going to tell you if a from neuron I to neuron J either the same area or in downstream area I fires and in the next step J fires the way to Phi J is multiplied by by something okay I mean oh it become it gets increased and then you have from your status forgetting and so on but I mean oh these are don't interfere with our room but um you know this is the model of our model of the brain and incidentally when I say a model of the brain a lot of people have been sort of have mathematical models of the brain um you know I'll tell you where our emphasis is is is a is importantly I think and enable it way different people have been interested in modeling the sensory cortex okay the visual cortex the auditory cortex and so on I mean oh they do why because this this is what is accessible to experiments right I mean oh you wire an animal you use you show it things you make it you make it make some decisions sort of you know lick some sugar okay so Romanian you have a paper right I mean oh so this is this is this is this is this is this is the this is that Rodino for the past poor step for from the past 50 years okay so you know since urbanism this is the brand butter so no of all neuroscience okay so I am more interested first of all in the human brain and I'm more interested in something that is you know it only has an old-fashioned term you know because it's not it's not it's not a beloved subject of anybody it's called the association cortex okay it means anything that is beyond sensors okay if you wish it started it starts from the hippocampus and later in other words that's the inner life of our brain okay so you know if I'm interested in thinking about language storytelling reasoning planning and so on this is what I'm interested in okay so that's and and it's it's it's pitifully little study again so the parameter side we know suppose that every new every every one of this area has about 10 million excitatory neurons but that the Hobbesian brings it to have to to the square root of that imagine that the probability of action is about 1,000 and and they increased because of plasticity is 1.1 okay so this this this is the ballpark figures that I'm interested in sorry I there's no geometry there's no meter so it's it's it's yeah but of course I mean oh I'm thinking of it as as yes it's a graph so there are three ideas randomness selection but what I call the random projection a cup and plus this - okay these are the three the three forces all right I mean that I'm interested in okay and and and everything I'll tell you so the theorem is the following the probably the process the process that I showed you does converge exponentially fast with high probability and the total number of cells involved which is a measure of how slowly to converge is if beta is bigger than beta star which is which is this this value so it's about point 0.15 then it's it converges very fast otherwise it's still converges as long as beta is beta is not zero okay so plasticity turns out and everything about it is not it's not it's not surprising plasticity helps convergence right amino that because trans plasticity stability okay if these things have been firing then we help them a little more and therefore they're going to keep firing okay and they're going to be stable good and here are our simulations and so on okay so the result of such projection let's call it an assembly it's not my a set of K neurons in a brain area who's firing in a pattern it's tantamount to our thinking of a particular memory concept name word episode etc okay so it's not my idea okay this is in other words that's no new nothing new right I mean Oh everybody believes that I mean so you know I know the extent to which they think it's the key to how the brain works difference but everybody believes that roughly this is what's happening okay he'll propose the 70 years ago now you know it has been they have been changed by people who who were interested in them then these you know boo said he was of course at random at etre Albert at Rutgers when he discovered this amino they discovered the Soudan okay and and and there are there are there are many now they are sort of you know there they are you know basically what we do that is novel is we use them in a way that Sauron had not been anticipated has not had not been sort of systematically worked out before and and we have another Rivera we know our group with group in in in Austria sort of you know we have simulations that really in a not in our model which is very schematic but sort of in a very biologically accurate model you know we know that they exist and and by the way you remember the concept of a gallon mother said okay basically a self you know the neuron that encodes your grandmother see much right I don't know how many of you heard of it I mean oh it used to be like folklore neuroscience folklore I mean I have a grandmother cell actually this if you think about it this cannot happen because if your say your grandmother goes a cell there would be no grandmother right let me know because a cell cannot do anything right I mean myself has no power I mean oh only only big gangs of cells have power okay we know so really it's a grandmother assembly right I mean Oh nowadays it's it's not called gramma it's called Jennifer Aniston cell okay you know or concept cells so because in the 90s they caught somebody who whose cell was firing only would when he saw a picture of Jennifer Aniston or even heard the voice of January cars and so on okay so incidentally by the way after my talk you have not only a Jennifer Aniston cells but you're going to have Jennifer Aniston cell cells think about but don't go that way okay okay so let's let's go back to let's go back to to oh you know I mean the business of trying to understand computation in the brain the question is what is the right level okay molecules of course computation habits at a molecular level spiking neurons and synapses yes definitely okay and people have been pursue pursuing these two levels for forever people will tell you that the real computation happens in the dendrites okay in other words were they were the axons meet to the presynaptic actions meet the postsynaptic neuron that's where the computation happens because they have many meeting points and God knows how how the whole effect is calculated right is it that if you multiplicative marks or what sort of you know it's it's a whole it's a whole computation tree and yes I mean a lot of computation happens then writes as well okay and then there is whole whole brain computation I mean that that's that's very useful in cognitive science where basically they do some experiments and and then they say you see so the subjects brain is a bit as if it exactly that this program right I mean oh so that's this is this is a these are all useful but the question is there is something in between that is missing right I mean oh and let's let's remember let's remember again what what the man said right I mean know that we need a logic I mean I think that the logic that axle is looking for it lives there okay and and so here is here is my bet okay so you know here here is what what what were thinking that we call the assembly hypothesis but there is in the intermediate level of brain computation it's implicating carry the higher cognitive functions of humans such as the reasoning I mean oh it's also important for animals but let me know but but it will be sort of you know a waste of our time to focus on our own non-human animals right amino reasoning planning language storytelling math music okay so you know science okay it's it's it's it's it's implicated in the good things assembly said it's basically sent a shoots main data structure it means data type okay and and the question is what are the fundamental operations let me know we have to come up with fundamental operations the basic operations and by the way tell me no it's not like should not be an idle exercise sort of you know saying well let's see perhaps assembly so you know have a decent deal boolean fine it should be average must be useful and plausible when I say useful it means that it should explain an experiment otherwise sort of you know why habit and plausible means that you have to convince yourself that that eventually it can be implemented by neurons and synapses okay because otherwise it's not it's not something that you should should venture it okay all right so so one operation is is projection right and I told you what it is is that you have you have an assembly than area and it can be projected it can create a copy in a secondary okay it's a little like an assignment in programming languages except that when you say X gets Y x and y I'm going to live independent lives but these two assemblies are forever tied together okay and and this can always fire this so he took on so the next time it will fire this will fire as well okay if this is enabled okay that's this is the idea all right so other operations it turns out that to establish massive associated by sharing cells okay so in other words you have two assemblies in the same area and there may be sharing cells why always do they share cells okay everything has square root of n they should share in cells even a random it turns out the share cells because there is an affinity I mean oh I want to show you an experiment that that okay so that's these two assemblies fire and as a result this was samples get together okay this was a copy or as a projection of this these are the projection of this these two fire together this means that they call card okay they have some Afeni and as a result these these these and so here is here is her here is amazing experiment okay this one that was also i opening for us they they they recorded from one neuron in one brain in one subjects brain and that neuron turns out that it was like the like the Eiffel Tower in here and every every time the so that for tower this fired okay actually they recorded from a couple of dozens of patients and from several hundred neurons but let's focus on this one you're on right so they show it other interesting things that familiar things nothing okay I felt our always okay then they show him people famous people used to be the president of the you remember that very okay good so nothing okay let it do something clever the Photoshop Obama in front of the Eiffel Tower okay yeah so I mean oh they probably did it in a better way than I did okay and of course the the neuron sister of the the Eiffel Tower of course the fires right then they swallow towers of course it fires this other stuff nothing what the you know fired okay get it so these patients learned that Obama has been to the Eiffel Tower okay so in America and you discover this experimental okay this is you know amazing okay and it's you know and the only plausible explanation is the previous picture right let me know that the Obama and and and and you know that this neuron was in job in the in rifle assembly but not in the Obama said okay and because the Obama and I shall call card it jumped to the I fell to the Obama assembly right I mean oh so now now it's both in the Eiffel Tower and Obama okay the the intersection interest and let me know the then the sex increases become something like 10 percent from 0 where it should be and Association presented the projection yes so associations protected it all so once these are associated now if they're projected to differ an area it's still they're still going to be associated okay it this one happens in in the you know it's you know it happens as I showed you I think okay that and we showed you know control by math but if you have two sets of neurons the two sets of in the two sets of nodes in the graph so you know Reina random graph and they fire together then their projections will come closer okay I know this these are all things that you can prove all right now so that's good so here is another operation marriage okay it's more complicated basically assemblies X&Y from different areas project to create one assembly area a call it Z in another area call it this call this I said new assembly Z and this it has it has this new assembly has ample Z has ample synaptic connectivity to and from X&Y okay in other words what you do is yet that you have built a tree whose leaves are x and y and z is an internal node of the tree so it's useful for played for hierarchies it's useful for language okay so you know I see and and so this is what happens okay that that these fire yeah that these these are the parents of this rule this fire and then you can you create the two-way dependencies between these three nodes okay and and so the very interesting thing is that this is the by far the most sophisticated one operation who have you have a couple more but it requires the careful synchronization of five brain areas and very strong synaptic connectivity and plasticity between between these two these three areas and and one question I have serving I'll come back to that I mean Oh does it mean enhanced hardware okay so you know in other words there is you know I believe that this is something that probably happens in the animal brain also okay but I believe that that that humans are a special equipped to use it a lot okay so you know to use it like many hundred times every second ok and and the question is do you need special hardware ok and and this is is is a huge fiber that that that connects that connects to brain areas that are put that are important for language Virna Kazarian Broca's area it's much huger in humans than innate and here's a surprise the left version is much bigger than the right there okay and that's the only anatomic asymmetry that you have seen in the mammalian brain okay so something's happening here okay but you don't know what it is okay so good so the assembly operations are are these okay so there are some there are some control operations which we need okay but are complete means that if - or if - if two assemblies are associated and one fires there is a good chance that the other one will fire okay so you know if you if you if you remember a mob Obama then then then you may you may remember the Eiffel Tower next okay okay good and the question is how powerful is the system and other assumption it can perform arbitrary square root of n computation space computation okay so it's very powerful all right let me know anything and it's n is a million sorry no that's that's a lot of computation all right all right cool okay how much time good ok cool ok excellent ok that's where I'm going ok the language right Amina so when I tell my neuroscience friends I mean Oh including accent that but that Amita said in language I mean oh so basically what what what they tell me is why so you know that's the that's the hardest thing that any brain has done okay why don't you wait until we figure the brain out and then we'll sit back light a cigar and think about language ok no that should be the last chair in the cake and I don't think so ok you know I think that language is an immense opportunity because I mean our brain sort of you know reflects the environment but this an environment was created by us ok we have not evolved since language ok and and it's a last meal as being adaptogen it evolved and language has evolved right I mean has evolved tremendously and extremely rapidly ok think about this ok that imagine a little girl in Japan and a little girl in England okay they speak very different languages ok this language is evolved over four thousand mothers grandmothers and so on ok mm mother mother's ago they were speaking the same with the same language okay so I mean oh the so Japanese and English okay differ their difference was mediated by 4,000 mother's okay and that's the remarkable okay I mean this this says that language has has adapted a lot okay you know and it has adapted to what I think I'd up to to our brain okay languages are our suppose you know are supposed to be easily teachable my mother's two babies okay and and it's I believe that it's an available as for study the brain I mean in fact there is there's an incredible number of recent experiments I mean so let me let me show you another experiment that's David pop purple in NYU okay so you're wonderful you know cognitive scientist universe on experimental New Scientist so here is his experiment he read the sort of in in a very neutral voice sort of you know a at four Hertz so you know forth for a second that's this is this is precisely the frequency which I'm speaking now okay so you know it's it's amazing you know everyone in the world everybody speaks at four Hertz okay it's you know people think that that that syllable is not a linguistic concept but but about a brain concept then your significance you know so so it's so what happens is that so they they they they read this nonsense sequence of words okay and what happens then then they record from everywhere in by many technologies different technologies what you get you take the free the free analysis you get a peak at 4 Hertz okay because four times a second your brain has to say what on earth does this mean okay you know so and and and and and there is activity for this for this for this and and it's recorded so no surprises here then it then pop or do something color clever item you know so he repeat the experiment except that every four words that make sense okay okay and guess what all right so of course you have to every four four times a second you have to recognize a word but one time-saving second enough to say hey a sentence okay and in the West that's apparently different part of the brain and twice every second you say a phrase okay because basically what I think happens is this right that's to me a parsimonious explanation of this experiment I mean I remember so you know having having lunch with Chris man in two years ago and and at sample if I was or you know I was you know I was overcome by temptation and turned to him and looking him in the eye I told him for the love of God Chris do we have trees in our brain okay and he came up back immediately of course you do okay so you know in Chris Manning is sort of you know a mother among the computational linguist the one who would be least inclined to say that I mean oh so I think we have trees in our brain you know the bubble experiment came came later okay so so here is another another experiment very red to to to subject things like the ball is he hit the truck in the truck hit the ball different areas of this the of the superior temporal gyrus responded to track in the two sentences okay so there is a special there is a special area for for object is a special area for subject and I'm sure a special area for her okay and not only that but the first area also responded the track was hit by the ball so in other words what what our brain does not have an area for object but has an area for deep object okay in other words it says here forget the passive the stupid passive voice maneuver okay the truck is the object here not the subject so you know this is some of the achons keys do not like okay but but but but it's there and another one so you know they come deletion of phrases and especially of sentences lights are parts of Broca's area you know so here is Veronica's area here is Broca's area this and this is there quite a vesicular okay this is the this is the huge bundle of nerves that at all before and it joins the two you want to hear something amazing this bundle of nerves this this this big big big fiber it becomes myelinated which means becomes ready for use at the twentieth month of the baby's life exactly when sentences are beginning to form okay these are sort of amazingly data okay so these are incredibly so you know it's very tempting to do ridiculous speculation okay so here is one way that you know ammeter setting in half centers you know I think parsing is an interesting problem but it's really reversible engineering of generation generations the interesting problem the real problem in in in in in in languages when you see this what do you do okay how do how do you record this as a fact okay and basically what you do is you you probably look for the verb first and once you find it you project it to very decays area then you find maybe there may be the subject that you projected then you find the maybe the the object you project it and then you create emerge between kickin ball and you call this verb phrase and then you could create a sentence which is boychiks ball so what I'm saying is that there is a wild speculation you can make about how this is done using assemblies and and and that agrees with with with everything with the experimental data that we have about about language in the brain okay so ultimately I don't know how many of you know the other story but but the people who discovered you know the founders of neuroscience were an italian spanish scientist called Camillo Golgi and Santiago harmonica hull they both sought at the same time the neuron okay so using a technology that golde golde had created and and then they disagree they departed company at the time okay because because basically Golgi said okay what I see here is a network okay this is is called a ridiculous right let me know that network theory that the brain is a network okay okay there are some some density dense masses here about who cares I mean other day obviously the brain is a network and and and we have to study the network whereas Golgi said whereas Camila Monica Hal said this is the neuron folks and you should spend the next eight hundred years studying the neuron okay and and amino they completely disagreed and they had they had they had a epic fight at the Nobel Prize ceremony okay but but I mean other question is who was right okay and for of course it's obvious now that they were both right okay and they were both wrong to reject so vehemently dope that the opposing view but in another year more real way now Monica Hal was right okay because there were no scientists in 1900 ready to study the network about there were a lot of physicians who wanted to study in Iran okay and and therefore that was okay so no but that's the point of view that one okay so i guess assembly hypothesis says wait a minute maybe there is something in between what when you focus there will get new insights about this thing okay so you know maybe there are sets of neurons assemblies of neurons that can explain a few things that could not be explained before okay the side of a brain is fascinating a bottomless assembly center of operations may be one productive path to thinking about computation in the brain how did they see the boxes logic okay so we don't know how a simple is learning predict okay and this you know unless unless you nail that sort of you know it's the theories incomplete and how can one test verified falsified assembly hypothesis to experiment so we have with no we have a NSF grant that was just approved that to work with cognitive scientists in your assignment is to try to see these things okay you know and and you know frankly my my my point of view is that fear is like that they never there never falsified right um you know you know they just they just die in absence of supporting evidence right I mean oh so so that's you know and and and you know for all I know that's that's what's going to happen okay so these are the people who work with Lhari about is the leader of the fury group and you know science at Columbia Santos vampire is we started together this trip to five years ago this is our student dumb Interpol ski my colleague my linguist Mike Collins at Columbia and and Wolfgang masse who also started me on this path he is a computer scientist theoretical meter scientists who 20 years 25 years ago decided to become a neuroscientist and became one of the earliest converts okay so you know did did what I'm doing 20 years earlier okay so that's it thank you very much [Applause] no I disagree yeah let's all by language I mean something something very specific okay you know and and and chimpanzees have cry have warning cries and so on right amia language is something is something that is you know I mean grammar recursion unbounded number of possibilities oh absolutely I mean that's and that's that's important I mean no language probably exists amino comic languages communication is only maybe eighty thousand years old people believe that language maybe existed half a million years ago but I mean no but I mean if you think about it we spend much more time talking to ourselves that to anybody else right I mean oh so so for for half a million years maybe we were talking to ourselves only okay but that has a lot of advantages because sort of you know it helps you a lot of evolutionary bandage them you know it helps you plan better understand make make make more more complete models of the world so you know and therefore you could spread if you have it okay and eventually the pressure is such that because you have so much to say that sort of you know that every little mutation in your facial muscles and and then chords so you know and actually speech is not apparently very difficult okay I'm you know there are a lot of a lot of non prime know primate non-human primate researchers who believe that that so that many many monkeys already yeah yeah yeah so so right right right yes I mean also the question is yes and that's why so no that's why you know this is the reluctance of you know because with humans you can only do very very limited spare immense to do as experiments like the Obama and Eiffel Tower experiment you need to find people in down-on-their-luck sort of you know to sort of intractable you know and that's sort of you know that's rare and so these these these are rare that are very very valuable that but but sort of you know everything else is is much more difficult and needs a lot of data science to analyze the results you know the other is are the other experimental show you are essentially fMRI and EEG experiments okay and you really need them you know they are not as crisp as a coke experiments you know so you really need a lot of a lot of analysis conclusions let's have a couple more questions and the don't and then we're gonna have a series of lightning talks any more questions good operation oh I see I have thought of that so we know it will be interesting what we know how much of our Lego language make any sub duplicating in the in our artifacts okay so you know that's that's that's important I think about okay I have a question that you had one slide about the like the first time you create a memory that it's recorded our hypothesis that there's a random number generator at that time to create the random projection how how the further how the first thing okay they are about this we know a lot okay you know the first thing happens in the in the hippocampus okay so we know and we know that every second of our lives or you know a new memories and most of them of course don't survive but some of them are projected further and then they start having a life over the road okay so you know that and so how the first and how these memories are created they are created from the highest order for the highest levels of sensory okay so you know for example for you know whole object memories so you know from from from the very base job for the visual cortex our happiness so you know are formed in an area called IT in Ferro temporal cortex which is sort of the highest the root of the of the tree that is vision okay so you know and these always project to the hippocampus you know and this seems to be the Gateway okay so know that true you know if if the brain is a tree where they has input and output this is a if if we lose it I mean there is a patient HM so even if a bustiers case lost it sort of you know at some point when people didn't know what to accomplish was and surgeons would cut it you know that did not create any memory okay so you know believe it lived a happy life for 15 years already know and every time you know he saw his doctor twice a week and every time he would introduce but learn to play piano you know so from you know is there some things that we don't understand okay yeah so yeah yeah yeah of course of course of course actually got a mechanism and uses it to bring yeah yeah so so I mean no that's that's that's that's amazing question you know and of course I told you that that that Axl's team did was able to measure this in the play okay so and seems to be pretty random okay for you know in in mammalian brain you know that we know that there are several deviations from Union for our donors okay for example if you know you have two two neurons okay the the chance that they are connected let's say is one in a thousand if they are connected the chance of is the reciprocal action exists is like 100 okay so it is or or you can have triangle completion if these two this two exist then this is very likely to exist so and these have been studied and there are reasons to believe that they are architectural importance or you know to to enhance algorithms to make algorithm run more more robust okay so so it's a it's a big question the origin of this is geometry is it is it plasticity I mean oh why why why do this do this these biases so deviations from beginning for Adam has happened okay it's always a matter of matter of matter of conjecture but I mean oh I feel that that's a very important okay great thank you so much Christmas [Music] [Applause]
