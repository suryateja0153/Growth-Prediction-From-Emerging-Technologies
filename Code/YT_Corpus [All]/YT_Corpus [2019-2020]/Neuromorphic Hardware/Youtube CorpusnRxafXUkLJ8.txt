 [Music] and we will find the right attachment here okay all right I'm still figuring out how to get my talked about okay that's great all right so good morning everyone I'm quite excited to talk today here and here actually my slice so that's really nice soon can do and I just want to connect you to the Lydia Scott was talking about neural networks and I go one level deeper asking the questions what a memory stirs and what can I actually do as building block once I would be later integrating a deep neural network and then I would come in last part to a new part of our last research that we have actually showing you how one can use classic listing type battery materials and the ions of that actually to mimic sign absence and actually he was set to normal fear computing so material that has been used on batteries could gain additional value and could actually also supply additional functions and just be an energy storage I was thinking about artificial intelligence and this can actually enable machines to sing and do actually different complicated operations like humans that's actually quite fascinating and I just want to show you really the technological landscape because we want to discuss Rosa's workshop what is coming up in the next ten years so a palace outside is actually to look into not on that work and using actually is a mimicking of neurons that know from human cell biology to act in a quite complicated operations were integrated addiction and I want to run your real quick this analogy so when we look in a classic neuron then you have actually there's a sacrum and has the different dendrites which can actually connect and have a certain synaptic weight which allows actually to transfer information and once the nucleus has actually received all that information goes over certain threshold it will actually fire to the next neuron into a connection that is actually what's happening right now when you think really hard about understanding that talk and the eyes are actually fires actually potassium and calcium ions depression is how to move main actions and super neurons by hardware and what to type is different kind of units to do that and one way to operate is actually with sort of social to speak memory stirs which are very tiny devices of a metal a transition metal oxide and a manner on top and if you make source in enough that they allow you actually to have a simple ionic transfer and the high local electric field where the synaptic weight would be actually sitting PNP oxide and if you have seven of those interconnected in a crossfire a structure then you can actually run on something similar as an avid fishermen are aware when you reach a threshold to have a the values that you can use for computation have been before after the somatic weight in the biological Luminara would actually be over there in the dendrites and we have to think about what are the materials that can actually do that and have actually synaptic weight in Allegan it has a hardware for instance in that restaurant and how to actually compose these matters and how do we understand sews and that's a lot of work actually on these memories looking into memory application would find ninety-five percent of all the papers the tricky part is when it comes to normal namitha computing they're actually the synaptic weight and also the dynamics that you need are very different so we have to actually really understand that laughs so to go one step deeper and actually looking at what is the output terms that we could use later in these different normal computational operations then we can see when we look in a classic neuron and we look at the current voltage profile that this is a hysteretic relationship which comes from the ions that are flowing in a certain pasta map of the time digital nation and it had a sign actually different resistance state changes that you have over the derivatives that you can later use in the computation of the brain similar and so-called memory stroke so in the memristor you have also hits the rabbit current voltage profile and that happens because we have very high local electric field strength that these princes to formation of filaments with different interface regions of defect of the material and when you reverse a bias or a change in amplitude so just like go in the other direction and this gives you actually what you don't know from the textbook where we normally talk about on resistors which was the alidium relationships but it gives you actually there the systemic cycle that you prefer that is the characteristic can retarget whose resistance response actually better continue around ever since so how I have actually memorized has been discovered so this goes actually back to the month of 70s when I was actually probably insurer that there should be an attractive hysteretic on voltage relationship that should be existing a salade memory stands and it came out of like looking into passive circuit elements and understanding that's a must be something else instead of having the resistance inductance and in all the other elements that we had around so he actually postulate is that there should be such a his the Riddick the rest of current but I took out two Stirling his later 14 years later I knew what was fine and passed away the average that they could actually find it was small enough in transition metal oxides it's memory stuff processes now what's quite fascinating is that actually can reach a similar density on the osseous memory stirs on a chip comparable to 10 of our 10 per square centimeter what we have actually has sine abscess in the brain and those are ionically controlled systems so what half the ions actually at the brain like potassium calcium are normally at these memories Dastak Siachen eyes copper or silver eyes that you find and those are non bio response systems that you can use action artificial intelligence it's a really hard part as a material scientist to understand the dynamics understand the different resistance state and understand how to manipulate those and that's actually where it's a is a tricky province of food Ryan audience it's a father's workshop I have kind of like put up here a little bit of what my groups vision and kind of like sorting is off the field right now in member schools there is two types of memory stirs that are existence of far so one is the so called elementary memristor and the second one is a so point interface memory stir the filament memories that you apply a bias to this unit here and you will actually have an electrode process like copper and it can form through an electrolyte a filament of copper connecting to the other side if that's happening it would have a very abrupt change in resistance or connectivity and you will see actually a very quick onset of the conductance to the other states that you set however later this becomes when actually swinging back to the stage once you take action that's enough and the consequence of that operation on an atomistic scale is actually that you have a very lower symmetry for this filament based than we're stressed and the second part is that you a crystal is very low right but the good news is because you have actually a very fast motion of cat eyes you have a very fast switch speed which can be as amount of seconds the other part of memory states that are have been published actually literature I wanna highlight here that food is a work of young and is actually well it can be much more about it it's the interface memory stone and in the interface memory star you can actually have here the effect that you accumulated what interface and when you apply it is bias in a reverse direction they were just shipped back to the other side and you're shuttling back and forth mostly oxygen ions over defects in the electrolyte material if an apprentice s asymmetry is quite high so you don't have such an abrupt change like in a cat ion migration mechanism their currency is high but the speed is relatively low okay so yeah in a constant dynamic which members does I call it a members to their lab your eyes I have a fast speed but a low symmetry of no Icarus II or you have a low speed and you have a fast symmetry inaccuracy it's a memory stop depending on what we pick so what's the impact of that the impact is later that an image recognition and that's one part actually of what you want to use these ignore and that works for us Vivian just pointed out if you have a pattern then the ratio between the resistances that you can access and the symmetry where define the synaptic weight that's what you see here and that is going to define over a certain time and the dynamics of movement how fast at however you can resolve that image so this is quite relevant so what we can learn from that is that we actually are not happy at work and what can we do guys material scientists to play with that and an idea what actually gets a speed-up and also Korean symmetry oh it's the most classic wave of what you could do is take for instance an effect and manipulate that either by extrinsic dopants or straight it has also been done in electronic transistors as like various examples but to be very honest even though I have also published them so there's a certain extent in which you can change the resistance values quaza dynamics but you will be limited funds under the distance modulation at least by a factor of ten to one solve whatever I can't open the material classes I showed you before so there's a certain rate I can manipulate but I can't go beyond set so to come back to this dilemma you can either have a symmetric faster switching but you can have switching in a symmetry but with slow dynamics so we need to come up with a strug class of new materials and how to source it and that is what I hope to show you as a second part of this talk so there has been some recent ideas actually has appeared to move away from those ions that I showed you before which are either using oxygen copper and silver very commonly in this as a finitary or interface-based memristors but to look for instance an iron that could actually migrate much faster can we make for instance that by power interface and wisdom that use actually I did have positive facility like Alyssia listen is a great fellow at was shown as a master five years in solid state that of a battery industry then you can actually fabricate very nicely cell phones was a high accuracy of Elysium and you have much more options to may their variance and symmetry and retention but keeps us interface mechanism but it was actually the fast propagation also this year and also you need a very low energy to move for this room around so this could actually be a very interesting material to look at so what has been done and there's a fantastic paper I want to point out from an Italian from severe lapses is one paper you wanna read on this topic this week with the electronic paper and it reveals that listing cobalt oxide which is a classic cathode material in the battery can be used for instance to compute information it's erratically in my residence and the interesting part of that you can use to listen that you pump in and out as a trigger to alter later and some kind of like synaptic weight of the material and there has been several other materials like instrument of titanate or less iron oxide that have been shown to be have capabilities to use of actually neuromorphic computing now that is all very nice however these materials may not be the most of it still need a lot of energy to nutritive industry Cola oxide and also it's not very environmentally friendly if we think about the cola crisis so what mighty propelled was is to make the first listed titanate memory stone and that is a material that is actually using a classic battery out where you need to have very low energy to bring Ashley's Elysium and to use the lesson actually buy a valence change to activate the titanium and have actually very fast dynamic see in a moment another transition the other thing that's interesting as an estimate titanium are readily available and there's a white an actual chemical we need to use it and it's a so-called zero strain material so whatever I do in my memories de it's never going to change the volume so it's actually also components it later is quite nicely manageable on the symmetry so what we have done is we have processes on listing tightness in films and you can see an example made by pulse laser their position so it's a technique where we use a ceramic pallet with blades that we shouldn't either without doing that now I bring it down actually in a substrate and okay create a nice thin films and Dennis he in according Raman spectra showing better Castle face and the really cool thing I'm excited about to show you is listen titanate can actually be used as a memory store so this is a theoretical voltage buffer you can cycle zap actually happen sometimes and the interesting thing is that we can assign actually Jewish resistance on our Frazier's cause it's missing four titanate material so it's actually a new material that we could use of that for computation now I think that we asked ourselves well it hasn't been intimated transition that's actually quite nice so what's really special about the materials if you have the mr. Forsyte here then it's an insulator and if I push more lycium in the structure I can come and see the metallic conductor so the basic idea is we use that material as a vehicle to later change a synaptic weight on the match so we can make a choose for that material beyond classic doping how it's going to switch and we can do that using her face changed in that material there has been pretty small room of Mademoiselle Reisz we collaborate in batteries actually showing us that one can also use these two faces for instance to automate as a dynamic center to chemistry of the system so whether this has never been applied to my master father set so we had to actually use a trick to even makes this very high conductive listed titanate city metallica back it's because mama you cannot just process s or Elizabeth so what we did is we kind of like make a multi-layer and the pyramids lay the deposition processing officer face we want solicitor titanate and we add the second phase which is list in my trade to later process that as a multi-layer you can see the contrast every study nanometers of faith is going to change and when we anneal that later we have internal Association sources as solicited nitrate decomposes and we can create very filing control highest of geometry listed titanate material which is normally very difficult to process because you need to have a really high control level and elysium to define whether it's insulating all the semi-metallic space later and then have some results so to show just like for the record that we can actually make with implicit film those faces yes we can we can see that as rahman looking here and soliciting oxygen titanium oxygen bonds but coming action having to the chains of what I was saying is that this has a huge impact later on the switching so we can see he's a man with decreased cost for the lower litigated and the tireless David face so you see the current voltage response and that's like three things we can learn from that first one I said was in one material depending on the lycium that I apply I can either be a symmetric or symmetric and I can change the religion on operation and the dynamics of the material that's actually quite relevant because what I showed you in the beginning is that you have not much leverage to design normally materials to have fast dynamics and a fact asymmetry and resistance on operation because doping can help you but not so much as a shoulder to extend up here so what might currently working on as a device where we create another statistic type leg on the bottom and it's a straight channel device and what would be is a gate in a trimester is on top of it now listen conducting electrolyte and listen file and that allows us Mike was a micro pump to pump illicium in and out and we can thereby on the map control the synaptic weight of the unit and then I think is some new approaches actually that can help us actually to play active it was a synaptic weight and add actually new solutions to this voltage time in there so how does that tie up on a budget perspective well think about that so we just showed you that became more market computation with some new class of materials are based on this you for AI but think about it right now in this safe on our instance if you have a cell phone on you you have a battery pack that's quite heavy you have some sensors on board and you have later somehow your your processor on board what if they turn that ship architecture you could have well sim film electrolyte right and depending on the electrodes electrochemistry it could later either process your data normally what could sense was another set of electrodes or you would actually have your energy on board but be much smaller that is what I'm Corinne as a new field SOC onyx and I think that's really exciting times to come so what has been classic classic battery materials do not need want to be classic battery materials we could really sink out wild for what else to use those and with that I come to the end not only everybody shows a really serious picture I'm not get it but that's how my team looks like I think when we go in another video from I don't know level 1 to level 4 or something and I really want to express see my sense to the team and especially also to Mon Calas was actually in the audience and Moran so most of the data you have seen stems actually from this work and isn't here really contributed to the processing and the houses thank you very much for your attention which will be yeah so I'm wondering um so you present this so I wouldn't be some oxidation states how would they came to be exposed to air or moisture that's a very good question so and here's a song state material so we would not inflame so what's quite nicest of us he was kept an interesting structure there's no exploding information etc let's click it and now there will be some slight modulation actually in there is melissap response if you have explored humanity we have we have been I think very early on publishing on the world tokens and actually under minutes he is a members two fields are for other oxygens and doctors and to tell you the school's what has been Annette neglected by a lot of to engineer said every memory stiff material shortly before will have a reaction on humidity so we can always cover humidity settle into a language of question so it doesn't matter and for them did you tightening commission look like to travel health devices and you showed them in wisdom response how stable is done it is very safe okay why yeah why don't you redistribute when you remove demoted why it doesn't move back yeah well so if you applies potential and we have actually a certain about retention allowed to interface right then it was maintaining that stage but it's not a driving for us to completely have all of this Timaeus go back right I think it's very simple to other type of users to redistribute non-uniformly and when you remove the voltage they could you bring this uniform I can sustain the profile of teaching in a very high diffusivity material I think that it's not very different so if you think about other material that switches at nanoseconds let's take that as an example and oxygen ion conductors like titanium I also hear it have low get very high light you need strength and material kind of like space in that state once you switch it right but about all the oxygen is hot all the effects panel is a stage not between materials 200 they don't conduct oxygen mask right but this little conducts medium fast actually channel distribute is a down so they somehow down has been was I think you have to think about is gesture somewhat mycube increased connectivity to visited to contact other oxygen ion conductor but also those would not anything that just because I have to try my advice to comment on how skateable are those devices that's a good question to be honest I have not that was a team so I cannot directly give you some numbers on that question it's a simple structure and architecture 400 nanometer systems right so we haven't scale it personality jobs but there's a potential IQ for as long as to compete in this geometry in processing well types of memory stirs the elementary one and these new interface and interface business and some of the materials seem the same between the two types so is that something that you can decide a fabrication for instance that's an example that can either have a preliminary switching or bipolar switching and it's not necessarily by the processing allows it even if you have made an expansion titanium oxide varistor depending on the electrics to feed strength and the way those items of health treatments in you have on your suite rate it can either be a buyer for our elementary switching so it's one of those exceptional materials that can have those so it depends on which range you actually operated and it has in some paper of our group where you show that they could be check it out that the candy dual switching it does other group with a em tip where they quoted ironic oz esteem and you know if you were to read so I'm gonna ask him any questions oh so this is my break here you serve you wipe the symmetry is about the asymmetry is a bad thing and I was trying to understand why why is that a suit that he explained more right if you think about computing on top of that it's obvious but maybe I'm missing something no I think it's not a bad thing it's just like showing the opportunities that is two eyes on the a semantics of symmetric depending later on the operation you want to take and so my equality of actions that currently it's very difficult by material supervisor and I was one or the other side and you can make careful decisions right and a hardware level and what's interesting I think on the example of the mr. titanate is that you could may have either station as we try to Architecture in cycles anyone and that's actually thinks that the cool part about it said if I wanted to do that it's not some titanium oxide having some extent if you operated in a different regime that's also what we published by fuse cranks or bias we pray the puttering yeah but it still within certain limitations and the twenties mega I think something that we've you know so raised for the big Nora networks to be flexible in the choice of materials we have and for the organisms they have materials that can preform in those and knowing how to operate it does that satisfy you so some of these materials are not very friendly this is a problem we have that's a very good material so there are more easy to handle than others that little answer this so on the misuse of the processing steps that I showed you that were just published on controlling of the simple metal very well no symptoms and that can be take carried out between 300 and 500 degree C so it is let's say as the higher end of see most comfort ability it is it is you have always be careful as Nicolas silicon and listening to we need to have a buffer layer or like about a very I think that's quite realistic however said something that industry knows how to solve if we think about some micro battery industry so for some services is not a problem to process it you would have to have a special boundary at the end right that makes this one part of it yeah I think that's that's realistic to say but I think it's not a showstopper necessarily for going into this potentially you can really use that we have this extra ability for copy and deposit disability and so to state matter what a misnomer
