 cognitive computing CC describes technology platforms that broadly speaking are based on the scientific disciplines of artificial intelligence and signal processing these platforms encompass machine learning reasoning natural language processing speech recognition and vision object recognition human-computer interaction dialogue and narrative generation among other technologies topic definition at present there is no widely agreed-upon definition for cognitive computing in either academia or industry in general the term cognitive computing has been used to refer to new hardware and or software that mimics the functioning of the human brain 2004 and helps to improve human decision-making in this sense CC is a new type of computing with the goal of more accurate models of how the human brain mind senses reasons and response to stimulus CC applications link data analysis and adaptive page displays a UI to adjust content for a particular type of audience as such CC hardware and applications strive to be more effective and more influential by design some features that cognitive systems may express our adaptive they may learn as information changes and as goals and requirements evolve they may resolve ambiguity and tolerate unpredictability they may be engineered to feed on dynamic data in real-time or near real-time interactive they may interact easily with users so that those users can define their needs comfortably they may also interact with other processors devices and cloud services as well as with people iterative and stateful they may aid in defining a problem by asking questions or finding additional source input if a problem statement is ambiguous or incomplete they may remember previous interactions in a process and return information that is suitable for the specific application at that point in time contextual they may understand identify and extract contextual elements such as meaning syntax time location appropriate domain regulations users profile process tasks and goal they may draw on multiple sources of information including both structured and unstructured digital information as well sensory inputs visual gestural auditory or sensor provided topic use cases speech recognition sentiment analysis face detection risk assessment fraud detection behavioral recommendations topic cognitive analytics cognitive computing branded technology platforms typically specialize in the processing and analysis of large unstructured data sets word processing documents emails videos images audio files presentations webpages social media and many other data formats often need to be manually tagged with metadata before they can be fed to a computer for analysis and insight generation the principal benefit of utilizing cognitive analytics over traditional big data analytics as that such datasets do not need to be pre tagged other characteristics of a cognitive analytic system include adaptability cognitive analytics systems can use machine learning to adapt to different contexts with minimal human supervision natural language interaction cognitive analytics systems can be equipped with a chat bot or search assistant that understands queries explains data insights and interacts with humans in natural language topic see also affective computing analytics artificial neural network cognitive computer cognitive reasoning enterprise cognitive system social neuroscience synthetic intelligence usability neuromorphic engineering AI accelerator
