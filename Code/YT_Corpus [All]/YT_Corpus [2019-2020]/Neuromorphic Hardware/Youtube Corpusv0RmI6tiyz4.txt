 See very excited to be what we striving for a prophecy is trying to make AI and computer vision more efficient trying to solve the problem of data deluge you especially create when it comes to vision when it comes to sensing with conventional camera technology, which are Everywhere in the world a 40 billion cameras are connected and generate a huge amount of data So the phonetic question is how to make a Yaya to make computer vision scalable and economically viable Also because the trend of course is to see these cameras growing in the future and when you look at carefully at all this data, in fact you realize that only 1% of the data generated by Cameras are pure information Our data which are relevant for a machine for a drone for a robot for a mobile phone to take a decision So why we do the extra work of processing all this useless data? while we know that 99% of these days I come very often from Redundant information right because when you for example, you want to take a movie of me talking on stage you know that most of the data will come from the background so which is essentially useless for any AI or computer vision information now when you think carefully the way the human eye works the way the biological retina works in fact The human eye is not producing an image the eye is only Reacting to change events is reacting to dynamic information when you look at me at this moment instead of producing An image and sending this image over and over to your brain your retinas only sending the contour is only sending few Dynamic information only what is changing the scene? So what we did a prophesy essentially is a silicon model of the human eye what I have in my hands is is a silicon retina is a is an emulation of the of the way the human eye works and When I take this this silicon retina And I put for example in front of a person moving in front of it what you get are not images our Dynamic information. So in the dynamic information is very often related to to the motion to the contour to the edges of an object so as you can realize by following this approach We reduce the data by More than 99% because all the background which is known is useless and is not acquired over and over so what we apply is only what is essential for a given computer vision or machine learning tasks So this convention this this new sensing paradigm is fundamentally different from the way Conventional camera works today in conventional camera had been working in the way they work today but since many many years since the cameras Quora of Leonardo da Vinci or the first video ever made by mu II bridge in Palo Alto in 1865 And third linear with a cinema invention, etc The fundamental paradigm has been to produce a nice image because the main business driver so far has been to produce video for human consumption not for machine consumption so what we believe that prophecies that a new paradigm is needed, especially now that We're entering this new era of AI of computer vision with this incredible tremendous growth of data in order to make again a is scalable and economically viable a new sensing paradigm is Needed and this new sensing paradigm is what we do a prophecies bio-inspired is neuromorphic is event based so the benefit are not only the fact that you acquire much less data is also the fact that now we Can control each single pixel in the array? Individually and the synchronously so we are not any more limited by a frame rate We are not producing a video a sequence of images. Each single pixel will react to each single event So for example, assuming that now you look at a black dot on a disk, which is rotating In a time-space domain, which is what you see in the slide You will not see single images single frames a fixed point in time You will see a No time continuous stream of event which give an incredible temporal precision Which is very valuable when it comes for example to detect a pedestrian which is crossing the door Which is crossing a road behind a track for example when you want to count Thousands of objects on a conveyor belt in a process automation application So what we are saying here is that not only this technology is providing much less data, but also is providing much more information So prophecy started four years ago in Paris as a spin-off of different research labs and universities and actually one of the trigger why we started this company is because we managed with the first implementation of the silicon retina to restore sight of People who are blind and then from that first implementation of the technology we decided to go beyond medical application looking for application in dust automation in automotive and in IOT and mobile devices We are now about a hundred people the compress four years old. We have more than 50 patents We are working across these three fields I just mentioned we raise about 35 million euros with investment partners like 360 Capital Intel Capital Bosch The Alliance Renison, etc So the market we're going after is the market of computer vision nara. I related to vision, of course And this is a fast-growing market today 40 billion cameras are connected in the world 200 cameras are produced every second 60 70 % of this cameras are not actually used for Machine vision. So the business opportunity is more than 30 billion and is growing extremely fast the way we serve it is by designing and developing this new vision sensor is by developing a new approach of computer vision and Machine learning on top of this Silicon component. So we provide the sensor. We provide a valuation kit We provide a reference system and we at our customer to disrupt their market by designing their drones the robot their car their mobile phone our unique technology so few examples, for example, we are able today to increase productivity in industry automation by enabling new usages like for example counting thousands of objects in the second for inspection we are able to Enable ultra fast and low-power eye tracking for a year. We are we are able to provide Below 10 millisecond latency for car detection in a driving assistance scenario So the company is more than is exceeding about 100 people. We are based in Paris this our headquarter. We are present everywhere with some boss research development activities and commercial activities and We are in the process of raising a new round of 40 million in order to bring the company to the next stage of business validation and Commercial scale up. Thank you for your attention You
