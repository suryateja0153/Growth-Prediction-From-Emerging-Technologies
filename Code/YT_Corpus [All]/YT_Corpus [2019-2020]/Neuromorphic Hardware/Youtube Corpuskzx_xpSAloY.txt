 well for us as designers it's a dream come to doing a car that is actually inspired by sci-fi or fantasy movie like Avatar and also to pick up on on the deeper meaning of the sustainable message of that bad movie and therefore we created something that is super in harmony with nature and actually a thing that merges current driver into almost an living organism well yeah I think we are bringing two things on a on a next level first of all our design language of central purity with that one super clean design very emotional but very much in harmony with the nature and the environment on one hand and then from the user interaction concept we are bringing man and machine together so it's a man and machine merge so actually the next level in user interaction again that thing is not a car it's a living organism and you actually merge when you enter into that car here you see that sleek silhouette this element we call it the merge device the vehicle and actually you feel it going up and down like like a heartbeat like a like a breathing so actually that thing comes to life and then it wakes up the entire car and when you come around you see that projection here and we are having two scenarios first of all it can bring you through planet Earth and we show the beauty of planet Earth we show things you normally don't see like magnetism lines and stuff like that and and then you can switch on some POS like that one here's the Avatar mountains in China we have two more clear eyes and then also you can transform yourself onto the world of Pandora and actually through hand recognition you can choose a new element here for instance here to die of horse and now here in the world of Pandora and you run through the world of Pandora through the eyes of the Dyer voice you can also go on the banjee dragon so you will be higher up so therefore we merge actually here's the dragon coming up it's called the Benji dragon and now you see you fly through the world of Pandora and so we're actually merging a physical drive with virtual experience bringing you on to the world of Pandora but also showing the beauty of our planet in this spectacular show car we call it a BTR advanced vehicle transformation it's really a car where man and machine merge and through a control unit once you touch it the car feels that you're there it can feel your pulse your breathing it's so intuitive if you just put out your hand it gets projected onto your hand what you want to do and you can control the car from the palm of your hand so an intuitive experience like we have never seen before what really unites us it's the quest to push the boundaries of Technology Lightstorm his company has always been about you know how do you get to the next technological edge of filmmaking which is what we're trying to do in the car business the ENR unrest for what's next always pushing beyond always thinking about what the next great thing is and letting your energy your fantasy and your creativity work for you but that's not the only thing it's also about sustainability that's what the Avatar movie is about it's a message to bring harmony between man and nature and that's also what we want to do with our sustainable business model make sure that mobility in the future has zero impact on nature under the banner of ambition 20:39 we have set ourselves a clear target in twenty years time three product life cycles we want to make our new car fleet carbon neutral but that's not the only thing that we're talking about here tonight we're also talking about decoupling the usage of resources from our growth how can we through reduction reuse and recycling make sure that what we do and the business that we are growing we use less materials and we have less of an impact on the environment that's what the message is about today tonight
