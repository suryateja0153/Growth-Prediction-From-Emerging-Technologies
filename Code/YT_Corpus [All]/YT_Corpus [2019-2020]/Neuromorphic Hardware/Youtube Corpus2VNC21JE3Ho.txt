 The human brain it is one of the most energy efficient and powerful processors in nature. Many scientists and engineers all over the world have tried to mimic the function of the human brain and the research is still in the very early stages. To understand why this research is very important, let's take a real world example. Take your phone: this phone can recognize your face due to its inbuilt machine learning algorithms and unlocks your phone in an instant. These machine learning algorithms run on frameworks called a neural network. This neural network mimics the functioning of the human nervous system and is very good at tasks such as face recognition or text-to-speech processing and these neural networks run on computer hardware which on basic phones and computers are GPUs and TPUs. Though these hardware components are very good at running these algorithms fast,  they still take a lot of energy and space. This is where our research comes in. We are a group of scientists and engineers at University of Pittsburgh working to develop a low-power new device that mimics the functioning of the human neuron. Our device is very efficient at processing these neural network algorithms in terms of its energy consumption and the space it takes to run an algorithm. In a long run, we hope that this device will be the next generation of GPUs and TPUs running neural network algorithms and having the state of the art precision and energy consumption.
