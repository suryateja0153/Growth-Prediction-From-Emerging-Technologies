 Dolby's mission is to advance the science of sight and sound. Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos are Dolby's latest audio and video innovations. At Dolby we see the PC as an incredibly important form factor. For the creator it's the tool that brings their vision to life, and for the consumer it's an amazing platform to experience the best of entertainment, and we have this amazing partnership with Intel that can bring these experiences to life. With the new Intel Core processor they will bring that amazing Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos experience to you. Dolby Atmos brings sound to a new level, so that the sound is all around you and immerses you within the storytelling. Intel plays a critical role in enabling Dolby Atmos. Together we've been able to optimize the power of Dolby Vision. It means greater color, contrast, vivid detail, so you'll be able to get that extra hour of battery life on your Intel 11th Gen Core processor powered device.
