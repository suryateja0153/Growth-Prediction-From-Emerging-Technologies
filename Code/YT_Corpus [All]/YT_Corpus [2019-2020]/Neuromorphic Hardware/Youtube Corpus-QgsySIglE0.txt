 an unmanned aerial vehicle UAV commonly known as a drone is an aircraft without a human pilot on board UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system UAS which include a UAV a ground-based controller and a system of communications between the two the flight of UAVs may operate with various degrees of autonomy either under remote control by a human operator or autonomously by onboard computers compared to manned aircraft UAVs were originally used for missions to dull dirty or dangerous for humans while they originated mostly in military applications their use is rapidly expanding to commercial scientific recreational agricultural and other applications such as policing peacekeeping and surveillance product deliveries aerial photography smuggling and drone racing civilian UAVs now vastly outnumber military UAVs with estimates of over a million sold by 2015 topic terminology multiple terms are used for unmanned aerial vehicles which generally refer to the same concept the term drone more widely used by the public was coined in reference to the early remotely flown target aircraft used for practice firing of a battleships guns and the term was first used with the 1920s Faerie Queene and 1930s de Havilland Queen B target aircraft these two were followed in service by the similarly named airspeed Queen wasp and miles queen martinet before ultimate replacement by the GAF gen Davich the term unmanned aircraft system UAS was adopted by the United States Department of Defense dodge and the United States Federal Aviation Administration in 2005 according to their unmanned aircraft system roadmap 2005 to 2030 the International Civil Aviation Organization ICAO and the British Civil Aviation Authority adopted this term also used in the European Union single European sky SCS air traffic management ATM research se SAR joint undertaking roadmap for 2020 this term emphasizes the importance of elements other than the aircraft it includes elements such as ground control stations data links and other support equipment a similar term is an unmanned aircraft vehicle system UAVs remotely piloted aerial vehicle RP AV remotely piloted aircraft system are pas many similar terms are in use a UAV is defined as a powered aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator uses aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely can be expendable or recoverable and can carry a lethal or non-lethal payload therefore missiles are not considered UAVs because the vehicle itself is a weapon that is not reused though it is also unmanned and in some cases remotely guided the relation of UAVs to remote-controlled model aircraft is unclear UAVs may or may not include model aircraft some jurisdictions base their definition on size or weight however the US Federal Aviation Administration defines any unmanned flying craft as a UAV regardless of size for recreational users a drone as opposed to a UAV is a model aircraft that has first-person video autonomous capabilities or both topic history the earliest recorded use of an unmanned aerial vehicle for war fighting occurred on July 1849 serving as a balloon carrier the precursor to the aircraft carrier in the first offensive use of airpower in naval aviation Austrian forces besieging Venice attempted to launch some 200 incendiary balloons at the besieged city the balloons were launched mainly from land however some were also launched from the Austrian ship SMS volcano at least one bomb fell in the city however due to the wind changing after launch most of the balloons missed the target and some drifted back over Austrian lines in the launching ship volcano UAV innovations started in the early 1900s and originally focused on providing practice targets for training military personnel UAV development continued during World War one when the date and right airplane company invented a pilotless aerial torpedo that would explode at a preset time the earliest attempt at a powered UAV was am loathe aerial target in 1916 Nikola Tesla described a fleet of unmanned aerial combat vehicles in 1915 advances followed during and after World War 1 including the Hewitt's very automatic airplane this developments also inspired the development of the Kettering bug by Charles Kettering from Dayton Ohio this was initially meant as an unmanned plane that would carry an explosive payload to a predetermined target the first scaled remote piloted vehicle was developed by film star and model airplane enthusiasts Reginald Denny in 1935 more emerged during world war ii used both to train anti-aircraft gunners and to fly attack missions nazi germany produced and used various UAV aircraft during the war jet engines entered service after world war ii in vehicles such as the australian GAF gin Davich and Teledyne ryan fire bi of 1951 while companies like Beechcraft offered their model 1001 for the US Navy in 1955 nevertheless they were little more than remote controlled airplanes until the Vietnam War in 1959 the US air force concerned about losing pilots over hostile territory began planning for the use of unmanned aircraft planning intensified after the Soviet Union shot down a u2 in 1960 within days a highly classified UAV program started under the codename of red wagon the August 1964 clash in the Tonkin Gulf between naval units of the u.s. and North Vietnamese Navy initiated America's highly classified UAVs Ryan model 147 Ryan aqm 91 Firefly lockheed d 21 into the first combat missions of the vietnam war when the chinese government showed photographs of downed US UAVs via wide world photos the official US response was no comment during the war of attrition 1967 to 1970 the first tactical UAV is installed with reconnaissance cameras were first tested by the Israeli intelligence successfully bringing photos from across the Suez Canal this was the first time that tactical UAVs which could be launched and landed on any short runway unlike the heavier jet based UAVs were developed and tested in battle in the 1973 Yom Kippur War Israel used UAVs as decoys to spur opposing forces into wasting expensive anti-aircraft missiles after the 1973 Yom Kippur War a few key people from the team that developed this early UAV joined a small startup company that aimed to develop UAVs into a commercial product eventually purchased by two dieren and leading to the development of the first Israeli u-v-a in 1973 the US military officially confirmed that they had been using UAVs in Southeast Asia Vietnam over 5,000 u.s. Airmen had been killed and over 1,000 more were missing or captured the USAF 100th strategic reconnaissance wing flew about three thousand four hundred and thirty-five UAV missions during the war at a cost of about 554 UAVs lost to all causes in the words of USAF General George s brown commander Air Force Systems come in 1972 the only reason we need UAVs is that we don't want to needlessly expend the man in the cockpit later that year General John C Mayer commander-in-chief Strategic Air Command stated we let the drone do the high-risk flying the loss rate is high but we are willing to risk more of them they save lives during the 1973 Yom Kippur War Soviets supplied surface-to-air missile batteries in Egypt and Syria caused heavy damage to Israeli fighter jets as a result Israel developed the first UAV with real-time surveillance the images and radar decoys provided by these UAVs helped Israel to completely neutralize the Syrian air defenses at the start of the 1982 Lebanon War resulting in no pilots downed the first time UAVs were used as proof of concept of super agility post-stall controlled flight in combat flight simulations involved taylor's stealth technology based three-dimensional thrust vectoring flight control jet steering UAVs in Israel in 1987 with the maturing and miniaturization of applicable technologies in the 1980s and 1990s interest in UAVs grew within the higher echelons of the US military in the 1990s the u.s. dog gave a contract to AAI corporation along with Israeli company Mallett the US Navy bought the AAI pioneer UAV the de AI and Mallett developed jointly many of these UAVs saw service in the 1991 Gulf War UAVs demonstrated the possibility of cheaper more capable fighting machines deployable without risk to air crews initial generations primarily involved surveillance aircraft but some carried armaments such as the General Atomics mq-1 predator that launched agm-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles see AP Co n was a European Union project to develop UAVs running from the 1st of May 2002 to the 31st of December 2005 as of 2012 the USAF employed 7,000 494 UAVs almost one in three USAF aircraft the Central Intelligence Agency also operated UAVs in 2013 at least 50 countries used UAVs China Iran Israel Pakistan and others designed and built their own varieties topic classification UAVs typically fall into one of six functional categories although multi-role airframe platforms are becoming more prevalent target and decoy providing ground and aerial gunnery a target that simulates an enemy aircraft or missile reconnaissance providing battlefield intelligence combat providing attack capability for high-risk missions see unmanned combat aerial vehicle UCAV logistics delivering cargo research and development improve UAV technologies civil and commercial UAVs agriculture aerial photography data collection see US military UAV tier system is used by military planners to designate the various individual aircraft elements in an overall usage plan vehicles can be categorized in terms of range altitude the following has been advanced as relevant at industry events such as Park Ave poor fun man systems forum handheld 2,000 feet 600 metres altitude about two kilometers range close 5,000 feet 1,500 metres altitude up to ten kilometers range nato type 10,000 feet 3,000 metres altitude up to

suborbital altitude range over 200 kilometers orbital low-earth orbit Matt 25 plus cislunar Earth Moon transfer assisted carry a guidance system CA CGS for UAVs other categories include hobbyist UAVs which can be further divided into ready to fly RTF commercial off-the-shelf cots bind and fly BNF require minimum knowledge to fly the platform almost ready to fly a RF Do It Yourself DIY requires significant knowledge to get in the air their frame requires significant knowledge and your own parts to get it in the air mid-size military and commercial UAVs large military specific UAVs stealth combat UAVs manned aircraft transformed into unmanned and optionally piloted UAVs or OPV S classifications according to aircraft weight are quite simpler micro air vehicle MAV the smallest UAVs that can weigh less than one gram miniature UAV also called suas approximately less than 25 kilograms heavier UAVs topic UAV components and an unmanned aircraft of the same type generally have recognizably similar physical components the main exceptions are the cockpit and environmental control system or life support systems some UAVs carry payloads such as a camera that way considerably less than an adult human and as a result can be considerably smaller though they carry heavy payloads weaponized military UAVs are lighter than their manned counterparts with comparable armaments small civilian UAVs have no life critical systems and can thus be built out of lighter but less sturdy materials and shapes and can use less robustly tested electronic control systems for small UAVs the quadcopter design has become popular though this layout is rarely used for manned aircraft miniaturization means that less powerful propulsion technologies can be used that are not feasible for manned aircraft such as small electric motors and batteries control systems for UAVs are often different than manned craft for remote human control a camera and video link almost always replace the cockpit windows radio transmitted digital commands replace physical cockpit controls auto pilot software is used on both manned and unmanned aircraft with varying feature sets topic body the primary difference for planes is the absence of the cockpit area and its windows tailless quadcopters are a common form factor for rotary wing UAVs while tailed mono and by copters are common form and platforms topic power supply and platform small UAVs mostly use lithium polymer batteries leepo while larger vehicles rely on conventional airplane engines scale or size of aircraft is not the defining or limiting characteristic of energy supply for a UAV at present the energy density of leepo is far less than gasoline the record of travel for a UAV built from balsa wood and miler skin across the North Atlantic Ocean is held by a gasoline model airplane or UAV mannered hill in in 2003 when one of his creations flew one thousand eight hundred and eighty two miles across the Atlantic Ocean on less than a gallon of fuel holds this record see electric power is used as less work is required for a flight and electric motors are quieter also properly designed the thrust to weight ratio for an electric or gasoline motor driving a propeller can hover or climb vertically but might airplane is an example of an electric UAV which can climb vertically battery elimination circuitry Beck is used to centralized power distribution and often harbors a microcontroller unit MCU costly a switching becs diminish heating on the platform topic computing UAV computing capability followed the advances of computing technology beginning with analog controls and evolving into microcontrollers then system-on-a-chip sock and single board computers SBC system hardware for small UAVs is often called the flight controller FC flight controller board FCB or autopilot topic sensors position and movement sensors give information about the aircraft state XT receptive sensors deal with external information like distance measurements while X proprioceptive ones correlate internal and external states non-cooperative sensors are able to detect targets autonomously so they used for separation assurance and collision avoidance degrees of freedom DOF refers to both the amount and quality of sensors onboard 60o F implies three axis gyroscopes and accelerometers a typical inertial measurement unit IMU 9000 F refers to an IMU plus a compass 10 DOF adds a barometer and 11 DOF usually adds a GPS receiver topic actuators avy actuators include digital electronic speed controllers which control the RPM of the motors linked to motors engines and propellers servo motors for planes and helicopters mostly weapons payload actuators LEDs and speakers topic software UAV software called the flight stack or autopilot UAVs are real-time systems that require rapid response to changing sensor data examples include raspberry pies beagle boards etc shielded with Navi o pxf mini etc or designed from scratch such as nu t TX pre-emptive RT Linux Zen oh my or eCos robot operating system or DDS Ross 2.0 civil use open source stacks include topic loop principles UAVs employ open-loop closed-loop or hybrid control architectures open-loop this type provides a positive control signal faster slower left-right up-down without incorporating feedback from sensor data closed loop this type incorporates sensor feedback to adjust behavior reduce speed to reflect tailwind move to altitude 300 feet the pit controller is common sometimes feed-forward is employed transferring the need to close the loop further topic flight controls UAVs can be programmed to perform aggressive maneuvers or landing perching on inclined surfaces and then to climb toward better communication spots some UAVs can control flight with varying flight model ization such as VTOL designs UAVs can also implement perching on a flat vertical surface topic communications most UAVs use a radio for remote control in exchange of video and other data early UAVs had only narrowband uplink downlinks came later these bi-directional narrowband radio links carried command and control C and C and telemetry data about the status of aircraft systems to the remote operator for very long range flights military UAVs also use satellite receivers as part of satellite navigation systems in cases when video transmission was required the UAVs will implement a separate analog video radio link in the most modern UAV applications video transmission is required so instead of having two separate links for C and C telemetry and video traffic a broadband link is used to carry all types of data on a single radio link these broadband links can leverage quality of service techniques to optimize the C and C traffic for low latency usually these broadband links carry tcp/ip traffic that can be routed over the Internet the radio signal from the operator side can be issued from either ground control the human operating a radio transmitter receiver a smartphone a tablet a computer or the original meaning of a military ground control station GCS recently control from wearable devices human movement recognition human brainwaves was also demonstrated remote network system such as satellite duplex data links for some military powers downstream digital video over mobile networks has also entered consumer markets while direct UAV control up early over the cellular mesh and LTE have been demonstrated and are in trials another aircraft serving is a relay or mobile control station military man down man teaming Monte a protocol mavs link is increasingly becoming popular to carry command and control data between the ground control in the vehicle topic autonomy Iko classifies unmanned aircraft as either remotely piloted aircraft or fully autonomous actual UAVs may offer intermediate degrees of autonomy eg a vehicle that is remotely piloted in most contexts may have an autonomous return to base operation basic autonomy comes from proprioceptive sensors advanced autonomy calls for situational awareness knowledge about the environment surrounding the aircraft from exterior set of sensors sensor fusion integrates information from multiple sensors topic basic principles one way to achieve autonomous control employs multiple control loop layers as in hierarchical control systems as of 2016 the low layer loops ie for flight control tik as fast as 32 thousand times per second while high level loops may cycle once per second the principle is to decompose the aircraft's behavior into manageable chunks or states with known transitions hierarchical control system types range from simple scripts to finite state machines behavior trees and hierarchical task planners the most common control mechanism used in these layers is the pit controller which can be used to achieve hover for a quadcopter by using data from the IMU to calculate precise inputs for the electronic speed controllers and motors examples of mid layer algorithms path planning determining an optimal path for vehicle to follow while meeting mission objectives and constraints such as obstacles or fuel requirements trajectory generation motion planning determining control maneuvers to take in order to follow a given path or to go from one location to another trajectory regulation constraining a vehicle within some tolerance to a trajectory evolved UAV hierarchical task planners use methods like state researchers or genetic algorithms topic autonomy features UAV manufacturers often build in specific autonomous operations such as self level attitude stabilisation on the pitch and roll axes altitude hold the aircraft maintains its altitude using barometric or ground sensors hover position hold keep level pitch and roll stable your heading and altitude while maintaining position using GNSS or inert all senses headless mode pitch control relative to the position of the pilot rather than relative to the vehicle's axes carefree automatic roll and your control while moving horizontally takeoff and landing using a variety of aircraft or ground-based sensors and systems see also Auto land failsafe automatic landing or return to home upon loss of control signal return to home fly back to the point of takeoff often gaining altitude first to avoid possible intervening obstructions such as trees or buildings follow me maintain relative position to a moving pilot or other object using GNSS image recognition or homing beacon GPS Waypoint navigation using GNSS to navigate to an intermediate location on a travel path orbit around an object similar to follow me but continuously circle a target pre-programmed aerobatics such as rolls and loops topic functions full autonomy is available for specific tasks such as airborne refueling or ground-based battery switching but higher level tasks call for greater computing sensing and actuating capabilities one approach to quantifying autonomous capabilities is based on ood a terminology as suggested by a 2002 US Air Force Research Laboratory and used in the table below medium levels of autonomy such as reactive autonomy and high levels using cognitive autonomy have already been achieved to some extent in a very active research fields topic reactive autonomy reactive autonomy such as collective flight real-time collision avoidance war following and corridor centering relies on telecommunication and situational awareness provided by range senses optic flow Nadal's light radars radar sonar most range senses analyze electromagnetic radiation reflected off the environment and coming to the sensor the cameras for visual flow act as simple receivers Nadal's radars and so nails with sound mechanical waves emit and receive waves measuring the round-trip transit time UAV cameras do not require emitting power reducing total consumption radars and so nails are mostly used for military applications reactive autonomy has in some forms already reached consumer markets it may be widely available in less than a decade topic simultaneous localization and mapping slam combines odometry and external data to represent the world and the position of the UAV in it in three dimensions high-altitude outdoor navigation does not require large vertical fields of view and can rely on GPS coordinates which makes it simple mapping rather than slam to related research fields of photogrammetry and Ladakh especially in low altitude and indoor 3d environments indoor photogrammetric in stereo photogrammetric slam has been demonstrated with quadcopters ludar platforms with heavy costly and jumbled traditional laser platforms our proven research attempts to address production cost 2d to 3d expansion power to range ratio weight and dimensions LED range finding applications are commercialized for low distance sensing capabilities research investigates hybridization between light emission and computing power phased array spatial light modulator z' and frequency modulated continuous wave FM CW MEMS tunable vertical cavity surface emitting lasers VCSEL z' topic swarming robots warming refers to networks of agents able to dynamically reconfigure as elements leave or enter the network they provide greater flexibility than multi agent cooperation swarming may open the path to data fusion some bio-inspired flight swarms use steering behaviors and flocking topic future military potential in the military sector American predators and Reapers are made for counterterrorism operations and in war zones in which the enemy lacks sufficient firepower to shoot him down they are not designed to withstand anti-aircraft defenses or air-to-air combat in September 2013 the chief of the u.s. Air Combat Command stated that current UAVs were useless in a contested environment unless manned aircraft were there to protect him 167 the 2012 Congressional Research Service CRS reports speculated that in the future UAVs may be able to perform tasks beyond intelligence surveillance reconnaissance and strikes the CRS report listed air-to-air combat a more difficult future tasks as possible future undertakings 168 the Department of Defense's unmanned systems integrated roadmap fy2013 - 2038 foresees a more important place for UAVs in combat 169 issues include extended capabilities human

relatively new compared to the military one companies are emerging in both developed and developing nations at the same time many early-stage startups have received support and funding from investors like in United States and by government agencies is the case in India some universities offer research and training programs or degrees private entities also provide online and in-person training programs for both recreational and commercial UAV use consumer drones are also widely used by military organizations worldwide because of the cost-effective nature of consumer product in 2018 Israeli military started to use DJI Mavic and mitrice series of UAV for light reconnaissance mission since the civilian drones are easier to use and have higher reliability DJI drones is also the most widely

include unmanned beetles and other insects research is exploring miniature optic flow sensors called our Seles mimicking the compound insect eyes formed from multiple facets which can transmit data to neuromorphic chips able to treat optic flow as well as light intensity discrepancies topic endurance UAV endurance is not constrained by the physiological capabilities of a human pilot because of the small size low weight low vibration and high power-to-weight ratio Wankel rotary engines are used in many large UAVs their engine rotors cannot cease the engine is not susceptible to shop cooling during descent and it does not require an enriched fuel mixture for cooling at high power these attributes reduce fuel usage increasing range or payload proper drone cooling is essential for long-term drone endurance overheating and subsequent engine failure is the most common cause of drone failure hydrogen fuel cells using hydrogen power may be able to extend the endurance of small UAVs up to several hours micro air vehicles endurance is so far best achieved with flapping wing UAVs followed by planes and multirotors standing last due to lower Reynolds number solar electric UAVs the concept originally championed by the Astro flight sunrise in 1974 have achieved flight times of several weeks solar-powered atmospheric satellites atmos apps designed for operating at altitudes exceeding 20 kilometres 12 miles for 60,000 feet for as long as five years could potentially perform duties more economically and with more versatility than low-earth orbit satellites likely applications include weather monitoring disaster recovery Earth imaging and communications electric UAVs powered by microwave power transmission or laser power beaming or other potential endurance solutions another application for a high endurance UAV would be to stare at a battlefield for a long interval Argus's Gorgon Stare integrated sensor is structure to record events that could then be played backwards to track battlefield activities topic reliability reliability improvements target all aspects of UAV systems using resilience engineering and fault tolerance techniques individual reliability covers robustness of flight controllers to ensure safety without excessive redundancy to minimize cost and weight the site's dynamic assessment of flight envelope allows damage resilient UAVs using nonlinear

control regime topic events you topic safety and security you topic air traffic UAVs can threaten airspace security in numerous ways including unintentional collisions or other interference with other aircraft deliberate attacks or by distracting pilots or flight controllers the first incident of a drone airplane collision occurred in mid-october 2017 in Quebec City Canada the first recorded instance of a drone collision with a hot air balloon occurred on the 10th of August 2018 in Driggs Idaho United States although there was no significant damage to the balloon nor any injuries to its

events UAVs flying into or near airports shutting them down for long periods of time topic malicious use UAVs could be loaded with dangerous payloads and crashed into vulnerable targets payloads could include explosives chemical radiology allure biological hazards UAVs with generally non-lethal payloads could possibly be hacked and put to malicious purposes anti UAV systems are being developed by States to counter this threat this is however proving difficult as dr. Jay Rogers stated in an interview to A&T there is a big debate out there at the moment about what the best way is to counter these small UAVs whether they are used by hobbyists causing a bit of a nuisance or in a more sinister manner by a terrorist actor by 2017 drones were being used to drop contraband into prisons drones caused significant disruption at Gatwick Airport during December 2018 needing the deployment of the British Army topic counter unmanned air system the malicious use of UAVs has led to the development of counter unmanned air system see UAS technologies such as the Raphael drone dome and the Raytheon coyote anti-aircraft missile systems such as the Iron Dome also being enhanced with C UAS technologies topic security vulnerabilities the interest in UAVs cybersecurity has been raised greatly after the predator UAV video stream hijacking incident in 2009 where Islamic militants used cheap off-the-shelf equipment to stream video feeds from a UAV another risk is the possibility of hijacking or jamming a UAV in flight several security researchers have made public some vulnerabilities in commercial UAVs in some cases even providing full source code or tools to reproduce their attacks at a workshop on UAVs and privacy in October 2016 researchers from the Federal Trade Commission showed they were able to hack into three different consumer quadcopters and noted that UAV manufacturers can make the UAVs more secure by the basic security measures of encrypting the Wi-Fi signal and adding password protection topic wildfires in the United States flying close to a wildfire is punishable by a maximum $25,000 fine nonetheless in 2014 and 2015 firefighting air support in California was hindered on several occasions including at the Lake Fire in the
