 (soft upbeat music) - The future of computing is going to blow you away. My background is in gameplay programming. So the first things that I think about are things like artificial intelligence. In the past, it's been limited by the power of the CPU in particular. The future of compute on the GPU side; the things I'm really excited about are real-time ray tracing and global illumination. This really is a generational leap. As a developer, we really want to push the boundaries of technology. We wanna be on the cutting edge, and Intel with their hardware they're developing, they're on the cutting edge. Really, it's been a great partnership, and we look forward to where that's going in the future. We look forward to all of the cool CPU and GPU technology that they have coming down the pipeline. As we've gotten to work with Intel recently on some of the projects that we're working on, it's been really great to see how that collaboration has really benefited Intel and us.
