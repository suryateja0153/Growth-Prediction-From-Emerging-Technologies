 an executive at Nvidia recently announced that he thought he would have fully autonomous cars in four years fully autonomous cars are what we call level 5 cars and the cars we have today are operating at about level 3 Elon Musk says Tesla will have level 5 cars soon Scott Miller who heads up General Motors autonomous vehicle integration said quote musk is full of crap isn't it interesting that even at this late stage we don't know when a level 5 car will be made is it one year or four years or 10 years part of the challenge is how perfect does it have to be does it simply have to be safer than a human driver for instance right now human drivers killed 40,000 people a year what if self-driving cars came along and only killed 20,000 people I think they would still be regarded as a mechanical menace and for self-driving cars to really take hold they're going to have to be vastly better than human drivers if you're interested in artificial intelligence visit gingham or check out my new book the fourth age smart robots conscious computers and the future of humanity
