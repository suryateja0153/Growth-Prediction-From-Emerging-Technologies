 Hello, I've got the latest news on the driving test from the DVSA. This is breaking news; it's just happened at 5:00 p.m. on April the 30th 2020 and have they been watching my videos? Because this news is actually something that I suggested in one of my videos the other day. So what is it? Well, there's a big change now to the driving test; if you commit a serious fault on your driving test, or if you get 16 driver faults which are more commonly known as minors, the test will now be stopped immediately. Now I mentioned this the other day in my video and I asked whether it would be a good idea to stop tests because of the moment of course, examiner's don't want to be in a car with anyone for longer than is necessary. So if you get a serious fault or 16 smaller faults, what will happen now is the examiner will ask you to drive back to the test centre and end the test early. So I did say that the other day in one of my videos. Maybe someone at the DVSA has been watching my videos! I know the examiners do. I don't know if someone higher up maybe saw that and thought it would be a good idea. Maybe it's just coincidence.
