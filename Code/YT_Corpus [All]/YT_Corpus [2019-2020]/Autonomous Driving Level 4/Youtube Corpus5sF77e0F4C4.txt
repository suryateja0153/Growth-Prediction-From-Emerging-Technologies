 trucking is a safety critical job but it's a it's a critical job period so many folks take for granted everything that we have we get up we go get milk we go get bread we go get our nice clothes whatever it may be it didn't just show up in the store somebody had to get it there i spent the last 12 years as a police officer and deputy sheriff spent a lot of times working with the community responding to various calls for assistance working crashes and things out on multiple different types of roadways there's always that case that it's always that case sticks with you anytime i go through a certain part of roanoke i'll drive by and i'll go i remember when that lady didn't make it try not to spend a lot of time thinking about those times but uh it has happened um and it's that's one of the things to me that that really drew me to torque and really made me embrace what we're doing here one of the things i found is to be able to take that experience that i have and it's actually welcomed experience to be able to relay that to the testing team and to try to move forward with making changes my responsibility is to be behind the wheel at all times in the event there's any emergency so that i can take over for safety purposes at any point while the vehicle is out on the roadway when we're testing we need to be laser focused because obviously the safety for everyone not only in the vehicle but everyone around us is paramount [Music] it's very very critical that that there are the best drivers that are operating the vehicles and we need those best drivers to be a part of the team that we're building by being able to have a role to play in that input at such a ground level it's just very important to me to be able to bring that and know that long after we're gone we're still delivering a product that is able to save lives down the road
