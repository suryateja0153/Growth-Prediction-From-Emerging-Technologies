 [Music] many people think that the catalyst to an economic singularity with artificial intelligence is the self-driving truck the thesis is that there are 3.5 million truck drivers and 6.8 million support jobs that to one degree or another live off the truck drivers so this is a big part of the economy but I don't think this is actually a tipping point I don't think the changeover to self-driving trucks will happen all that quickly first the technology has to be ironed out then it has to overcome the regulatory hurdles then the lawyers will get involved for every accident with the driverless car at the helm is an opportunity to sue a multi-billion dollar corporation instead of a middle-income truck driver every programming decision whether the car veers into a tree to avoid a dog in the road or chooses to run off a cliff instead of hitting a pedestrian will be the subject of legal discovery many a programmer will be subpoenaed during this time then of course there will be the social acceptance of autonomous trucks and then we have to retrofit existing hardware all of that will happen but even then you still need somebody to walk the FedEx box from the truck to the porch until you make a robot that can leave an allegedly scrawled post-it note on somebody's front door you don't really have an Indian solution all of these steps will happen you will see all kinds of new jobs created additionally during that time some truck drivers are going to retire and other people would think long and hard about entering the truck trading profession and finally for what it's worth the 6.8 million support jobs includes gas stations and auto repair and insurance agents all of which the self-driving trucks will need as well like I said undoubtedly it's all going to happen I just think it's going to be a bit more gradual my guess is that you will just live to see self-driving cars accepted you will have to see natural driving outlawed I think wasn't ever really a good idea to have a 16 year old propel 4,000 pounds of metal down the highway at 70 miles an hour the truest thing you can say about self-driving cars is that they will eventually save hundreds of thousands of lives every year if you're interested in artificial intelligence visit kagome calm or check out my new ball the fourth age smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity
