 Truck drivers are a strange breed. You get some that are willing to for change - willing for an upgrade. And you can see it will the different truckers that are out there. A lot of people like to go forward. Technology is moving forward. That I something I want to be a part of. Even though the truck may be in robotic, we're still watching it - we're still controlling it. We're there to make sure nothing bad is going to happen. I've seen trucks, the damage they can do, not only to other vehicles but to the occupant of the truck itself. And it's just bad. I feel better with a truck that will tell me if I'm departing from my lane. You have rumble strips on the road that make noise, but if you're fatigued and tired, it may be too late. These trucks will beep at you and alert you and do all these kinds of things to let you know. I've lost some friends because things happen, and it is just... As I say, I want to go back to the technology part of it and say I'd just like things to get better. Before we leave and we come back, we're doing pre-trips and post-trips on the truck and the trailer. It's not just me - it's everybody. I make sure that the truck's operational. I make sure there is nothing wrong with it. I mean, if I see a leaky spot, if I see oil on the tire, if I see anything that is wrong with it - a nail in the tire - what have you, I'm going to call it out. And they're going to stop and we're going to get it fixed before we do anything. I like to be part of something. And it is just something I want to see later on you say... as time goes on, my grandkids will say "my grandpa drove that truck that drives by itself. He started that." And that kind of excites me.
