 [Music] it always warms my heart every single time they say this makes me feel just like when I was at my grandmother's house ultimately for me it's about expressing love to people in the way of baking it's not a big thing it's not overly complicated it's really just about like where's your heart I'm Devon banks I reside in Pasadena California and I'm the proud owner of butter bakery I've owned a business before but it has nothing to do with baking at all the challenge was that you have to have a job obviously so you can take care of your children and have a roof over your head and blah blah blah but I needed something for me like I needed to be full I baked a lot but I don't really think of it as a business per se not at first I just thought I love this so much and all I want to do is make every single day it wasn't a thing of oh I'm just gonna open a bakery business I don't think about that at all I didn't feel like that was where I was drawn to or that this is the business that I should go into or any of those things it was more about oh this isn't something I think is fun this is something that I love to do anyway and it wasn't until I saw that people really liked the things that I made from a perspective of oh I'll pay for it butter bakery is the taste of warm chocolate chip cookies it's delectable butter pound cakes it's warm even peach cobbler and ice cream it's all the things that you have in the comfort of being at your grandma's house that's who we are that's what we do as much as I would I look I would love I would love very much to have a brick-and-mortar but it's a little challenging trying to find an actual space for the business very much online presence currently we're not operating in one set place it's either commercial kitchens I've even used schools I've used Church kitchens my own kitchen it's just I'm all over the place right now just getting it done making things work so the challenge in that is having to take everything you have everywhere you go so you have just lots of stuff to lug every single day I just kind of feel like people don't really respect your business if they don't see it in an actual building people tend to not take you seriously so they think gee just this is a hobby and it's really not baking is something that I love and I love every day that I wake up is before the Sun gets that regardless of what things come my way none that really matters to me because I love what I do and I'm super passionate about it every single day no matter what that looks like and even if it seems to other people like it's a challenge or that it's frustrating or what have you nothing in me nothing outside of me makes me feel like oh I don't want to do this anymore because every day this is all I want to do I just want to get up and I want to bake and I want to do what I do and that's it so there is no real challenge if you will not for me not to me so right now I'm waiting waiting for a building I've already like submitted a letter of intent and so hopefully they'll come back to me before the new year and I don't know if I should say that because of the timing but so it's been about a month since and from that point till now the property management company reached out and offered me the building so I'm super excited that butter bakery will now have its own space from a personal level all of this is surreal it doesn't even seem like a reality for butter bakery though it feels like it's supposed to be when I started butter bakery I had a five-pound bag of sugar a five-pound bag of flour I had a pack of butter and I thought this five-pound bag of sugar right here will eventually become 5,000 pounds if there's something that you love it's something that's way on the inside it doesn't matter what people think it doesn't matter when people say it doesn't matter what people make you feel like even in that moment if you love it enough do it don't allow your drive and your passion and your love for something to go to the grave with you don't go there with regret and leave it for everybody else that's why you have it all of these things are deposited in us for the benefit of everybody around us I would like to be able to like touch people I would like to be able to like touch them in their heart with just the little thing that I do and to me they seem small this is what I do every day but sometimes that's all that matters sometimes that's all that really is needed like sometimes people just need cookies those cookies are good inevitably I know that working as hard as I do that I will get the things that I want from this so that's why I keep doing it I'm davana Banks the proud owner of butter bakery where things are always homemade from scratch oh yes you
