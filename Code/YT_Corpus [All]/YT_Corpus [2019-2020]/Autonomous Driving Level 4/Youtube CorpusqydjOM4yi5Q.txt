 the hallucinogenic drug known as LSD is making a comeback but only in very small doses the effects are barely perceptible still many users report a positive experience you just feel a little bit happier you feel a little bit lighter you feel a little bit more open you have a little bit more energy you're a little more cognitive like on top of things LSD has helped some people to deal effectively with psychological problems virgins are nestled esteem and liberal attitude in fact I believe that LSD saved my life it gave me hope again Vidar flourished many users say that LSD has allowed them to rediscover themselves but this process can sometimes produce strong emotions I feel this hand grabbed me and it's my younger self it's the it's the very person I saw when I looked in the mirror as a child and he said O'Keefe that I've been looking for you this whole time but the use of psychedelic substances can also end in tragedy for a number of different reasons does Steve you don't know where these drugs came from look what they're made of or how much you're taking style in versus industry walk for Vic she's often diabolical drug or miracle cure is it simply a matter of dosage in a kitchen somewhere in Berlin this young man is preparing ice cubes that are laced with LSD I put in two drops of liquid LSD 12 micrograms per cube that's the pleasant micro doses we've agreed not to use the man's real name we'll call him Ben Oh in higher doses LSD can cause hallucinations but Ben Oh is using just 12 micrograms per cube a fraction of the amount that some people use to get high for several hours that's not the sort of trip he's looking for Ben oh says that a micro dose of LSD will produce an enjoyable experience I feel more awake my mind is clearer I'm more focused and my overall performance improves some positive paranoid benno ignores the fact that the possession of LSD is illegal in Germany he buys his drugs from a dealer he consumes about 10 euros worth per month like many other people who micro dose he uses LSD for just a few weeks and then takes a break for several months he's confident that he won't become addicted the my snorted into a person most people who end up hooked are looking for an escape they want to feel numb or to get a euphoric high for a while that's not what I want and I wouldn't get it anyway with such a small dose I saw this with Nintendo after three quarters of an hour sometimes up to two hours benno experiences a change in his consciousness you start feeling really good more like yourself you feel rested and motivational like you're having a great day just Google Talk we'll talk to benno later to find out how he's doing for this film we interviewed several other people who micro dose they all know that using LSD is illegal that's why we've agreed not to show their faces by this disaster Martha the first time I tried it I noticed a very subtle effect after half an hour things were a little more intense and that was my focus yeah if I constantly attack as a family uses an absolutism it was a groundbreaking experience and a turning point in my life for me micro dosing is like taking medicine uten Pharma didn't seem Gant's was on on days what I'm expected to do a lot of work it really helps me to focus when the micro goes on a micro dose I feel like I'm switched on the whole day goosed LSD was created in 1938 by Albert Hofmann a Swiss scientist who was trying to develop a respiratory and circulatory stimulant Hoffman worked with substances that included a grain fungus called ergot he was the first to synthesize lysergic acid diethylamide or LSD for short in April 1943 Hofmann tested a high dose of 250 micrograms and experienced the first LSD trip in history later the pharmaceutical company Sandoz his employer marketed the drug under the trade name della CID and claimed it could successfully treat a number of psychiatric problems in the 1960's LSD found its way from the laboratory to the street a German news program reported on the drugs rise in 1966 didn't enough anyone who takes LSD becomes intoxicated and we'll never see life the same way again opens evening benno certainly doesn't feel intoxicated right now he's in a good mood a micro dose of LSD has become part of his everyday life he uses the drug at work and during his free time I don't feel high at all oh I hardly noticed the effects yes but it's just kind of there but it's a good feeling cause if you drive the Nishikado harbour it's sort of like the way you feel when you come back from vacation you're relaxed and you can still ignore the stress of everyday life you know in Japan alone benno started micro dosing five years ago his goal self-realization and personal optimization he says LSD makes it easier for him to set priorities and carry out tasks he believes the drug can help him stay focused when he's stressed out for example when I'm in a new situation and I'm afraid I can't handle it LSD helps me to concentrate I feel better and have more confidence to do this but it's a fine line between personal optimization and loss of control large doses of LSD can cause paranoia anxiety and impaired judgment benno is unfazed micro dosing as a phenomenon originated in San Francisco and Silicon Valley where it's viewed as an insider's tip to enhance performance and creativity Paul Austin has become something of a micro dosing guru he's the founder and CEO of an organization that advocates the use of psychedelics as a means of personal development and collective well-being I'd say I'm on a mission yeah to educate people about like the benefits and the potential risks of not only micro dosing but generally like psychedelics more than anything I'm a teacher I teach people about micro dose and I teach people generally about psychedelics and I'd like to like approach them in terms of where they're at and just help guide them further along in terms of you know what they need to learn about these substances Austin's organization is called the third wave a reference to the use of psychedelics over centuries he organizes seminars and online courses to educate people about the responsible use of these drugs these events attract people who care and who want to learn more and who want to be part of something it's very rare that you'll have someone who comes to these events who is anti psychedelics or anti micro dosing so that energy here is like it's thyself because it's usually very positive and supportive and like open and curious and that's it's just refreshing compared to most people most places so one question I want to start with as they everyone here done psychedelics Austin doesn't need to win anyone over most are here to find out more about these drugs and about micro dosing but he warns that buying LSD in the US and many other Western countries is illegal it's usually best practice not to try to get drugs at an event like this so although we have a psychedelic website and we are putting on event this is not a great place to actively pursue that this is a great place to build connections and build relationships but attitudes are changing for example the possession of psilocybin mushrooms has been decriminalized in several US cities more and more people seem to be trying these drugs you have people from every walk of life who are micro dosing from college students in the Midwest to stay-at-home moms in California to tech executives in New York to people who are retired who you know live on farms and New Zealand you literally have people from all walks of life who are becoming interested in this it's not just limited to tech executives in Silicon Valley who are micro dosing with LSD Austin is convinced that legal restrictions on the sale and possession of LSD in the US will eventually be lifted he won't have to worry about being arrested when he uses it Austin has soaked a small shred of cardboard with a liquid micro dose of the drug he's not too concerned about administering an exact amount when I'm mic reducing I don't worry about that as much because I've been doing acid now for nine years and so I tend to have a pretty good fit if it's a little bit too less or a little bit too much I can handle it and kind of go with it and just go with the flow after Austin has taken a dose of LSD he enjoys walking around outside in the forest or at the seashore the effects of the drug with this amount are mild but Pleasant I feel good I feel like euphoric I feel just my sense of touch my sense of smell everything's a little bit high and more sensitive to like everything that's going on around me so yeah I feel great I feel really good in the u.s. the use of LSD has become popular among a well educated and professionally successful demographic this is the group that Paul Austin is targeting with his business model and his public information campaign the drugs that I've chosen to use happen to be highly illegal and not yet and that's a keyword they're not yet accepted culturally but they will be very soon and I just happen to be one of the pioneers who's talking about this in a more public way Austin is always on the lookout for new investors he earns money from online courses which started $49 each and personalized coaching sessions at just under $400 per half-hour I want to welcome you to the first video that we're doing for the third way of micro dosing course and community I'm your instructor Paul Austin his goal is to legitimize the responsible use of psychedelic substances starting with Mike reducing so the best way to calibrate your dose level is to start low and go slow he's in a legal gray area the thing with the third wave is you know we don't sell drugs we only sell information so we're just creating the space so that people if they make that decision to do it they can do it safely and effectively but in terms of actually crossing any sort of legal issue we're very careful about you know what we do because psychedelics still you know are very legal in most countries in 2011 psychologist and researcher James Fadiman published a book which claimed that ultra low doses of psychedelic drugs can improve cognitive functioning emotional balance and physical stamina I have called the godfather of micro dosing which is more amusing and embarrassing I would say that I rediscovered micro dosing through more mistakes than wisdom but in discovering it I found something that people found generally safe and for many people useful Fadiman began his research on these substances in the 1960s he says that the purpose of micro dosing is not mind-bending intoxication but the enhancement of normal functionality micro dosing is far and away the most boring form of consuming psychedelics no visions no angels no being eaten by snakes no seeing all of your relatives for 15 generations no becoming one with all humanity and with all matter and finding that you were part of divinity none of that in the mid-1960s San Francisco became the epicenter of the countercultural movement the use of illegal drugs was widespread in 1967 tens of thousands of young people flocked to the city to experience the Summer of Love many had their first acid trip here the movement in the 60s wanted to create a counterculture they wanted to create something that was opposite of mainstream culture whereas today we want to integrate psychedelics into mainstream culture to actually transform culture itself many young people taking LSD felt liberated from social constraints but for some the use of hallucinogens ended in bad trips and overdoses the u.s. banned LSD in 1970 and a UN treaty that outlawed psychotropic substances was approved a year later high doses are different world and are scary and take preparation and take a full day out of your busy life micro dosing is something that you do as part of your life it doesn't interfere it actually improves your normal behavior but there is no conclusive clinical evidence to support Fatima's claims he recommends that a micro dose should be taken only once every three days so that the body doesn't develop a tolerance for the drug Fadiman has conducted a survey on his website in which he asks micro dosers to comment on their use of psychedelics most of the 1,600 responses were positive but how credible are these testimonials it sounds like a wonder drug as long as you're thinking of it as a pharmaceutical because how can something both be interesting for migraines for depression and change people's eating habits so they eat healthier that makes no sense at all from a pharmaceutical point of view so what we're seeing is micro dosing seems to increase the body's natural healing capacity the German micro dosers we interviewed would agree with that assessment jovan mentioned tag on some days I feel like I've been given a superpower plan it's like a small tool that gives you huge energy it gives me creative insights and abilities that I wouldn't normally have my my textbook was signage hittin a button when I'm at work it definitely helps me to concentrate I'm wide awake and more focused on theater Mike Eruzione allows me to focus more quickly and ignore all the stuff that's not important it really helps me to concentrate have never considered soon this person hold this DC guns Kleinert finer and spun on it gives me a very subtle sense of relaxation micro dosing allows me to get in touch with myself my body and my feelings I'm calm I'm furious but is there scientific evidence to support such claims or are these people simply imagining that a micro dose of LSD improves their performance we travel to the Netherlands to find out more at the University of Maastricht we meet johannes rama cares a professor of psychopharmacology he's conducting one of the first lab based studies on micro dosing nobody has actually been able to assess whether this claim is true or false right now we're just being presented with case reports of individuals that support the claim but objective evidence of whether such a tiny dose because it really is a tiny dose really has a positive effect has not been established ROM occurs gave the test participants five ten or twenty micrograms of LSD he wanted to determine the short-term effects that the various doses would have so far he believes that small amounts posed no serious risks in general psychedelics are relatively harmless in the sense that I do not produce any toxic effects on physiological parameters or health health outcome params so in that respect they are really safe the but at the same time at subside Alec that plays around with your mind and that's where the potential risks can be found but this is particularly true for when people use high doses open your mouth and it is poured into cheek and the participants were given either LSD or a placebo and were then tested over a 24-hour period ramicus and his team showed how the micro dose has affected the subjects mood creativity concentration and general sensitivity the smallest dose produced no effects but the researchers noticed a change at ten micrograms participants reported a small increase in their moods a particularly positive mood and even though this increase was not very big and she would not expect also for micro dose it was very consistent and it occurred directly after the intake of the micro dose and it lasted for as long as the drug is actually active so for a number of about 10 hours or so the study found that the micro dose helped the participants to concentrate better but it did not make them more creative these results are only preliminary and further research will be required also rum occurs wants to find out how micro dosing would affect test subjects over a period of several weeks but he advises that the results will probably show that micro dosing is not a miracle cure as some have claimed you can't expect that a mic could also convert you into the next Nobel Prize winner mica dose is not a one of those and the changes that it produce by definition will be mild so a person that is not creative will not become creative but some micro doses are not interested in improving their performance productivity or creativity they use LSD to treat depression Julian is studying for his doctorate degree in chemistry Julian has battled severe depression for seven years one analyst tea without LSD I probably wouldn't be here right now LSD saved my life it helps to restore my sense of hope after four or five years of despair - fian often occurred yulian tried everything to combat his depression including psychotherapy alternative medicine hypnosis and antidepressants but nothing worked and he was desperate to find a solution spa dozen zips inverter sweetsie - 2017 was the worst for his dismay oh I thought seriously several times about suicide and just giving up this eternal struggle and find for me I gave him one Suzanne I asked myself what I was getting out of life is definitely and and the answer was nothing on infinite Oscar food then you lee undiscovered psychedelics some friends and the netherlands introduced him to truffles laced with LSD and for the first time in years he felt better later he found that micro dosing helped to relieve his depression symptoms in the fossil specifically hard work I don't do some really tough time there were days when I didn't even get out of bed I had no motivation at all does micro dosing but micro dosing gave me new hope it showed me that life really was worth living and helped me to start enjoying things again I was much more aware of my surroundings and I was able to get in touch with them Julien spoke to his psychologist about micro dosing but she couldn't prescribe LSD therapy because the drug is illegal in Germany in Switzerland where LSD was discovered 80 years ago scientists are studying whether the drug can be used effectively to treat depression at the psychiatric university hospital in Zurich researchers are studying the effects that this drug has on the human body test participants are given a full dose of LSD not a micro dose and the medical staff monitors their reactions they've found that the drug changes more than sensory perceptions as even if and oldest among innovation we've observed changes in mood emotional perception and self perception the participants have more empathy they also experience less social anxiety that is they don't feel like they're being ostracized and eager for and then mention oh gosh Lawson some bias beer after the test subjects ingest a dose of LSD they undergo an MRI brain scan analysis of these scans indicates that the drug changes communication patterns among various regions of the brain including activity and networking in areas where such exchanges rarely take place LSD seems to affect the way we think and our emotions and self perceptions the results indicate for example that these drugs can be used to treat depression many people who suffer from mental disorders simply withdraw from society it's essential to bring them back into a social environment and we hope that psychedelic drugs can help in that process the concept of using LSD to help treat mental illness is not new but these days the idea is getting a lot of attention from researchers Katrine brother and psychiatrist funds full inviter are now studying how hallucinogens particularly psilocybin could be used to treat depression both Monheit devices that the siffredi cannot we have learned something new called it's a luminary studies indicate that one or two doses of saw Simon can over a period of three to six months she helped to reduce depression symptoms by b61 Arthur Debra thief is symptomatic at CERN in a recent study 60 patients who suffer from intermediate level depression took part in a study on the effects of psilocybin 30 test subjects were actually given the drug the others a placebo their reactions were constantly monitored by a therapist in case the psilocybin brought back traumatic memories the participants were a sleep mask and listened to relaxing music to help them concentrate on the experience the earth metals disease of stands and I hope that this will help the patients to escape at least for a while this downward spiral of emotions and negative self-assessment we can help to reduce their depressions on items over the long term even d/deaf resumes informal and fuzzy arts begin this would be a major step forward in depression therapy only 7 sessions are involved three four preliminary discussions one for the actual ingestion of the drug and three for debriefing the results seem promising an Academy of calm depth is one of the main effects of psychedelics is that they blur one's perception of the external environment from thoughtful there's a loss of the sense of self command of inhibitions and this allows people to interact more effectively with others of course it all depends on the dosage the systole is a panic but the researchers warned that it could be dangerous for people to take a full dose of psilocybin or LSD without proper preparation and medical supervision it's browsed Naha this treatment is complicated and it involves therapy before and after the drug is taken patients have to go through the entire process otherwise they'll just have a single pleasant experience that will mean little antennae partition process but yulian did not have access to this kind of therapy he decided to treat his depression symptoms with LSD without medical supervision his girlfriend Nayla has been with him through good times in bed she has doubts about whether micro dosing will help a long-term I have to trust him when he says that he knows what he's doing but he's been suffering from serious depression and it's often got out of hand so I'm still worried about him but I also see that the drugs seem to help him he feels better now and I'd really missed seeing him happy for house an infamous table english julian has now stopped micro dosing he feels better today than at any time since his symptoms first appeared he's glad that he used psychedelics but he also realizes that he was taking a risk in surviving these drugs have a huge potential but they can also be dangerous so they're not for everyone dominus inviting him I wouldn't recommend self-medicating with LSD for everybody I really prepared myself before I started using alpha but I did medical experts point out that taking LSD without proper supervision can make existing psychological problems even worse is micro dancing can be a real problem if people do it on their own but at this point we don't know enough about the effects to be able to properly assess the risks Vitas goofy le so we strongly advise against people using psychedelic drugs to treat themselves and far as Memphians feared as we've said LSD and psilocybin are still illegal in most countries but a number of alternative therapists have been experimenting with these and other hallucinogens anyway in 2015 in the town of Honda low near Hamburg nearly 30 people were hospitalized after they ingested a drug called 2c e which is similar to LSD they had been attending a seminar on how to expand their consciousness and were given the drug by the therapists to organize the event thus SD these substances have a dark side there's always the potential for abuse in this bout what's more than you don't know where these drugs came from what they're made of or how much you're taking the therapists often have no idea either this is off I'll finish Waseda English on men but some medical experts believe that LSD could be used in certain kinds of therapy the topic was discussed at a recent conference in Berlin one of their participants dr. Gerhard Grunder plans to launch a clinical study on the possible therapeutic use of hallucinogens concerns and definitive cook it's definitely time to re-evaluate the status of psychedelics if people use substances that are pharmacologically pure administered in specific doses by experienced therapists and are given appropriate preparation and follow-up we can substantially reduce the risks I don't love it a solution one finished maqam one of those who believes that LSD can play a role in medical treatment is the berlin-based researcher henrik young Avella he heads an organization that promotes the study of psychedelic drugs unless the yield up to the subpoenas for now the medical benefits are limited to the treatment of depression and anxiety the preliminary data suggests these drugs could also be used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism don't echo whole isthmus this light machine can mimic the effects of psychedelic drugs some who have used it report that the experience enhances their sense of well-being for decades research into LSD was ridiculed but now that's changing young Avila says that it's time for government regulators and ethics committees to take a second look at the drug because there are drugs out that are supposed to be Wonder drugs hope based on the drugs and actually how can we how can we respond to these beliefs and to these hopes by showing people if they were one person convinced that LSD works is in the audience Julian has travelled to Berlin to attend the conference and share his experiences with the experts this is a finished us estimate this is the first time that I've had the chance to meet people who are actually doing research in this field O'Malley India I'm really looking forward to learning from them the goal is to regulate LSD for therapeutic purposes but some here believe it should be legalized so anyone can take a trip by Moses Tony samehada unzips a lot of people are looking for a new spiritual experience for whatever reason and they shouldn't have to go to a shaman or self-proclaimed therapist to get their drugs I believe that we should take LSD off the illegal underground market and provide a safe and professional environment for those who want to use it for self exploration which is explore Hudson atonium could demand for chemically induced self exploration is nothing new and the Netherlands is one of the few countries where it can be indulged in publicly truffles laced with psilocybin are legal and sold openly the effects of psilocybin are similar to those of LSD this is the synthesis retreat near Amsterdam a privately run facility that gives its customers the opportunity to experiment with psychedelic drugs in a medically supervised environment keith is a 49 year old doctor from the US this is his second stay here I want to reconnect with my younger self that that person who was not jaded by life who was not guarded by disappointment who had not adapted to the circumstances in a way that had changed the underlying person which I felt my life had done so the difference between many of these people are going to try psychedelic drugs for the first time the staff provides an extensive preparation program we want to create this safe space and container that will allow you to surrender fully into the experience so that you can go as deeply as possible into the experience trust in the truffles that they know exactly what you need and they're going to help you have the experience that you're supposed to have most of the clients come from Europe and the u.s. a three days day costs about two thousand euros the company's director of business development miles Katz explains the renewed interest in the use of psychedelic drugs we live in a world that's like highly digitalized and so we're always looking at screens and you know our societal norms for work-life balance aren't really healthy and so people really feel themselves going through the motions of things but not really living a fulfilling life or to their full potential they're really feeling connected to anything at all and that's often one of the most powerful outcomes from these experiences people just feel this immense sense of connection to themselves again to the natural world to the other people in the group that they share these experiences with we weren't allowed to film the clients actually experiencing a psychedelic trip but we did watch the staff prepare the drugs after the clients have consumed a psilocybin truffle they lie down and wait for the hallucinogen to take effect an average experience lasts up to eight hours a nurse is present at all times but not a qualified drug therapist the next day Keith tells us how it went he saw no bright colors or mythical creatures but he did encounter his younger self I started walking down this hallway and I feel this I'm gonna cry because I always do with this stupid thing I feel his hand grabbed me and it's my younger self it's the it's the very person I saw when I looked in the mirror as a child and he said Oh Keith I've been looking for you this whole time where have you been the shift between me being a responsible adults trying to make this connection for my own health and then seeing what to my mind was absolutely me looking up to me saying I've been looking for you this whole time it was just so profound staff members later interview the clients about their experience miles Katz says that synthesis has developed a profitable business model and the company hopes to expand it looking out 20-30 years into the future as legislation change maybe every major city will have one or two synthesis type centers where people are going on a regular basis maybe every six months or every 12 months to go have these experiences where they can kind of reconnect reset check in with themselves Katz has helped to develop one of the world's first facilities where psychedelic drugs can be consumed legally and safely the German micro dosers we spoke to earlier say that LSD has become part of their daily lives yeah Dilek yes it definitely has my consciousness has been liberated and I won't let anyone take that away from me and others should have that freedom as well so decision if I disposed sense namely listen I don't really care what people say these drugs help me the big question is what will happen if I don't take them as finishes knees name the future mayor of Clairol public needs to be informed of the benefits of these drugs and they need to be legalized so everyone can choose whether they want to take them in Canoga that's marked with only Brno has experimented with LSD in both large and small doses so far he's pleased with the results we get sued well I'm doing fine and it's a good feeling but they've also been times in my life when I wasn't doing so well I hadn't discovered micro dosing yet and now I'm grateful that I have done better benno says he's not addicted to the drugs and could stop at any time so why doesn't he I simply noticed that when I use them I feel better I'm sure it's possible to experience the same journey that you take on micro dosing without using drugs one was up sponson but it's quite possibly a harder road to travel like villa you
