 [Music] well welcome everyone uh i'm ed niedermeyer i am one of the co-hosts of the atonicast um and i'm also the communications director for partners for automated vehicle education uh as well as the author of ludicrous the unvarnished story of tesla motors if we're going into all of the uh the job titles but um i'm here today uh uh i'm really excited about this because um i'm i get the chance to talk to uh uh two folks who are really at the forefront of exciting things in the autonomous vehicle space um and that are uh carl yanyema the ceo of motional and laura major the cto of motional there's so much happening in autonomous vehicles right now even though some of that's been a little bit overshadowed by of course all the other crazy things happening in our world but um you know it occurs to me that that some people might be saying wait a second emotional what's that i've i've heard of carly and yemi i've heard of laura major but what's emotional so let's let's start there what is emotional yeah well in march you know hyundai motor group an aptiv formed former joint venture focused on autonomous driving and uh really excited today to be able to announce the identity of that joint venture as emotional motional's mission is to make driverless vehicles a safe reliable and accessible reality and deploy them in cities around the world um the name you know comes from two parts there's motion which speaks to the products we're developing and our you know forward progress as a business and then emotional you know whether we like it or not today transportation decisions have become emotional decisions uh deciding how you get from point a to point b safely is an emotional decision so rna emotional speaks to that and every product that we develop will have that insight you know at its core right so so really uh it's about the the human piece i think a lot of times people are so focused on the technology of autonomous vehicles that it's easy to lose sight of the fact that this is about people right yeah you know what we're building is not technology for technology's sake it's about putting the rider first ultimately the rider the passenger the users of our technology have to have confidence in the technology or they won't use it yeah and and just to give people a little bit of background too about about active so um the the half of this joint venture that that you come from um how long what is aptiv and and how long have you been working on avs and so what's sort of the background that that sort of built up to this moment yeah i can give a bit of background about both companies hyundai motor company one of the world's foremost automotive oems they build cars that are high quality and cost optimized better than just about anyone else aptiv one of the world's most prominent automotive technology developers so that's the dna emotional you know my background i was leading autonomous mobility development within aptiv before the joint venture uh prior to that started a company called nutonomy one of the first startups in the autonomous driving space and prior to that was at mit for many years you know researching autonomous vehicles before we called them autonomous vehicles they were just robots yeah absolutely and and you know there's a lot of um a lot of partnerships in this space between oems and and um you know technology developers a lot of collaboration going on but this is one of the first big joint ventures and it seems like that sort of separates it potentially from some of the other partnerships that people might hear about sort of what why why make a joint venture and sort of what does that mean how does that differentiate it from potentially other approaches that are out there to these kinds of collaboration well i'll tell you one of the things that we realized uh is that we really needed to have a close relationship with an automotive manufacturer you know when we were purely focused on developing the software um that integration challenge getting the software integrated with the hardware we recognized that was a really significant challenge so the joint venture really came about from the realization of us saying boy if we want to ensure that our technology gets onto vehicles that can be produced at scale we need to go beyond an arm's length relationship with an oem we need to do something you know much closer so the joint venture that's about as close as you can get our equity holders now 50 active and 50 hyundai so 50 oem and 50 technology developer if you will yeah so so as you mentioned you've been there's been a lot of development work going on around avs that you've been involved in for for a long time and leading um and this is sort of a big step to collaborate it seems like that implies that things are coming into focus here that you're starting to to to get closer to um you know getting more of these vehicles out there and and you know building out a business so sort of what is what is the the build up to that on sort of the technical side look like in terms of of where your technology's at what are some of the details that maybe you know in all this this craziness of the last six months or so really uh that people might have not be aware of the progress that's been made that's a great one for laura our cto yeah so emotional really builds on top of the autonomous driving division from aptiv and we're combining active self-driving software expertise with hyundai's you know vehicle engineering and manufacturing expertise combined with the with the capital um and we're doing all that to create a level four uh driverless robo taxi product um and this year you know our fir we're gonna debut our first driverless uh technology and um as well as you announce other key partnerships and new market activities yeah and and you know i think a lot of people again focus so much on the technology that that they may not always understand why it's so important to have that that oem presence the manufacturer be there sort of as you're developing this kind of product so from again a technical perspective why is that so important to have that collaboration between you know the development of the of the software and the hardware but then also the input from the people who who develop and and then make the vehicle yeah as carl mentioned i mean the arms length relationship with the oem just just didn't cut it you know ultimately it needs to be a tight partnership to figure out how we're going to modify the vehicle to be able to enable the av components to to work in a in a way that's sustainable that can you know be done at scale that can ultimately come off of a production line and so it really requires that tight partnership to you know design the entire solution as a system that includes the software the components and the vehicle and so we need to do that you know together in close partnership yeah and and so what so what is this relationship going to be looking like just sort of over the next year or two sort of walk me through a little bit how how this is going to you know move forward and develop well i can speak to the relationship you know we obviously have a very close working relationship with hyundai they're one of our stakeholders um we are today focused uh intensely on getting our autonomous technology integrated with the hyundai vehicle now with all that said we are not in an exclusive partnership with hyundai and obligated to only use hyundai vehicles and by the same token not obligated only to use active componentry sensors and other solutions so moving forward for the jv you know i envision a future where we have multiple partners in the automotive world i think we're seeing many partnerships um struck across the entire av landscape we look forward to continuing you know an aggressive partnership strategy yeah and and so you mentioned the the robo taxi application um sort of you know how do you see that fitting in with with cities and sort of how they're evolving um you know there's all kinds of new mobility options out there autonomous vehicles are one one of those sort of developing options that people are getting excited about sort of how do you see that that fitting in where where where do robo-taxis solve a problem well you know robot taxes will be a transportation choice and of course you know writers will have many other choices we work uh closely with city representatives state representatives in every city that we're active in everywhere we test we want to make sure that we're developing technology number one that our customers want to use but number two that our city partners want to have on their streets but the promise is vast you know significant increases in safety significant increases in transportation efficiency uh and significant improvements to accessibility so our you know city partners understand all those potential benefits and um in the cities that we're in we're there because our city partners want us to be there yeah absolutely and and um obviously i don't want to get you know to be careful not to ask too many specific questions here but uh you know do you is this something that you know can you give us a sense of sort of in the next couple of years what we might be able to see in terms of you know is this going to be a bunch of cities are going to be focused on maybe one or two to start i know you already active as has vehicles already in in las vegas and and elsewhere i think um you know so what can we what can we expect in terms of of sort of the the presence of this and and and sort of the scale of it you know we're one of the only major players in the industry that has a significant international footprint we're obviously focused on north america i'm sitting here in boston today laura's here in boston we've got significant operations in pittsburgh in las vegas you know smaller office in santa monica but we're also in singapore and in seoul and growing there very quickly uh you know as we think about going to market and your question about what cities will be in the future having that broad footprint and that flexibility that comes with it is going to be extremely valuable for us you know i think there's an open question globally as to where autonomous technology will get to market first that question will be answered both by where consumers want the technology where they want those products but also where regulators will allow that technology to go to market to get on the road so with us with motional having a global footprint you know we're going to maintain flexibility and go to market where the best opportunity presents itself yeah and even before those deployments as you said having presences in cities i mean those are some pretty different cities right los angeles and pittsburgh alone but then singapore i mean these are the the makeup of these cities the kinds of traffic uh the driving culture has got to be really different um does having that presence in in lots of different places does that help the technology yeah definitely the diversity of environments you know for testing and development purposes gives us you know sets us up to develop a robust solution that's going to you know be able to translate from one region to another very easily so we see left-handed driving we see right-handed driving we see different kinds of pedestrian behavior um even you know cities as you know as different as los angeles and boston um then you add singapore and seoul you know there's just a wide range of you know more driver-friendly cities more pedestrian-friendly cities and you know having exposure to that collecting data in those environments testing our product in those cities um you know gives us that ability to really see how you know how our you know our solution um in in that very dynamic and diverse setting yeah to follow up on that you know we're developing a global solution one of the things i've focused on from the very beginning is avoiding developing a solution that wouldn't generalize to other cities around the world laura's example of left-hand driving and right-hand driving is a great one every time we do a build of software we know that it can drive both sides of the road and if you think about that from a technical perspective that change may sound simple for us as a human driver but that change of shifting to the other side of the road to drive that could be vastly complex and could break your system if you hadn't designed from day one with that scalability in mind so we're confident you know we'll have the ability to go to market go to market globally and that's not something that um i'm sure all of our competitors can say yeah yeah i know that flexibility is a really interesting and important part of it for exactly those reasons but laura you also said you know this is a level four robo taxi which means that when these things are out there and people can start getting rides in them they will be focused in in certain areas right that's what level four is and and actually if you could maybe just give a little bit more of an explanation about about what level is just to make sure people really understand it and and why that approach uh makes sense in your view yeah so for you know for a first of a kind uh driverless product um we feel like it's important to you know do a lot of testing in in the city you know where we're gonna the cities where we're going to launch and so you know while we are you know designing a solution that can be generalized across many different cities we're going to also step through that deployment you know very carefully so we have high fidelity maps that we that we develop that are on board the vehicle that we use to navigate and guide our you know our decision making um and again we go through a rigorous validation and testing effort in those cities so you know level four is really about you know kind of being able to do all of the driving tasks but being able to really you know kind of focus that in in a particular area for each of your deployments as i've already brought up it feels like way too many times uh you know there is a lot going on this year um and uh specifically with with the the covenant 19 pandemic um it seems to be there's a lot of really interesting discussion in the autonomous vehicle world because in a lot of ways it seems like it's both a challenge but also potentially maybe an opportunity um can you speak to that yeah i can speak to the opportunities you know when when kovitz struck uh i became convinced that um that people would recognize really the value of a driverless experience and the value of being able to take a trip and not necessarily have to share space with someone that you may not know so that was a hypothesis we went out and we asked people we did a survey we talked to over a thousand people in the u.s and what we found is that you know a couple statistics 70 of people we talked to uh said that the risk of infection strongly influenced their transportation decision it became an emotional decision as we talked about earlier 19 almost one in five of the people that we spoke to said that they were more interested in riding in a driverless vehicle today than they were pre pandemic and to me that just underscored you know the importance and the relevance of what we're building so the opportunity to me is is greater than ever but um you know in terms of the challenges of course from a technology development perspective when your team is at home and it's difficult to test uh that does create some complications maybe laura you can speak to some of those yeah certainly some of the challenges you know we can continue with our software development during uh coronavirus from people's homes and make a lot of great progress that way but the the testing on public roads you know became more challenging and we had to come up with innovative solutions to keep our you know our test operators you know safely separated within a confined space of the vehicle um and so we've worked through those issues um and and actually one of the the really interesting things is a lot of times simulation ends up becoming an important already always a fundamentally important part of av development um maybe it's becoming more important now if you could just explain to why simulation is is important anyway and maybe if that's uh its role has changed at all during covet yeah absolutely we depended on simulation much more than we did pre-covid but it's an integral part of av development already because as you're developing software you know every software engineer when they're checking in their code they want a way to quickly test test it in a virtual world and so that's what simulation offers the ability to with without any worries about safety go into this virtual world and try out their their software change and see again evaluate its performance across a wide range of scenarios you can do that very quickly very cheaply in simulation you know in order to get something out onto the road we have to take more steps and there's more rigor around making sure that the performance is is refined and robust enough uh to you know again handle as you know a range of conditions that you can't predict on the public roads so we have to go through close course testing on our tracks and and go through a number of you know repetitive tests again to make sure that it's robust to a wide range of scenarios again in simulation you can quickly try something out and get that feedback you know very rapidly so that's something we use already in our development process but during covid we um we rapidly expanded the number of uh simulation scenarios that we have our vehicle operators actually many of them became trained on how to create scenarios in our our simulation um environment and uh and again we were leveraging that um you know with our incremental builds uh that we were developing before we could do public testing again yeah um and and so uh carl you know you mentioned that people are more um interested in self-driving vehicles since covet 19 has happened um you know and and i think it makes sense especially when you think about things like public transit and and just other things where you're you know stuck with a lot of people inside a confined amount of space um at the same time you know robo taxis are shared vehicles right um and so there's you know this is clearly something that that um you know you'll have to deal with um and again without giving anything away i you know are there technical things that can be done uh to to ensure uh these vehicles uh are safe that it's not a transmission vector uh is basic just fleet management cleaning maintenance type of stuff is that enough um you're going beyond that i don't know to the extent that you can discuss these two it's a great point look even if you're not sharing a trip with uh someone you don't know it may be that you get into a vehicle after someone has just gotten out you know covet has caused us to really redefine safety prior to the pandemic safety meant avoiding crashes now for us safety means not only avoiding crashes but minimizing the risk of infection so to answer your question there's both technical and operational things we can do to ensure that our vehicles are as safe as possible the technical part of it you know will get baked into and is currently getting baked into our product development process and there are methods out there for disinfecting surfaces that you know we're exploring uh operationally the question of when we would want to bring a vehicle back for human intervention to have somebody either wipe it down clean it off or some other operational process again that gets rolled into our operational model so you know we're confident that we can put systems on the road that are safe and obviously we're not going to put a product in the market until we're 100 convinced that it's safe now in that new dimension of safety yeah absolutely um and and so also in your in your survey data i mean you say that um you know half americans say they would ride in a self-driving car given the opportunity uh 62 believe they're the the way of the future um so sort of with that in mind like what you know what can people sort of expect from these vehicles i think there's you know people have really struggled for for years now since it's become more of a public thing to understand sort of where is this technology how close is it is this something i'm going to be able to ride tomorrow is this something i'm able to write in 10 years um and i know these are very difficult questions to ask and you get asked them all the time but but if there's a way to sort of give people a way to think about sort of what this future is going to is going to look like well i will tell you first you know public perception of avs is really interesting because we're we're often asking people about a technology that many haven't yet experienced you know in las vegas where we're operating what i believe is the world's largest open to the public commercial autonomous mobility service we've given over a hundred thousand rides most of those people who've you know taken rights hadn't previously been in an av 98 of our riders when they get out of the vehicle give us a five-star rating out of five what we've seen is that once people experience the technology they become open to it and are willing to adopt it the caveat there the asterisk is that you have to deliver a ride that's safe that's comfortable and that drives in some way like a human would drive like you or i would drive if you can do all those things people will accept the technology so excited by what we've seen so far now where the question of where you know it really depends on where you are if you're in las vegas today if you're in and around the strip you can hail a vehicle you can take a ride you can experience the technology but we're going to deploy the technology in a way that matches the cities that we enter with the technical readiness of the system so another way to put that is you know we won't be in times square in rush hour tomorrow that'll be down the road but we'll be in the cities with the driving conditions that match the capabilities of our vehicle so we'll deploy gradually over time it won't be a step change overnight where we wake up one day and there's autonomous vehicles everywhere all the time yeah and and you also you mentioned accessibility before and that's something i'm you know a little bit of a personal passion about um because i i do think that you know autonomous vehicles it there's an opportunity not just to provide mobility to people who are not currently well served by cars but really like personal autonomy which i think sometimes people don't think about what that what that really means and it's it's a really important thing for for a lot of people and and so you mentioned a couple times now um sort of how important is that for you and and and you know maybe can you give us a sense of some of the things that uh that you have to do to sort of you know make sure that's kind of that accessibility component is really baked into what you're developing yeah you know it's it's very important to us um it's it's about ultimately building a system that's free of some of the biases that are inherent either explicit or implicit in some of our other transportation solutions and we can do that with autonomous vehicles we have the ability to do that um and so it's a guiding principle you know it's in our mission statement that we're going to build systems that are accessible i can tell you that our city partners are very excited about that as well they look at autonomous vehicles as a transportation option that has the promise of being much more accessible than some existing options yeah absolutely and i mean um i you know i love the autonomous vehicle space because there's so much to talk about and i'm just a yacker i love to to talk but i have to imagine as you know behind the scenes you guys are are working on this stuff are you are you getting really like excited for this to be something that you don't just have to talk about that you can really actually show people so that so that they understand you know as you said it's it's there's something about personally experiencing this stuff that just totally changes how you relate to it right yeah i mean i'll speak for myself you know i get very excited to come to work every day you know the mission um increasing safety the potential impact the 40 000 lives lost in the us yearly uh and many many more worldwide and the impact we can have on that is absolutely tremendous so very easy to come to work i can tell you that yeah i second that you know the opportunity to really ultimately change the world um you know reduce you know the number of traffic related accidents on the road and ultimately deaths to you know improve the sustainability of mobility um you know it's it's very motivating and as carl said i enjoy coming into work every day to to work on this problem yeah well um i personally am i'm quite excited about this as well um i have been lucky enough to ride in one of optus cars in in las vegas um which was a great experience and and i'm really excited to to see where you guys go next and and and what this vehicle looks like and you know what this what this service is able to really do um you know not just for the technology but but for for people and for these cities um because i think it is really important that we that we are able to actually see that instead of just talking about it all the time so um congratulations on on this announcement and and thanks so much for uh you know taking the time to to chat about this today yeah thanks ed we're super excited as i'm sure you can tell to launch motion [Music] you
