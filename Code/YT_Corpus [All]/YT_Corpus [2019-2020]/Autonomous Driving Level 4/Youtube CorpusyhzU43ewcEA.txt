 what up bros all right we'll give people a little bit of time to to to come in here we have a real um you know how we don't talk about ty on this channel this stream is the exception let's wait for a bunch of people to get in here hello what's up uh we'll be chill about who can talk to uh yeah it's pretty good hello what's up uh we're going to talk about calm ai and in just this stream um this is my last day in in new york uh this is my my last day in this apartment um so yeah i'm uh i'm going to go back to comma i'm going to make models train fast so maybe we'll start with uh we'll start with a a open ai post about gpg3 scaling um does this paper go into the actual scaling curves of it uh twitch hasn't gotten back to me yet about whether i'm a partner or not uh yeah so this these are these are winograd schemas um by the way if you don't know what a winograd schema is these things are really cool um like where's the where's the classic one yes uh the councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence who does they refer to [Music] um so the they here refers to the the city councilman uh but then if you change the word from feared to advocated uh the council city councilman refused the demonstrators of permit because they advocated violence the they refers to the demonstrators and there's no way by doing sort of technical analysis on that sentence um that you can say what they refers to you have to have a a a semantic understanding you have to understand that city councilmen will be more likely to to fear violence and demonstrators would be more likely to advocate violence um it's not about common ai we're talking about self-driving cars um so it's interesting to note uh how well this scaling works and it may be just a question of scaling up language models to get things that even pass the tiring test um so the question is is the same thing true about self-driving cars let's see how many let's see how many um how we doing on 295 okay somewhat decent we'll get started in in in a little bit um so yeah i mean just scaling is is unreasonably effective and i think that the solution to self-driving cars is going to pretty much be the same thing is going to be designing now when you're building language models language models have a very simple uh loss function maybe we'll we'll go back to we'll do some some vim writers right um so language models are basically some form of this you want to predict uh the next symbol a symbol can be a character a symbol can be a word i'll say let's say the symbol at position k given um the symbols uh 1 through uh k minus one right so given the previous text so if i were to say something like the quick brown right um and you can you can decide you know everyone uh and then like symbol right so what's the probability of symbol um yeah and people already know it's fox right what's the probability of symbol given uh the quick brand right um so fox is maybe maybe 95 percent but you know maybe maybe someone's like making a joke about it uh dog uh duck maybe if it's you fuckers you're right keyboard uh you know we can we can we can give them all probabilities right um so this this loss function is called uh categorical cross entropy uh it's a very simple loss function and it's it's mathematically beautiful so what you can do and what basically what gbt3 is is just this really scaled up i think that right now people are hyped on things like transformer it's unclear how much the model architecture even matters it's just training on a lot of data many many data many many params uh many many many compute so that's mostly what it seems to look like and um you know let's say clean loss function so uh it's it's pretty cool so this is the common ai strategy the comic strategy is do you want to know how to drive a car well so um so this is language models uh if you want to know how to build driving models um it's basically the same thing so we have the probability of the action at time t um given uh the actions uh from time one to t minus one right uh now there's a few problems uh so i should spell that right categorical uh so um categorical cross entropy uh doesn't work right well i mean it can work you could think about how to do it but then you have to ask the question what are the categories um by the way you don't you don't actually have to do this on symbols you could also have like the quick brown you know fo uh and now you know uh you're asking the question of what's the probability of the character given the string and then i think x is extremely high uh maybe it's the quick brown four or the quick brown foul um but uh yeah so if for this but the important thing to note here is whether it's a word-based model or a character-based model it's easy to see what the what categories are um the other really nice thing about categorical cross-entropy is it's outputting a full probability distribution over the space so fox dog.keyboard uh you're outputting the probability for every single word um not just outputting the most likely word uh which which helps something to train uh so when you're doing driving models categorical cross-entropy doesn't work what are the categories um so and then also well another kind of related question is what is the output um so oh let's also ask the question what is the input uh so i think this one's pretty easy it's just a video stream you know cameras uh it's all you really need to drive a car human has two eyes what is the output is a little bit trickier so you can go all the way through uh to controls so um this is you know multi-dimensional uh huge huge you know let's say it's like um 512 by 256 right uh so that's something like um what is that like uh i don't want to do that i don't i don't want to do the math wrong i think it's something like um an eighth of a million uh yeah so it's an eighth of a million and actually let's let's give it a bit of uh let's give it a bit of color oh let's give it a bit of temporal contact so let's just round it up let's say it's about one million dimensions right um so the output uh from driving a car is actually uh really uh how many dimensions is it does anyone know come on chat i believe in you um so i hear three uh why three three is it good three three's a good answer um so who for the people who said three what are the dimensions ah that's better uh left right straight gas break turning um so i don't know where you guys are getting four and seven from and i don't know about upward and downhill uh two is the answer i like right um because gas and break are on a spectrum right uh so this is the uh long let's say long excel and then for uh yeah yeah or or or speed uh and then we could have like steering angle or we could just call it like um you know yo ray it doesn't matter but yeah um cars are fundamentally a it's long in lat yeah our cars are fundamentally a two-dimensional control problem um because you're operating in an xy plane right um so how do you move well no that's not exactly true right i guess if you had a like a kalo platform in an xy plane uh it would be three dimensions so i shouldn't say that but cars are basically a two-dimensional control problem so um why not just output that uh output the two dimensions so you run into a few problems with just trying to do this um so this is putting the vehicle model vehicle model in uh end to end neural network it's kind of a bad idea because what if you want to support different cars you could train a different model for each car you could parameterize it um and then there's another problem which is like neural networks are bad at controls um because they can't search well at least modern neural networks can't search so modern modern neural networks are almost always just a feed forward pass um it never backtracks right if you think about search search is frequently backtracking so what we use in openpilot is something called mpc npc is model predictive control and it's a constrained search it solves it solves a search problem at each time step uh so what's the output of model predictive control it's you know uh let's call it excel and steer and the input is a path all right um the other problem with this is how do you integrate maps to you integrate maps um very very uh temporal right if you can't just output the two dimensions at an exact time step um yeah so we have this uh extra thing in open pilot called model predictive control and we've decided to operate on paths and not directly on accelerations and steerings um what are the downsides well so there is more code but not much else right um so for people who are trying to build self-driving cars and operating at a level where like they're talking about perception outputs they're talking about like oh well there's cars here and there's people here and there's lanes here what's a car what's a person these things don't mean anything um paths have a very clear physics based definition um not much else because the paths are still physics based and with paths it's much easier to debug uh a question that we frequently ask a comma is will what we're building now be in the final system um let's talk about level five right the levels don't mean anything but it's kind of what comes is uh will what we are building be in the final system uh and we think that paths yes but otherwise it's all a very simple thing to think about the input to the neural network is camera uh the output well then there's compute right are you all remember this who watched my stream about this uh your compute and then you have output which is paths right um so this is the you know neural network part uh and then we have this controls part where the input is paths and the output for some compute and the output is uh driving right cool uh so this part is almost done all right um this part is not even close so we're actually missing one thing um the control specification is complete but we're missing something something else needs to be input into the neural network besides just the camera who knows what it is and don't worry i assume it's a 360 camera what do you mean by planning well so yeah you say map why not radar you don't need radar you definitely don't need lidar you don't need depth that can all be inferred from the picture what do you mean by driver ah toonless chan is the closest yeah um so you ready for my theory about how to um let me not do my location but yeah uh so how do you put in how do you put in the destination uh what's the best way to put in uh your destination right wait why can't i navigate what i can't navigate if it's not from my location i'm just going to put this in right yeah i'm just literally going to put in um i'm just literally oh you guys can't see that at all can you yeah there you go i'm just going to like put that in right now knows where to go um so the input is also going to be let's just call it waze um so we have to input we'll input literal waves like how do humans do this they're literally just taking ways so you know we can point another camera at your car's navigation system and that kind of solves a problem doesn't it um all right so yeah i mean you do need to put in uh you know let's just call it a nav system right uh so we're gonna integrate that into the neural network but even if you haven't integrated that into the neural network you can still do a lot you only get a little bit confused when there are choices um so one way to deal with this without having nav is you can also parameterize this thing as input camera compute output well i just actually wrote that's just path but this one can actually have multiple paths as an output right and then you can choose the most likely one so that's what openpop does right now um but you see how this paradigm very easily scales to integrate navigation uh so we we break down the neural network a little bit further we break down the neural network into two components uh we'll call them perception and planning um but here is the here is the thing where we differ uh from pretty much everybody else working in the space um there is no human understandable uh uh state here right um so your your your perception and your planning model have to be connected by some if you think you can hand label everything that connects those two models you are doomed to fail uh there's no human understandable stay here we can train them separately but so we have a perception model that takes in a camera and outputs a 1024 dimensional state vector and then we have a planning module which takes in that one or two four dimensional state vector and outputs a path outputs paths uh but it's trained uh and to end uh tesla is figuring this out um carpathia is now talking about this uh they know they know um i mean tesla tesla's probably a year behind comma on the machine learning stuff uh they're probably two or three years ahead on the hardware um maybe a little ahead maybe a year ahead on like the overall code rigor uh and i still think i still think they're a year behind on their data ingestion pipeline um so yeah we wrote some really nice medium posts about this and they they got they got very little traction uh and it's so sad um you know the the the self-driving car space makes me sad uh you just see total idiots winning the day um something that uh it's from the same how to drop out guy um which is something that made me think you know okay i gotta let's put some time back into self-driving cars uh this is actually kind of important um crimson xx mana thank you for gifting subs uh so this i'll link it in chat um he goes into judging whether technology is is good or not and self-driving cars can very easily end so badly uh do you think you want to live in a waymo world where you know oh you made a racist tweet once oh yeah no you can't go you can't transport oh yeah no that's not for you yeah that's too bad um you don't want to live in that world right you don't want to live in a world where uh a company basically owns uh transportation or like two or three owned transportation oh i gotta worry about my waymo rating um right so it's i mean it's already kind of a problem with uber and lyft uh oh it's so funny what's happening in california you know these idiots deserve each other honestly these these idiots deserve each other um with the with the ab15 these idiots deserve each other those those lawmakers who oh yes oh yes all the worker oh oh oh shit oh shit ah yeah we're gonna have to shut down oh shit um no my business model is not to sell insurance i don't know you know what com is a profitable company so i can do and say whatever the fuck i want um as long as we're improving the product and making the users happy uh you know uh i'm not selling insurance fuck that's just boring if it's boring i don't do it no that world's not coming soon the world is not coming soon um don't worry about it uh they're dying and everyone knows they're dying and the reason you're seeing hysteria around it now it's like the last gasps of a dying animal um we all know what the future is right uh the 2020s are going to be a swing back to decentralization hey for example like google's dying right google's dying um the the the old guard the people who ran the u.s government for the last 40 years you're dying look the two major parties in america have um been taken over by a completely different group of people uh you know um google's not dying google has built so much complexity they can barely maintain it where was um here i saw there's an article on tector uh yeah why there are currently no ads on tech dirt um and actually reading this article um made me more realize yeah neocons and neolibs get get btfo exactly um this showed me that you know you know you should never tribute a tribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence um no microsoft well microsoft went through some rough stuff microsoft looks a whole lot better now um microsoft yeah it's they're not uh they're they're not dying in the way google um well ibm is a joke does anyone take ibm seriously anymore what what is their market cap i can't believe some someone still thinks it's worth 110 billion dollars uh they came up with some joke power pc chip but whatever um we're not really here to talk about that uh we're here to talk about and you guys can watch this video in three years and be like oh wow you know george was right about self-driving cars yeah you know i said the same thing three years ago i'm so sick of saying the same thing over and over again and now like you know everyone kind of accepts now the hype cycle has gone away right and the hype cycle's gone away not because of anything that's changed i've been saying the exact same stuff now for almost four years and it's just set well why don't the self-driving cars work why aren't the robo taxis ready um so i don't know i mean i guess you really just have to win uh just build the software right and then you know laugh in everyone's faces and then i don't know like there's something i think about a lot too like personally you know this isn't like going to mars right self-driving cars i don't think i don't think matter in the in the grand scheme of things uh you're just making people's lives a little bit easier but what i would like to do and what i've said for a long time is my goal with calm has always been to change culture um we're gonna clown these people and i don't know i don't know if they're gonna learn their lesson i i kind of don't think they will um i kind of think they'll chalk it up to something else just like the ronos you know they didn't and i wrote i wrote i wrote multiple medium posts about that too these ones got a bit more traction because it was oh george hawt's being angry and calling out people these are my my two posts about that i think microsoft and apple will be around a long time because they fundamentally provide value to people and businesses uh facebook and google not so much um you want to save lives don't go outside guys don't go outside um it doesn't it doesn't give humanity any new abilities ah yeah so so this is how we we arrange the company um and i think all of this stuff you know when i talk about all the things we build technically the company structure i want to make sure can survive until level five as well everything that's built to comma should be will this be in the final system um and i think it kind of can be uh so we break we break comma down into into three divisions we have the open pilot division which is responsible for kind of the plumbing testing uh releases of this piece of software called open pilot so openpilot is a is a glorified wrapper around these driving models open pilot will be finished long before the models themselves are finished uh so open pilot is now at i think zero seven eight is about to be released um 1.0 is going to be going to be a big milestone for it um hopefully at that point we have open pilot as like a system uh done the models won't be done um but openpile will just be it'll just be cleaning up it'll be research it'll be but the code for this will be written a lot of the code for research is already written as well it's just kind of a question of scaling it up um well here we have some descriptions the open pilot division uh builds and maintains the open pound software which is an open source driver sister system used by thousands of people every day they focus on safety stability quality and car support in that order um so openpilot also uh compiled team also maintains the panda code so we have this other project unfortunately because of the way that we have to link them to make it work for forks um i can't click but we have this other project called panda and panda is responsible for implementing all the uh iso 26262 checks uh tesla calls it i forget their exact name for it but basically if openpilot tries to make uh a bad request or request would violate the safety model the panda code blocks it um so yeah that's that's the open pilot team we now have an office as well in rotterdam so we have an office in rotterdam and an office in san diego uh you know uh out of fucking stupid the immigration policy you know you have you have people who are coming here getting paid six figure salaries and paying taxes you want to kick those people out you're an idiot um so yeah we have an office in in uh in in rotterdam uh we have an office in uh in uh rotterdam netherlands yeah uh yo i don't have any draws in atlanta that'd be kind of cool though if i did um so the research uh [Music] rotterdam i don't know i let i let the uh the the european contingent of the office pick the location of the office um so yeah uh we were we're hiring we're hiring for the uh the netherlands office as well um why the netherlands uh countries ranked uh by personal freedom um you guys know freedom is very important to me uh well not so much for that one anymore right but uh terrible terrible tragedy um but uh yeah so very very high on on personal freedom um switzerland's way too damn expensive new zealand has more sheep than people uh australian canada you know they were right um but they're not europe uh europe has a lot of very smart people um they actually do better two one on uh number one number one for personal freedom look at that um so yeah uh before i get distracted more um so that's the open pile division a lot of them are now based in the netherlands we have the research division um still based in in san diego i've been looking into south dakota for freedom but um they make infrastructure to collect data and produce the largest supervised training data sets in the world much larger than 14 million samples in imagenet um so the current models the ones well the ones we're about to ship are trained on one million minutes of data um minutes two years so a common misconception from even people who are like who really should know better um is that oh oh tesla has so much data oh the data is what gives them the advantage it's not it has nothing to do with it you need data but you don't need that much of it um so we're trading our models now on a million minutes of data and we think the final models will just be 10x greater than that 10 million minutes of data is 19 years straight what's interesting about 19 years straight well it's how long a person takes the drive right no no no two-year-olds can drive cars but 20-year-olds can um so there has to be enough information there in order to train uh no no i didn't say that's why tesla would get to level five first um what they have is a rebel they have a repel advantage uh it's not just the data and if it was just data god you know how easy it would be for me to scale comma ai guys if i wanted more data you think i you think you think i'd charge 999 dollars for it no way if i was data limited i'd take the vc money and give these things away for free but you know i'm not uh he's talking outside there's always people talking um no humans don't learn to drive in six months this is a myth so humans are building that driving knowledge off of all of their visual priors their priors about objects the prize about shape color and all of that stuff driving and walking are pretty simple to map to each other um there's people talking outside i'm just i'm just i just want to listen you know um so large supervised training data sets um the biggest ones probably uh in the world because the supervision is done automatically the supervision is not done by labeling each frame we do not have we do not have the the philippines division which is labeling all the images uh we just don't have it okay and then the operations division makes the product the money the website and the app uh they gather feedback from users to incorporate into further versions of open pilot they design and improve our hardware and they ship that hardware out every monday and tuesday monday and thursday um is it is it unsupervised uh sort of so we have another post here which goes more in depth um into yeah tesla has a big data labeling team data labeling is gonna fail um we have we have uh i mean we have some amount of labeling but it's kind of more for our mapping efforts uh at this point we care less about so these labels um except for lanes uh our labels aren't semantic i guess lanes and roads are both semantic but the green things are not labeled green because they're cars they're labeled green because they're movable and movability is a true is if you have a physics based definition for movability right there's three kind of motion frames uh involved with driving um there's the motion frame of like the purple things are literally your car they stay fixed with respect to the camera there's the motion frame of the road trees all the things that are fixed with respect to how like the earth and then there's green things which move of their own kind of volition no we just have a github uh people have been shout outs pj lau uh people have been helping out a lot with labeling these uh we've gotten almost 4 000 images labeled so far um well yeah so the segmentation labels are not used the they're used more for um recovering the ego motion of the vehicle uh how does your slam algorithm know to exclude things that are uh moving like because if you if you detect pixels on these cars and you try to use them to recover your ego motion you're going to have a bad time um especially with these things too um depth is less important than you think uh like you don't need depth from a single image you can get depth using structure from motion um is it tree movable what if it's falling down i mean how often do trees fall down if it's off sometimes we have outlier ejection as well uh so yeah um this is this is an output of our automatic annotator uh so this all of these labels are created using um are created by running by running an algorithm over it nobody drew lines for each one of those lanes they gave it like a vague idea of what a lane is um you need to re-up your medium accounts we're moving off medium fuck medium for this um against optical flow is poor man's image segmentation i mean you have to be depth aware in order to say that right like you know you can imagine this gets into weird stuff where if your stuff relies none of our segmentation relies on being particularly accurate um yeah i know i know we'll we'll we'll move off medium uh i'll post my own blog you know i'll put github i'll put on github man um no there's uh whatever vitalik was using for his blog that's that's what i used for mine as well right like here it's jekyll it generates a static page and then you can host it with github pages how good is monocular depth estimation pretty good now um we haven't one of these days we're gonna push on that uh we can build we can build really good unsupervised depth nets we haven't yet for a few reasons uh that are that are long to go into but um so um most attempts making a superhuman planner involve making a perception stack to detect certain human understandable aspects of the environment such as cars perceptions and lanes a planning stack then makes plans based on these perception outputs the problem with this approach is that the planner is limited to only make plans on what is described in the hand-coded perception layer which is doomed to never be good enough um here's here's a uh on that yeah the tesla is um leverage where carpathia goes into describing it when you start if you're if your voyage and you're driving around the same block over and over and over again you think that this approach is is feasible when your tesla or comma and you start looking at just the diversity that exists in something as simple as a stop sign you realize that it's never going to work um so yeah we believe the most promising way to make a superhuman planner is to make a planner that mimics human policy um a planner that learns to predict the most probable human policy for every scenario would make less mistakes than a human so the way that we separate the vision model and the planner model again is with these a thousand non-human interpretable features this is again visualizing what's in these features and if you notice the important things about the scene are kept constant the position of the cars the position and type of the lanes uh where this wall is but then the things that don't matter at all like this sign or where the sky is or you know all of this stuff it has no information about because none of it is relevant to the the driving uh scenario um and this is i think a huge key you can't just train an auto encoder to do this it has to be a task aware auto encoder we also have a driver monitoring model uh i don't i don't understand well actually i do know why tesla hasn't shipped it yet but uh level two is gonna be here for a long ass time you know uh car companies get this tesla doesn't and waymo and uber and uh argo's the worst uh are just so far off the deep end i mean you know what do you do when you're in a ponzi scheme what do you do what do you do you keep digging yeah i mean you do keep thinking every because locally keep digging is what you're never gonna get how are you gonna get over that activation energy that hump and be like shit man sorry we wasted your three billion dollars uh yeah you know uh well they certainly are not gonna start being like wow george said all these things three years ago damn i mean what's worse than wasting three billion dollars wasting three billion dollars when you should have known better mm-hmm yeah sad sad sad uh we also have a post here about open pilot um written by the open pilot team where we go into uh what our vehicle planning model looks like like i say we're still doing that path to um path to action translation uh classically you can you can do this classically superhuman um and there's a whole bunch of advantages to doing it classically uh it also lets you reason much more about like the safety you can reason about the safety you can reason about the smoothness whereas all that stuff was baked into the neural net the neural net just kind of says where to go and about how fast it'd be going and then the planner uh takes care of the rest of that why does open pilot work better on tesla with roads with no lane lines because you don't really rely on lane lines um i mean for this picture we show you lane lines because it you know they look really nice but actually what we're much more interested in in uh because people are like oh look it automatically ground truths and lane lines wow connor has normal self-driving car stuff too um but uh the mq man the mq uh you know it's like the j cube but like it matters the machine question what will we do about the machines how will we incorporate the machines into society um so yeah it's really the reason it works better without lanes is because uh of the path being uh such a core part of how we learn am i gonna sell maps and i don't really care to um we built all the stuff to build maps and then we asked kind of the question how useful are these things could we scam a company into giving us lots of money for maps yeah probably but why do that we don't need to whenever you scam you give up your integrity ah the machines are learning yeah um so mostly this is a shell stream uh to come work at comma uh we're hiring we're hiring like five more people over the next couple months um [Music] as i've learned from the tests uh most at least most of you who talk on twitch uh are not qualified to work at comma um vips uh you guys i'm i'm much more interested in um i don't care what your qualifications are i'll give you the same kind of test we're not hiring any business people uh um yeah i do hope i do hope that um if you're from india we can we can we're we can definitely get visas uh maybe not right now for america but maybe for europe um we do not do any remote i don't believe in remote uh so you have to be willing to come to either the san diego office or the rotterdam office um and you have to have a lot of skills and you know really you have to want to solve the problem you know i think a lot of companies come in a lot of ways isn't a company it's a project after we solve self-driving cars i'm done i'm done i don't care at that point what would i do with money you know i'll build a college right i don't build the college with other people's money at that point right um we do internships uh remote just remotes just just people who work remote wanna slack off um you're not you're not part of a culture either oh yeah we have a rotterdam office and we have a um a san diego office uh we don't care if you have self-driving knowledge um we're less interested in interns we're really only interested in interns if you can convert to full-time um europeans can work in yeah europeans can work in san diego um we'll put money into getting visas look i mean you research it i'm fine with sponsoring or doing whatever for that um if you're asking what should you learn to apply uh oh cool um if you're asking what should you learn to apply you're probably missing the point so what are we interested in now well so we talked about how now i want to add navigation um so i think we're going to code it in qt so if you do you know qt uh can you build nav um we have some really beautiful let me uh here's a figma of what the new what the open pilot refresh is going to look like i don't know if i'm supposed to be showing this off but we'll show you we'll show you a little uh how big is the current team like 15 people um yes this is just like like what the what thinking of the new open pilot um yeah if you're not qualified then you're not qualified uh we're interested in navigation putting that in there um how much of the strategy using the research repo do we still use i mean it's not just scaled up um so yeah we're interested in in for this is a role for a navigation designer do you know qt can you build nav i'm also interested in a machine learning engineer um it says this this is not ml this is infrastructure um so you know if if i told you i want a 10 terabyte you know hard drive array uh and i want to read from it at 100 gigabits per second right how do we build that um so if you saw you know i wrote mini key value it's related to stuff like this but then going beyond that we have a great infrastructure engineer handling that side of things but now on the other side of that is okay how do we scale up our ml algorithms we're finishing up a 40 gpu cluster right now um it's going to be pretty nice uh they're not very expensive like look people who want to be paid if you want to be paid 250 000 yeah fuck off to some scam company you know i'm not gonna pay you 250 000 uh if you want to come and actually you know solve a problem well that's what really comma has to offer uh perhaps um yeah so email give me a job at comma ai uh i'm going back to work starting uh thursday so maybe i will take calls with the most promising of you guys uh no we're paying we're just not paying 250 000 cash uh we pay we pay we pay we pay appropriately for the stage of startup rat oh no we don't pay 80k we pay appropriately for the stage of startup we're at um salaries can be discussed after you uh uh pass the uh the the this stuff um it's enough to live extremely comfortably um it's not an nba thing uh it's six figures you know pretty much all our starting engineers now will get paid six figures okay um and we offer options as well um we offer uh we pay our interns we pay our interns pretty well also um yeah we offer options and that's how you really end up making money off of this but again if you're the kind of person who wants to run business scams get out i wouldn't let you i wouldn't let you you know i wouldn't let you near a comment with a 10-foot pole um but if you're the kind of person who's motivated to solve this problem um our company mission uh uh our comma at comma our mission is to solve self-driving cars while delivering shippable intermediaries um everything we do is derived from that mission and as the narrative unfolds it's looking increasingly like we will win alongside tesla and mobileye mobilize like the windows of the space tesla's the back or the linux what's our interview process look like for a full stack engineer uh programming challenge phone screens and then we do on-site paid micro internships i'll got on board talking about this stuff i don't deal with this stuff the operations division deals with this stuff i'm i'm just here to chill i'm not hiring for a hammer hammer is a joke man i'm not hiring for common ai comment ai is higher all right like i'm not you know it's not me man uh yeah look can i sponsor a visa i'm happy to tell the government whatever you want me to tell the government i'm happy to pay for it if you pass the technical stuff i think it's all bullshit and uh you know kama will use its resources to make that bullshit go away um can you just explain more about what we're doing right now sure so the idea is to scale everything up we've built something that is fairly end to end uh we've built something that can output the new models now output full uh lateral and longitudinal plans jointly um so they jointly tell you here's how you should drive the car here's how fast you should go uh when you do it uh but we need to we need to scale all this stuff up how do we go from you know training on on this much data to training on this much data how do we improve the quality of our data right so we have this automatic ground truth and how good is it well it's like 99 good but you know what that one percent really starts to be a big chunk uh once you get into um once you get into uh the scale that we're doing it all right if we can fix that one percent we'll see our losses in the model go down uh so we want to have perfect data uh shit tons of it and cram it into huge models right um so this is the other beauty of these kind of language models it's like the data is just web scraping you don't mess up web scraping um so uh yeah this is not ml it's infrastructure how do we how do we scale up our ml algorithms uh how do we make uh all the data perfect um yeah these are these are these are the two things that i'm person we're hiring for a bunch of other posts but the two that i'm personally interested in in speaking with are machine learning engineers and uh navigation designers um like like can you build ways right open source ways right basically what we're building um we'll say like mapbox backend something that we can switch to our own openstreetmap if we ever choose to uh yeah can you build open source ways that that that people actually want to use um do you know react uh add so the we have like the comma app kind of the flow that we're thinking about for navigation is we're going to go in here like here's like here's like the comma prius it's connecting to it right now that's a live screen shot from the prius in the office uh the car battery's at 12 volt too that's a little low um but what we'll be able to say is like you'll be able to click a button on here start a new trip you'll be able to search right here on your phone for where you want to go and then say send to the device then the device is like ready to go um so add uh nav sending support to app this is going to be a comma prime only feature um no we don't use anything like django i don't know what iconic even is oh they're watching my stream watching our stream at the office um [Music] we don't add support for cars anymore uh community members add support for the cars if you want to add support for the renault zoe uh you guys can do it um yeah i think we i think our apply right i think it's actually harder to get into common ai than it is to get into harvard uh i think harvard accepts like eight percent of their applications i think coming i accept less um no most people we've recruited from around uh like what you say like oh we're in the bay area do i want to hire the people who are like i moved to the bay area so i could be a thought leader blockchain influencer yeah you're not you know who comment wants to hire um so yeah i really want i really want someone who's going to come in and own this navigation project this is what elon does when you want someone good right it's just like he like tweets about it maybe this kind of stuff works um no i mean a lot more people you filter themselves out before they before they send an email to to to to give me a job become ai oh harvard's at 4.7 oh we got to stay competitive no that's a bullshit metric wouldn't it be nicer if everyone in the world was just smarter um no we're allowed to talk about self-driving cars now uh how does the infrastructure engineer interview look like what you want you want to know the questions what you're trying to pull a hillary clinton for the debates you know um woke need not apply i i don't you're not going to be asked any political questions i don't give a shit man um you're going to be at you know you want to come here you got to focus like that's just what it is um no we're not open to remote positions no remote remote is kill uh it's called osm and yeah i've looked at them except they're all crappy right like has anyone oh this actually has a surprisingly good rating is it open source huh wow i feel like i downloaded this and i was upset by it let's try it let's download it on my iphone the ux sucks yeah we'll try to navigate somewhere on this wow it has good it has good ratings though um yeah i mean yeah we want to write our own front end basically we want to use mapbox i think mapbox can generate nav um map to gl looks pretty beautiful uh yeah no no no no they have like beautiful 3d looking ones yeah i want like 3d looking we want to make the ux good we want to build a really usable navigation app uh that we can then integrate with openpilot um we'll pay for mapbox well this is why it's a common prime only feature so this covers uh mapbox api costs um yeah i think we'll do a good job in the ui uh yeah fuck google um google google maps google what google did with google maps as evil uh they priced it really low they scorched the earth of all the competition and then they jacked up the price anti-competitive um classic anti-competitive tactic you know hey hey doj hey you know if you're interested hey um did i interview anyone who passed the test but in the interview is extremely unskilled we do a pretty good job um to repeat which maps i want to we want to use i think we're going to build something custom i mean there are map box there are apis which will give you the navigation pretty much all we need to build like can you build open source ways from it let's just say it's the front end uh the actual navigation i believe mapbox uses something called valhalla to do the planning uh yeah they hired the team who made it overall we like mapbox uh open source routing engine so we can use we can use this routing engine we can even use map boxes servers to get it i'm not that worried about the cost i am worried about making sure the front end looks good it's built into open pilot and we get people to actually use it um and then yeah machine learning engineers who are going to come in and and scale up the ml so you know better scale better data all right better scale better data uh why are we building a nav because you know we talked about this say here's your input right if you if all you have is a camera you can have to output paths how do i know whether i'm turning right or going straight at the light right um what's hard about the scale i don't actually build it right can you build something that scales the gpd3 size i think that's what it's going to take uh any potential for using audio perception in cars you ever get that thing in uber where it's like yo your driver's death and then they get you where you need to go yeah that's what i think of audio perception in cars um with maps we can beat what tesla's currently doing at least last time i use navigate on autopilot i think their integration approach is pretty bad um yeah i mean look we gotta build it right it's not no shit we gotta build navigation everyone knows this uh there's like some false starts on the project but you know there's false starts on things and then like it's third time's the charge second time's the charm we'll get someone good in here to build it uh security what do you mean by security man everyone is like what is security security is just good software engineering uh yqt what else would we use um i don't want some like heavyweight ass react html javascript typescript transpiler shit no um yeah c plus plus that's a programming language uh tesla uses qt as well l will be big uh google maps does not even offer navigation and mapbox gives us an approach to move away from them because it's open source and it's not that we actually will look i'm happy to pay i'm happy to pay their costs if their costs are lower than ours but it's you're not going to get locked in the same way you would with something like google oh maybe i could compile qt with wasm self-supervised self-driving car models coming from mr yan lacoon uh protection policy under uncertainty i don't know if you've seen this how old's this paper this is an interesting paper learning a policy using only observational data is challenging because the distribution of states induces at execution time may differ from the distribution observed during training holy shit this is super smart oh my god this is kind of what we're doing this just shows you that like no ideas are secret you're supposed to train a policy by unrolling a learned model of the environment dynamics over multiple time steps while explicit wow i can't believe this is a year old and i didn't see it um we're doing something similar to this these are these are the common ai secrets that you find out once you come to work here because this is an extremely hard problem um let's see how they're actually doing it so there's a few problems with this namely well okay so a learned model of the environment dynamics what's your loss function on that um it's two years old i don't know how i missed this one [Music] uh it's weird what they're doing though it's not like and then how do they make us well then that's the other question about this rollout right like you can't just train straight up supervised you want to be able to sample um from the distribution of the future we have like like this is similar kind of to what mu zero is doing um yeah th this is this is just this is a very succinct way of of explaining what the problem is um learning a policy using only observational data is challenging because the distribution of states that induces that execution time may differ from the distribution observed during training um so this is the there's another paper that goes into this more invitation to imitation i like this one uh that like like go really goes into depth about this problem it encourages the policy to stay in situations it understands yeah well we'll have to look we'll have to see uh how exactly we can we can integrate into this so what we've built at comma we've built basically this um yeah we built this around the same the same time horizon i guess you know like really this this is just a reminder of something that i definitely believe it's that there are no ideas trust me whenever you came up with the idea someone else came up with the idea too um so we we do it slight yeah that's not even exactly true we do something pretty similar to this now we don't have this uncertainty cost we generate we generate new ground truth to deal with the state divergence problem um and we generate that new ground truth in an environment dynamic simulator so we we've built like an explicit simulator uh we haven't had luck yet with learned models of the environment dynamics but this is another place that we'd like to take this right so you can think about so we have some we have some feature vector that i think i'm very happy with so we have this like one or two four dimensional uh vision feature vector um now we have that vision feature vector you know um from one to time t minus one now like you know we want to generate uh vision feature vector from like let's say t to like t plus you know 100 right so i wanna i want to generate that um so a few things about this model i need to be able to sample from it right not one rollout uh rollout um the i mean samples must come from uh the distribution right so given just those two requirements i mean like what's your loss function here uh and what's your you know sampling mechanism here uh it's kind of what makes that stuff tricky uh just use bert well see and this this this gets to what we spoke about up here which is uh categorical cross entropy um allows you to sample uh in a way that this stuff doesn't but uh this is cool and i will definitely uh read more about it later uh and maybe there's some insights we we haven't exactly had on this problem um but for now a lot of it still is uh like how do we scale up our ml algorithms how do we make all the data perfect um we think that even with our current approach um our current approach we'll get to level three right without fancy fancier loss functions uh yeah loss function is the entropy between the two distributions okay how do i calculate that right sure that's great in theory yeah um i mean this is right so i could have a discriminator uh which takes in you know uh real fake and uh outputs like kl level three meaning the system knows every time it's going to make a mistake oh that's that's kind of the technical definition of it the system never messes up and doesn't know that it's messing up uh if anyone would like to bet against elon getting to level five by the end of 2020 uh i'll take your i'll take your action uh the levels are stupid level is a scam can't roll up to actually sorry for money yo yo yo yo real question what has more revenue oh sorry not revenue sorry sorry sorry burn rate waymo or chandler arizona think about that it's how many people are there in chandler arizona chandler arizona [Music] um okay okay i mean that is a lot of people but like some of them are children and stuff right uh so then median uh household uh income well i guess i guess median per capita income in chandler does that like include like children and stuff wow peoples in channel are rich but now does income per capita oh here we go the total number of households is that and the average household income is that okay so six billion dollars a year right now what's the waymo uh burn rate 16 billion dollars eh oh no that's that's that's all of them combined um did what does waymo burn i mean i would say it's comparable i would say waymo and chandler arizona are comparable inside yeah kodak after giving up on photography blockchain and drugs is now a self-driving car company um what the importance of calibrating your deep models it sounds like they're gonna like sell me a calibrate or nine thousand hmm multi-class classification problem huh oh no i see what they mean by calibration this is interesting this is like the rationality meaning of calibration it was cool we'll check out this paper towel uh oh by the way if you're interested in calvin filters check out our beautiful kalman filter library comma ai red nose beautiful kalman filters uh i wrote the c plus in it myself it's very fast uh now harold really wrote the whole thing i just i wrote like 10 likes um yeah yeah learning about calibration and checking out the john le coon paper uh cool like you guys give some good paper suggestions i'm happy with chat today i'm i'm happy with you guys you guys have redeemed yourself for being generally shitty um wait there's ads in the stream am i a twitch partner wait yo am i a twitch partner i didn't do that did they make me a partner oh i'm not allowed to look at my creator dashboard on screen you guys yelled at me last time i did that well maybe i'm a twitch partner good to see 900 yeah i got that blocker two bros you gotta get your ad blocker up you know um if a comedy meet on the road do they fight to show dominance [Laughter] eventually some stupid academic is gonna write like uh driving is really just a game of chicken played out many many many times and that's why self-driving cars can never exist and then that's why com is gonna include in the new versions of open pilot uh how like chicken are you and you'll be able to slide the chicken-ness um and like if you challenge someone to like the traditional game of chicken uh you know if you slide the chicken this all the way up it never the chicken this all the way down it never swerves man you know chicken ah yeah this is appropriate [Music] [Music] here with the air [Music] wow the special effects were bad all right well that's chicken you can also play chicken where you drive the two cars at each other and then the first person to swerve is the chicken i think that's the more traditional version of chicken that i've seen uh you know you two cars and like river and then you drive at each other and then whoever swerves is the chicken um why'd they destroy their cars yeah you know the flint effect bros all right guys um i think that's today's stream from osm end maps oh my god the first thing it has to do is download many megabytes willow rk thank you for for gifting subs uh yeah but the main moral of this stream is if you're interested in a job um and you want to work on improving uh our machine learning stack or you want to work on building our navigation uh i'm interested in in hiring you um and i hope you know i think i think these things kind of get around uh like uh we're gonna win you wanna join the winning team um you know i mean tesla tesla's gonna tesla's gonna win too if you're interested in going to work for tesla you can go work for tesla come work on ai if you want to be eventually strangled by middle management from intel go or get mobile eye uh if you wanna like you know i take down big buckets of money while doing nothing to actually advance anything for the world consider a company like waymo or argo um how can you apply uh comma dot ai slash jobs uh we're working to solve level three in three years i think we can do it um i don't say things like level five in 2020 also level five in 2017 2018 2019 2020. um level three uh in 2023 i think is actually an achievable goal uh by what we based on what we have now um yeah uh tacoma we gotta update this we gotta include rotterdam why isn't rotterdam on here do i just need to refresh better no rotterdam um but yeah uh software engineers uh ml engineers where's my navigation designer yeah can you build a waze like app people will use qt5 um how new is rotterdam i think it opened like uh like a week ago or something it's pretty new uh but see do you see that do you see that federal government all that happens when you ban immigration is now i'm sending a big wire transfer to europe every month you know dum dumb dumb no remote work uh if you're interested in rotterdam if you're interested in questions who's managing it you'll find that all out uh later we got a uh i don't know if it's true i look i'm not going to go into who did it man it's just fucking stupid uh you know you know the george hat's immigration policy is very straightforward you want to come here one rule pay fucking taxes you want to come here you want to give more money to the government than you take congratulations welcome to america see that's how you run a good business boys um duh i don't know how big is the rotterdam team i don't know these things man that's not the team i'm on i'm on team shell and i'm on the uh machine learning team uh machine learning engineers i'm working on our current model is taking nine days to train that's nine days on eight gpus so we just built a new machine um we built a new machine we built a nice 40 gpu cluster connected with 100 gigabit interconnects 100 gigabits infiniband yeah and we got the melanox connect fives which means that we can dma directly from gpu memory on one computer to gpu memory well we can dma directly from the gpu memory to the infiniband card uh without having to go through the cpu and then we can you know blit that over that infiniband fiber to the other computer so if you like playing with stuff like that um very excited for nvidia's new gp as much as i hate nvidia you know like as a business i look i don't hate nvidia i think they've lost their way i think that when their stock went up they became you know like nvidia look jensen's a good guy man he's he's a good guy and you know you start seeing that stuff you get kind of you get kind of like caught up and like we're going to own the future forever and yeah that's what every company thought that had their their their uh their stock price run up like that and they're like now we can just overcharge everybody for everything and the stock will go up more yeah well you know it's not working for everybody who tried this yeah yeah too bad yeah yeah intel died yeah isn't video wow nvidia past intel wow nvidia has blown intel away wow wow nvidia's oh wow this shit's overvalued man wow this shit's overvalued you know what one of these days they're going to push me and i'm going to start building ai accelerators one of these days they're going to push me and i'll build the right thing i'll build the right thing and nvidia's competitive advantage well nvidia owns melanox fuckers man uh wow this shit's insane though really really though i mean i guess all the intel lost money had to go somewhere uh oh my god please don't let the buy arm please don't let them by arm lock that block that uh yeah no actually i saw that gpu i saw the gpu that has the port um no wafers for intel yeah intel has a 10 nanometer coming uh at least nvidia's pushing tech phone it's true it's true um two things two things that i think are nvidia at least the last or we'll see what happens with ampere we'll see what happens with ampere um turing was the gpu's first game um and then like nvidia knew it but they didn't really care they're like look we're in video what's anybody gonna gonna do with us um yeah so if you want to build a competitive by the way if anyone out there builds ai accelerators here's how you build a competitive ai accelerator one whatever bullshit you're saying is going to distinguish yourself like we've hand tuned it on transformer blah blah blah blah nobody cares right get rid of all that shit don't like oh we're going to sell it to cloud providers we're going to provide an exclusive ai cloud don't do that build a card build a pcie card 300 watts right pcie card 300 watts sell it for a thousand dollars and you put um you know you build builds now you probably have to sell it less if nvidia is selling their gpu their consumer gpu for a thousand dollars price it at half the price of nvidia's gpu have the same number of flops and then make sure you get it integrated with upstream tensorflow whatever it takes get it integrated with upstream tensorflow um ati whatever amd whatever it takes get it integrated with upstream tensorflow no i'm not downloading and building rock m from source um every time nvidia does something stupid they're like look well we could do this this this trick and if you just use the nvidia stack no nvidia wins for one reason they built a 300 watt pcie card that has a lot of flops that's integrated with tensorflow build the same thing price it for less um and don't scam like nvidia don't have like oh this is the version for data centers and this is the version for consumer don't do that um yeah integrate it with pi torch as well you're gonna have to do pi torch and tensorflow um we still use tensorflow should we switch maybe we should switch uh we train at fp32 but let's just because we have 1080 ti's we'll switch to fb16 when we can uh yeah it's working well for tpu google do you want to own this market you're going to have to do something that's on googley or you're not going to be able to sell because nobody uses google cloud you're going to have to put it on a pcie card and sell it to people for 500. um i don't know they they kind of seem even you you have tensorflow is gross but google throws so many people at it that it kind of works allen roberson thank you for subscribing uh will the nvidia tf oh nvidia's new scam 32-bit that's not really 32-bit we'll see um you can't build an auto-encoder the problem with an auto-encoder is just going to memorize location of all the trees it's useless uh you've wasted waste all your features on that um pie torch is great but apex sucks you mean the video game this girl who plays apex uh do i like fortnite not really uh should i i was thinking of playing uh fall guys should i play four guys on stream uh should we play four guys four guys ultimate knockout maybe we'll do a four guy stream uh maybe we'll do a fall guys stream uh next time we have time to stream all right i think we'll leave it on that note uh if you're interested in coming to work come ai uh if you like you know solving problems uh open source yeah you know you just you just can't take you're fed up with the lies you want to come to a place where we don't make ridiculous promises all we promise is that regressions are going to be really rare if every day we're making the system better than it was yesterday if you're stuck in a hole and you're trying to climb out of a hole doesn't matter how fast you're doing it it just matters that every day you're making more progress up than you are sliding back down and that's our real philosophy for solving self-driving cars um you like being lied to yeah you wouldn't be a good fit then yeah oh my god i hope i hope that that that anybody who's seriously considering working at comma ai isn't like but they only have one camera i wonder if george is an idiot and thinks that you can build the whole thing with one camera no i don't think that you know how easy it is to add two more cameras mad easy you know how easy it is to get to the performance limitations with a single camera insanely hard it's all software nope can't show the new open pilot ui again that was a one-time offer that was a one-time offer uh [Music] my fall guys on my machine with 40 gpus it's not it's it's five machines interconnected with big melanox cards uh why open source your software because freedom bro freedom it doesn't matter if you're trying to rent seek off software you're a loser um you know like i mean who still does that even microsoft doesn't do that anymore uh software is hard yeah uh those five machines are like 35k each uh a bit less uh but yeah we have a huge uh we have a huge data center um we got like i think we're up to like 1500 cores now the thing draws like 60 kilowatts of power uh no no we're doing a four guys stream yeah four guys dream uh no the whole the whole data center costs like what are we up to now it's like half a million maybe more um yeah big electricity bill uh yeah we have two petabytes of spinning storage whatever four times four times 20 320 terabytes of uh ssd storage uh why not rent a data center because look if you rent a house it'll be paid back in 30 years rent a house like if you rent a house versus buy a house right like it's like this is different for different cities but the average is like like 20 or 30 years um for cloud ship pays for itself in under a year especially if you're buying used hardware um use the new efficient net b7 you mean like the norm like is there a new one we use efficient nuts uh i haven't seen anything now um yeah we don't even call it we just we have in the garage um even cola is kind of expensive we just we we're we're training models for so much less money than everybody else um see the correct way to use uh yeah i gotta i got a 1500 core computer uh it's got like it's got like 50 something gpus um it's not big enough to train it can change gpt too i don't think it can turn gpt3 building your own cloud is so much cheaper than renting um also it forces you to think in better ways if you believe in the unlimited compute of the cloud you're scamming yourself right like your your your efficiency per compute so companies that build on the cloud um because they're not actually physically building the data they don't really care about the efficiency of it at all right and this is fine if you're all about like the vc model of like okay we're just going to get tons of money um but it's much easier if you currently have a model that you're capable of training like on your local machine i can scale that up 100x and i know how to scale it up 100x if i really wanted to if you've already built at the cloud scale there might be nowhere to go right we're still working out a lot of the like when i talk about this this infrastructure right this is not getting more gpus this is making sure we build the stuff that efficiently utilizes the hardware we have to the point once it becomes once it makes economic sense we can flip the switch and we can scale it up and make it crazy huge right um you needed to build gpt before you built gp2 you t2 you needed to build gt2 before you built gpt3 our data center is capable of training things that are gbt2 scale not gpg3 but we can scale that up when we have to um why not use an asic yeah we're not an a6 scale yet uh tesla's using an asic i don't think we have to own that part tesla's way more vertically integrated than we are um i trust that some company will eventually take my advice and build start with the 300 watt accelerator card and then build the edge thing don't start with the edge thing and then be like eventually we're going to ship like google you know google actually sells our tpus but they sell it in the stupidest form factor you know they sell in a usb stick well why don't you get a usb stick to accelerate your ai my cpu does that better right i don't understand who this form factor is for all the people out there using raspberry pi's seven people all right oh wait no no no the hobbyists right a million hobbyists and seven serious people um yeah they're so stupid uh they build these like little like nobody wants this oh here look i stuck it on a raspberry pi nobody wants this 300 watt accelerator cards yeah yeah yeah yeah build me that but with a good chip that's supported in the software um what's wrong with hobbyists it's nothing there's nothing wrong with hobbyists as a hobby but when a company like google thinks they're going to like can't resist man they cannot resist they cannot resist injecting their ideology into a chip right it's chip man i'm gonna buy it google and i'm gonna build malicious and privacy destroying ai [Laughter] carpathi built mini gpj wow cute man carpathi good to see you still have time for stuff like this no you know who's evil people who are shoving your ideology down your throat with the purchase of a chip oh it's going to improve strength strengthen society improve the environment and enrich lives like just when you think is it a parody or is it not you can't tell man you can't tell you cannot tell uh let's see who's serious about i see jim keller's name in there let's see what we got are these all the people building yes these people they're they're really bought into the cloud model though and you shouldn't buy into the cloud model um because like one of the beauties of one one of the reasons uh the cpus work so well in the cloud is developers develop locally and then when they push it to the cloud it's the same cpu right the same docker container that runs on their local machine runs in the cloud if you have custom ai accelerators that only exist in azure nobody's going to want to develop for that um oh comedy has his own twitch [Laughter] um you know look look i i think i think he he's he's been saying a lot of the same stuff you know we we welcome to to to team truth about self-driving cars am i suggesting risk five i like risk back um oh graph course you know yeah yeah yeah let's see what they got okay i can buy it how much is it can i buy a pcie card or i got to buy a custom crap that goes in my data center oh wait oh wait no no don't tell me this is the company who's building a really large chip oh my god the wafer scale chip company oh my god you know you know some vc somewhere who doesn't know too much about chips it's like oh it's way for scale man bro it's way for scale why'd you put it all in the same chip why see that this is the right thing to build each one of those chips draws 300 watts put four of them in there you know put four of them into one u oh that's beautiful um what do i think about the apple arm transition fuck intel intel yo because this guy is like intel x engineer what's wrong with intel uh yeah yeah this guy this guy this guy went on a youtube brand about what's wrong with intel um fortunately at the beginning it's a bunch of technical stuff um at the beginning he like talks about like specific technical decisions like you know linus torvald says like abx 512 is stupid an avx fact 12 is stupid but that's not really the problem with intel right like how do you end up at avx 512 next the mbas oh you know yeah so this was the this was the old culture of intel you had constructive confrontation um when meeting external people when designing you know nice guys on the top cancer people with skills on the top good right uh doers over management open cubicle modern intel oh my god intel's breast relations i want to win no it's not even security of like intel is an example of a truly broken company um pro tip the more you see ideological garbage on a company's website uh the more they're failing as a company um if i go to tesla i'm not gonna find anything about you know there's not gonna be an ideology right just sexy pictures of a car cheap solar panels for roofs solar for new roofs it's cheap you can also buy that see let's see notice notice how none of these things are like you know safety high impact protection right cool man i like that look at that that looks that looks safe it legitimately looks safe you put a huge battery at the bottom very low rollover it's good i like this look they're informing me and educating me oh it's fast yeah i mean they're fast that's true right coral it's flexible enough for startups and large-scale enterprises can i bend the board that's what i'm thinking about oh industries building smarter cities manufacturing more efficiently helping people get around all right wait we like graphcore i don't know graphcore is not the idiots making the way for scale chip right oh it's these people yeah uh so oh no never mind i think these colossus mk2s are they is that wafer scale colossus mk2 okay um can you put one of these on a pcie card and does it draw how many watts just tell me watts no no no no see this is wrong what software do i want tensorflow and pi torch and if it's a fork for a while that's fine but once you become dominant google will merge your fork sorry i'm not using the poplar sdk and i'm definitely not using the pop vision visualization and analysis tools it supports both of those okay look at the diagram oh there's a diagram good good all right good good they wrote their own xla okay fine fine fine fine it sits on top of that all right i like that oem pcie servers okay i like that packs one pay to flop so i'm not exactly sure what that means teraflops of ai compute is that you and aid is that float32 um i mean this isn't selling the machine like this isn't necessarily bad i mean if you're trying to this looks like a straight up competition with google uh i mean it's not it's not water cooled it has these fans but like yeah how many how many watts is that whole thing drawing wow that whole thing is just cooling oh and those are the chips okay cute um wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait why do i have an ipu gateway sock um okay i mean maybe that's how google's doing it with the tpus maybe that's okay all right can i buy one let's buy one ipu machine m200 and 2000 by now okay i can watch video um it's radical that's you know concerning um all the people who have qubits use them so where's that where's the buy link it's 32k wait how is that competitive with it with intel oh and it's going to take a couple phone calls oh sorry how's that competitive with with wait 32k for a pay to flop why do i have phone calls i don't want phone calls i want to buy one how do i buy one oh i got to contact their sales no no no no so you build card i want a card i want i want pcie card and i want to go to amazon.com or i'll buy it from your website you want to have a shopify that's fine i'll buy it from your shopify uh all right all right blog blog why do they do that because you know yeah i'll tell you why companies do that right the reason companies have a contact us for sales is because they know their product isn't actually profitable right if anyone had a product that was actually profitable uh they would just put it up for sale at a price right but if you know that the real price trade-off would be made some other way then you're pulling a scam right whenever you see this whenever they get you and force you through a sales person it's because if you were free to make your own decision you would not choose them right there's no other reason to do that if you truly have a product that's competitive put it on amazon or fine i don't care if you don't want to deal with amazon do a shopify i dealt with amazon i get why you might not want to put it on amazon fuck amazon um but you know a shopify some fulfillment stuff okay can i buy this taboola who's taboola the first company that sticks them on amazon you know didn't that didn't bitmain make ai chips can i buy these well no but see no no no i've seen this one and they failed because it's only 75 watts and they didn't listen when i said it has to be through oh 30 watts so that's even more pathetic but this one 75 watts that's not enough watts put four of the chips on there now we got a good number of watts um yeah they don't know the price they they're just it's whatever your it's whatever you're willing to pay man you know i'll sell you this this can of soda how much what are you willing to pay me for um no no no okay i like amazon i like amazon as a consumer purchasing off amazon is a great experience selling on amazon is a nightmare um guys you know i talk about a lot of companies i don't like let's talk about companies i like i like amazon i like apple for the most part i like microsoft um i like tesla spacex why is 300 watts important because you know that's i want to fill my server up with this thing right i want to buy some cheap shitty servers and i i wanna fill them up with these cards i like pornhub that's a good company um i don't like facebook i don't like twitter no what do you mean i think like most companies i feel kind of indifferent about right like you know whatever company made this mask right i don't you know i might not like masks but i don't have a problem with that company um reddit's a bunch of sellouts i like wikipedia fuck tick tock uh tick tock's the most degenerate shit you know like at least instagram glorifies beauty tiktok is just like people being degenerate um does higher wattage mean higher flops well you basically two things determine the number of like unless you build something that's really inefficient which i don't think a lot of these people have two things are really going to determine your amount of flops um your process that you've used and then your number of watts right so if it's a seven nanometer chip it's watt scale with flops this is true all the way down to like you know uh little qualcomm socs uh so does this does this can i buy one here can i buy one of these things no well they're just sticking in v 100 tensor core gpus do i think insta thoughts are beautiful yeah a lot of them i mean they put a lot of effort into that stuff man like some of those girls like they'll take like a picture in a private jet and they like you know they just like they rent the jet just to sit on the tarmac and take the picture like you know what but props for them they're supporting the economy you made up some like stupid tick tock dance like boo um instagram glorify is a beauty i like instagram i know despite despite uh despite not liking facebook i don't like facebook as a product right facebook is a company it's like yeah i dislike actually i just like facebook as a product but like facebook is a company i feel better about than google um instagram is a great pickup website too uh well amd actually can be competitive amd if amd got their shit together with software all right all right radeon instincts see what we got um how much watts oh oh 300 watts okay i mean it is rock m but maybe rocking will get good how much wait it's it's only uh nvidia a100 is only is only 20 teraflops i mean actually the bigger thing that matters too it's not just the flops it's also your memory bandwidth i've been upset with rock m i've just been mostly upset with like trying to get it to build and work uh no wait they're not claiming they're only claiming 13.3 that's not that much those are lying flops you know lying flops i don't want any lying flops real flops oh this is if i'm looking for a dell rack amd is pushing so good i good good guy amd man how's amd stock well they deserve it you know amd deserves it but i hope they don't become scammers great i can buy a ups good link um how much are these they have a good amount of memory bandwidth you think their stock will drop after next gen announcements uh um well the performance to value ratio yeah but that's only because you know you can't compare with nvidia's scam pricing you have to compare with the real pricing of these things which if you want the real pricing look at their consumer gpus those are the old amd cards the new ones come this fall wait you're telling me these are the old ones oh yeah it's vega yeah so does this is this up to date for the no huh it's really not many the g4 is oh wait where's the ti is the 1082 and 2080 ti yeah so these are the numbers that i'm familiar with it's like 13 uh well let's just say a titan rtx another two here let's let's give it 15 15 gigaflops right so you're telling me there's newer there's newer ones than this and here you got a link where i can buy them oh my god oh that's crazy expensive you gotta compare to nvidia's uh you gotta compare to nvidia's consumer gpus um again that that's a scam but when is in video is this still big navi sorry i i haven't kept up to date with this stuff wait they have pictures now is that a real picture of a geforce we are leaks no that's that so that's what it's going to look like how they do the heatsink is interesting because it determines how many of these we can shove in a box the second picture was the leaked design you mean this this is the scam picture that i've been seeing all over the internet you're saying this one old ones this is supposedly the leaked design yeah i don't know um all right guys uh i'm waiting i'm waiting for somebody to build nvidia is priced okay for the consumer gpus they just need to stop trying to segment the market artificially um and if they won't do it maybe i will should we build should we pivot commerce should we build should we build uh tpus um just wait for a blower heatsink version and rip the blower part off yeah we could we could raise the money to do it not gpus just just tpus um you know i mean i really like i don't want to be the one who builds them i would design even that you know what tesla should just stick their tbus on pcie cards um yeah you get tsmc to build them it's fine no i don't want to have to do this i really this should be a completely commodity thing anybody should be able to build this right anybody should be able to build this can somebody just go steal a tpu from google and build a duplicator machine that is tesla dojo yeah it is exactly tesla's dojo project generic data center picture um tesla ai chip yeah they need to stick a whole bunch of these whatever they're using for dojo they should sell dojo is only on an fpga implementation now how do you know that um if anyone was able to build it they can't sell it as a service yeah these people need to get wait elon tweeted it oh wait why don't they sell them yo elon let's let's go in on it man let's go in on it i will help you out we'll help you out with software or just just elon here's the deal i'm willing to make we'll do free software support for dojo you just need to sell the chips open dojo come on man just sell the chips you'll make money i'm not saying sell the chips at a you know sell the chips at a reasonable markup sell the chips at a 10 20 percent markup right um free money uh fp16 is fine open dojo yo elon come on man come on let's open up doja dojo has multiplied yeah i i've seen i've seen i've seen presentations on there on their other channel i can do most of the stuff we'll help you with the software we'll switch to pi torch you guys using pi torch we'll use pi torch we can all use pi torch fuck tensorflow fuck google let's pick come on man let's do it let's do it let's build the competitor let's crush her man fucking video fuck google come on um i believe i believe uh open dojo elon here i'll think about it all right all right think about it you think about it all you gotta do is sell the chips man that's all i'm asking um uh how many people we got people still watching this crap here we go we got how are we doing ah a thousand people not bad um but yeah good to see we got it we got another you know i do the haskell stream no one follows the hassle stream sad i'm verified on twitter but i don't care about being verified on twitter because the women on twitter are not what i'm looking for it's women on instagram that i'm looking for and that's where i want that blue checkmark um actual elon tweet i have twitter blocked on my computer so i can't see that okay guys uh come work at comma ai uh you know we're the underdog to tesla let's be honest you know i'm not even gonna say that like if you want to win we're the underdog to tesla but trust me we live in a world where we both win uh build android we're gonna be two years behind apple uh you know but we're gonna we're gonna capture most of the market share i think um i mean i think that's what has to happen i think that these companies they're not going to have you know oh that might oh yeah george hartsman there goes a clone man you know he doesn't he doesn't work in the normal business ways but they're not going to have a choice they're going to have to use open pilot right i mean it may not be me selling them open pipe but i don't care uh maybe maybe maybe some some some some mba guy is going to be like yo yo you see this open pilot thing man the kid who runs it's an idiot you know i'm going to package it up and i'm going to sell it to hyundai yeah thanks bro thanks you work for me except i don't have to pay you and deal with you that's great that's what i'm talking about right um no linkedin is not a good site for dating i was going hard on linkedin recently uh and you know it's not a good site for dating um yeah no but that's what i'm saying right like i'm gonna let some other some some mb oh yeah i'm gonna capture all the value yeah you capture the value man you could do that right uh do i think hinge where they ask you the questions if you were a fruit how pointy would you be uh open tinder tonight um do i think any old car companies have a chance yeah i think i think can you leave up the video yeah if you're a subscriber i don't take the videos down um i think that the car companies aren't gonna have a choice uh but to use open pilot um as as autopilot becomes eventually tesla is gonna deliver on these promises um i don't post them on youtube somebody else does that uh eventually tesla's going to deliver on these promises and autopilot is going to become such a distinguishing feature of the car and then at this point the car companies are or like you know mercedes is partnering with nvidia uh to ship uh their video gpus in their s-class 2023. who's writing the software for that um so they're going to try they're going to have software teams they're going to be over funded they're going to be terribly mismanaged are they going to have all the wrong ways of going about the problem um and then it's going to be like a year you know the hardware team is going to work on that and someone's going to realize hey you know georgia's right we're going to have to use open pilot um and then you know uh welcome to how to do business development without ever doing any business development just make things inevitable you know just like like the universe think of how the universe think of how the story is gonna unfold right think think about think about the narrator think about the story and think about how it has to work out um and then you realize that you win you can't mess up right like there's there's always opportunities for for pitfalls there's always there's always pits to fall in there's always there's always wrong turns to make and there are certainly ways that we can make mistakes but really the future of self-driving is ours to lose i think um yeah i mean at what point at what point was it inevitable at what point was android inevitable right at what point and you you you had and what makes me think they won't go to other self-driving companies um name another self-driving company that has something that looks like autopilot of course winning means everyone uses my software for free of course yeah everyone uses the software that's how you win um uber doesn't have anything that looks like autopilot who uber has broken stuff that killed somebody at what point will linux be inevitable i think i think for a bunch of years past that one bro um uh who's linux is competitor it's windows and mac right mobile and tesla those are our competitors uh oh this is the year of the linux desktop oh yeah yeah i'm sure i'm sure man i'm sure uh linux is supposed to be internet all right linux one um you wouldn't hear about uber killing someone dude this is terrible it's really it's a terrible story um this is a terrible story actually watching that video is why like like after i saw that video i'm like holy shit we need to ship driver monitoring uh like driver monitoring is gonna be a big uh there's going to be a big piece of the next five to ten years in self-driving um yandex has something uh again who's built something that looks like autopilot not something that looks like waymo things that look like waymo will never really be economically viable things that look like autopilot will and this is why openpilot's inevitable um i think it might i think it's too late now also like it's too late now to start a new company right so it's not going to be a new company it's not going to be a project inside of any of these these car companies uh it doesn't look like it's going to be a startup i mean you have some like helm that i uh who are saying helm and wave who are saying like similar things to us but they're years behind us um i mean again yeah if we stumble and like those people could potentially take take the reins from us uh though i also haven't seen i mean baidu is the only one saying open source uh your competitor is going to have to really be open source um i think it's i think i think we just passed it in uh in stars but yeah um baidu is going open source they're using the right rhetoric they're saying the android of self-driving cars but then they went on to build something that looks like waymo and not like autopilot um so yeah we pass on the stars it's inevitable it's it's it's yeah if you're reading the story what if tesla starts licensing the software so what if apple started licensing ios all right i think it is more likely that tesla will sell the dojo chips than it is that they will license through fsd software uh what's stopping tesla from open sourcing after they solve fsd what have they open source in the past i mean it's possible um it's also their software is probably much less flexible than ours when it comes to supporting multiple cars like how baked in is it to the tesla versus open pilot supports over 85 cars now and we support all these different cars what about new economy you mean bought by active the swimming are bought by active right how about nvidia as a competitor nvidia had a shot when they were working with tesla um where's mazda the problem with mazda's oh my god this is this is too common ai now i don't care about that there's a problem with mazda's you can you can read about it why is open pilot not available for volvo there's a problem with volvo's you can read about it um uh what do i think of apple moving to arm yeah yeah buddy i want to buy one of the macbooks man i love apple uh a push towards standardization of self-driving sensors oh first people got to get over the lidar shit you know not everybody i mean like not everybody's on the same page yet you know some people are still they're still lied aren't believers don't uh how can you accelerate your progress i mean again i'm reading the book right how does the book how does how does the book move faster what is what are what are the plot events that are going to make things move faster there's a few people we need to hire to build certain things but the end team that's going to solve self-driving cars is 25 people it's not it's not going to be a ton of people so yeah there's a few key roles that we can hire for and maybe help things move faster though to be fair probably 70 of the people we've hired have helped things move faster and 30 percent have made things move slower so you always have to be careful with that i don't own any chain link but i hear it's going to the moon man this is not an endorsement of chain link it's stupid uh i got i can't believe what's the new people only use coin market cap anymore it's like a new one people use i don't know it um wow wow the link marines the link marines i'm you know i i think tether is going to go up tethers tethers going up you know um all in on tether bro uh no i i don't i don't i don't understand why chain link's pumping link marines what's keeping open pile from being level four level five it's chris we don't have a lidar did i just talk about all stream big connect yo i bought the dip man and it just kept dipping so you know um you know i think he renamed his child to something reasonable and just about to troll the media yams bro those yams wow a lot happened since we last talked oh there was like uh no no no no no oh the the yam commits were funny oh it's just like reading the is it this one um no oh oh there were just there were just some yam posts probably not correct typos probably not pending uh warning oh yes it went from it's a great day to save yam to remove liquidity from the yam uniswap pool uh oh wow this is this is this is really going off the rails now this is this is a shill stream for you to come work at comma um come work a comma uh we're gonna win uh if you're interviewing for this position or this position and you get past the initial hurdles uh well we'll do a phone call um i'll ask you a bunch of questions if you do well in the questions uh we'll invite you to the office uh for paid micro internship well we could talk about joining the team yeah we could talk about uh winning you could see all the all the real common ai secrets right like this is the public side this is the things we talk about not the all the subtle tricks that are actually going to make it work um yeah i don't know why it doesn't mention the rotterdam office you think i do the website i won't do the website man i'll do the website complain the website team i'm a machine learning engineer i'm also have a personal hobby of the navigation and i want to see it exist uh are we vc funded we're profitable we are funded by people buying common tools uh so yeah i mean if you're interested i'm i'm less interested in chilling for this i don't really care if you buy it or not like in aggregate enough people buy it but yeah like we sell these little things they're pretty cool actually they're totally worth the money uh if you get it set up um we've helped people with their green cards yeah yeah we can help with all sorts of immigration stuff um i mean i don't i can't give you a green card but we can sponsor it yeah um let you work for free at comma on a temp basis so let me tell you about that right people ask this kind of stuff a lot and the answer is straight up now right because what you're asking is to be managed for free you are a cost like i said i'd say 70 of the people we've hired at comma have been a net benefit to the company 30 percent have been in that loss right and if you're asking if you could work for free you know it's not even a money question it's just it's just a productivity question what could we do if we had 100 software engineers honestly have a bloated hard to maintain code base um would i say everyone who works at comma they don't work for me who am i right they work for common ai i come in as a corporation corporations are people i'm a guy i work there right um i'm not your boss you know uh but i would say that the people who are in ai are very smart yeah um well we don't really have any vc money anymore we spent the vc money now we have profit money when will we go full open source papers and shit okay let's talk about that so do you think inside of common ai we write papers and we keep them closed source yeah i've got to write papers but we're going to keep them closed um if you're asking me what you need to learn it's not like a set of things man i'll probe your whole knowledge graph you know that's that's what my interviews are like right i just start with like i start with some abstract bullshit question then i'll go wherever wherever you take me right it will go to the leaves of the knowledge graph and if it turns out you can go beyond me and the leaves of the knowledge graph and you could teach me something oh i'm interested all right those are the good interviews right um the ones who like here's like think of the knowledge graphs right if you think of knowledge it's like a big tree and you can think about like people's overlap uh you know with with my knowledge graph and you know people who extend further than me on certain branches are very interesting to to to to be hired um yeah shit's documented to some extent it's not like a beautiful paper i don't know uh yeah i think i think once we're uh once we solve the problem i i'm i'm certainly not opposed to to writing papers i think when we have something good to say we won't write it up i don't think like i'm not like it's the it's not a secret like there's nothing there's nothing at comma where i tell people hey don't talk about that uh well actually that's not true there are some secrets but they're not in the ml division you can imagine where the secrets are um yeah so i mean we talk a little about like what kind of people uh we're looking for i mean this is kind of old but like competitors if you've done well at math competitions if you've done well competition programming before as a meme science fairs in high school capture the flag competition um if people have contributed value to open source projects if you have stars on your github if you've um got pull requests merged into major open source projects we're interested uh and then people who are good at like architecting stuff these are kind of what our interview questions are i'm like if you're going to build this system how would you architect it and like people like make the right decisions here and the way that you learn to make the right decisions there is you've architected systems similar to it three other times so yeah um what's a regular run-of-the-mill dev i mean there's no there's no rote work at comma um i mean it's not like like like everything if you have if you have other things going for you it's not like oh yeah i don't know github with stars you can't be hired um but notice how none of these are uh anything to do with a degree or some kind of education yeah so we do we do yeah we only hire people better than the average or at least that's the goal right because if if you're at a company um and you're hiring uh people better than the average i mean this is an interesting this is you can talk about this with immigration too right like that should be this is this is another nice immigration policy idea for america right it's like here's the average right is this person who who who wants to come to america are they below the average are they above the average if they're above the average please come to america you're bringing up our average as a country right um they're bar raising right um i mean you know yeah like it's the same it's the same things as uh it's just similar to the tax thing right if you're gonna bring more money into comma then it's gonna cost you well actually there's other costs to that too so but um you don't give anyone an iq test uh what about research people so what do you think research is right if you want to sit there and you want to discover some new mathy bullshit research is actually just it's it's infrastructure uh but you get to do cool math occasionally like there's a lot of cool math stuff like you got to write like all like the hopefully you remember how to do like rotation matrices in three dimensions and shit you got to deal with all the different frames yeah i'll show you i'll show you this one pilot all um you know if you want to work in the research division you better understand like this kind of crap like here's our reference frames you know uh you mess up so much you mess up like like there's so many little subtleties here it's so easy to mess these things up we have cameras we have normalized cameras we have calibrated things relative to the camera relative to the imu relative to the earth's surface and we have this library which can transform between all this stuff um the only purpose we serve is twitch chat is to stroke george's ego no sometimes you guys are good like i said i've complimented chat this time we had a nice conversation about ai accelerators uh we had a nice conversation you guys showed me two papers which i'm gonna read after this stream uh you have a pr immersion to open pilot well that's good um didn't have to ban anyone nice uh good good stream today good stream good good evidence everyone you see this that's that's a nice uh nice squirrel to see how many how many viewers we at uh wow still up at a thousand um i'm not even going to shield for subscribing on this stream i'm just going to chill for coming to work at comma and you know tell your friends man ban you then sure absolutely you know it's even it's a pleasant ban you're banned you see there you go um what's the interview process like uh interested in the navigation designer role uh so email give me a job at comma ai you're gonna get hit with one of there might be some screening questions there might be some uh it might be a small programming challenge that should be pretty fun um then usually it's it's one or two phone screens uh with with com employees we have like an initial there's like the weeder part uh and then there's the the phone screen part and then we bring you in uh we'll fly you out for a micro internship uh you work in a real code base for two days uh good luck finding someone good willing to do non-remote i found a lot of people who are good i want to do another remote you just like like what are you here here's my real problem with remote more than anything else um you come because you want to join a culture right you can go work on code i mean you want to work on open pilot remotely we won't pay you just submit pull requests right maybe we don't even pay you a little bit like a per project kind of thing if you're doing well on pull requests but you're not you're not you're not an equity employee of the company right um if this thing does succeed uh there's gonna be a lot of a lot of money um and you know it's it's like well who's the team right the team is is a group that's in a place remote is great if you hate your job see yeah that's exactly right right if you hate your job like this isn't a place to work if you hate your job um remote is great if you hate your peers see yeah that's that's another one too like this is sure and these big companies i i think you know google used to be so good about about about culture um and about building a kind of culture and about building a kind of place where people like just wanted to hang around the office like you go back to google and set you know you go back to google like 12 years ago that's what it was um i'm not talking about the people who did it for cove and i'm talking about like the companies who who hire remote employees you can bring your own keyboard sure uh san diego is a nice place yeah uh you know we're not in san francisco we got out man we got out we got out ahead of the curve you know um can i explain where the equity value will come from oh well so i mean like i said right think about think about it like this um a lot of people are very concerned with capturing value right um and if you're working in a market say like real estate sure that's the only thing there is to do right it's not like it's not like there's going to be a big growth in real estate or anything there's no there's no new value to capture you better capture value you better be competitive with other people right self-driving cars and software like open pilot is going to create immense amounts of value um what i've always found is it doesn't really matter what are the jailbreaks and i asked for donations it's unclear how much better i really could have monetized them right just by creating and building this value the money will come to you how much is linux worth so for reference um red hat sale to ibm um red hat which is a company that supports like really a linux like like distribution or fork got acquired for 34 billion dollars
