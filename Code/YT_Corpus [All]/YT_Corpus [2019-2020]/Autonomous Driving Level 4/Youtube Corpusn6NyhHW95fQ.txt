 In BMWs produced from July '19, with Operating System 7 and with Driving Assistant Professional, the driver is now supported by the new Assisted Driving View. To switch the Assisted Driving View on, go to: “CAR”, “Settings”, “Displays”, “Instrument cluster” and check the box to display the Assisted Driving View only when driver assistance is active. To always display Assisted Driving View go to “Central display Area” – “Assisted Driving View”. In the ‘Minimal Status’ on the left side of the Instrument Cluster, different Driver Assistance Systems are visualised and can vary depending on activation. Whenever the Assisted Driving View is shown, you see a 3D model of your vehicle in the middle driving in your own lane. To help the driver keep the overview in complex situations, only relevant vehicles and lanes are visualised. Depending on what Driver Assistance System is active, the view highlights different elements. Continue watching our How-To Series to get the most out of your BMW.
