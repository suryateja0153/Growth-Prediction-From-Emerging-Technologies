 welcome to today's video today's video I'm at Milton Keynes and I thought I'd stop over at the hugely massive rapid charger Center so take you around to how many they've got they've got a hell of a lot ground here and I mean a lot so spin you around there's me on charge there's 3 on this side two on this side and then a further three on this side and Zoe owners will be happy that all triple headed charges with AC fast charging chadamo and CCS so you just tap your polar card and start the charge or use the polar website app to start the charge by there I've signed up to polar for a 3 month trial because I knew I was coming down to drive to London for my honeymoon and brought the BM all the way down so in a bit I'm gonna go and visit Milton Keynes experience centre so I'll see you there well I'm at Milton Keynes experience centre and if you've never been here it's basically just full of Ev's at the moment I'm sitting in eGolf they've got a Renault Zoe over there they've got a mollycoddle shell of an i3 striped back down there and also they've got a BMW i3 in the showroom as well the Milton Keynes experience centre is just a place for you to learn and get more information on Ev's so if you haven't gotten YouTube or you know you're not really interested in finding out more videos this way you can come into a place like this they offer test drives and various other things and they're full of knowledgeable staff that know quite a lot about Ev's probably more than me yeah it's it's a really interesting place it's nicely a mixture of different cars they've even got charges here because they offer extended test drives as well I'm gonna have a word with some of the stuff that working and get a bit more information on that little boards of information telling you loads of little things about how long the cars take to charge and you know prices etc and then they basically have all the cars here to try out they've even got an altar charger to show you what that looks like and then another board here on a Zoe with basically the range charging times and distance and stuff like that which is just simply amazing I'm here with Ted who is the general manager i presume "yea centre manager" Centre manager MK experience so I've said before they've got different cars choices and stuff like that and you do like a test service where you can sort of like try the car out "yes we've got 2 test services so" "you've got like an on the day kind of test drive and we've also got kind of" "a longer-term kind of I suppose rentals I call them experience drives" "because you get to kind of experience what it's like to drive you've got a" 4 day and a seven-day and and it starts at fifty pounds for four days across all our models it's a heavily subsidized by essentially Milton Keynes Council so when you take people out on the the like short little test drive what what do they do you just take them do they just drive the car do you go with them what kind of "so like when we" "start the test drive off really what we're doing first well probably before" "we've been done the test drive we're just kind of qualifying people so" "understanding kind of what they do at daily mileage how often they drive over" "150 miles maybe can they charge at home can they charge at work build a picture" "off them and then off the back of that then we'll recommend some vehicles and" "then potentially go take them out in the short term which then will we'll take" "them to a couple of different maybe to a rapid charger and a fast charger" okay so you sure know how to other charges work etc "yeah of course that" okay and you're you're involved heavily we've chargemaster and polar here so right "yes so" "everyone who works here works for BP chargemaster" okay "and BP chargemaster kind of runs the center itself yeah" "and yeah it's it's" so it's like BP chargemaster polar and then manufactures support all-in-one "yeah" yeah okay so which might which manufactures do you do you have on board "so we've got Volkswagen, Kia, BMW and Renault are the" "four manufactures on board now they they've got obviously got all there vehicles" "here so we've got the the Renault Zoe we have the BMW i3 the e-golf the E-Up" "the Nero PHEV we will hopefully have the Nero or the e Nero when it arrives" yeah "your guess is probably as good as mine with that" yeah late "most likely who knows okay" I mean you presume you've got the Hyundai Kona then as well on "no so" " Hyundai aren't our partner so it's only our part of vehicles that we do have" okay you've got Kia sorry but not Hyundai though "yeah okay it's still good" yeah but you've got and you've got PHEVs as well as as well Full EV's "yep so" "we've got PHEV's as well and we are kind of predominantly more BEV here yeah but" "we do have well we've only Niro, The Niro is the only kind of PHEV we have at" "at present yeah but who knows well be in the future" and I presume that you you get the lovely miff questions of Oh do any these do 300 mile range i need 300 mile range "yeah a lot of people coming in telling us how they need to go" "to Scotland very very regulate" yeah "or Devon is it's one of the two but yeah I" "think obviously that's that's kind of what we're good at trying to do is" "trying to understand kind of well I suppose that you you see it a lot" yeah "yourselves it's that kind of asking people like really what what how miles" "do they actually drive in a day" yeah so presume in a way you're almost almost sales trained here in a way because when you can have that argument with someone about 300 miles you you kind of you've got to be a bit clever about it because otherwise people think you're arguing with them and they just shut down instantly so you need to tell them it needs to be pretty sort of savvy to sort of get that across to them "yeah I think the key there is just putting" "yourself in in the other person's perspective" yeah "and trying to" "understand where are they coming from because that then allows you to kind of" "start I kind of I suppose hopefully kind of" "see what they're saying and hopefully be able to get them to kind of come back" "towards what you kind of welcome if another reality of the matter is you" "probably don't need to drive 300 miles in one go" yeah "not many people do that" "in a day" right and you you don't non of the cars here are for sale you refer back to manufacturer is that correct "yes so we can't i can't I suppose that's probably the" "first thing to say really we don't sell any vehicles here the only thing we do" "sell is obviously this kind of this subsidized long-term loan kind of" "experience obviously people when they go out for a test drive if you do kind of" "opt in for the manufacturer to get in contact with you yeah the manufacturer" "will get in contact with you but if you don't want them to they don't get in" "contact you" I suppose that's the advantage you've got rather than going into into say a Renault showroom or a Volkswagen showroom instead of them telling you that all the other EV's are rubbish you've got this thing where you're talking about all EV's and you're comparing what's best for the use case of that customer rather than sort of saying this brands better than this brand you know you're giving them a fair honest companion of all the EV's that you've got on offer "yeah definitely we're not here to tell people what's the" "best vehicle we're here to kind of promote the right concert the right" "concept for the right for though of that person really so it's whether that is" "BEV whether that is PHEV or if to be honest if someone's doing 350 miles a" "day and they have five people in their family and two dogs who will tell them" "them probably at the moment your might you're better off you've been in an ICE" "vehicle so it's about making sure people go into the right vehicle that choice" "obviously it's less and less that we need to tell people that they would" "potentially need a ice vehicle obviously you want people to go into bev's but as" "the ranges are increasing it's making it easier for us to kind of always find a" "suitable option there" okay and when you shown someone a PHEV I presumed you give them the kind of the the lesson of not hogging rapid using the rapids all the time and making sure that the rapids are available for full bevs rather than just I suppose "yeah we're good to go through there but I think predominantly" "that is maybe for a conversation kind of later on" yeah "I think it's more" "about making sure people understand how they how the car works at and" "will go over the over the point that obviously the rapid charges don't don't" "charge the PHEV's well okay you've got the Outlander" outlander yeah the Outlander is a bit of a subcategory there but "but you don't charge them you're using the the" UltraCharger to its full capacity so we'll explain that it's a tricky one" yeah yeah no it is I've just used the Mk Hub down the road the new hub but it's absolutely great just it's nice to go somewhere it's all like a petrol station it's all lit up its covered from rain and just tap the Polar card and the charger it's just probably one of the easiest charging networks I've ever used "yeah fantastic yeah we're trying to do like an obvious if anybody is kind of coming" through Milton Keynes please please use the charging hub and pop in and say" "hello" which isexactly what I've done I'm on the way to Heathrow so I thought stop there's for the charging hub just to get a boost and now parked outside the milton keynes exper shopping centre which is just lited in polar charges in fact the night most of some of the post's aren't even tarmac for charging only are they because there's just so many of them we're quite lucky in "Milton Keynes i think we've got over sixty rapid charges we've got over" "two hundred and about 250 fast charges throughout Milton keynes and actually the rapid" "charging layout means that you're never more than about a mile from a rapid" "charge as well so that the whole of the city is is relatively covered so we're" "we're very lucky here" yeah when you zoom out on the map and you see it on plugshare or polar's app it's just a cluster of charges it's probably the most largest clusters charges i've seen apart from Dundee probably about the nearest to Milton Keynes I think "yeah we're" crazy "were it's phenomenal really" "so yeah we're very lucky in that sense" which is if you if you're coming down for fully charged later on in the year we're all staying in Milton Keynes hub "okay" up the Road and if you if that's what if you're coming to Silverstone you're going to come for two or three days I advise you to park up around here visit the guys in here possibly  what do you need to do the test drive driving licence I presume "driving license and a DVLA code check so to get" "your DVLA code check just need to go onto the DVLA website with your national" "insurance and your driving license and bring it in" "if you can print that off before you come in that makes it a little bit" "quicker when you do get here but if not something to bring your National" "Insurance number we can do all in all when you arrive" all right thanks very much if you've enjoyed this week's video don't forget to give it a like don't forget to click
