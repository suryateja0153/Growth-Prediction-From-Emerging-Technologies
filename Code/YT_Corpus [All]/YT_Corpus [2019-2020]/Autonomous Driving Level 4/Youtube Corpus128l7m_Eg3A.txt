roll-on pain roll-on this could be used on vacation as well there you go hand it in Bob and Brad calm go to the giveaway section or go to Bob and Brad on Facebook and have a pin to the top and a good job all right Brad well this will be you and a couple hours driving right so the big thing is if you have a car seat that you know is not comfortable like I had a car seat so that way you know oftentimes the problem is is the seat pan where you sit is too low it's got a hollow spot it allows your butt to get too far down in there so you want to fill that in so maybe step number one right if that's an issue with your seat yep some it some it's not but I can see what this one is you could just use a any kind of cushion now actually I've used a pillow I've used a cushion like this actually used up it was a cushion for a boat for oh sure a flat boat life preserver and there we go so that can lift you up there if it's already a fine seat you don't have to worry about that now so make sure that's there the next thing is your back make sure your lumbar get some type of lumbar support right now this one for me it takes my back and how was it out and we want to keep that spine in a neutral position so we want to have lumbar support particularly if you have in back pain it rounds out your back is what your mat right yeah what did I said hollows it out oh so it depends on which way the hollow is right now you can do so many things to adjust your back position so it's proper you can buy things or you can just simply get things from and some of them are built-in right I'm going to have a knob that you can twist and and some people don't even realize it that their seat has that right I've had patients I say do you have your your car seat adjusted they don't even know if it adjust so if we go out to the car seat sure enough they'll have an adjustment it's usually on the side it's a mechanical one where you crank it or sometimes a button where you pushing an electric motor pumps it out yeah you know you can do something as simple as taking a towel roll particulars you got sciatica um this is a good way to keep that arch and we'll put that right in above that the belt line may be a little above or a little below and that already feels better for me now I'm gonna have to remove my hat I'd have to worry about in the car because I don't have the sunroof open so now you know with the towel what's nice about is you can make it a different size right see what size works where you can make a thicker towel roll using a beach towel or you can use a small towel right then and see what works for you exactly times the smaller you are a slater build you are the smaller tolian precisely you know if you really like the towel roll you're probably going to want to go buy a rolling yeah just a little more comfortable and like this one has the strap that goes around the backside so that way you don't know all right falling away on there and this happens to be the McKenzie roll they make a great product we promote to you they're the ones that's invented it right I mean they're the first ones to market they came up with the ideas from Robin McKenzie the physical therapist that have literally changed how therapy has done throughout the world right there's other car seats now if you have stenosis or like I got spondylolisthesis I think those people want some a broader support over the back seat now this is just a simple one you know you can buy go to the any pharmacy or big-box store to go online and you'll see dozens of different ways to put important if you don't need much something like this it's just got a plastic support that might be enough I can tell right now it's not enough for me now there's this i like the memory foam so let's say come out with these now this one like bob's used it it's way too big i don't like it at all for me it's okay actually i really liked it when i first start using it but it felt a little big because it's memory foam after i use it and sit in it for about five minutes squishes so it feels good but then I found the Kubota yeah not so thick and it's got a few lumbar protrusions here to help support that lumbar area and its memory foam as well and then I fell in love with this one this really makes a difference for me again everyone's gonna be a little different again I do not like this one yeah doesn't work for Bob but I just like a since more behind yeah I've got three of these I got one in each car and I've got one in my recliner so yeah again brad has spinal our thesis and or imagine it with spinal stenosis to you you'd like to have this probably I bought it again it's an individual thing so now you think man I got to go through all this just to get comfortable but I'm assuming that you've already had some discomfort you're going on this long trip and you want to make sure you're enjoying the trip now you're advising we were talking earlier Brad that ideally number one you shouldn't drive if you have somebody else with you let them dry because you need to adjust a lot that's right if you're having some back issues or shoulder neck issues yeah it's not good even with all these supports that we well I want to get it into the neck be sure after that this is a nice I like I got this at an airport actually I'm gonna sit in the plane and it happens to have those little beads in there so I can you can conform it it's really lightweight and it works well you can roll it and fold it in half you can roll it into a support there and use it for your back this one I like to for my neck and I actually used this for reading a lot at home but in a car seat there work well too now this one that would be too much of a bump I would do this and let it flip over better and then take it back yep take it back now my mic is getting in the way so it's yeah I have a device to become a not a similar stuff that I use to adjusting my head from turning this way yeah like the horseshoe yeah okay Bob did you add the part of the sack yeah okay so this kids made fun of this for years the sock because what I like this is good for like when you got when you're a tall person you tend to flex right here and you and you get that neck hump you know yeah have your head bang it into the roof of that side so anyway years ago I started just putting the rolled-up sock right behind and Brad saw this the first time a couple years back knee love glove I used to pop can one time and it just gives me a little counter pressure there it just feels so good and I said almost every one of my kids criticized me about this and now I think every one of my kids is using something like this now sure especially if they drive long tricks the Apple doesn't solve far from the tree that's right and it's not a it's a rotten apple but I you know this doesn't cost you anything and you can try this is great if you're having pain and that upper you know upper traps and also upper back everywhere so so if you're driving you get the best you can if you do have discomfort and you can very be in the passenger seat ease even better yet but I also take frequent breaks right I mean it's really important that you get out and walk walk around a little bit it's great to do at a gas station probably not on our interstate all right don't be walking on there right well if they got the rest areas yeah and then the other thing is if you can go way back as far as you can if you've got low back pain technology don't drive this way right we're talk about it as a passenger right and you know you trust the person driving so I mean some people you don't want to you feel like more comfortable if you see where they're driving because my wife says to me she goes I can't yeah I'm drives because I can't sleep when you're driving right but anyways go back and the big thing is change position you may be back here for you know our taking a little nap but then you know get up and change it up then you here take that support out change around again and then can feel constantly but really to try to put the back of slightly different position it's like when you fall asleep in bed you don't typically lay on your back for eight hours you're rolling because your body needs effort body knows that it needs to have some movement it helps maintain circulation and keep things comfortable arthritis you know in itself as a problem doesn't like to be still I mean if you state you know keep it arthritic joint in one position all night long it's gonna hurt as a matter of fact Bob I've is just doing research yesterday on this and we're gonna have a video coming up in a couple weeks good updated research a teaser yeah so anyways if you're going on vacation you're sitting in that car seat for a number of hours take some of these tips and enjoy so does your wife drive well yeah she drives but you guys mix it up yeah actually we're taking two cars this time oh it's a long story yeah it's a fan I get along a lot better that way alright thanks for watching [Music] you
