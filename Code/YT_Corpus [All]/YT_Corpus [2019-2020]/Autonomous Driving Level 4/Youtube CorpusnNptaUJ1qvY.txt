 VW Electric ID. Roomzz Concept Revealed With 280 Miles Of Range, Three Rows Of Seats VW revealed the new ID electric SUV flagship concept ahead of its public debut in Shanghai. VW has revealed the new ID. Roomzz concept at a special event in the run-up to the Shanghai Auto Show, which opens its gates on April 18. The latest member of the electric-only ID family previews the brand’s flagship electric three-row SUV that’s set to arrive in the market in 2021. The VW ID. Roomzz measures 4,915mm (193.5 inches) long, 1,890mm (74.4 inches) wide and 1,760mm (69.3 inches) tall, featuring a wheelbase that’s 2,965mm (116.7 inches) long. The company says that it will offer more space inside than their own conventionally-powered VW Touareg. The powetrain combines two electric motors with a system output of 302hp (306PS / 225KW), fed by a 82kWh battery pack mounted on the floor. The new ID concept claims it has a driving range of up to 450km (279 miles) on the newer WLTP cycle. 0-62mph (100km/h) comes in 6.6 seconds, while top speed is 112mph (180km/h). In addition, the ID Roomzz is compatible with 150kW DC fast charging, allowing it to recharge its battery up to 80 percent of its capacity in about 30 minutes. The sixth ID concept also features sliding rear doors and an innovative interior that offers plenty of seating configurations that can also be adapted to the chosen driving mode. That’s because the ID Roomzz features a Level 4 autonomous driving technology, which when enabled rotates the individual seats inwards by 25 degrees for a more lounge-like atmosphere in the cabin. There isn’t a dashboard in the traditional sense either; instead VW has given the ID Roomzz a digital glass-covered cockpit along with a digitalised steering wheel. The materials used also deserve a mention; the seats are covered in “AppleSkin”, a new product created out of renewable raw materials, while specially processed wooden veneers are used in the door panels. Stay tuned for the ID Roomzz’s public debut at the Shanghai Auto Show on April 18.
