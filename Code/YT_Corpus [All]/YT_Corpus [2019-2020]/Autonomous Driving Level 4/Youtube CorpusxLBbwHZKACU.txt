 we all know that Arizona almost seems like a magnet for self-driving cars and now you can add semi-trucks to the list team twelves William Pitts got an exclusive look at way Mo's driverless trucks chances are you've probably seen one of these way most semi trucks driving around town but they're not just delivering things for whammo they're actually self driving just because you see somebody behind the wheel doesn't mean they're actually driving it these way mode driverless minivans are one thing self-driving semi-truck that's something else we have sensors that are positioned on the sides and the top that have a field of view that can look at the front way most been driving or actually not driving a fleet of semis around Chandler for a while in it trucking is also one of the deadliest professions in the United States so there's an opportunity for us to prevent the thousands of fatalities and hundreds of thousands of injuries that occur every year and that's one of wei Mo's main selling points wham-o believes that taking the human out of driving is ultimately safer the semi trucks use basically the same technology as the minivans the black domes on the top and sides house sensors and cameras that let the truck see where it's going other sensors on the side tell it what's around it but driving a truck is much different than driving a minivan see there's a huge trailer behind it which creates blind spots for the trucks another example is they accelerate and brake differently than vehicle sometimes much slower than vehicles way most cars need incredibly detailed scans of every street they drive on that's why you can't just ride one anywhere in the valley but what most says the trucks don't need all that information it doesn't have to be that you map every single city and surface Street in the world you can start by mapping the freeways and the selective hubs that the trucks are going to so basically we move to the hard stuff first for now there are still two drivers in the truck at all times just to make sure it's working way mo says it plans to go fully driverless on the trucks and the cars soon William Pitts 12 News
