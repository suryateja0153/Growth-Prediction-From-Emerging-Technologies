 This paper presents a counterbalanced within-subject simulator study. 42 participants experienced automated driving in a familiar driving environment. Participants chose a TV show to watch on a Head Up Display and mobile phone during two 15min drives on the same route. Eye and head tracking data revealed more self-interruptions in the Head Up Display condition, suggesting a higher likelihood of a higher situation awareness.
