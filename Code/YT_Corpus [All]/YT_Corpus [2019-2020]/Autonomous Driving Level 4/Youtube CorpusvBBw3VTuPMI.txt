can't employ money management techniques you don't know which is whether rich tend to focus a lot of their attention on raising their financial IQ lucky for you boss in this video I will go over five tips that will significantly improve your financial situation and if you're new to the channel then hit the subscribe button below for more life-changing content tip number one leverage compound interest if you've ever heard of Albert Einstein then you will know that he was a pretty smart dude and is famously quoted as saying compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world he understands it earns it he who doesn't pays it and I think it's fair to say that any financial principle becomes this highly touted should be put to good use if you are familiar with compound interest it's the accumulation of interest on any principle amount invested over time well this doesn't sound very magical by its description the leveraging of compound interest can make your wealth exponentially increase as readyreturn continues to be applied to larger and larger balances over time let's use an example to illustrate just how powerful this financial principle really is if you deposited five thousand dollars into an investment account that yielded a five percent return and compounded once annually after the first year you would end up with five thousand two hundred and fifty dollars now in the second year the five percent return will be applied to the new balance of five thousand two hundred and fifty dollars Mickey money grow a little bit more in the second year to five thousand five hundred and twelve dollars and fifty cents this calculation assumes that you won't be taking out any money from this investment but as you can see as you allow the interest to continue to be applied to your untouched principle it can grow quite quickly in fact in just ten years your original five thousand dollar investment would have grown to eight thousand one hundred and forty four dollars and forty seven cents without ever having contributed another penny to it since you first started this is why you often hear me preach that you need to start investing as early as possible because it true for behind this financial principle is the power of time every year the interest compounds along your wealth to grow that much more this is why I like to share the story of my friends Justin and Ryan Justin began investing at age 19 and put two thousand dollars into a twelve percent interest bearing investment vehicle every year until age 26 for a total of eight contributions now Ryan put off investing until use 27 years old then contributed two thousand dollars into a twelve percent interest bearing investment vehicle every year until age 65 for a total of thirty nine contributions well you would think that Ryan would have ended up with more money since he invested many more contributions in Justin the sheer power of time on compound and growth will actually allow Justin to out earn Ryan by more than seven hundred thousand dollars for the total fund worth two million two hundred and eighty eight thousand nine hundred and ninety six dollars versus Ryan's 1 million five hundred and thirty two thousand one hundred and sixty-six dollars by the time they both turned 65 therefore if you want to transform your financial life for the better then you must start leveraging compound interest now tip number two build multiple streams of income so you just graduated college and are now starting during your first real paychecks and are feeling richer than you've ever felt before that's great but as a majority people come to realize pretty quick that money goes out much faster than it comes in that's because when you get paid you then need to pay your taxes contribute to your 401 K make payments on your student loans pay rent fill your fridge with groceries and make sure to at least pay the minimum balance on your credit card while you envision being able to enjoy that money your employer handed you through reality is that after expenses it can be easy to have nothing left to show for all of your hard work but wait you still haven't put money aside for a future vacation your child's education or any other worthwhile causes you see unfortunately we are sold the idea that if you go to college and get a good job you will not have to worry about money for as long as you live however this is very far from the truth across the board salaries are growing at a much slower rate than the cost of living which means that every year unless you get a big raise of promotion your salary will actually have less buying power than the year before your income after it is netted against inflation is known as real income and many studies showed that in the United States real income or the buying power after inflation has barely risen since 1978 besides the cost of nearly everything going up the general population is becoming more and more consumer centric we keep finding new things we didn't even know we needed and every year we find ourselves out spending our prior self and in an effort to keep up with those around us who are falling into the same financial trap so how do we combat this financial struggle my recommendation is to start building other sources of income for the typical person to run an only source of income is their nine-to-five job and the reality is that for most people this won't give them the amount of income they need to prosper financially and the statistics back this up 78 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck which means that they have little money to put towards their financial futures further supporting the point that having multiple sources of income is important this income could come in the form of a part-time job freelance work building a side business or anything else that can earn you a steady second income going one step further you can then live off your primary income and make your second income which is known as the two income savings technique then you can start to build a solid financial base and see you also grow over time tip number three plan for emergencies doesn't it feel like every time you put some money aside your car breaks down your washer breaks or the air conditioning on your car stops working well you should keep a positive mindset in your day-to-day life the reality is that emergencies happen and the best way to handle them is to be prepared in advance I remember when my uncle fell ill and I had to fly out to see him with very little notice and having money stashed away allowed me to focus on him and not the stress of the financial cost of the situation now not every situation will be this dire but having money set aside for a rainy day is important nonetheless many financial gurus will recommend you save up 3 to 6 months worth of living expenses in your emergency fund but my advice is to put aside a year's worth if you can having a bit more money put aside gives you extra peace of mind it can be leveraged in cases where you need to take off an extended time for work or have to deal with multiple emergencies at the same time now if you don't know where to start when it comes to building an emergency fund let me walk you through the two-step process I personally use many years ago first take out a piece of paper and write down all of your monthly expenses this should include things like rent or mortgage payments your grocery costs utilities car payments etc well it's easy to list out your most obvious expenses make sure you don't miss any hidden costs like recurring insurance payments investment contributions or monthly subscriptions once you have your total monthly cost calculated multiply it by 12 to get the total amount you will want to have in your emergency fund once you have this figure it's time to move on to step number two in step number two you will set up a system to begin saving up to this total amount what I recommend is that you open up a bank account specifically for your emergency fund and then set up a 10 percent automatic deduction from your pay with your employer that will send a portion of your paycheck into that emergency savings account every month by automating this process you can be sure that your fund will continue to grow to your target amount and once complete you can reroute that automatic deduction into other accounts like your 401k or a mutual fund tip number four avoid the lifestyle inflation if you didn't know any better you would probably assume that the people around you're rich as it's become so common to see people constantly spending their money on new clothes cars and electronics the truth however is that most people are spending much more than they actually have well social media in the comparison culture of fosters contributes to this behavior another factor at play is lifestyle creep lifestyle creep is defined as the act of increasing your standard of living in order to match your increased income and this phenomenon is destroying the wealth building potential of many individuals you see for the average person when they begin to make more money their level of spending Rises accordingly for instance you may be fine with driving around in your twenty thousand dollar sedan when you're struggling to pay your bills but once you get a big promotion or your business takes off you may find yourself wanting to splurge on that fancy $100,000 sports car and this is one of the big differentiators between the rich and the poor when the rich make more money they forego the desire to spend the money today and said socket away into savings and investments that grow in value and provide financial resources that can be used in the future to maintain their current standard of living in financial terms delaying gratification is known as delay discounting and it takes place when someone decides to discount the value of future rewards to immediately gratify themselves even though accepting a lesser award isn't exactly rational the rich nor the future payoffs will be greater than present rewards and said he strongly support how this restraint from present gratification can lead to larger income realizations in the future in a study of over 2,500 people participants were us whether they would hypothetically accept a smaller sum of money Klieman dollars USD or a larger sum a thousand dollars USD after a delay which could be one day one week one month six months or one year when the researchers used machine learning algorithms to model the relationship between individuals tendency for delay discounting and other self-reported variables they found that delay discounting was more predictive of income than age ethnicity race and height therefore if you want to say goodbye to your money worries then make sure you avoid lifestyle inflation at all costs tip number five manage financial stress we all know that stress can be harmful to not only our physical but mental health as well and one of the main causes the stress relates to our finances compare these two situations and ask yourself which of these two individuals will be more stressed out due to their financial situation person one who makes minimum wage and can barely cover their bills or person two who has multiple streams of income has their house paid off and has a fully funded retirement account I think the answer is pretty obvious and when you can establish a solid financial position you can start to see your financial stress dissipate so what can you do to avoid this type of financial turmoil reducing debt having adequate insurance and automating your finances are all ways to reduce the mental bandwidth money will have in your mind and will allow you to focus on more important things like family friends and your health thanks for watching if you want to go from the life you have to the life you deserve then hit the subscribe
