 by the way uber is unveiling a new self-driving car I don't know about this old self-driving there I dunno it's very big and Susan Lee on how big at their big conference aren't just this subject hey Susan hey there Neil so yeah we'll fix Thea I have via the earpiece on Erica my offer and just submit he's the head of Ober self-driving and we're here to introduce the third-generation uber self-driving car so Erica this is made by Volvo and you say it'll be tests ready road ready by the next year that's correct yeah this is a prototype you see here alright so n+ by the way I should also tell our viewers that self-driving is probably overs biggest internal bets in terms of investments it's values at seven and a quarter billion dollars also you recently received I think a billion dollars from Toyota and Softbank as well we were to Softbank in ten so yes that's right right and people are thinking because of the cash sperm ray and how much Rd is involved in self-driving vehicles you're gonna need to raise more money well I think it's possible at some point we're talking about a seven and a quarter deal that we haven't even seen the ink dry and what is the next round and going to look like but yeah it's something we have to consider yeah I want it safety because that's obviously something you need to consider as well especially after the headlines made by that tragic death in Phoenix yeah so Safety's and this isn't a cliche thing but it's the essence of what we're doing it's all about safety for us if we don't have a product that people think it's safe we don't have a product people will use yeah so it's through our entire company from the way we do engineering to the way we've just built out our safety team that folks we've hired from government from aviation and then also how we've gone about changing how we train our mission specialists the people that are behind the wheel it's it's it's important it's it's the number one thing for us no I'm just wondering because of the the accident and Phoenix has that push back your plans for commercial introduction I think our plans for commercial introduction are all about when this technology is ready in such a way that people believe it and so how Tempe affects that is hard to say but the fact the matter is people have to to to open the app and see the product and say yes okay and if they don't feel comfortable they're not going to say yes so it's it's on us to make them feel comfortable by showing them okay now your apartment this Eric just quickly we're running out of time but your Volvo partner says that by the mid-2020s a third of the cars on the road will be autonomous is that true I love that I hope so but I I really don't know that's that's in the mid-20s yeah perhaps I'm excited to see yeah well you know you have a lot of competition whammo and the like they just partnered with lit so maybe you want to get there first well we'll all be doing our best I'm sure Eric thank you so much good to see you so there's a lot of new technologies here Neil we have a lot to get through but I'm gonna send it back to you man oh man very cool stuff all right Susan Lee thank you very very much
