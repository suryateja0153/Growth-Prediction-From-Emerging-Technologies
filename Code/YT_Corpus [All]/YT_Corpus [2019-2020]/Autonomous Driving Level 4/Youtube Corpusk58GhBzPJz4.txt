 [Music] welcome to South Beach Miami my name is Marius color and a co-founder of house head living and we at the arc up what is it a house or a yacht well you can certainly call it a house yard or a recorded a floating Villa but it is truly the first livable luxury sustainable yacht in the world which is independent of electricity and water we have 119 solar panels on the roof and we can store 182 kilowatt in our battery packs which is sufficient for the electricity for the air-conditioned also to drive this yacht and for all the idiotic system what also makes it one of the kind in the world is right now it's lifted I can push a button and we can right now go about about another 18 feet which would truly help in case of a hurricane then we also have hurricane impact windows they've been done by code up to 155 miles an hour it makes it truly not just beautiful but also safe the our cup is four thousand three and fifty square feet of living space it has four bedroom four half bath and sleeps very comfortable eight people so this house yard is on the market for five point five million dollars and this is the ultimate outside living area so you can actually have alone fifty five people alone on the outside sliding deck the best part of it when you drive it we actually fold the side glasses down and entire deck slides right into the hole so the extendable deck gives you another 12 feet on fournette 55 square feet of living space just one of the four piling systems which are responsible that entire yard can be lifted above water so we are stable like a house here we are the back on the boat this is a lifting platform which can go down to the water in case you want to go for a swim or being picked up by a tender boat and right if you get off the jetski very convenient an outdoor shower [Music] so on a yacht that would be the galley right but as you see we have a full-size kitchen we even have an amazing wine cooler here double fridge it's really all high-end luxury finishing as well at the same time while you cook prepare the food you also can enjoy the view at the same time entertain your friends so I think this is really one of the best parts right next door here we have an optional fourth bathroom watch those pocket doors in case you have your crew captain maid or Butler we also have some bunk beds in stalls here so that the owner of the yard actually can have and keep his complete privacy at the same time so we also have a full size bathroom out here and now let me show you the outside area [Music] all right he might be the best piece of the yacht everybody thinks it's the barbecue but it's to help this is where you drive it obviously this is responsible for the hydraulics so why we're so stable like a house so we could raise ourselves up about another 18 feet right now like on any other yacht we have the bath rust we can give some gas in this case would be soul electric we have here the energy we can here measure how much is being stored in the batteries and how much we're using at the same time all right only a few steps into the living room but the views continuing forever obviously the yard is unfurnished we have chosen our de factor to have all the furniture customized in Brazil we also have a surround system and this is a really comfortable area to hangout and it's really unbelievable when you take this yet for a spin and it's moving that you actually really can just sit here and enjoy the view so I would like to point out because this is innovative architecture of the future that the our cup has received Innovation Award by the French American Chamber of Commerce a green award by the Miami chamber of commerce and even the golden key to the city I would like to mention that we have additional storage here and also an additional half bath in a full size washer and dryer as I mentioned no water and electricity bill here either when you purchase this yard fully furnished will include this beautiful piece by Hamilton Aguada it reminds us how close the beach is actually from here so great piece to have we call it the VIP suite also very spacious room floor-to-ceiling windows has a private Terrace and your little desks you can work on also here you can hang out probably all day all right here another spacious bathroom double sink rain shower and I think the inspiration of the colors are matching the beach and the lifestyle here we experience in Miami welcome to the master bedroom in case you have enough of the Sun then obviously we can change the view as well pretty spacious you have your own desk in there you have a bathtub in the living room you have nine-foot floor-to-ceiling windows and I think the view speaks for itself I think you can just hang out here all day if you like so this is the master bathroom obviously pretty spacious something you usually don't see in a yard double sink everything inside is custom double rain shower a lot of natural lights I think this is definitely dream bathroom [Music] but I'd have to master speed you have this beautiful terrorist by the way we are actually just a few walking distance from all the craziness nightlife and restaurants five minutes to the beach while we are here at the edge of the marina and can just enjoy the view or go fishing thanks for coming I'm glad you were able to see the our cub house yard so the extendable deck gives you another 12 feet on fawn at 55 square feet of living space four bedroom four nerf bars feels comfortable eight and probably another hundred of your friends sitting on it as well this is to a house yard living it's on a market for 5.5 million dollars for more information going how said living calm
