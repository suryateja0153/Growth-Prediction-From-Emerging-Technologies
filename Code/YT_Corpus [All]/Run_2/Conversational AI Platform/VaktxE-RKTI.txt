 Artificial Intelligence is not coming or happening sometime in the future. It is here and it is here to stay. To support our business as well as our daily lives. So, think about it as another very powerful tool in your technology scene. A tool you can use, just the same way as you use your computers today. From self driving cars, to virtual assistants that manage schedules and support you in your interactions. From real time translation services, to predictive maintenance models. Every industry and every area of your life is affected by this technology. At Microsoft, we continue to advance Artificial Intelligence in all areas of our business. Solutions that most people hadn't even thought about two years ago, can now be created because of the rapid development of our technology.
