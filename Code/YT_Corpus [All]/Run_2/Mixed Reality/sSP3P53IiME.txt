 medical imaging like CT scans MRIs and ultrasound are difficult and complex to understand by their nature now imagine how difficult it would be for a patient or one of their loved ones to understand this kind of information here at Ochsner's medical 3D lab or M3D lab we're using a variety of technologies to make this information more accessible to clinicians patients and their loved ones we're using 3d printing or additive manufacturing to build accurate 3d models from medical imaging we're also using something called mixed reality and mixed reality involves virtual reality VR allows clinicians to explore anatomy and medical imaging in ways that they can never have done before you can actually walk inside a chamber of a heart and look for holes a second component of mixed reality is augmented reality AR allows clinicians to bring these advanced visualization techniques to the bedside before when I would try to explain medical imaging to my patients I felt like they were even more confused now with these advanced visualization techniques I feel like I can not only educate my patients but empower them we're developing 21st century tools to deliver 21st century care the M3D lab allows the diverse array of clinicians and specialists here at Ochsner to treat the most complicated pathologies and diagnose the most difficult cases
