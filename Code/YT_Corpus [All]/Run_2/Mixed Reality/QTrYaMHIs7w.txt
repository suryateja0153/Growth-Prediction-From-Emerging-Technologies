 This chapter explains how to use a trigger event to start and stop a line drawing. Find the BrushController and open its script in Visual Studio. In the OnEnable method, we subscribe to the InteractionSourcePressed and Released events. When we receive the InteractionSourcePressed event, we start drawing. In the DrawOverTime method, we get the position of the tip, then it creates a new brush stroke by instantiating a new strokePrefab. Points are then drawn as long as the draw property is true. Save your scene back in Unity and then click Play. You’ll be able to use the trigger button to start and stop a line drawing.
