 at the MW and many we think about the future of course we want to look for the next generation of each model of each car in the world is ticking faster and faster so it's also important for us to to speed up with the process a mixed reality lab is hardware plus virtual reality and the experience of the car is created by the engine the issue in this job is we have a design that shows how in the perfect world the car would look like and then we come from the engineering side what is possible to industrialize in the time we have mixed wear it is the best of both world and together we can show all the options between them costs time technology possibilities until we start our tooling we have this possibility to change everything and to fight for the best solution the BMW Group and its international partners have development activities all over the world therefore we have the need for the our collaboration we implemented that with Unreal Engine the new technology helps us actually to display our surfaces earlier in a different stage and to see what is happening actually in different surroundings if you sit inside the car and see it virtually you can see very fast how shadows are working on the surfaces how the light is really exploring our surfaces that helps us to shorten the process and react earlier to what we see in that virtual world because Unreal Engine we had a very good starting point regarding optical quality its gives us flexibility for all the stuff we are implementing for the interactions for the experience you want to have in the car and it's very easy to implement for us we have with the use of Unreal Engine the full control over our source code and since Unreal Engine is also established on the market if we catch new devices new hardware automatically they provide us on an Android integration and SDK or in plugins so takes just a few hours to integrate those hot our application we came from a world with full GI renderings and high-end visualizations and if you go back to a more immersive real time technology you have to have the best optical look that is very important for us that is the main reason why we choose Unreal Engine 4 here because of its outstanding look you can set up a much better feeling for the customer experience at the early phase of the car and it really gives us the possibility to be very agile in the development to give a very short iteration with all the designers within the engineers and we get to a new level of discussion [Music]
