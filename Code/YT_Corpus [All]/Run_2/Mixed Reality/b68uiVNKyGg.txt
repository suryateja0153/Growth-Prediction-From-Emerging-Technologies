 I'm Steve Curran, I'm CEO of ROAR Augmented Reality. We are a AR platform that makes it simple and easy to create and deploy AR at scale for a brand campaign or store-wide at a retailer. ROAR Augmented Reality is an easy-to-use web editor to create, develop, and deploy an AR experience without the interaction of any programmers. Any customer can go on to our web editor, set a target - that could be a poster, that could be a package, that could be on signage - and assign things like 3D models, video content, social media buttons - any kind of interaction they want to have happen in that experience, we make that very simple to drag-and-drop, save and deploy, test it live to our ROAR Mobile Scanner that's in the app stores, and then many customers come to us and they want a white label version of that scanner so that's their own brand. In addition to that, we have very custom services that can work with customers to build out very unique custom features for whatever they have as a use case. We are developing unique ways of creating experiences that are different from one customer to another customer based on some profiling information they've either done inside the app, or information they've carried with them from something else that they've done. So we're very interested in the idea of being able to deliver a unique experience to a unique customer, and on the analytics side, track and report on that customer behavior
