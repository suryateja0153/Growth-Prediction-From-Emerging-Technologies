 hey welcome back to the channel now windows mixed reality is a fantastic VR alternative to something like the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive, but one place that's lacking a little bit is the games and apps that are available for it now the good thing is you could play the vast majority of the stuff in Steam VR and it works just fine on Windows Mixed Reality. There's a few things available in the Microsoft Store but honestly the stuff that's available there is not that great and it's a very very small selection but one thing you may not have known is that you could play the vast majority of oculus games on a Windows Mixed Reality headset using a free application called Revive and I'm going to show you how to do that today. So here we go. Alright so before we get started if you want to know more about Windows Mixed Reality I'll put a link up here and down in the description to a couple of videos I did on two different headsets if you have any questions leave those in the comments section below and the last thing I wanted to point out is that this is a completely unsupported setup by both Oculus and Windows Mixed Reality there's no risk that you're gonna do damage to your hardware or anything but if you go down this road you're kind of on your own but I'll walk you through it step by step and it's a pretty easy setup so without any further ado let's jump into the tutorial all right so here we are on the desktop and at this point I'm going to assume that you already have your Windows Mixed Reality headset all set up and ready to go so the only other thing we're going to need is two pieces of software we'll need the Oculus home software and revive I'll have a link down in the description to both these pieces of software but if we go out to the revive get a page we'll see that the first thing they want us to do is install oculus home and it has a link that'll take you right to that so let's go ahead and grab this software it just takes a few seconds to download and we're gonna run it now this is the setup for oculus and it expects you to have an Oculus Rift VR headset but we can just skip through some of that setup and I'll take you through that right now so let's go agree just gonna put it on D: that's fine so this is downloading the software and I'll skip ahead when the is done and will continue the set up all right so there we are the oculus software is downloaded and installed we're going to go through the setup here now if it takes you into this setup screen we can just skip through a lot of this so let's hit next we're gonna skip the setup and it brings us into here now sometimes you get another setup screen I've already installed it on this machine so it didn't go through all all the setups but if it does do the initial setup screen just keep hitting next or skip this setup and it'll eventually bring you to this screen this is where you can download your your apps install your games and stuff like that and then play them now this is all we need to do on this part there's some application or games that are installed by default that we can use to try this out so let's skip over to the revive section now so if we go into revive and we download the latest installer all right so we're downloaded we're gonna go ahead and launch it and just go through the setup I'm going to use all the defaults on this okay so it's all installed now so if we look at the instructions for revive it tells us to install a Revive in the preferred directory start steamvr if it's already running put on the headset go into the dashboard and launch it from there now the problem with this is that there was a change in steam a few months ago that caused a lot of jittering and stuttering and stuff in oculus games through Windows mixed reality if you do it this way so we're not gonna do it that way what we're gonna do and you saw it for a second there popped up is if we go into the Start menu and we go to revive dashboard we're gonna launch this and this shows us all the games that are installed and what you want to do is you want to launch the game from this dashboard so you put on your windows mix reality headset go into the windows mixed reality home and then from there you can jump out to a desktop you can launch the desktop from the Start menu in the windows mixed reality home launch this panel up and then click on any of these and it'll launch you into that oculus game and that's all there is to it all right so that's it pretty easy setup just remember to launch it from the Start menu or else you're gonna get that jittering I've used this on several different oculus games I play a lot of From Other Suns and Arizona sunshine and those work just great with this setup I'm not sure if it's gonna work with every single oculus game I haven't tried every singular one but I haven't run into one where it didn't work yet I hope you found this useful and informative if you did please consider subscribing if you haven't yet leave any questions that you have down in the comment section below and come see me on Twitter Instagram and Facebook I love meeting new people on those platforms and chatting with them and I'll see you in the next video
