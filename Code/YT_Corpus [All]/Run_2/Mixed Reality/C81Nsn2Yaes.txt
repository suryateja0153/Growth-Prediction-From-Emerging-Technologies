 We are trying to use new ways in which students can learn. So this applies to both PET and CET. For example, Central Library, within a few months we are going to announce the launch of our Mixed Reality Space and tech Showcase. So, we've a Mixed Reality Space where students can don virtual or augmented reality kits and interact within this mixed reality space, and we've been encouraging our colleagues to develop some of these initiatives. The School of Design Environment is using the mixed reality space to imagine a room - they can plot out the plans that they are trying to draw in order to design the room, but at the same time, you can have an architect linking up the room in one way, a civil engineer looking for structural defects, an interior designer looking at how this space can be decorated. As we've developed our conversations with all our teaching faculty, we've also realized that for example a medical school might come in and say that "if this building falls down, there might be a disaster and in mixed-reality, a resuscitating a patient as the building collapses", and they have to look out for the things around them. I mean, this kind of thing you can never do in in real world - you wouldn't want to subject the students to the kind of danger. But in mixed reality, all kinds of scenarios can be can be showcased and the students then have to think very differently. You can create all kinds of real-world situations in virtual reality and they're kind of interdisciplinarity, the kind of collaboration, I think is very useful.
