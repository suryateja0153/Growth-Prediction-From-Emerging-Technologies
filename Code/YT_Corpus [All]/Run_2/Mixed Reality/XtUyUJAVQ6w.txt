   "OnSight: Virtual Visit to Mars" This mixed-reality software lets NASA scientists walk on Mars. OnSight takes real images of Mars from the Curiosity rover and turns them into a 3D landscape. Curiosity mission scientists can virtually study rocks and the rover's path... ...or work together on Mars with scientists anywhere in the world. The software was developed by NASA JPL for the Microsoft HoloLens. In the future, OnSight will be adapted for the Mars 2020 rover.
