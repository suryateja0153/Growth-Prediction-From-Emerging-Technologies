 In this chapter, we’ll learn how to work with motion controller models in Unity’s game mode and runtime. In the Project panel, find the Motion Controllers prefab and add it to our scene. Now let’s look at the MotionControllerVisualizer script. In the Awake() function, the script is subscribing to InteractionSourceDetected and InteractionSourceLost events. The InteractionSourceDetected method calls StartTrackingController() which then calls LoadControllerModel(). Based on the AlternateController model setting, either the default controller model or the alternate controller model is loaded. Once the controllers have been loaded, these scripts then use motion controller info to find the transforms for specific controller elements. In a later chapter, we’ll learn how to use these scripts to attach UI elements to the controllers. Switch back to Unity and save our Scene. Click Play and in your headset you’ll be able to see the scene with the motion controllers, the detailed animations for button clicks, thumbstick movement, and touchpad highlights.
