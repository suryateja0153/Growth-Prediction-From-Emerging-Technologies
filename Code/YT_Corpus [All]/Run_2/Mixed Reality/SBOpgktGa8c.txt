 Let´s be honest, the world around us  is perhaps not that open-minded. Making it time for  Europe's biggest airline Lufthansa to take a stand and  „say yes to the world.“ Which became the slogan  of a campaign centered around  one single question: We turned this question into an interactive experience „Open Seats“ and invited New Yorkers to „say yes to the world.“ „yes“ „yes“ „yes“ It transports its users  to exciting destinations, where they interacted with a digital world. And just like a real trip, „Open Seats“ offers unique experiences. Users can play in a  genuine Bavarian band, celebrate the Holi festival or learn kung fu. Perfect for a souvenir photo, which is instantly available online. In four days „Opens Seats“ made hundreds of participants marvel. „wonderful“ „wonderful“ „wunderbar“ „It was really cool. Especially with the fireworks.“ „It's fun and it's something new, something different“ „Makes me wanna go to Mumbai“ And brought the message  of our campaign to life. „When you get to travel  to other places it allows you to kind of maybe open up your perspective.“
