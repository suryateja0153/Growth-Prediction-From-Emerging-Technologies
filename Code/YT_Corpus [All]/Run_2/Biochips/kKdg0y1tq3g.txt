 you welcome to this lecture and this lecture is our lecture that is focused on developing a cancer diagnosis tool so what we mean by the cancer diagnosis tool and how is it really helping or aiding a clinician to die organize the cancer in a better way than the current existing tools so we are talking about tissue related cancers all right and when you talk about tissue later cancers there are several cancers which are tissue later cancer and amongst those we'll be focusing on breast cancer so let's see what we are talking about and at the end of this course at the end of this particular lecture you will be able to fabricate or at least understand the process flow for fabricating a bio chip that can measure certain properties of tissue which can lead to a particular diagnosis all right so if we see the slide for this particular course right we are talking about cancer diagnosis tool so we will be developing a tool right that can measure multi parameter multi parameter of tissue what are multiple parameters multi parameters can be stiffness of tissue right or in another way mechanical properties of tissue right mechanical properties of tissue then will be measure we will measuring resistance of the tissue or in another way we are measuring electrical property of tissue electrical properties of tissue right third we will be measuring the change or in the temperature of the tissue when we heat the tissue from the bottom so if I place a tissue on a heater and I keep it at 37 degree centigrade to 40 degree centigrade I keep a thermistor here and I measure the temperature at the top surface let's say this is T 2 this is T 1 right and I see that how much is a variation between t2 and t1 and from that what we are measuring we are measuring the we are measuring the thermal conductivity of tissue thermal conductivity of tissue right or in in in one one sentence it is we are measuring that we are measuring mechanical electrical and thermal properties of tissue this is what I mean by multi parameter multi parameter all right measuring the electrical property mechanical property and thermal property of tissue in in one go is a multi parameter diagnostic device now another point is so if I just rub it off another point is that this diagnostic tool diagnostic tool should be portable portable that means I can take it to from one dispensary to another dispensary from one hospital setting to another hospital setting without any problem right and what is the use of this so what are the gold standards that are used in the organizing cancer right now let's say a patient is suffering from a breast cancer what what are the parameters how a person would know right the first thing is self testing look at the abnormality in the breast look at the leaky fluids all right but what else what else we need to do right and why why we have to wait to test the electrical property mechanical property thermal property of tissues right so let us see first let us understand the breast anatomy breast anatomy right and see even we are designing Micro engineering device or micro engineering or biochips which can be used for cancer diagnosis it is very important to first understand what cancer we are targeting and if we are targeting a breast cancer we should know right what is the anatomy of breast otherwise it is very difficult for us to to directly you know start fabricating the device so if you see the anatomy of breast what we see that the there is breast consists of ducts right it consists of duct then it consists of lobes it consists of fat right duct lobes and fat this is fatty tissue here then these are lobular tissues this one and then finally there is a duct right so and this whole thing is supported by bacterial muscles bacterial muscles right this is the anatomy of a breast it's just not to go in detail hmm so so three things we understand first thing is that they it consists of duct it consists of lobes it consists of fat and the breast is supported by factorial muscles factorial muscles right this much we understand now if the breasts if the cancer if the cancer happens in duct then this called ductal cancer right in the guise of breast cancer in the case of breast cancer if the cancer occurs in duct it is ductal cancer if it happens in lobes lobular cancer it happens in both duct and lobes it is called multi tumor breast cancer then if there is an inflammation inflammation it's a inflammatory breast cancer and if there is a mucus is mucinous breast cancer mucinous breast cancer so types of breast cancers are there right and it's very very important to understand this because breast cancer is second largest cause of cancer-related death in women very important disease to understand and thus it's very important to diagnose this particular cancer in early stage in fact diagnosing any cancer in early stage will double the chances of survival then you know diagnosing at a later stage or in fact triple the chances of survival all right so as you can see there is a tumor formation in the breast right and that is what we call as cancer all right now there are two types of further cancer one is called non invasive second is called invasive what is invasive and what is non-invasive hmm so when it when there is a tumor and the cells comes out of the tumor and moves to other part of the body moves to other part of the body through lymph node lymph node we all have lymph nodes okay lymph nodes lymph nodes are used to activate or to protect or to enhance our immune system lymph nodes are used or at the part of our immune system to make it simpler and the cells when they are not localized if they stay there if they stay there if the tumor says their cell stays there it is non-invasive it is not in ways invading other part of the body but if the cells moves from the present location to another part of the body through lymph nodes it is called invasive invasive kind of breast cancer invasive breast cancer right so what we understand breast cancer two types one is invasive one is non invasive then we understood that based on the area of the breast it can be further classified as ductal cancer or lobular cancer if it is in duct and low both mixed tumor cancer if it is mucinous mucinous cancer with inflammatory inflammatory cancer right this must be understood so now what are the gold standards how how it is diagnosed currently so there is a technique which is called mammography what is called mammography so let us see the next slide let us see the next slide so if you see breast cancer statistics what it says that according to World Health Organization last report of it right cancer remains a global problem around 14 point 1 million new cases arises right or were diagnosed in 2012 out of which 8.2 million people died right and again it's very difficult to understand how cancer happens what is the root cause of cancer difficult there are a lot of theories but there are a lot of speculations and theories but not a certain answer why it happens what to do to stop it what to do to prevent it right we all learn that prevention is better than cure or precaution is better than cure precaution is better than cure right so how I can be cautioned that I should not do this so that I will not have a cancer right so what I studied or what I found from the literature is that if you avoid processed foods if you avoid foods that are modified genetically modified keep it we keep our body cleaner right compared by when I say cleaner it's not just taking bad but also what food we consume are we consuming all the processed foods right are we consuming all the genetically modified foods or fruits or vegetables if so we should not we should not right so again i what i am i am telling is from my reading my experience right and what i will tell is avoid any processed food eat clean food is easier easier alright fortunately as per my understanding within our country right still there is no gene genetically modified for the the grains that are grown the fruits that are grown the vegetables that are grown are not genetically modified of course there are use of pesticides but not genetically modified right except cotton cotton is genetically modified and that's why there is a huge amount of cotton X if we can export cotton now when you modify a fruit or a vegetable or a grain right genetically then it will stay for a longer time it is fresh for a longer time it grows faster it is faster yields that the yield of the product is more right so in certain countries when you go you will find that the fruits are bigger in shape the flowers are way bigger in shape right and it does not stay for a longer time not just because of the temperature but because it is genetically modified now how much it affects the body I don't know whether it will cause cancer or not I cannot say but is it good to avoid that yes that is the precaution that is the precaution right and in fact that's why the whole world is running after organic foods organic foods what is organic food where we use the organic material to grow our grains fruits vegetables right cow dung you see how organic pesticides when you say about chemical pesticides that the pesticides in particular they also harm to a level not only they just kill insects but also harm the crops of course when I say harm the crops doesn't mean that crop dies but still it is a chemical we have to wash the fruit thoroughly vegetables thoroughly there may be part of pesticides left in the in the leaf suppose you eat spinach right but organic way of doing it is much more safer and that's what we were doing from centuries centuries right and they're from someone I heard this story and and in fact it is a real story that you know that people were making fun of our forefathers that they are using cow dung they are using coal and salt for for cleaning teeth right and now you see now you see MN sees have salt in their toothpaste right and the flutes in some of the countries they are or fruits and vegetables in some of the countries when you when you travel you will see organic markets in fact in fact in India also will now see organic markets right and they sell it at much more higher price than the fruits grown by pesticides right so the point that I'm making is the point that I'm making is that try to avoid processed food once in a while because of our lifestyle we can write and not avoid and that's fine right but try to avoid it try to our genetic immunity fight food try to learn what exactly this this all things are it's called GMO anyway so but the point is you see that there are so many cases 14 point 1 million cases out of which 8.2 million died in 2012 in fact like I said if you talk about just breast cancer breast cancer continues to be second largest cause of cancer-related female deaths in world accounting for 12% amongst all cancer 12% very high number very high number and Indian Council of medical research into 116 estimated about 14.5 like new cancer cases and projected that this is likely to reach 17.3 lake new cases in 2020 which is not too far it was also reported that breast cancer constituted an estimation of 1.5 lakh over ten percent of all cancer cases in sixteen and making it number one cancer overall you see now there is something even even worse and that is called triple negative breast cancer what's that triple negative you see here triple negative breast cancer also called TNBC which is an aggressive type of cancer accounts for about 12% of breast cancer cases and no specific treatment currently exists for this subset now this is based on the literature which is right over here I'm not making my own statements these statements are supported by the literature right triple negative breast cancer aggressive type of breast cancer twelve percent of overall breast cancer and no specific treatment exists for this subset specific treatment doesn't mean there is no treatment but specific for triple negative is not existing all right now which are other cancers tissue related cancers and why we are talking about this because we want to see that if there is a gold standard and if you see a gold standard if you G if you see the diagnosis there is lot of false positive and false negative results what exactly false positive and false negative results means that if a patient has a cancer the report comes said it is okay you are okay and if a patient is not having any any disease right now he's not suffering from the cancer the report says that you have cancer false positive false negative right that false positive false negative rates are higher so if we can if we can design a tool based on our micro engineering knowledge a little bit of editing manufacturing that is your 3d printing laser cutting right in Jiang designs you all do engineering drawing in first year of your undergrad right you use workshop so using this basic knowledge of micro-engineering additive manufacturing can we design a tool that can aid the clinician and reduce the false positive and false negative signals that is idea right that is the idea so when we talk about tissue related cancers other than breast cancers other than breast cancer which are other tissue related cancer so let us see that let's see that you see in 2015 according 2015 right it is just about United States of America so it's a the report from American Cancer Society which says that just in u.s. hmm estimated cases and estimated deaths you see estimated cases estimated death cancer type prostate cancer prostate cancer occurs in men all right that breast cancer is extremely dangerous for women poster cancer is dangerous for men and 26% is was the estimated cases in one 2015 report and 9% of the outer 26% was the estimated net for the figure for estimated amount of death a number of deaths second one was lung lung cancer both in men and women 14 13 close let 28 and 26 percent out of 14 percent that is detected 28% dies and 26 percent in women colon cancer and dictum cancer 8% 8% look at the death 8% and 9% urinary bladder 7% death from 7% for person dies breast cancer amongst 25 29 percent of estimated cases 15% from 29% is the death rate same Whalum for lymphoma thyroid leukemia light which is a blood cancer melanoma which is a skin cancer right kidney and the renal pelvis and finally uterine corpus so these are the major cancer that occurs in humans and as amount estimated death in numbers from this particular table right so when we talk about this what does exactly the statistics that we were talking about means that means that worldwide it is estimated that about one point 68 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer and 115 which means one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime one in eight right because it is one point sixty eight million women were diagnosed with breast cancer 115 that means approximately one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during the lifetime second breast cancer in United States each year in the USA the more than to add to 3 how much it is to like thirty two thousand seven hundred fourteen right to let 30 2007 foot in breast cancers where diagonalized amongst which forty three thousand nine hundred nine women died that means in u.s. for every five or six woman newly diagnosed with breast cancer one is dying for every five one is dying now let us talk about our country right so there were about one like forty four thousand nine hundred and thirty seven new cases of breast cancer in India into 115 almost with seventy thousand two hundred and eighteen women died of breast cancer in India seventy thousand right the big number big number and in general nobody should die that's what we we want right nobody whom below should die but the the the real truth of our life is that nobody can deny it right so the point the point that I am making is a loss of a family member is a great loss and that to a woman we call is a pillar of a family she is a pillar of a family men is there but woman has multiple roles you see mother sister daughter right and and and that that role no man can replace in fact it is a great great role that only a only a woman can do the loss of a woman in our society a loss of a woman in a family is a great loss is a great loss same strength same stands true for men as well but my point is why to lose anyone just because of some disease and we have the play we have the medicine to cure we have the curing pills we have the we have the all the all the tools to cure but we don't have tools to diagnose it early it's not that we we don't know how to cure but by the time we know there is something it's too late and that's why this engineering design our an understanding of engineering we can apply to solve and diagnose cancer that's why we we are learning this particular topic all right so if you see back the statistics in India for every to every two women newly diagnosed with breast cancer one is dying of it first of all we are not aware right unfortunately the hour and awareness program is not reaching to each and every you know person in the society awareness program it should be aware right what happens how to do self testing self examine where to go what kind of diagnosis we should do primary health care and when I'm talking about self awareness you will see in the next slide what I mean by that what I mean by that but the but the situation is even worst when we talk about our country and what is that for every to moment newly diagnosed one is dying one is time so if you talk about the awareness what is heaviness that a woman should go for mammography if she is below 50 for every year in mammography is testing the best to understand if there is any suspicion region or not gold centered exactly I cannot say go centered because there is a pathology also involved next to after mammography where they take the biopsy and they do the IHC and then measure the biomarkers so it's not a really good sure but but diese is a standard diagnostic tool mammography women between forty and fifty four or below that right every year they should go and do this examination do we know that how many of us knows that very few write self awareness or awareness about this disease when we are aware we can test we can diagnose early we can be healthy we can live longer a woman who is above 55 55 and emo right every two years once we show she should go and do this testing right so if you see the slide if you see the slide that's what is written or adult women of all ages are encouraged to perform breast self-exams at least once a month once a month self-examination like I said right stiffness leaky fluids inflammation that's all self-examination and mammography every year forty to fifty four right may even between this age should go every year in fact less than that should also go every year and every two years 55 in about 55 an about right so you see if you go for MRI if a patient who is suffering from breast cancer and goes to MRI and you can see in MRI the suspicious region the suspicious region right same before mammography you see this is mammography right and here you can see this suspicious is in this spot this white spot you see you're suspicious region right so what happens what happens once we once we see that there is a suspicious region or not V but the clinician looks at the suspicious region what is the next step what's the next step the next step is the next step is that the patient is advised for biopsy biopsy biopsy is when you take out the tissue from the suspicious region you take out the tissue from the suspicious region so when you take out the tissue from this suspicious region which is your tumor what next the next is the tissue is sliced tissue is sliced and sent so tissue is sent to the pathology lab pathology path lab pathology lab tissue is sent to pathology lab so when you when you do the biopsy this is a tissue you can see tissue right over here and it's sent to pad lab where it is sliced further you can see here slicing for immunohistochemistry and special staining ie Etsy and special staining you see here this one alright so when you do these ihcn special staining you are looking for certain biomarkers and if the biomarkers are then the diagnosis would be that okay the patient is suffering from cancer or the patient is not suffering from cancer so when we talk about biomarkers what are these biomarkers the biomarkers are hne estrogen Prestage n' SMA p63 and one is called H er er these are the biomarkers that the pad lab or the pathologist will be looking at what hne p63 SMA estrogen biomarkers prosto gene and h er all right this much is easy very easy right to understand it's easy but they they die out the diagnosis is not so easy it's difficult alright now what we want what we want is can we design a tool can we design a device that can measure other properties of tissue accept biomarkers or the optical way of understanding which are the mammography is also using it so here the idea is can we measure the stiffness of the tissue there is a mechanical property can we measure the resistance of the tissue electrical property can we measure the thermal property of tissue that is thermal conductivity of this and to do all three things we need to design now a bio chip that can perform all three experiments together or all three it can detect all three parameters of the tissue right so if we if we see that if we see the slide what we see that the tissue is sliced further and it is given for our experiment and another tissue is sent for Fe SEM is a scanning electromicroscope is every three at issue here if we see the tissue here now there are two regions one is a epithelial region another is stromal Legion if the cancer is in Soma Legion is called stromal cancer epithelial is an epithelial cancer 70% of cases or most of the cases in epidural region 70% of cancer breast cancer is in duct and it's called ductal cancer right so doctor cancer are about about 70% and that is again based on literature so if we perform the Fe SEM what we see is that the structure of the tissue from normal and this is IDC invasive ductal carcinoma IDC I D C invasive invasive ductal carcinoma carcinoma all right this is IDC so if you see the morphology or this the topography using the SEM image using the SEM right what we what we see we see that we see that the the IDC which is invasive ductal carcinoma the tissue is much more ruptured and the normal tissue is smoother compared to this is smoother compared to this one IDC this is normal this is normal and this one this one is cancer carcinoma so when you look at the images we look at the normal and the carcinoma then you can see that the normal tissue is smoother and the tissue which has carcinoma is rough or it is a ruptured alright this is what we see now what we want to do if you want to measure electro thermo mechanical phenotyping or we can do if you know type the basic answer so electro thermo mechanical phenotyping of breast cancer all right so let's see let's see what should our bio chip consists of my chip consists of a bottom layer which is micro heater which is a micro heater on this micro heater so you can see here process flow okay look at the process flow here and then we will see how we can fabricate this thing that I will show you the process flow in detail right now just concentrate on this particular slide on this particular image process flow first is you take a silicon wafer this is sin all right second step is you grow oxide this is sio2 on silicon then you form a micro heater you can see here you deposit a metal do lithography do lithography and form a micro heater okay on micro heater you again deposit an insulator sio2 on micro heater I will say mhm just to make it easy you get it where are we right now silicon silicon oxide that is grown on silicon on which we have using photolithography we have patterned micro heater okay and then there is a insulator on micro heater the reason of placing this insulator is that next would be our inter digitated electrodes you can see here right this one this step but I cannot directly pattern interdigital electrodes on micrometer because metal of micrometer and metal of in the indonesian electrode will get shorted we can short electrical short right so to avoid this short we are depositing or we are growing insulator on the micro heater and then we are we are forming the we are we are depositing gold and pattern 8 pattern 8 using lithography using lithography to obtain inter digitated electrodes now in between there is a step where you open the contacts you don't deposit the material so here also there should be a contact like this you don't deposit or you you deposit silicon dioxide then you perform lithography such that the contact area is open only the window here you can see that one that should be open that means they they're silicon dioxide should not be there otherwise we cannot take contact to the heater right so after this you perform you deposit a you and perform lithography so that you will obtain this particular state after this you deposit you deposit in this step piece your resistor material pzo resistive p 0 resistive material and pattern 8 pattern it so you get this 4 squares and you can see right over here right over here okay after this after PC register there is one more step which is not which is not mentioned here but there is one more step very again guru ah after after step 6 you take this one and then grow or silicon dioxide alright then you deposit then you deposit gold and form a pair which is here on this pair you deposit su 8 su 8 in 4 n pattern 8 in form of pillar and then you make su 8 conductive by using lift of technique lift of technique again when you get when you do this you will obtain this from the backside if I edge the silicon using bulk micromachining that we have learned early then I will have you see I have etched the silicon from backside so what will I have I will have a diaphragm I will have a diaphragm on which the entire structure is there so if you see this particular structure this one then below this below the circle below the circle on the back side there is a edging so when I press it there will be a bending right you get it so the the front side is the pad so here if you see the the pad is somewhere like this on the front side backside there is a thing on that pen this structure is there right so we have h the silicon from backside using bulk micromachining so let us see quickly once again what we have done what we have done here we have take we have started with a silicon substrate right then we have grown oxide which is number 2 then we have deposited a metal for micro heater and pattern the micro heater then we deposit silicon dioxide which is an insulator and we pattern the insulator such that the contact area is open here on that V deposit gold and we pattern the goal to form inter digitated electrodes on individual electrodes we deposit piezo resistive material which is six number here and pattern it to form the squares on that we have an insulating material on which we have a gold pad and gold pad is patterned on which there is an su 8 there are su 8 pillars and these su 8 pillars are made conductive using liftoff technique which is number 9 and on the backside we create we etch the silicon to to create a diaphragm to obtain finally this particular this particular design right and the chip is right over here chip is right over here so what's the use of this right what's the use of this we should know what's the use of this let's see what's the use of this we have now three things if you have notice we have three things what first is I have a heater second thing I have a p0 resistors third thing I have a electrode you see this one this is the electrode if you see this one let's say electrode electrode to just mean we are just giving a name well let's say electrode one this electrode one consists of four su eight pillars on gold pad and this everything is conductive and this gold pad is connected externally so that from here we can apply or we can we can we have one power point which is our electrode one one contact pad for electrode one three things we have right heater is resistant electrode now let us see how we will use this one and where we will place this thing so see this structure see this structure and look at this structure in particular first what is it it is in rod right that has that has conductive is conductive is conductive rod sorry conduct e rod and it is a thermistor thermistor and it is conductive so it can be our electrode number two there is a thermistor here and it is conductive right so this is our indenter what do we say indenter indenter is used to indent like let us say if I have a material or I have a tissue this can press it this can indent it indenter alright conductive electrodes because it is a conductive and we have thermistor at the tip of the indenter understood this much now what we will do now what we will do so we will design a case using 3d printing such that this case consists of top part which is right over here you can see this particular portion it consists of top part right and in the top that is a rubber packing then there is a press fit contact pins press fit contact pins then there is a middle part then there is a microchip or bio chip then there is a spring then there is a bottom part and then there are alignment columns right what is that let's see once again top part press fit context middle part microchip or bio chip spring bottom part and alignment columns okay this much we have now what we will do if I press wait everything if I bring everything together if I bring this whole structure together it will look like this you got it if I press this structure together what it will look like you look like the one that I have shown it to you here which is this particular structure you can see spring you can see 12-pin connector you can see the bio chip within right you can see the biochip c12 in greater biochip there's a spring and then there is a conical flask like thing here right here you can see here the top part we have created this structure hmm so what exactly we have done here we have we have made a 3d printed case such that it consists of or it is integrated with the microchip there are no shoulder there are no shoulder wires there is there is no shouldering there is no wire bonding no shouldering no wire bonding but there is a persuade contact press with context right this particular design is such a design that it makes our life so easy we do not have to do worthwhile shouldering we don't have to go for wire ball bonding and we just have to load our chip within this 3d printer case and we press it press fitted because of the press fit context we can take out the way signal or we can measure the signal from the external pins directly one thing one advantage second is that now you can lower the tissue you can lower the tissue in this particular section and this tissue when you when you press with everything this tissue will you can see this funnel going all the way around like if you I say draw here it goes all the way around like this right and where the better you end it ends in the center of the bio chip it ends in the center of the bio chip that means if I lower the tissue here if I lower the tissue here right I bring that issue down right so what will happen finally the tissue will be placed on the bio chip you got it the tissue will be placed on the bio chip so if I place the tissue you can see this funnel right funnel and we at the bottom of the funnel there is a the center of the tissue is that this one so the tissue is placed directly in the center of the by chip using this particular mechanism all right you got it so if I place that issue like this and if I place this indenter so there is a tissue let's say this is a tissue on the bio chip and now what I am doing I am using an indenter this indenter which is our electrode - right and on the bio chip on this bio chip what we have we have electrode one right let's see back we have this electrode one so if I apply voltage between electrode one and electrode 2 then the current will pass through the tissue right based on the tissue resistance you get it if I have electrode one on bio chip electrode 2 is on indenter if I press it if I apply voltage between a1 and a2 then the current will pass through the tissue based on the tissue resistance and that's why I can measure the resistance of the tissue I can measure the resistance of the tissue one thing second if i press this indenter if i press this indenter if i indent the tissue down then the tissue will ex the force exerted by this indenter will be transferred to thee will be transferred to the piezo resistors via tissue right if I indent this indenter in this direction with a particular amount of force in micro nano Newton this force will be transferred to the bio chip and the bio chip has piezo resistors so how much force will transfer to by a bio chip based on the stiffness of the tissue so the amount of force applied and amount of force transferred to the bio chip there we'll help us to determine what is the elasticity of the tissue or stiffness of the tissue right in the t stitched tissue is stiff then the amount of force will be different if tissue is smoother if tissue is less stiff sorry not smoother left stiff if the tissue is less stiff then the amount of force transferred would be different right so now now we can measure the mechanical properties of tissue you got it two things you got it right right third thing what is there here thermistor what is that what our bio chip consists of or bio chip consists of heater heater right so now if I heat the tissue from the bottom the bottom of the tissue I heat it with the help of the heater which is integrated on my bio chip and let's say the temperature is 40 degree centigrade I can measure the top surface of the tier the temperature the top surface of the tissue I see the bottom surface has 40 degree I can measure the temperature at the top surface of the tissue with the help of thermistor with the help of thermistor so now I have t1 which is let us say t1 is 40 and with help of thermistor t2 right from this since I know the temperature the bottom surface the amount of temperature at the top surface so if the temp there is a temperature difference and based on that I can measure the thermal conductivity of the dish short I can measure thermal properties of tissue or thermal conductivity of tissue you get it so now if I place the tissue if the place that issue in this particular setup I can measure the mechanical electrical which is resistance and thermal properties of tissue cool so what will I do with this if I can measure elliptical thermal mechanical properties of tissue and how it is really helpful right how it is really helpful so let us see let us see first of all when when we measure electrical property and thermal property is it different my point was that if we develop this biochip and we measure the electrical thermal and mechanical properties of tissue are the electrical thermal and mechanical properties of normal tissue different than cancer tissue right are the electrical thermal mechanic properties of normal tissue different than cancer tissue and if there are difference then we can understand that a tissue is changing is property the disease is progressing and we can diagnose that is the the change in the tissue property and thus the week and I organized the cancer possibly at earlier stage right so but can we understand the signature anyway as a signature of the tissue or properties that is changing in the tissue so for that let us see the result let us see the result so what we see here again is so one way is that you take that life T lie biopsy means wet when you take the biopsy biopsies when you take the tissue from the suspicious region out right and directly place the tissue on to this system on to this tool or you can you can save this tissue in the stitch bank right which is using the paraffin block using the paraffin block there is a standard way of storing the tissue in a tissue bank and whenever you want to use it whenever you want to test it you can deeper a fine a nice tissue means you you you remove the paraffin right take the tissue out and place a tissue on this device on this tool you see here is a deeper if a nice tissue this white one deep paraffin ice tissue this is a paraffin ice tissue paraffin ice tissue alright so that is one thing now when we measure when we measure the normal tissues and cancerous tissues in here we are taken case of invasive ductal carcinoma or IDC that's how you can see here IDC alright IDC so we have used invasive ductal carcinoma or IDC and with the help of indenter when we indent the tissue with width depth of indentation with the depth of indentation in micrometers we could see the compression force compression force and we can clearly see you can clearly see that the force obtained the compression force obtained from normal tissues normal tissues is different than cancerous tissue is different than carcinoma second the resistivity the resistivity of the normal tissues is different than the resistivity of the cancerous tissues third the thermal conductivity you can see this these three lines here the thermal conductivity of cancerous tissues is different than thermal conductivity of normal tissues what we see that the there is all all three properties changes all the repetition is in fact when you see the normal tissues and take the SEM do the cancer tissues and you take SEM you will see that the cancerous tissue shows much more ruptured structures what is rupturing what is not smooth when something is not smooth the resistance would increase wear resistance is increasing the thermal conductivity also would be this and right and that is what we have measured here that is what we have measured here so if you see that from mechanical electrical and thermal property of tissues we can get a sense that when we will be measuring lot of samples we would have a particular signature that will help us to diagnose whether there is cancer or not or you can diagnose cancer in fact in an earlier stage in an earlier stage right because the properties of tissue would be different as the disease progresses as the disease progresses all right and all the things that I am talking about is from the publication I Triple E transactions on biomedical engineering which is published which was published earlier in 2016 or 17 16 probably and these are all the results that is from the same publication so if you want to just go back and see this paper towards a portable diagnosis tool using a disposable MEMS based chip from I triple TB Emmy you can go you can read in detail what exactly we have done I Triple E transactions on biomedical engineering okay so now the point is if we know these things now if we know that we need to fabricate we need to fabricate the bio chip right we need to fabricate a bio chip which will have the heater which will have piezo resistors and which would have electrodes then we have seen here process flow but let us now see how you can fabricate each of this component each of this sensor on the bio chip alright so in the in the next module in the next module we will be looking at each of these sensors that we can fabricate on a bio chip right from heater then interdigital electrodes or which there is a piezo register or which there is a electrode on which there are su-8 pillars on which we are making Seop less conductive because su it is a polymer non conductive polymer and finally we are creating a diaphragm by etching the silicon from the backside right bulk micromachining so we will see in the next module the fabrication or the process flow for families a fabricating this bio chip what I will like you to do is go through this module once again also read about types of cancer read about breast cancer in fact when you go to youtube and write down breast cancer and its stages breast cancer any stages you will be able to understand thoroughly or slightly better how exactly the cancer progresses and what are the stages of cancer then by understanding that you may get more problems and probably with that problems you may have more solutions and the solutions can be or may be based on the knowledge that we are acquiring by understanding the micro engineering right can you come up with a new device a novel device a better device that what I am showing it to you that is the idea the idea of you know discussing and exchanging the viewpoints the knowledge is that we we increase we we make our research better we come up with new ideas new technologies there can be metter than the existing one on what I am performing on whatever I am doing is what I know can you come up with a better solution than what I know then it is worth of you know talking and discussing and understanding the micro engineering right that is ideas I think about it read and and learn this videos once again learn and go through this module once again and in the next module let us see how we can draw a process flow what should be the recipe so that we can fabricate this biochip all right till then you take care I'll see you in the next module bye
