 Argonne National Laboratory as a science and engineering research National Laboratory operated by the University of Chicago Argonne LLC for the United States Department of Energy located in Lemont Illinois outside Chicago it is the largest National Laboratory by size and scope in the Midwest Argonne was initially formed to carry out Enrico Fermi's work on nuclear reactors as part of the Manhattan Project and it was designated as the first national laboratory in the United States on July 1st 1946 in the post-war era the lab focused primarily on non-weapon related nuclear physics designing and building the first power producing nuclear reactors helping design the reactors used by the USS nuclear Navy and a wide variety of similar projects in 1994 the labs nuclear mission ended and today it maintains a broad portfolio in basic science research energy storage and renewable energy environmental sustainability supercomputing and national security you Chicago Argonne LLC the operator of the laboratory brings together the expertise of the University of Chicago the sole member of the LLC with Jacobs Engineering Group Inc Argonne as a part of the expanding Illinois technology and research corridor Argonne formerly ran a smaller facility called Argonne National Laboratory West or simply Argonne West in Idaho next to the Idaho national engineering and environmental laboratory in 2005 the to Idaho based laboratories merged to become the Idaho National Laboratory you topic overview argon has five main areas of focus these goals as stated by the DOE in 2008 consist of conducting basic scientific research operating national scientific facilities enhancing the nation's energy resources developing better ways to manage environmental problems protecting national security topic history argon began in 1942 as the metallurgical laboratory at the University of Chicago which became part of the Manhattan Project the Met lab built Chicago pile one the world's first nuclear reactor under the stands of a University of Chicago sports stadium considered unsafe in 1943 cp1 was reconstructed as cp2 in what is today known as red gate woods but was then the Argonne forest of the Cook County Forest Preserve District near Palos Hills the lab was named after the surrounding Argonne forest which in turn was named after the forest of Argonne in France where US troops fought in World War one Fermi's Pyle was originally going to be constructed in the Argonne forest and construction plans were set in motion but a labor dispute brought the project to a halt since speed was paramount the project was moved to the squash court under Stagg field the football field on the campus of the University of Chicago Fermi told them that he was sure of his calculations which said that it would not lead to a runaway reaction which would have contaminated the city other activities were added to Argonne over the next five years on July 1st 1946 the metallurgical laboratory was formerly recharter Dazz Argonne National Laboratory for Cooperative Research in nucleonic s-- at the request of the US Atomic Energy Commission it began developing nuclear reactors for the nation's peaceful nuclear energy program in the late 1940s and early 1950s the laboratory moved to a larger location in unincorporated DuPage County Illinois and established a remote location in Idaho called Argonne West to conduct further nuclear research in quick succession the laboratory designed and built Chicago pile 319 for for the world's first heavy water moderated reactor and the experimental breeder reactor I Chicago pile four built in Idaho which lit a string of four light bulbs with the world's first nuclear generated electricity in 1951 a complete list of the reactors designed and in most cases built and operated by Argonne can be viewed in the reactors designed by Argonne page the knowledge gained from the Argonne experiments conducted with these reactors one formed the foundation for the designs of most of the commercial reactors currently used throughout the world for electric power generation and to inform the current evolving designs of liquid metal reactors for future commercial power stations conducting classified research the laboratory was heavily secured all employees and visitors needed badges to pass a checkpoint many of the buildings were classified and the laboratory itself was fenced and guarded such alluring secrecy drew visitors both authorized including King Leopold the third of Belgium and Queen Frederica of Greece an unauthorized shortly past 1:00 a.m. on February 6 1951 Argonne guards discovered reporter Paul Harvey near the 10 foot 3.0 m/s in the barbed wire searching his car guards found a previously prepared for page broadcast detailing the saga of his unauthorized entrance into a classified hot zone he was brought before a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to obtain information on national security and transmit it to the public but was not indicted not all nuclear technology went into developing reactors however while designing a scanner for reactor fuel elements in 1957 Argonne physicist William Nelson Beck put his own arm inside the scanner and obtained one of the first ultrasound images of the human body remote manipulators designed to handle radioactive materials laid the groundwork for more complex machines used to clean up contaminated areas sealed laboratories or caves in 1964 the Janus reactor opened to study the effects of neutron radiation on Biological life providing research for guidelines on safe exposure levels for workers at power plants laboratories and hospitals scientists at Argonne pioneered a technique to analyze the moon's surface using alpha radiation which launched aboard the surveyor v in 1967 and later analyzed lunar samples from the Apollo 11 mission in addition to nuclear work the laboratory maintained a strong presence in the basic research of physics and chemistry in 1955 Argonne chemists Co discovered the elements einsteinium and fermium elements 99 and 100 in the periodic table in 1962 laboratory chemists produced the first compound of the inert noble gas xenon opening up a new field of chemical bonding research in 1963 they discovered the hydrated electron high-energy physics made a leap forward when argon was chosen as the site of the 12.5 GeV 0 gradient synchrotron a proton accelerator that opened in 1963 a bubble chamber allowed scientists to track the motions of subatomic particles as they zipped through the chamber in 1970 they observed the neutrino in a hydrogen bubble chamber for the first time meanwhile the laboratory was also helping to design the reactor for the world's first nuclear-powered submarine the USS Nautilus which steamed for more than 500 13500 15 nautical miles 950 1090 kilometers the next nuclear reactor model was experimental boiling water reactor the forerunner of many modern nuclear plants an experimental breeder reactor 2 e BR 2 which was sodium-cooled and included a fuel recycling facility eb r2 was later modified to test other reactor designs including a fast Neutron reactor and in 1982 the integral fast reactor concept a revolutionary design that reprocessed its own fuel reduced its atomic waste and withstood safety tests of the same failures that triggered the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island disasters in 1994 however the US Congress terminated funding for the bulk of Argon's nuclear programs Argonne moved to specialized in other areas while capitalizing on its experience in physics chemical sciences and metallurgy in 1987 the laboratory was the first to successfully demonstrate a pioneering technique called plasma wakefield acceleration which accelerates particles in much shorter distances than conventional accelerators it also cultivated a strong battery research program following a major push by then director Alan Sri
