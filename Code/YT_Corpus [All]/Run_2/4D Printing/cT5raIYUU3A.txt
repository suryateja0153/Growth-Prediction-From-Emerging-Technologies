 In this video we'll see how to calibrate the printer base position. In this printer (BIQU Magician) that's an automatic process. In other printers this has to be done manually. Position the sensor on the hot end. (It must be cold) Select "Leveling" and confirm. The head will go down at diferent positions to touch the base, measuring it's height. In other printers the base calibration is made manually adjusting the screws holding it. The first thing to do is to connect the pressure sensor.
