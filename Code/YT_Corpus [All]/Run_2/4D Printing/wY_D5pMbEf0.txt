 okay today we're going to be seeing if it's possible to actually use a laser to shine it on your cornea and reshape your cornea so you can actually see better and so in order to show you this I actually underwent real LASIK eye surgery and filmed it in the operating room so you could see what's actually happening to my eye during LASIK eye surgery so let me show you what's going to happen during the operation okay so to show you how this works first I'll perform my own LASIK eye surgery on this eye here which is actually an egg and then I'll show you the performance of a real surgeon on my real eye in the operating room so I have the actual instruments that I asked the surgeon if I could keep from my own surgery so here's what happens so first they stick this thing on your eye and it has kind of a suction cup on it and it's going to go right over your iris like that and then they put you in a different chair and this piece is hooked to a machine that has a laser on it and this piece has to dock together so basically your eye is it your eye is on it like this and this piece comes over and they dock it down and it has to fit right in there and this piece has a hard glass lens on it right here and so this is going to dock into here and it's going to get pushed right up against your eye and they suction it against your eye like this well it sucks the eye right up in there against the lens so it does apply some pressure to it it doesn't hurt because they put numbing drops in but basically this lens is pressed up against your eye and now here's where the they create a corneal flap and so it's called a laser microtome it's a femtosecond laser and it shoots the laser light right down in the middle there and it's focused just under the outer layer of your cornea and what happens is right where it's focused it creates a plasma right underneath the outer layer of your cornea and it creates tiny little plasma bubbles so this laser starts shooting and it rasters up and down and up and down and goes across your eye and so it separates a tiny little corneal flap and that's the flap that the surgeon is then going to flip up so let's create my corneal flap with my high-strength laser here three to one so after they do that the cornea is now foggy because there's this layer of gas in between there and then this is the cool part then the surgeon comes in and grabs that flap with a better tool than what I have here and then pills it up and now this is the part that actually shapes your cornea so at this point he moves me to another machine and has me look up at a light and he tells me to watch that light and this is a special kind of laser it's an ultraviolet laser and it tracks my pupil so even if you shift your eye a little bit it's always tracking it and what it does is it vaporizes the part of your eye that needs to be reshaped and so it reshapes your cornea so it can focus the light better so as you're looking up this ultraviolet laser which you can't see comes down and it starts itching your eye away and it makes this buzzing sound and as its itching you can actually kind of smell the I getting etched away which it was a little bit weird and that only takes a few seconds and then the surgeon gently puts down the and that only takes a few seconds and then the surgeon gently puts down the corneal flap smooths it down and then your eye begins to heal on its own and that flap will reseal within like six hours they said and so the flap seals down and it basically has a natural band-aid on it to start healing your eye okay now that you saw how it worked on an a guy let's see what it looks like on my actual eyes so let's check out my real LASIK eye surgery filmed so first I met with the eye surgeon dr. Cornell and asked him a few questions about the procedure okay holy cow here we go about to go into the oh are you operated on okay so first they put in the numbing drops here and I've got a little stress ball here for you okay I just read that instead okay we are ahead cover up your left eye go ahead close both eyes dr. Cornell and now as I'm laying down they're putting those suction cups on my eye okay [Music] and then they're gonna swing me over to the other chair and then they put me over under the machine and now they're docking it against my eye now this part was the most uncomfortable part this is the part where because of the pressure that's on your eye it actually makes your eye kind of black out and you can actually mimic this if you just kind of push on the side of your eye if you do that for a long time eventually your vision will just kind of black out that's because you're cutting off the circulation to your eye so it's not getting the blood flow and knees to create that vision so now they have these two pieces docked together and this lens is against my eye squished up against my eye so you can see the laser form this plasma underneath the thin layer of my cornea here and so it turns Y as it forms this plasma underneath and it goes up and down and up and down so basically basically you just see this white move across my pupil now for the other eye and the left eye okay I kind of the red line [Music] [Music] okay thank you now at this point help me up and it's just the foggy I can't really see anything because I have this kind of gap under my cornea now that's filled with I guess gases there's a making it a little bit foggy and so then I moved to the different laser and this is the laser that has the waveguide that actually shapes my cornea now this is the cool part this is where the surgeon has to get in there and pull that corneal flap up so during this I didn't actually know what he was doing at this point I just kind of felt pressure on my eye it's really cool to see afterwards what's happening [Music] dr. Cornel was amazing amazingly smooth hands you can see that little tiny very thin flap getting pulled up [Music] and this is a part where you can smell the vaporizing cornea [Music] and then he puts the cornea flap back down in flow [Music] now the other eye [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] football's a good idea and a great idea let you speak you're going something like this Dadu it's actually not that bad the worst part was them that beginning Venice I almost just rubbed my eyes just that okay see if I check it right yes let's take a picture here document this okay and guess what I'm not wearing no more contacts and glasses well give him a thumbs up you did okay so the reason I did this I was actually planning on getting LASIK already and just the date before my surgery I called him and I asked if it'd be okay if I filmed it cuz I thought it'd be really cool to see the actual eye surgery and I thought you guys would like it and sure enough they said sure it's great if you film it and so they actually did it for me for free and they said if I just put a link in my description if anybody's been thinking about LASIK surgery check out the link in my description LASIK plus is a great option it was I love the staff here everything went really well so check it out if you're thinking about it or if you've been curious about it check out my description I'll put a link there for a discount if you want and then after all that's done they eat your eye oh no they don't nevermind so I'm about four days post-surgery now and I can see almost perfectly clearly now it's a little cloudy but it takes a few weeks to clear up it takes a few weeks for the fluid that got between that flap and everything and your eye being inflamed from the laser takes a few weeks for that to go away completely but as of now it's like I'm wearing glasses hey everybody thanks for watching another episode of the action lab I hope you enjoyed it if you did hit that subscribe button and hit the bell to be notified in my latest videos out and head over to the action lab comm if you haven't checked out my new action lab subscription box thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
