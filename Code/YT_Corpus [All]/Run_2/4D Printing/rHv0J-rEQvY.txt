 in this video we explore 3D printing you'll see the tech already in use from printing running shoes to houses so let's get started one of the most fun aspects is 3D printing when we look at exponential technologies what is 3D printing it's printing physical objects from a digital model you just take a computer-aided design you transfer the design to a printer instead of printing on a piece of paper it prints it in 3D pretty cool huh we can print with thousands of materials metal plastic wax rubber composites concrete nylon this reduces R&D in production costs it cuts inventory and lead time it makes virtually zero waste and allows you to personalize really extensively these printers are getting really really cheap you can now get them for a hundred bucks they were 40 grand a decade ago that's four hundred times cheaper in seven years Mini Coopers now have 10,000 options virtually anything you want in a Mini Cooper you can have produced this Shelby Cobra replica 100% printed ya they built that car on a 3D printer the F-35 fighter has 900 parts that were manufactured on a 3D printer NASA is funding development of a 3D printer that will print food this is how we're gonna get astronauts to Mars you can't possibly put enough food in the spacecraft for that long a journey so you print the food on on your way you'll do the same with tools because you don't know what tools you're gonna need you know what you don't know what replacement parts you're gonna need on the journey so you have a printer there and you manufacture the part on the fly as needed don't need it anymore destroy it put the material back and manufacturer the next part with the same materials Harvard scientists have printed electronic circuits using a 3D printer this thing only costs $8,000 you can print your own computer the FDA allows this this is an anti-seizure medication and it's 3D printed it allows the drug to be made less expensively and it dissolves more quickly in the stomach to deliver the drug to the body faster faster cheaper what's wrong with that and of course we can make all kinds of things with an extraordinary complexity that we couldn't do before such as this what's that it's a windpipe this was built for a child who was born with a defective windpipe the University of Michigan doctors implanted it using tiny splints to support the baby's windpipe we're printing ears were printing all kinds of body parts here in picking University's hospital they're printing vertebrae for a 12 year old who was suffering from cancer that was in 2025 now we're doing is with ribs as well take a look at this 3D printers let doctors create a prosthetic for children who were born with missing fingers the materials cost 20 bucks by the way you want to print an ear the 3D bioprinter is only five thousand dollars at Oxford scientists are printing material that covers half the width of a human hair that's extraordinarily tiny we can use this to deliver medicine or to replace tissues in germany their Institute there is print is printing a robot so small it can travel through the bloodstream it can deliver medicine to a single spot it can provide missing substances like cartilage and we all love to be different well 3D printing lets you do exactly that with 3D printing everything as we spoke so any product you want you can have custom designed the way you want it to be take a look at those Nike shoes and the lower-right those are called fly nets those were already on the market 3D printed 150 bucks available on their website and in running shoe stores all over the world you can have them in pretty much any color you want you know the traditional car company spends about three billion dollars to bring its new models to the market Local Motors is a new car company they do for three million bucks because they print their cars that is a 3D printed car a thousand times cheaper than a traditional car development you know we've talked about making ears vertebrae making running shoes through a 3D printer how'd you like to print a house check this out the introduction of highly sophisticated computer modeling technologies has meant that designing the shape and form of a building is now only limited by an architect's imagination leading architectural practices such as Foster and partners are designing buildings to a level of geometrical complexity unheard of ten years ago however while these forms can often be achieved through off-site factory-based manufacturing techniques there are significant limits to the levels of intricacy attainable for example pouring concrete into a framework can go some way to fulfilling these ambitions but the reality is that the achievable complexity is still limited the manufacturing process is required to turn these complex building designs into reality have remained elusive until now this may be about to change if current research by scientists at Loughborough University comes to fruition the research group has been inspired by 3D printing an additive manufacturing process here information created from computer generated models is exported to a machine which then builds up a model or component layer by layer the virtual model is in effect materialized at Loughborough instead of using powder and glue they are experimenting with concrete to create large-scale building components concrete printing works on the basis of a highly controlled extrusion of cement based mortar which is precisely positioned according to computer data the process has the potential to create architecture that is more unique in form but crucially components do not have to be made from solid material and so can use resources more efficiently than traditional techniques for example the section which you can see being manufactured here could incorporate all the service requirements of a building such as pipes and cables in one unit this process is capable of producing building components of a degree of customization that's not yet been seen it could create an era of architecture that's adapted to the environment of a fully integrated with engineering function imagine whole sections of a building being printed and then assembled on-site with their service provision already installed above all imagine a building whose form and scale could take on limitless possibilities 3D printer revenue is skyrocketing on a global basis in 2015 it was a 1.6 billion dollar market by 2018 13 billion a tenfold increase in the marketplace we're looking at the medical and dental markets skyrocketing over the next 10 years but there is a bit of a problem 3D printing is causing a hundred billion dollars in losses to intellectual property because someone can take your artistic design say in jewelry and they can manufacture that product on their own 3d printer denying you the licensing and royalty rights so it demonstrates as we will see a bit later on there's always some downsides associated with these technologies oh by the way what's coming next 4D and 5D printing what's 4D printing well we know a 3D is printing in three dimensions but 4D is when it prints when you need it to such as you install something into a pipe you don't need to activate unless the pipe leaks so water changes or humidity time or temperature or light activate the printing process 5d printing picture George Jetson in his self-flying car when he arrives on the pad that car becomes a briefcase they're already making guitars that fold into boxes making them easy to travel on an airplane 4D and 5D printing ain't seen nothing yet what are the personal finance implications of all this well you want to make room for a 3D printer in your home office as well as your kitchen because yeah you're going to be printing your food in the future 3D printing technologies create wonderful investment opportunities but also some pretty big risks as many companies try to enter the space but fail to do so hope you're enjoying this video series you're watching The Truth About Your Future that's it for this video in our next video we explore medicine and neuroscience you'll see why you're likely to live not just to your 80s or 90s but to age 110 or 120 and why you'll be healthier and feel younger at age 95 then at age 55 this series is based on my New York Times bestseller The Truth About Your Future the money guide you need now later and much later if at any point you have any questions you can send them to me by visiting TheTruthAboutYourFuture.com thanks for watching
