 Good evening, everyone, and hello. And today, I am very excited to give you a glimpse into the future of materials. So, most of you must have come across those news report of those disastrous pipe plant explosions. Did you know that they are most often caused due to a simple thing like corrosion? Studies estimate that globally, corrosion costs a staggering $2.5 trillion a year, and $875 billion of that could have been simply avoided with proper corrosion protection mechanisms in place. This is the primary motive of my research here at the University of Illinois, where I study and develop smart decoding systems, systems that can autonomously react with their environment and prevent degradation. I primarily work with the development of self healing and self protecting coating systems, which is exactly as the name suggests. The first figure here, in my opinion, shows a very simple, yet elegant solution of how we achieve that. The coatings are embedded with what we call microcapsules, which are nothing but tiny microscopic containers, which are carefully engineered to encapsulate some sort of a healing agent or an anti corrosive agent. And this is where I come in, the design of these microcapsules. So, when there is damage to these coatings, these healing agents are released, thus healing the damage and preventing further corrosion. As you can see in the last image, the scanning electron micrograph, which, by the way, is just a very fancy microscope, which allows us to look at very small things with very fine detail, you can clearly see that there is significantly less corrosion product in the self protecting coating, compared to the control coating, which lacks these carefully engineered microcapsules. We've also made sunlight activated self healing coatings, where the healing action is in response to exposure to sunlight, like one would encounter in scenarios, such as oil and gas pipelines above the ground. And guess what? We are already close to commercializing it. So, the current phase of my research now focuses on additionally making these coatings environmentally stimuli responsive. That is, to make them react to certain stimuli from the surrounding medium. So, what do I mean by that? To give you an example, when there is corrosion, the surrounding medium becomes acidic in nature due to formation of acids. And so I'm developing these special microcapsules, which would release the healing agents in response to acidity rather than waiting to be broken through damage. Additionally, I could also engineer them for other sorts of stimuli, such as heat [inaudible], which would then lend itself to various other applications. I mean, most of us here, at least some of us here, must have gone through the suffering of a cracked screen on their phone or laptop. And then especially me, having gone through the agony of two, what if I tell you that someday, we could heal those screens without having to pay for those hefty replacements? Wouldn't that just be simply amazing? On that note, I will leave you all to ponder over the future of smart materials. Thank you so much.
