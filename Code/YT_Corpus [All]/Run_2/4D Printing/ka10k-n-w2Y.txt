  THIS WEEK WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT 3D PRINTING, AND HOW IT'S REVOLUTIONIZING SOME INDUS WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH MANUFACTU 3D PRINTING IS A PROCESS THAT TAKES A DIGITAL DESIGN AND CREATES A PHYSICAL OBJECT USING A PIECE OF MACHINERY THAT WORKS ON AN "X, Y, AND Z" AXIS. STEVE LONGPRE IS THE FOUNDER AN CEO OF "BARN STORM STUDIO ADDITIVE" IN SOUTH HADLEY. WHEN HE FIRST OPENED THE DOORS OF HIS BUSINESS, HE FOCUSED ON HELPING OTHER COMPANIES DEVELOP THEIR IDEAS INTO PROTOTYPES. NOW HIS FOCUS IS ON PRINTING THINGS USING RECYCLED SCRAP MED STEVE BELIEVES THIS PROCESS WIL REVOLUTIONIZE MANUFACTURING WHE IT COMES TO LOWERING THE COST O PRODUCTS, AND PRODUCER ALEJANDR CAMERON BRINGS US THE STORY.  I'M THE FOUND ER AND CEO OF THE PRINTING COMPANY. IT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS. IT HAS BEEN USED EXTENSIVELY IN PROTOTYING PRINTING FOR THE CONSUMER, USED IN THE AEROSPACE AND USED IN TOOLING MATERIALS OF BRACKETS AND FIXTURES AND JIG FOR ASSEMBLING PART. SO IT HAS A VERY LONG HISTORY OF USE BUT AT THE SAME TIME I SAW IT, IT WAS BECOMING MAINSTREAM. LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE STARTING TO USE IT IN THEIR SMALL OFFICES OR SHOP AS A MEANS TO MAKE END USE PARTS.  THIS IS A PROJECT WE WORKED ON WITH A COMPANY IN NEW ZEALAND CALLED THE BREAD PICK. BASICALLY THEY PRODUCE A GUITAR PACK THAT -- PICK THAT IS ACTUALLY A BREAD BAG CLOSURE AND THEY ARE PRODUCING IT FOR A GROCERY CHAIN AND THIS IS THE FINAL PROJECT FOR A PLACE CALLED THE TOAST CAFE. WHAT WE DID WAS HELP THEM DEVELOP A DUAL USE GUITAR PICK, IT HAS A CHIP THAT STORES A SONG SO YOU CAN DOWNLOAD MUSIC EVERY TIME YOU BUY A LOAF OF BREAD. IT IS THE METHOD AT WHICH WE MAKE OBJECTS. WE MANUFACTURE PROTOTYPES OUT OF THERMO PLASTICS IN A PLAYER BY LAYER FASHION. LIKE THE PC WAS HUGE IN THE 80s, IT IS REALIZED THIS COULD BE HUGE THING IN A FEW YEARS AND THAT IS WHAT STARTED IT FOR US. I WAS LOOKING AROUND THE INTERNET AT COMPANIES THAT WERE DOING EXCITING THINGS IN TECHNOLOGY AND I SAW A FEW PRINTING COMPANIES THAT CAPTURED THE ATTENTION OF THE MEDIA, MAKERS MOVEMENT AT THE TIME. ONE OF WHICH MANAGED TO BE ACQUIRED FOR $400 MILLION. IN CAUGHT MY ATTENTION AND TOLD ME A LOT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE INDUSTRY AND THEN I LOOKED AROUND TO SEE WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY LEARN HOW TO 3D PRINT SOMETHING AND THERE WAS NOTHING OUT THERE. NONE OF THE COLLEGES HAD ANY TYPE OF COURSE OR EQUIPMENT SO I DECIDED I COULD MAKE A SMALL INVESTMENT AND LEARN THE TECHNOLOGY MYSELF. OUR TRADITIONAL CUSTOMER IS SOMEONE WHO WOULD CALL UP AND SAY WE HAVE A IDEA FOR A PRODUCT, A SPORTS DEVICE OR A CONSUMER PRODUCT OR A BRACKET OR TOOL FOR A MANUFACTURING COMPANY AND WE WOULD INTERVIEW THEM TO SEE WHAT KIND OF METHOD THEY ARE USING CURRENTLY TO MANUFACTURE THAT PRODUCT. WE THEN LOOK TO FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THE PRODUCT FITS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE MANUFACTURING OR 3D PRINTING AND WE MAKE THE PART WITH SOME OF THE MACHINES WE HAVE AROUND HERE. SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE ARE BASICALLY BASICALLY THERMOBLASTIC AND YOU USE A HOT GLUE GUN THAT EX TRUTHS THE THERMOPLASTIC IN A SHAPE USING A COMPUTER NUMERIC CONTROL. WE DEVELOPED A METHOD FOR USING METAL SHAVINGS OFF BIG INDICATES Y'ALL MACHINES THAT MANUFACTURE PARTS FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY, MOLDING INDUSTRY, WE FOUND A WAY TO CONVERT THEM DIRECTLY INTO POWDER FOR THE MANUFACTURING AND MOLDING INDUSTRY. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS IS WE FOUND A VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO CONVERT METAL MATERIALS OUT OF POWDER THAT COULD BE MELTED IN THESE THREE PRINTING SYSTEMS. SO ONE OF THE BEST IS IF WE ARE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE TAKE AN IDEA FROM CONCEPTION TO END PRODUCT, SOMETHING THEY CAN HOLD AND SHARE WITH OTHER PEOPLE, IT FEELS  PLEASE JOIN US ON WEDNESDAY FOR THE SECOND PART OF OUR LOOK AT 3D PRINTING, WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT ITS USES IN THE MEDICAL FIELD.
