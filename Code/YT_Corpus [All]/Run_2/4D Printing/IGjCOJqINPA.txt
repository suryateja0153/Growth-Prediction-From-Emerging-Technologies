 in this video we'll explore nanotechnology the world is shrinking meaning among other things robots will soon be traveling in your bloodstream so let's get started the world is getting smaller so let's talk about nanotechnology we're talking about the nanometer the nanometer this is a billionth of a meter we're talking about small here just give you an idea of how small a nanometer is one hundred thousand nanometers is the size of a human hair so take that hundred thousand and drive it all the way down we're talking small we're talking about the atomic level let me give you an illustration here the American Society of Mechanical Engineers says that nanotechnology will leave virtually no aspect of life untouched and is expected to be in widespread use by 2020 this was all predicted by Richard Feynman with a world-famous physicist who said in 1959 there's plenty of room at the bottom what was he talking about well computers used to fill an entire building now they fit on your wrists transistors are shrinking as we've seen earlier getting down by the mid-2020s to a single atom in size what scientists have discovered is that the difference between one thing and another is not its atomic makeup it's simply the order in which the atoms are put together this is how they convert sand into silicon it's how we convert coal into gold how we take old sick people and turn them into young healthy ones okay that's off into the future near-term nanotech it's already here we already have devices that by 2018 your smartphone will have a video projector in it that will produce 3D imagery yeah 2018 it's coming by 2025 it'll be the end of laundry nothing will get dirty by building textiles where dirt literally fluffs right off we're already saying robots in technology robots are now building other robots why do we need a robot building another robot because the robots that the robots are building are really really tiny down to the molecular level this is having huge benefits ultra high-yield agriculture zero pollution manufacturing cheap power environmental remediation even eventually personal space craft we're seeing medical nano robotics as well we're looking at artificial red blood cells artificial white blood cells when they find an infection they devour it already in the marketplace look at what's going on in one type of eye surgery right now the the traditional methodology painful injections big risk of infection and very expensive being replaced by nanoparticles that float in eyedrops you self treat at home you just give yourself an eye drop quick painless same results as the surgery no risk of infection 90 percent cheaper that's the promise at hope of nanotech what you're looking at here every dot you see is an atom we're looking at tiny robots that will be able to perform glaucoma surgery gastric bypass surgery even provide dental repairs let me illustrate with you one of the most promising technologies on the marketplace it's called graphene to help you understand what graphene is it is the thinnest material ever built when I say thin it has no height it has width it has length but it's only one atom tall how do you make graphene well take your ordinary number two lead pencil not quite sure why they call them lead pencils they're made of graphite so you take that lead pencil draw it across the page and you've now got some graphite on the page imagine if you could take a layer of the graphite away and then take another layer away and another you keep healing off layers of the graphite until there's only one layer left a single atom tall that's graphene it's made from ordinary graphite a very plentiful cheap material but graphene when you get it down to the one atom height it's suddenly the strongest material ever measured it's a hundred and fifty times stronger than steel it's almost completely transparent transmits almost 98% of the light that passes through it it's as pliable as rubber you can stretch it to 120 percent of its size it's highly conductive 150 times more so than silicon it's the only substance we know of that is completely impermeable to liquids and gas but it weighs almost nothing it's been theorized for decades graphene is but finally in 2004 they have isolated it in the lab now ten thousand patents exist today there are over 25,000 patents let me illustrate for you some of the potential uses of graphene for computing ultra long life batteries and photovoltaic cells power everything from mobile devices to your home computers that are a hundred times faster than today's fastest machines touchscreens liquid crystal displays organic LEDs for your smart phones tablets and TVs super thin smartphone bendable unbreakable how about for the environment we can eliminate radioactive waste and toxic spills water filtration systems for desalinization creating biofuel improve solar cells how about for aviation conductive paint that removes ice from aircraft weight saving inflatable slides and rafts for industry we can improve the electric effect we can provide lubricants radio wave absorption sound trend users thermal management structural materials faster chemical reactions fluids that increase the efficiency of oil drills how about 4D printing as well wondering what 4D printing is aren't you well we all know what 3D printing is that's three-dimensional printing 4D printing is basically printing on demand upon a change in temperature change in humidity change in light suddenly the device prints itself how about for the military body armor for military personnel and vehicles how about for healthcare scaffolds for spinal cord injuries blood glucose testing cheaper medical imaging faster and efficient devices that monitor glucose hemoglobin cholesterol DNA sequencing body sensors to measure breathing heart rate and movement MRI contrast agents implantable medical devices and sensors microbial detection and diagnostic devices drug delivery agents for cancer therapy Bionic devices we can place into living tissues connected directly to neurons allowing paralyzed people to move tissue regeneration antibiotics cancer treatments and how about for fun tennis rackets that are lightweight and strong already on the market by the way bottom line is this there's a huge amount of money being poured into nanotech research venture capital funding has skyrocketed over the past 20 years what does all this mean for personal finance it means you're going to want to spend a lot of money on nanotech products the latest greatest stuff how would you like to buy genes that you never have to wash pretty cool huh how would you like to buy the latest tennis racquet lightweight more powerful than ever nanotech products are in your future you're gonna want to buy them that means creating enough money to be able to do so and recognize that advances in health care as exciting as they are they're not going to be free so you're going want to a lot money for what many people are calling participatory voluntary healthcare we'll talk more about that in an episode to come because you're watching the truth about your future that's it for this video in our next video we explore 3D printing you'll see the tech already in use from printing running shoes to houses this series is based on my New York Times best seller The Truth About Your Future the money guide you need now later and much later if at any point you have any questions you can send them to me by visiting TheTruthAboutYourFuture.com thanks for watching
