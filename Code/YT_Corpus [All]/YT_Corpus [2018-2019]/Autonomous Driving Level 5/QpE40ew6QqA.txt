 the city of c-- tax sensing change is looming last year started developing an action plan for deploying self-driving vehicles on its roads we think that the industry would be interested in a in a place like SeaTac that's easy to reach as a place to show their capabilities John Niles executive research director at the Center for Advanced transportation and energy solutions helped the city develop the plan which explores whether self-driving cars are feasible here the city is not interested in being a test track or a lab center what they're interested in is understanding the applications of automated vehicles in the city that would benefit their citizens one idea is to launch self-driving shuttle service to ferry commuters from bus and rail stations to neighborhoods within a few miles so what would they have to do to these roads to prepare for this big change in traffic turns out not all that much I don't think new lanes need to be painted there are a few traffic lights might need to be changed to give priority of these vehicles these are vehicles that move no faster than 25 or 30 miles an hour the SeaTac City Council last night approved to measure expressing support for autonomous vehicles a state work group is also hammering out a plan keeping Washington at the vanguard and at the forefront ensuring testing is welcome here and that we're really staying at the edge of this new technology they're talking about how to adjust the rules of the road licensing and transportation infrastructure anticipating that within a few years a lot of drivers will put their faith in a computer transforming the way they get around Ted land King 5 news so the team in SeaTac says it's also talking with toquilla and des moines about developing a similar self-driving vehicle action plan they hope to attract a public-private partnership to help someday launch self-driving transit shuttle service
