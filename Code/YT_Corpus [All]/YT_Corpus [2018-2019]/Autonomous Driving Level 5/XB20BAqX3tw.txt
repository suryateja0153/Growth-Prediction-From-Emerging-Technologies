 The interesting thing is every customer comes to an epiphany. And the epiphany is after you built an automated vehicle. So in a traditional sense, if you're going to build an automated vehicle that has to have three layer fail operational design, you would basically double everything. You would double wires for the power. You would double the network for the signal. You'd also have redundant compute. Essentially unaffordable and it doesn't package. Just to give you an idea about the complexity, the complete electrical architecture is today already the third heaviest part in the car, after the chassis and the combustion engine. We can't go this way any further because we are running out of space and it's too expensive and it's too heavy. It has to be what we call affordable redundancy. We looked at all layers. We looked at the compute at the top, obviously the network and the power, and said, "What is the minimum amount of redundancy that I have to guarantee three layer fail operational design?" The result of that would be what we call affordable redundancy, which is one of the key tenets of SVA (Smart Vehicle Architecture). That's really the challenge that we have as engineers. We need to make sure that the car, the complete architecture is fail operational at all times, but we need to design it in a such way that it is efficient. We have to look at cost, we have to look at weight, because weight is in direct connection to carbon dioxide emissions. And the interesting thing is when you look at it holistically and you break it down into its parts, solutions arise that make the entire system cost less. We're the first to take a look at it holistically at a total system level, and that's what's required today. And that's also what's resonating with our customers.
