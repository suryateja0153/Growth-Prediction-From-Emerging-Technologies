 The Capstone Project was phenomenal. Being able to get exposure to understanding ROS and all of its capabilities was really exciting. In addition to that our team was distributed across the globe. It was really cool to just see that so many people are trying to transition into this industry effort having years and years of experience in another industry, and that's a lot of motivation for myself to be able to surround myself with some really incredible and talented engineers as well.
