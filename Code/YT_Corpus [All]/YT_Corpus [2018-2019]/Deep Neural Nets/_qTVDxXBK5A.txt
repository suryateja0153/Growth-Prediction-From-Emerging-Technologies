 [Music] I'm Nick Cheney I'm finishing my PhD in computational biology at Cornell University Gabriel crimen and I are interested in seeing how deep networks respond to neuroplasticity so in the brain we know that the brain is constantly in flux and neurons are growing and dying weights are changing in response to stimuli but most of the time machine learning what we do is pre train a network on some crating set but then we want to use it for real we freeze it and keep it in some static form there's been a lot more emphasis lately on more online learning so that you learn as you're working on a data set and in those kind of environments we think that the network will be changing quite a bit so we're looking at how that network could be robust to those kind of changes much like the brain is to everyday stimuli in actions disease to start out just doing a very simple test looking at perturbations of the network so just throwing random changes at the weights that make up this network and seeing how that affects its ability to classify images after that we're looking at how different parts of the network respond differently to these kind of changes and then ideally we'd like to have some kind of rule that doesn't affect the performance of the network that much and it's able to maintain its ability to classify throughout seeing a number of stimuli so we know that the brain has certain learning rules like temporal in which neurons that fire one after another and of strengthening their connections or conversely weakening their reactions and we're seeing going to see if rules like that end up providing stable perturbations where the network can easily recover and maintain what it's doing or unstable ones where we're gonna go down on track or we know the deep networks act similar to how the brain works Jim to Carl okay very great gave a great talk about how the features we see and Deve networks are similar to the features in the brain we know that the brain is constantly undergoing these kind of changes so it's we're curious scientifically to see how these computer models respond in understanding how these two systems that are the same or different but also from engineering context online learning where the network is changing while it's learning is going to be I think a much larger part of the use of machine learning going forward so understanding how stable these things are to constantly changing parameters I think will be quite informative for those kind of studies being able to explore new types of materials and learn a lot about both computer vision and neurosciences been a lot of fun and certainly informative deep learning is it's a very hot topic right now so being able to dive hands in a little bit and get some experience working with these models and some of the the latest software packages I think will be useful going forward to [Music]
