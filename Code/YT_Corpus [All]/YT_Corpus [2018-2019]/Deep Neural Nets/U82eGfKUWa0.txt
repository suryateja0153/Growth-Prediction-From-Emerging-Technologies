 An Artificial Neural Network (or ANN for short)  is a predictive model (for regression and  classification) motivated by the brain operates. We use the house type as the dependent  variable and the house ages and house prices  as the independent variables We use a Split Validation operator to calculate  the accuracies of the model on training data  and test data. Within the validation operator, we use a Neural  Network model to predict the house types. We calculate the model performance on the  training data. We calculate the model performance on the  test data as well. Report the model parameters, the model  performances on the training data and the test  data. We can build a more complicated network by  adding more hidden layers and/or more  neurons, and/or adjusting the learning rate. We can also use the AutoMLP operator to let  RapidMiner choose the parameters of the  Neural Works. Adjust the parameters to allow RapidMiner to  consider more possible settings.
