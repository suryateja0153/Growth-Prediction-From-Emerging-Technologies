 The idea is what if virtual reality can be used instead of a drug to help people regulate their emotions. Let's say you're coming in to detox from a traumatic situation as a lot of patients are. This world kind of helps them escape their own realities and come into a completely abstract universe, and then deliver a therapeutic intervention or allow them to access social support or Alcoholics Anonymous, those kinds of things, immediately from their home to help them cope with some of the negative feelings that they might have. What we're seeing is that if you deliver therapy when someone is in that state of relief, that the therapy seems to be sinking in more effectively than if you were trying to do therapy with someone while they're experiencing all these negative emotions. You know, it's really important to remember that this is all experimental, and it's not an established therapy. And the long term goal is to eventually get these headsets in the homes of patients. If you can create an intervention that is as accessible as the drug for the patient, that perhaps they can choose the intervention over the drug.
