guys the great thing about this industry is the fact that you don't actually have to work near the people who are either working in your agency or for your agency and you don't have to actually live near the people who you take on as clients for your agency now I do recommend some things first and foremost if you've never worked in this industry before then you're gonna want to start obviously probably with your business locally and the reason why is because you need to get your feet up under you before you try and take on virtual clients but if you are up for the challenge it is a way for you to take on new business from pretty much anywhere across the world as long as they have the budget and the means to work with you virtually so in this video we're gonna cover two main parts or two main things that you're going to want to consider when building a business that's going to work with other businesses virtually or customers virtually um and what you're gonna need to do to also work with the team that you build on a virtual basis so here we go let's get into it oh and PS make sure to stay tuned to the end of the video and I'll give you a tool that we actually use the software that we use to actually manage this process so that we can work with anybody across the world but also throughout this video we're gonna be talking about several other tools that we use to complete this job and make this functional so if you're interested in learning about all of the tools you're gonna want to pay attention in this video so working with clients on a remote basis is the first thing we want to talk about it's two main parts and it's going to be talking about working with the client side of things and then working with your team and finding people who you contract out at a cheaper rates that we are able to really grow your business in the beginning the key with this is to keep your costs low in the beginning right you don't have a ton of budget to spend and just to throw money away so you have to make what you have work for you and then everything else you're gonna have to pick up right so you want to make that budget really work as much as you can for you and so this is how you're gonna get it done so let's talk about the clients and what's neat well you know really what's needed to get that job done so when you're working with clients really if you're working with them virtually or not the biggest thing that's gonna come into play here is doing a proper onboarding so that way you get enough information about the business your ask the right questions you know their past marketing you understand who their customers are what their you know what their goals are they trying to drive leads or sales or views or engagement whatever you know what are they trying to do and that's really what you find out an onboarding call also what I recommend doing is looking into platforms that are gonna make this communication process easier so we use first and foremost something like Google Hangouts or Slack something that is a messenger platform that we're able to communicate with people also we understand that email is a perfect platform for doing that too so we make sure that we have our communication channels with clients open the next thing I recommend doing is in the first couple of months setting up a bi-weekly call basically where you call them every two weeks and then get to the point where you're gonna call them at least once a month and go over campaign goals what their objectives are if anything's coming up that you need to know about basically to plan out the content for the month now it's okay to make as many touch points or touch calls as you need to but I recommend trying not to get to the once per week call or anything where you're calling daily because that's what the customer begins to expect and as you grow you won't obviously be able to call that customer every single day so don't set up with the wrong idea in mind you want them to get used to a service that they're gonna receive consistently so that way they don't get you know beyond your expectations or their expectations with regards to what service you provide so as I mentioned the onboarding process is super important and we actually just put together a video on that process so check out this video up here in the top right hand corner some other important things to remember are setting deliverable dates or basically dates where you expect to have certain milestones reached or accomplished so if you're planning on generating leads and you're running an ad campaign then you should tell them hey this month in month one we expect to generate this many leads after we optimize and collect more data and make better campaigns in month two we should make this much of return you know month three should be this month of a return at month four we plan to increase your budget by this much and you should see this much of a return you know because setting expectations so that way at least have some sort of guideline to go by you know with little stipulation obviously leads aren't guaranteed and your level of marketing experience is gonna have a lot to do with how much you're able to generate and how way how well your campaigns perform so question that I want you to answer below have you ever worked with a client that was basically in another area and the relationship not work out for you if so what was it that didn't work out or if it did work out what do you think that you did specifically that helped build that relationship and really build the ability for you to be able to work with that client being in another area now the other thing you're going to want to consider when starting up a business where you plan to work virtually is the fact that you're going to want to start to hire team mates basically team members or otherwise known as virtual assistants now the good thing is you don't necessarily have to hire from people in your country because there might be other countries out there that have a more affordable rate for you to work out which again is good for you because it allows you to be able to scale your business quicker because you're not paying as much to get that work done but like with your clients you're going to need to know some things to make sure that that process runs smoothly so here's some things that I wanted to mention that also relate to the client side of your business some apps and some software that you'll be able to use that will also relate to the client side and to the VA side of your business the first thing you're gonna want is something to store all your documents and things that you'll use to basically build the content the campaigns for your clients or for your business and what we like to use is Google Drive and the reason why is because it's super cheap to get unlimited storage and it allows you to collaborate add and collaborators update and edit documents together suggest editing create powerpoints do all kinds of things and it really is the backbone to all of the information or content that we create for our business so if you're looking for something to store your documents if you've been looking at something like onedrive or any of the other web box or whatever Dropbox if you if you're looking at any of those I strongly suggest checking out Google first that's just my recommendation another thing you're going to need is something for meetings right because if you're gonna meet with these businesses they still want to see a person and they want to know who they're working with so a lot of the time you need to be able to show them video so I'm gonna give you two resources here number one thing that you're gonna want is a video app to use right and I recommend to number one Google Hangouts is great that's why I am heavily involved in all of the google apps that are available but as well as things like Zoom. Zoom is a great platform that's also free and it's really easy to use you can share your screen and things like that so check out Zoom it might be more suitable for you a lot of people that I've come across like to use zoom I personally don't like to use Skype that's just my again my preference so I would recommend checking out the first two that I suggested the second thing I'm gonna suggest to you guys let me grab it the logitech 1080p camera it's a great camera I love the camera and the reason why is because it shoots in 1080p and if you don't have a camera that's gonna perform well I really suggest getting one of those also the last thing would be this thin mic right here both of the links for both of those products are in the description below all of my videos you'll see it under the tools and software equipment section if you plan to work virtually you're gonna want a good camera and a good mic just trust me on that you can't work virtually without either those two so check out those products again those are in the description below now as far as working with teams that are virtual or you know working with virtual assistants the most important thing is to set up guidelines training rules for them to follow and very clear instructions for them to complete any project the biggest thing that I see are the biggest area of failure is when people actually go in and they try to create a task or a description for a task and they don't include anywhere near to enough information yet they're expecting this finalized product to come out that's supposed to look immaculate and like you know $10,000 was spent on the development and that's the thing it's you shouldn't expect that type of situation to happen for example I have people who reach out to me all the time Jordan how do I hire a social media manager personally I don't think you should hire a social media manager because that's one person to do all of those jobs I recommend hiring a designer a copywriter a post scheduler a great creative director to come up with ideas you know all of those different positions that make up the content that go on Facebook not just one person who sits there and creates images and coffee and smashes it all together on a Facebook post so that's pretty much it for this video but before you go I wanted to give you that free thing that I mentioned in the beginning that's gonna help you with managing the team and all of your clients and the projects that you guys have going on it's really you know outside of Google Drive this would be the other supporting software that we use that is the backbone to everything that we do all of the content we create that you see right here all of the things that we do for clients everything that we do to grow our company is based in this software and really I'm promising you if you want to get better results you want to get faster results and you want to just optimize your business process to the best of your bit to the best of your ability then you need to check out this app so the app is called and you probably have heard me talk about it before but it's called Asana now I'm gonna leave a link for Asana in the description below this video all you have to do is go click that link it's a free link it's not even an affiliate link I like I don't make any money doing it I just like giving it out because it's freaking awesome and it's what helps us do so well so go check out that link right below this video in the description yeah you'll want to check that out oh and by the way guess what we're already super helpful because if you're planning on using Asana we've already put together a video on how we use Asana to help you you know facilitate the jobs for our team so check out this video up here in the top right hand corner you're gonna love that one too but that's it for me thank you guys so much for joining me and stopping by again if you haven't subscribed hit that button and the notification bell so you get all of our future updates and content that we release here at my channel as well as all of the guides and templates and free courses that we give away but that's it for me thank you guys so much I will see you guys on the next video until then Cereal Entrepreneur out bye guys ready to start living the six-figure work where ever be your own boss lifestyle well at Cereal Entrepreneur Academy teach you how to use a laptop and internet to start your own social media and digital marketing agency get started with our free Facebook Ads training links in the description below guys see you in the course and Cereal Entrepreneur, out!
