 [Music] and welcome back today in our 1 million cups spotlight is Jamie Jay Wright their founder of bottle neck virtual assistants welcome to show good to see you thank you so much I guess you know everything baguettes the question what is bottleneck virtual assistants that's a great question well I I love the fact that I can help businesses stop the bottleneck in their business and a lot of time when businesses are growing it's really hard to figure out what to do how to do it and you get so busy I don't know if you've ever been home late or missed a dinner or have to work on the weekends these are all signs of getting really busy in your business so what better way to leverage your time by then hiring somebody like an administrative assistant or something like that to do the things that you don't really like doing but need to get done so we help stop the bottleneck in your business so you said an assistant but your title says virtual assistant right so how does that work ah good question so the right now it's it's pretty expensive to hire staff and to grow your company so you're always looking for ways that you can hire staff but for a little bit more cost-effective and so what we do is we go out and we search remotely for virtual assistants whether it's web developers administrative assistants graphic designers and they actually work from their home so they worked merchants I think it's not like artificial intelligence maybe like a robot when you first look you think ok it's gonna be just a computer screen that's it but in a way it is because it's someone remote that's doing it exactly which can save a lot of money tons yes so and we staff from overseas a lot of times so there's no 1099 there's no w-2s no fyke a lot of things like that and we can usually get them for about 10-12 dollars less per hour than what you normally pay what type of businesses couldn't utilize this any type of business any type of business we have we have real estate agents we have oh my gosh a lot of entrepreneurs that have their own companies I have eleven myself that work for us internally so we have a writer web developers graphic designers yeah Wow save your saving space on office space right here save another cannon right there okay never now how does one I guess find a virtual assistant how do they know that they need one where do you fit in with that that's a great question this is probably one of the biggest challenges that a lot of entrepreneurs or business leaders have is they don't really know when they can hire so we've come up with a really big systems and processes guy and so we've laid out a six-step hiring formula that helps you everyone identify what you can outsource what you can delegate and then number two when can you hire an assistant so this six step process helps you understand all of the everything that you need to kind of think about before you hire somebody when you when you do that though let's say you hire someone you go through the six steps you hire somebody you have this virtual assistant maybe you're not a good match can you then switch to a different virtual assistant maybe you switch directions and a totally different lancing you know what I actually need a virtual listen in this area of my business not this one is that possible 100% every virtual assistant assistant that gets hired is a 60-day probationary period just to make sure that it feels good okay yeah you're telling us about one side of the equation but obviously the virtual assistant has to come from somewhere can you become a virtual assistant for your your companies you can 100% so if you're looking to work remotely all you have to do is contact us and we have a four-step hiring process for the virtual assistants to go through and it kind of has some problem-solving and things like that make sure that they're a good fit so about 20% of the applicants that we get are the candidates that we get actually finish the application process and that's a good thing because if you're gonna be working from home you kind of have to know how to get your self around so you take care of both ends of that equation yes you had be organized and you know what you're doing exactly yeah how how did 1 million cups help you out oh my gosh they were incredibly it was Jesse and Hannah and sterling made me feel right at home there is did you get any questions at the end that where you weren't expecting that kind of you Trish about everyone really oh good yeah that's what I love about one being comes there really put you on the spot makes you think about something maybe different that you had thought of yet exactly yeah they were just very welcoming and since all my clients and like everybody is out of the states pretty much I don't have any local clients right neat to kind of you know meet somebody local people want more information about bottleneck how can they get it they go to bottleneck dot online bottleneck dot online that seems easy enough for example I may apply to get my own assistant yeah good to see you I think all right still to come on over live guess what Kelly has an easy dessert recipe for you and
