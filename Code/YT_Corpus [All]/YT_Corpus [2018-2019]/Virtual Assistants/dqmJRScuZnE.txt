 Oh, no. That never would have happened with Tom. Tom, a butler, a roommate, not quite. Tom is a digital assistant. Ordering missing household items is no problem for him. Music on voice request, booking a trip, or appointment reminders, we are all familiar with daily digital assistants. But do you know in which other situations artificial intelligence can help us out? For example, in the field of medicine, here, digital assistants help with research and support doctors in terms of analyses and concrete therapeutic recommendations. They can even overcome barriers. Digital assistants act as eyesight for the blind by explaining the right path, describing people and emotions, or helping with shopping. Sometimes going a little overboard, but they can also help us along by providing creative impulses. You're looking for a certain dish to match the red wine from your last vacation? No problem. Your digital assistant has already created a new recipe, springbok steak with avocado-chocolate-chutney. Delicious. However, you still have to do the cooking for now. But why stop here? You only want the best for your children, don't you? Well, your digital friend is already one step ahead. The positive pregnancy test is also equipped with options for the best school education, career goals, and potential spouses. All of this ensures your child's success. These digital assistants are truly interesting companions and wouldn't it be a shame if Tom was limited to making weather predictions only? By the way, this film was also developed by a digital assistant. Just kidding. Of course not, or was it?
