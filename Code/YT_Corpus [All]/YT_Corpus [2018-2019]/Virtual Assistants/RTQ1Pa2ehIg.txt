I’m a Virtual Medical Assistant here at Xilium and basically my tasks include calling up other doctors for to set up a peer to peer review for my client. My hobbies include mainly reading I love reading and also watching movies sci-fi, horror, some drama, good drama, movies Series Netflix and also I go out with friends at times. I love being with my friends and just have some downtime and hang out with them. Uhmmm… something interesting? Well people tell me that I'm fun to be with. I think that's the most interesting thing that I can say about myself. Yeah, I’m not afraid to have a good time. What? I can live, I can love, I can reach the heavens above.
