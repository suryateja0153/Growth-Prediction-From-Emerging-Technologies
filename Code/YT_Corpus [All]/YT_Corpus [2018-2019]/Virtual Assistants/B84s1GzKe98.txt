 Digital assistants will evolve to know more things about the world and us, to be better respond in our context with things that are relevant to us. And then also be proactive about suggesting things that we might want. What we're trying to get to is a place where every person can have that personal assistant that an executive might have today. And now what we're seeing, is not paper, nor website, not app, but maybe a chat bot, or a digital assistant, or a voice interaction is the next wave of how we're seeing that users can interact with technology and with the services that companies like insurances provide. And this is really helpful because you don't have to be tech savvy in order to have a conversation. And also you can ask for exactly you need, rather than trying to browse through a whole lot of information.
