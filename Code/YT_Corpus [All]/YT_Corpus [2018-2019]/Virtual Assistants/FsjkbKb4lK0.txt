 on the Amazon meeting Center in downtown Seattle it's the queue covering imagine a better world a global education conference sponsored by Amazon Web Services hey welcome back everybody Jeff Rick here with the cube we're in downtown Seattle at AWS imagine education first year the show 900 registrants 20 countries represented really all the public sectors show but this one's just focused on education as its own track a lot of really interesting innovation going on and it's part of the keynote we saw a really cool concept video about bringing Alexa into the class the echo dot talking and so we're excited to have kind of the the guy driving this whole project he's David hakonsen the CIO of st. lous University first off what a great keynote you had this morning thank you thank you it we're really excited to announce this today so today we announced that we are putting an Amazon echo dot in every single residence hall room so over 2,300 devices that will be in every room awaiting students for this fall the the device will be essentially their virtual assistant they can ask questions specific to the University through our custom skill or any other question that's normally through the Alexa platform so voice of God is talking above us but that's okay so it's interesting when you were when you were starting your presentation earlier today I'm like what are the applications gonna be I mean one of these kids gonna do with this thing we've got a dotted only ask it to play music all the time but but it you really did your homework on trying to think through what are the different use cases what types of information are gonna help the kids get them information a little bit faster a little easier that's right we we want this to be valuable for our students and our students are active inside and outside of the classroom our university does over a million hours of community service a year so we we attract a very active student we don't want them to be spending time searching for information we want them to get that information immediately whether it's something simple such as when is the library closed or what channel is is their favorite you'll show going to be on we want them to be able to get very fast to access information because right now they have to search through webpages or calendars to find out what's on campus or other key information and that takes time right well it's funny because there's a lot of conversation about the educational experience and really trying to develop an engaging experience for for the kids in school for the students but the question is always you know how do you define engagement what is engagement and what are the actual things you know the physical activities that are going to drive this and you guys amazing stat you said you went from concept to delivery in three months and in that process really explored a lot of interesting concept so wonder if you can add a little bit more color to that development process absolutely it started with a six-week pilot program where we tested different virtual assistant technology to see what did the students really like and they chose the the Amazon echo system and once we made that decision we were able to go from that concept to completion in three months which was fantastic for us because we wanted to make sure we were ready for the fall semester to do that we work very closely with AWS in the Alexa for business team as well as the partner the skill development partner called empowered we were able to use the partner ecosystem to allow us to move very quickly and through that process engaging our students engaging our stakeholders to make sure that the device was going to meet their needs not just be something that looked good on on their desk right so what was voice part of the initial design criteria or did that come when you were looking at different different type of interactive devices because clearly the kids today are super adept on their phone and they can text with their eyes closed with one finger tied behind their back voice is still relatively relatively new at least maybe maybe it's not as new as I think so how did you get to the voice as the main UI for kind of this new cutting-edge information system so we started with voice saying we want a virtual assistant that's voice based because we see that as the future so if if you're on your smartphone looking for information you're still having to go to a website or to different data sources to get that whereas asking a question is much faster and getting that answer it's a much faster transaction so we started with that saying how can we use voice technology to our students be more productive and then engaged our students in that conversation and they were very excited about that right so one of the really cool things about the Alexa and the dot is the program ability which obviously you guys took advantage of so a little color on on kind of how you chose what to program but but I think even more exciting is kind of opportunities that opens up as as an individual student as a CS project in the class and as you said your university has a lot more going on than just incoming students you've got graduate degrees medical things going on so I wonder if you can share a little light on kind of how you developed what you have for the launch date but you know some of the future things that you see down the road that really goes to the Alexa for business foundation that we chose and an Alexa for business was the differentiator for us is it was a key area because through that tool and ecosystem we could manage the devices and we could group the devices so we could group a learning community of engineers of students studying engineering and give them specialized skills or allow them to develop a skill and have that only on their devices not on everyone else's devices so the the ability to manage these allowed us to really focus on that educational experience allow students to start creating skills and then be able to manage and deploy them at scale it's great I can't I can't wait to come back a year from now and hear kind of what happened I'm sure there's gonna be all kinds of cool surprises tough surprise is you know upsides and downsides because you said there they're getting installed this week and the kids are showing up in a couple weeks that's correct that's correct we're moving very quickly all right David well again I give you the last word as you touched on it a little bit but you know how working with Amazon and AWS specifically you know kind of impacted this project and how does that help you you know deliver your objectives more efficiently and faster the only way we could have gone from concept to completion in three months was by working closely with AWS in the partner ecosystem we could not have done this at any scale or or efficient timeframe without them they were they were a fantastic partner helping us all the way from choosing the the right partner to develop the skill to helping us on we get all these devices to work on our network - how do we get all these devices working on our network and installed within a couple days and so from beginning to end AWS has been instrumental in our success to bring this new innovative technology to our students okay well we might have to have a field trip out to st. Louis and check it out you're welcome to come all right he's David I'm Jeff weird AWS in downtown Seattle at AWS imagines thanks for watching [Music]
