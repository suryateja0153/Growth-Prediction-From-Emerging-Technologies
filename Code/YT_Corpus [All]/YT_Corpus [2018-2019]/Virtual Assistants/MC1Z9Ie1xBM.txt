 Are you interested in getting into the medical field, but don't want to spend a year or more in school? Medical Assistants are able to experience a wide variety of responsibilities and job opportunities with only eight months of training. In recent years, an MA's responsibilities have grown to include tasks that were once only performed by nurses. For this reason, most facilities now require Medical Assistants to earn at least a college certificate and be nationally certified before being hired. At BTC, 100% of our 2017 MA graduates went on to receive their national certification. As a Medical Assistant, you can work in the front office of a clinic: setting up appointments, working with finance and insurance, and getting medical history from patients. Or you can work in the back office of a clinic: rooming patients, giving injections, drawing blood, working in the phlebotomy lab, and assisting with medical procedures on patients. While many healthcare providers are used to working long hours or even overnight shifts, most MAs work during normal business hours Monday through Friday. The need for Medical Assistants is growing rapidly and the job is projected to grow 23% between 2014 and 2024, which is way faster than the national average. There is a huge demand locally for Medical Assistants, which is great for those that want to go to college and work close to home.  Interested in working in healthcare, but don't know where to begin? Hesitant about going straight to nursing school? If you want an important role in the healthcare field, our Medical Assistant program may be perfect for you. Continue to the next video to learn more.
