 [Music] hey what's going on guys so I just wanted to make this quick video to give you some information on the tools that I use to keep organized with my team in the Philippines and how we stay efficient stay effective and ultimately you know get the most value for my team okay I don't know what industry you've been in or what kind of work you do but I've always worked with some kind of project management system or at least like something that you know can keep everybody on the same page where everybody knows what they need to get done and you know a couple like really simple examples I would say probably the simplest one that I really like and I started off with I don't I no longer use anymore is a company called wonder list and wonder list is just one of the most simplest tools available where you can literally create checklists of things that you need to do and you can organize you can organize your checklists by you know by different categories and different topics and when you create check when you create checklists you know you can add like subtasks and notes and upload files to them and you can even go back in the past and see you know different tasks that were done before I mean it's it's a really really simple tool a good solution is for you to create an account and just share it with your virtual assistant and this way you guys can go through and make sure everything is getting knocked out you can also you can also schedule tasks for a later date if there's something that needs to be done like daily or weekly or monthly you can actually set up you can actually set up reoccurring tasks and that way your virtual assistant knows all the time you know on a daily basis you they just come in they check wonder list and everything that you need them to do for you is there whether that be you know marketing tasks or advatage whatever they are they're there and they just need to do because you know when you're scaling and business operations are so important and usually what scale is a business is you're you know how tight you keeping your operations so Wunderlist is like a very like the simplest solution if you never use a project management system or anything like that that's probably the first one I recommend next is that I mean and there's a ton there's Podio sauna Trello you know I mean the list just goes on forever some of you use CRM customer relationship management systems and some of those actually have the functionality within the customer relationship management me personally I use PO do I think po do is you know it's not as popular for a lot of people but because we're doing you know really big like website projects graphic design and kind of ongoing projects in different styles of projects I really like PO do because I can kind of customize my workflow exactly how I want it the company that makes it is a company called Citrix and you know it's it's just a very good kind of more advanced program for project management it has like all the same functionality as wunderlist plus so much more I'm gonna show you guys some screenshots on this video so you can kind of see what that looks like and other other you know other project management systems could be like a sauna but honestly for most for most businesses using something like Wunderlist is awesome and even if you're not using Virtual Assistants using a software like wunderlist could really really boost your productivity within your company right now okay so I just wanted to share this real quick video and kind of start opening up your mind to the possibilities of working with a virtual assistant to help move your business forward faster and you know help you save money on labor but also you know give you an opportunity to maybe reallocate some money into other parts of your business that are important to help you grow and you know eventually you can have staff in the philippi and also more staff here and you know if you have any other questions about business about virtual assistants marketing feel free to direct message me or email me I'm always available thank you [Music]
