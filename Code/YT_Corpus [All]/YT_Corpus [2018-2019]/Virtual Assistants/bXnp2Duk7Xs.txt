 hi my name is Carl Ellen I'm the founder and CEO of ninja acquisitions were a uk-based company we're a training company we teach and coach entrepreneurs how to buy small businesses I started working with Selina Johnson about 1516 months ago my business is about four times larger than it was time we're now doing about 2 million a year in revenues and not only did Selena really kind of get involved in a lot of kind of knucklehead stuff that you know I shouldn't have been doing as the owner of my business a lot of the administration staff a lot of the project management you know customer management all that kind of logistical stuff so with her taking all that off my desk it freed up about 90% of my time to really get into the kind of strategic work that I should have been doing as the owner of my business and I've been able to 4x the size of my business in just over 12 months time so that's the stuff that you would expect a you know a VA of extreme caliber to do for you but you know what's Lynn has done for me it's way way beyond that and that's why I love her and respect her so much as a massively integral part of my business she really cares about me with the Kurds about my health and my well-being on my productivity and she's constantly looking for ways to you know improve my life balance and making sure that you know I'm staying on task and I'm doing a lot of the things that I should be doing along doing the things that I shouldn't be but then you know something happened about six months ago in my personal life my wife got rushed into hospital with a very serious brain injury and as a result I had to take a four week leave of absence from my business and ordinarily if I didn't have Selena in my team you know my business probably would have just folded and because it was a life and death situation at the time I probably wouldn't have cared about that I was focused on on my wife and my family and making sure they were okay but you know what they're asking her to do it or prompting her Selena stepped in and practically ran my business for me for four weeks so the business actually grew in sighs what I wasn't there so that was quite an interesting thing for me to happen but you know deep down you know she just really really cares about me my business our performance and you know that's so refreshing you know to have from from somebody so I love her to bits she's a very very important you don't member of my team you know she's helped me grow and scale this business we're scaling massively at the moment and she's a big part of that so thank you Selena for all your work and your dedication and I hope our business relationship continues for all along one time thanks bye for now
