 hey what's up guys it's max Maxwell and as you can probably hear I have a little bit of a lisp and I'm gonna apologize for that I'm wearing these a direct smile Club a vis aligner and not vision liner but direct smile Club I'm wearing these things I'm gonna try them out for six months but today's topic is about why you do not need a virtual assistant and I get to ask this question a lot a lot in the Facebook group a lot in personal messages because they look at my business model and people say he has bas I need bas and the reality is a lot of you want to hire VA in order to alleviate something that you're not good at and that's not what a virtual assistants for a virtual assistants for is to assist you doing something that you can't multiply and do yourself for example one of the first VA s I ever hired was to do what we call admin work this person was in charge of all my excel files keeping my data correct and stuff like that when we pull records from the county or wherever we got it from that was something I was doing myself but it was not an income-producing task so I had to outsource it as soon as possible I wasn't the best at it but I did it I was proficient at it and I did what I needed to do in order to make it work a lot of you want especially in the Facebook group I get a lot of questions a lot of you want a virtual assistants to start doing phone calls for you outbound calls because you're not good at it and you've never done it that is a no-no that is a big no-no and that is leads to a disaster of fail and one of my early videos I put out an email to reach Alexis my virtual assistant because she could assist you with finding other virtual sisters here what we found out over the last five six months a lot of people want to hire a virtual assistant to make outbound phone calls for them the number one problem is the person doing the hire and does not know how to do the job himself and they believe that a virtual assistant should come already equipped and know everything that they need to know that is not true a virtual assistant is only a reflection on exactly what you know so let's just say you are the best coal caller a virtual assistant that you hire and train is only gonna be 75 to 80% of what you could actually be so with that being said you do not need a virtual assistant don't hire a virtual assistant in order to alleviate what you do not want to do are you afraid to do if you have not made a thousand plus calls and you are not proficient at actually doing the co calling yourself then you do not need to hire somebody you cannot train chaos and that is exactly what you'll be doing if you hire a virtual assistant without actually knowing how to do the work yourself now there is some instance where you do need virtual assistants and if you guys most you don't know my story when I started I was continuously doing twenty to thirty thousand dollars every single month before I decided to hire my own da and like I said my virtual aid was my first BA was not for phone calls was not for answering the phones my first VA was to do the admin work that was not a income-producing tasks for our company so with that being said if you're looking to hire a VA here's what you should do take the task that is repetitive and takes up a lot of your time and I'm not talking about the income-producing test because answering the phone and qualifying leads and outbound calls is something that you need to do because that is the income-producing task okay hire somebody to do some admin work for you in the beginning so you're not spending a lot amount of a lot of time scrubbing through your list and putting it correctly into itself forms in order to be skipped traced or to be record-keeping or so son just beaming down on me so if you are looking for a virtual assistant here's why we'll put you in the right direction you're going to go to online jobs dot pH okay and you're going to fill out a request you're gonna write a job description and you're gonna put the qualifications that you need for the virtual assistants to have and then in return you will get applicants to that job now a lot of questions that I also get is hey what job description should I put for the virtual assistant if you're asking that question you also still do not need a virtual assistants because my virtual assistant I knew exactly what I wanted them to do because there's something I'm doing myself so like I said a virtual assistant something you can add to your team to add value do not add a virtual assistant to your team to try to do something that you're not good at you need to get good at if you're gonna hire it out and there's gonna be a link below for online jobs that pH if you want to search and scrub their website to see if you can find a virtual assistant but make sure you're hiring a virtual assistant for the right reason and please please please don't forget you're hiring another human being so if you don't have the capacity to at least dedicate 66 months or a year of salary to this person do not hire a virtual assistants because they're gonna change their life just to work for you and if you can't sustain them or you fire them within a month or two because of your lack of either finances or your lack of I don't need them anymore then that just look bad upon you and you shouldn't do that these are humans just like you and I they just happen to live on the other side of the world alright guys just max if you've been watching this video this far please do me a favor subscribe on the
