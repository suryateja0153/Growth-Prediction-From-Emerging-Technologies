 hi Sonia Waterhouse training staff or virtual assistants used to be a huge headache but today it's so fast and easy as I quickly show you back on we started you know using virtual assistants ice to fly to Cebu in the Philippines to train them but today it's far more efficient of thousands of times faster just to use a simple piece of cheap software what I'm talking about here is to simply learn the tasks yourself and then record yourself doing it and then never you never ever have to be the task regain yourself most tasks only take three to four minutes to record each task so you you take any task and break it down just a small threat for minute chunks it's amazing what you can teach in three to four minutes now I'm not talking about you know having someone behind you with a video camera recording of what you're doing I'm I'm talking about using software which called your screen and records your voice when you do a task so what you do to create a short instructional video of how to do a task is press the record button on your computer do the task on your computer then speak into the into the microphone explaining you know what you're doing and always pretend you're speaking to a 10 year old so you give clear instructions the great thing about the strategies is you build a library a short video showing how to do every single task then you just get your virtual assistants to watch each task if they get stuck they just rewind the video you know this is a thousand times more cost and time efficient than flying over to South Philippines to train them manually because with the video the VA or virtual assistant can watch it over and over again you know and so it's recorded for life so that you know this system leaves you or you need to train someone else you just go to your video library and send them the video you also don't need to hire skilled or trained staff as a video was recorded originally for you know for a ten-year-old the videos are also really useful if you get head to a task or one of your tasks on holidays or you need to cross train another staff member if you know for whatever reason you know that's what problem editor to shoot this video now I'm in Tucson Arizona and visiting the aircraft boneyards a place to go if you're an aircraft enthusiasts but anyway you know backpack the topic this morning our receiver and it's a mess message from one of my virtual assistants in the Philippines you know how to do a task I innocent replied and toddler which video to watch to learn how to do that task you know that SMS replied took me in less than one minute if we didn't have that recorded video library you know that recorded video in our library you know enough to spend you know at least an hour or so set up my computer logging in and then doing you know a lot of screen centering chefs um with TeamViewer you know whatever software and then quite possibly I'd need to do the same thing again sometime down the track you know somebody else they didn't do the same task again then the great thing about creating a library of short instructional videos is you can use it yourself if you ever forget how to do a task you know what I mean about this is you know when you outsource a task you're no longer do it regular yourself it can be easy to forget you know perhaps of how to do the task especially in our hands but as we get older you know if you outsource the task say today and then for some reason and say six months time you need to do the task again someone's gonna be hard to recall different parts of the task this is a way of building your own library of instructional videos really comes into its own if you forget how to do something you simply get your video library and watch the video most instructional videos by the way that we create you know are between three to five minutes long so in three to five minutes you know you back up to speed now the program we use is Snagit you know it cost around 50 bucks I'll put a link on the screen but Snagit is not the only program out there you know there's a lot of others that can record video including Jing and you know a multitude of other ones the only thing that you need besides the software is a set of headphones with a microphone and you can pick these up on eBay or Amazon for less than 15 bucks again and I'll put up a link on the screen it really is amazing to stop you know be grateful and again how you know software like this you know it's completely transformed how we teach staff it really is a complete game change of how human beings in general and now trained in almost every single task you know in most industries and it's such a short time ago you know I mean less than two years ago we're writing instructions in Microsoft Word and pasting screenshots you know another time you know this seemed like you know cutting-edge technology but you know we could spend hours writing a Twitter feed page document to teach a task and invariably we give you know this 10 or 20 page document to a virtual assistant and they come back you know with a ton of questions the video massively reduces questions now with recording video what you take hours in to document a task now takes literally only minutes that's obvious week please go on down leave me a comment below until next week let's more sell more this is Neil Waterhouse you
