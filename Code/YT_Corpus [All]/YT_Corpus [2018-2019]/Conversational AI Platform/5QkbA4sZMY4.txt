 Let's say this is you. A utility company, a startup or a bank. Your business is thriving but your outdated receivables management and debt collection processes are not up to speed with the digital age and late payments are a big challenge. Until now, your communication with your customers in receivables is standardised, slow and therefore ineffective and results in high collection costs, low collection rates and overall a bad customer experience. That’s why we built collectAI. We make receivables management smart and customer-friendly ... by digitally steering the end-to-end process from e-invoicing and payment reminders to debt collection. Say Jenny is your customer. She's a business consultant, with a busy lifestyle, rarely at home. Or James, who just became a dad. He's on paternity leave and spends most of his time outside with the kid. What's the best way to connect with both of them when they have overlooked a bill? Our smart artificial intelligence knows the most suitable channel and the best time to send them a friendly payment reminder. We provide a payment link to a customised landing page where they can get further information on the outstanding bill, contact customer care and complete a frictionless payment. That means people like Jenny and James can settle their bills wherever they are and whenever they want. With this we achieve better customer relations, higher collection rates and lower process costs for an optimised cash flow. So your receivables management is ready for digital transformation and most importantly you treat your customers with respect. collectAI - Receivables. Redefined. Digitally.
