 well this is the title of the panel is usable transparency in the age of artificial intelligence and machine learning well from my point of view my perspective of course usable is the most important term and probably the less heard so far so we heard about transparency we heard about users we had about all the technologies but usable transparency I think is nowadays probably one of the most important challenges we have in our hands it's not only about technology it's more about I would say culture and I think this would be the the point of our panel why useable is important because of course transparency means awareness so we are opening and making things more clear because we want people be aware but what awareness and transparency is without a real understanding of what's going on and then and this is probably in our opinion I think much more important is then the action that comes after the warners and understanding what is transparency if nothing happened afterwards we heard about this morning about behaviors of people that don't change we heard about people looking at data from different perspectives with new lenses but then they go back to what they were used to do so my point in our point is what can we do to actually to move from transparency awareness towards understanding an action what could be the role of designers especially in this path and yeah it's moving from what we heard a lot of recipes on what we should do what we have to do but how we do that I think it's as important is if not even much more important than what we do per se so how do we transform this data in a way that will lead to understand to action and you know making people are in control of their data doesn't necessarily mean that that we have to plant them into a kind of a contour room of course do it never work and I think there is a kind of a paradox nowadays I mean we are on one side we want and I think we should try to convey the complexity of the things that are happening on the technological layer and this is good in a way but this is probably too much for for the user and on the other side there is a kind of a temptation to oversimplify I mean to reduce this complex in order to make people able I think what we have to search and that's we will try to argument I mean how we can search for it so how can we reach the good trade-off for exploring the complexity of this processes and make people really able to find it on positioning and interact and interact in this complexity so I think it's a great panel to do that because we have four different perspectives and four different positions I think in the field well myself I come from the academia I I lead a research lab in Politecnico di Milano and then we have mahatma liens that we speak after me and she comes from an NGO a think tank this topics and then we have Matias Ferreira from a design agency Fiat that works with different clients and then we have a company so we have University we have an NGO we have a design agency and we have a company I think we have four different perspectives and I think this is a very good way to approach this topic so how we move from awareness to understanding and from understanding to action so involve users really into the value production in this field so just few words about me and what I do in my research lab we are well most of the time we develop a custom interfaces for accessing big masses of data in a kind of a friendly way depending on the user we are also part of this initiative that is a lot to do with the things we are discussing now here is a public data lab is a inter university initiative with the aim of facilitating research democratic engagement and public debate around the future of a data society so we do a lot of different things one of the last we have done is this guide is a field guide for fake news especially for journalists so we teach you know we give them we share with them the knowledge we got in using digital methods to explore the behavior of fake news so we produce knowledge packs that we deliver to some some stakeholders and then we train students and that's also part of the job these are the five the names of the 500 students I trained in shaping data in a meaningful and understandable way and we do also design tools these are tools that tool that we design and designed for allowing no people anybody to visualize data so we think that the more people will be in you know we will have data in their hands the more that will be trying we hope to shape them in a man full wave for them so it's an open source tool anybody can use it you know copy and paste their own data and trying to explore with different shapes and different visualizations how they can do that so this is just a very brief introduction but what we do in our research lab and then now I give the floor to the the the panelists and this will be really a discussion so we have very few slides will be more you know care questions and answers and then if you have questions we'll be happy to take them so the first point we will the first round of questions would be around these interfaces and touch points so what is the kind of experience that they allow to do the to users around data and then we will go through the journey that can bring users from transparency to understanding into value production and then at the end we will talk about you know the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning with this idea of meta transparency that I will talk about you after so that's something that will develop more with some additional slides so more that's your tongue so what is the kind of experience that you deliver now to the users which is the project you are working on what what is your perspective on this idea of transparency I tried to depict yes so thank you maybe first I will describe a bit more NGO I work for it's good thing so we described ourselves as a French think-tank and and what we do is that is that we are working on digital transformation and we do that through several projects and the project I'm going to talk about today is the one about personal data and we have been running that project since 2012 and we have also different experiments on on personal data and in one of them we actually use row graph everything more about it but today we are not to talk about that I will talk about the mizzen full project in English it's it's translated by mad at my data project and what we do in that project is that we are exploring the potential of sharing data with individuals that are concerned by this data by bad by this data yeah so our baseline is quite easy if you an organization like a telco company an insurance company Facebook and the kind of organization public organisations also so if you have data on me then I should be able to have the same data and to use it for my own purposes that's the baseline for this project so two real to make a link to the title of this panel today when I was told the panel was about artificial intelligence I was kind of a bit worried because whenever I presented this project before I've never used the word attrition intelligence but when I thought about it more I realized it was a very good starting point for for this project because the measure for project comes from a basic fact that organizations have and more tools to collect and analyze our data we saw that yesterday we saw that today so we have those tools where as individuals don't have much power against that way they don't have much tools to to to to really establish a balance of power between organizations individual individuals when speaking about data so those tools are getting smarter and smarter you have more and more artificial intelligence building on data because if you control the data basically you're the one who can build an artificial intelligence right so those tools are getting more and more stronger and so I'm not going to talk about how artificial intelligence can make the user experience more friendly and more easy I think we will cover that later yeah yeah so I was just going to use what artificial intelligence part as a starting point saying that individuals are bit scared of it not not as much as robot taking over but more more about how the people in power the people who are going to create those artificial intelligence Facebook etc working on those are going to control and manipulate us even more than they are already doing today so that basic facts that we we started with is of course the the basic fact for the trust crisis right there is a trust crisis between organizations and individuals they don't individuals don't trust organizations anymore when a regarding personal data and the handling of their personal data and as you all know Trust is like the most valuable currency on the market and those markets stopped being places where individuals could talk and to organizations and where anywhere the conversation was alive it's more like and targeting people so tourists to respond to that her fing organization and with him is our four project try to come up with an answer right to try to to say this is not inevitable we can try to make it better and one of the the answer we we came up with is the sound data concept so self data is is actually very easy to describe it's when individuals are in control of their data when they become the master of the data not only who has access to it how can I share it and for how long but also being able to actually use it so self data implies free things first you need to be able to collect your data from any company or organizations that old the data the data although right so you need to be able to collect it you need to be able to store it in a secure way and to administrate it in a secure and privacy compliant space and thirdly and that's what we are going to talk about today you need to be able to use it you need to be able to do it to do something with it so organizations can do something with it they do like big analysis to market you better so why not why not you why not me why not you individuals should do something with it like for instance make your life easier or just being able to to make better decisions to know yourself better right so this is the concept we are working on and as you asked I'm going to show you how do we implement it so yeah so I'm not going to speak to you about one solution we are a think-tank we are an NGO so we are not building one app or one service we are not a service provider definitely not so what we built was more of an ecosystem to ensure that that transparency and to ensure that people get better control over the data so what we did was that we gathered a few partners telco company insurance company energy providers company and we asked them what data do you have on your clients or our new users that you can share with them what personal data do you have on them that you can share with them so we did an experiment in 2013 like 100 testers got via that data back from from 8 big companies and in 2016 we last year we try to make it bigger we try to make it more less less unmade if I may say because in 2013 we were like trying to do what we could and now we are trying to make it bigger so what we have is the diagram I'm sorry I translated it this morning and I'm sure maybe there are some some mistakes but but this is basically the middle foot pilot right starting from 2016 and this pilot is the way we implement the self data concept so this diagram shows you the serve that data concept as we think about it now actually I think and with our partners so I'm going to show you just a bit so we have on one hand we have the partners so around my Eve two energy distributors and one energy providers and other partners but who are not involved in the data and in getting back the data and what those big organizations are sharing with their clients and users the data they have on them and where do they do that they do that on their personal information management system each individual each tester has its own personal information management system which is a personal cloud we are working for now with the startup cozy cloud it's a French startup that is providing personal cloud to to individuals so of course individuals can also so it's a safe place to store your day time to administrate it individuals can of course add more data like photos or anything else on their personal cloud and the second stakeholders are the services and apps what we call re users because once they got their data on their on their personal cloud they want to do something with it right you don't you just don't want to just see it you need to do something more transparency is not enough you as a organization if you give back the data to individuals who are like telling them okay this is what I have on you it's a first step but then you need more than just that transparency you need for individuals to actually do something with it so that's why we have our users like apps and services that can do things with with a data of individuals and are still plugged in on the platform so everything runs on the personal cloud no data and what's get out and of course we have so we are testers we are like now we have two thousand and two and three hundred testers since September and of course we have a team of researchers getting the feedback from those from those testers researchers in marketing and also in the sociology okay so I'm just going to show you I have two slides I'm going to show you very quickly what testers can do today within this ecosystem so they log on to their platform right there cozy cloud and they can access they they can they can get the data from organizations you have to way of getting your data from organizations first you can just scrap it right it's not you for example you can get your data from the French national insurance system all right the public insurance system you just have to put your login and your password and it will retrieve all the data from your that client but user space from their website and then you have the partners connectors that are like AP is that can take the data from the information system and put them into your personal cloud and for example I just going to take one example from from the telecom company around what the data we are sharing is geolocation data with individuals like where I've been the video on-demand data what sin did you so at what time and also call cause report called called report data like with who did you call at which time for hour long etc and we have also smart meter data so this is how you get your data in your in your platform and then how do you use it well you've got an app store and it's not like Google Play or Apple Store it's within your koozie so all the apps you you want to activate to use your data as I said like to know yourself better or for instance to I don't know get your conception data and cross it with open data to see if you can consume in a more green way or cross your elf data with your consumption data and see what food gives you a little tricks your allergies so these are all the apps you can find in the App Store so this is what we are doing right now at thing with with all our partners just to say that this model is not a model only only built by French people we are inspired by other countries like England did something also about that on a few years ago called my data with an eye and the United States also are very involved in the in the surf data model they don't call it that they call it for example vrm so the goal is to to not be the only one and we also are building a European Network called the my data network we has a conference every year in Helsinki where we gather and we try to to implement this model to to make people the master of their own data a question before living the slot zu Matthias and and we spoke about that this this is a for a very limited amount of Giza so this early stage at early adopters very techie nerdy users so I do you think you can scale and scale up and involve engage a broader audience into this activity so this how do we recruit it was two thousand and three hundred it's actually one of the company I caught it back there the insurance company called mesh with opening all those personal clouds to their clients to their clients so that's why we are able to do this experiment right because we don't have the money to pay for 203 2003 hundred cozy so they are doing that they are opening the cosy for their clients so that's one way if companies are in getting involved in other platforms and they are trying to propose those services public company or public services also trying to propose those two individuals then maybe we will have more broader audience right are you collecting any knowledge of what these users are doing now so yeah what I'm using this so yeah there is a research panel and those signed like consent to be okay to be monitored on their use on the platform so what Abdul values at which time and for a long and of course we have also researchers doing we are going to do interviews and who designed the interfaces yeah so that's good that's cozy cloud is a partner right so thing is not involved in any way in the design or in the interface or anything of the other platform we chose cozy for the experiment because of what I said about the one company that's proposed to their clients and also because on the French market now they are the more advanced one and they actually changed their interface like last year so we had to it took a bit of time to adjust so very very interface is quite new yeah okay thank you very much and we will be back with some other questions after and Matthias can we well what is your point of view your perspective of being a designer involved I think from you know with many different clients on maybe topics related to data can we agree that if the last feet of the last mile doesn't work all this transparency we are all claiming yeah not be so I would agree but I would say that it's not the last mile it's all throughout all throughout the really quickly I'm I'm Matthias I I work in Berlin at fjord and fjord is a service design and innovation agency four years ago it was got acquired by Accenture so also full transparency we do a lot of design consultancy and we work with a really big companies and these topics are are very important our role in in the project is to bring the user side to the to the business idea as a designer I try to get the point of the business and make sure that there is a business model or a business and a profit to be made but at the same time that we can support the needs of the users whoever that those users are it's not necessarily the people that are at the end of a screen or at the end of any touch point but it can also be another company that is or employees those could be also users and when I say that it's not the last mile I think also another thing when you said before that is from the what to the how I would add that is also important to think of the why and I'm not saying anything new here but there there are reasons why we make decisions and we should be very conscious about those decisions and why we are making those decisions and if the case is that you cannot make everybody happy then there should be a reason why you're doing that so that's why we bring the user and we try to find compromises between what the business needs and what the users need and the last mile like Paulo saying is that a big part of making sure that services work is making them desirable making people want to use them it doesn't matter if your service is the most useful or best service in whatever measure you have if people don't use it then it's not used and then it's not successful then it's going to disappear for for many reasons economic reasons but also there is no point of a service that is not used because it's not satisfying it's not fulfilling any need so from my point of view working for big big companies from many industries automotive farm all the evil corporations that you can imagine we are trying to solve real needs of real people and at the same time make sure that there's a business there and we need to make those solutions for their problems or for those needs that we find through research through talking to people through testing through many ways we need to make sure that they understand them and and and that's part of what paula was saying at the beginning in terms of transparency that is something that people understand what they are getting into what they can do with it and what they are getting in return and make that something that they want to use if they want to use their it needs to be a choice it shouldn't be we were talking before about this it shouldn't be captive it's like it's not yes no it should be a choice but it's also important that they understand that when they do this choice many times there's a trade-off and that's a conscious trait of an important trade of so my point of view as a designer is lying is wrong it's not convincing of something that is that is bad for them is educating it's this awareness side educating them and and explaining really clearly what is there for them and what is not there for them and what they are doing what's this trade of and it's a long process and we can talk about the journey later but there's there are many many ways to be clear and going back to the why and when we make decisions sometimes we don't need to talk to everybody because it's not in our interest or in their interest to tell them about everything so sometimes we decide for whom we are designing for whom we are creating a service and that brings a little bit these interfaces or touch points that's what we make the decisions what are the interfaces and touch points you have any I don't know any principle or any guideline that we can share maybe so did you notice something on how people interact with with data so when they are confronted with data so because also my mom said okay that on a certain point I have to have someone mentioned this morning dashboards is that the way we should put people in control or in contact with their own data there's again going to this for whom we are designed it's very important as a designer to understand the design challenge the problem that makes sense to solve or you're trying to solve but it's as important to understand for whom you are solving and not everybody wants to be talked in the same way there is no one guideline for things it's always important to understand who you're talking to and who you're designing for but what I can say guidelines is there is information overload and overwhelming the user with information is not the right way that is not that that is scary and and that is also a way to protect yourself behind a bed sheet of text and and this is the current standard pattern of of terms and conditions on the other hand the the first approaches to this that are let me summarize this to you in three easy steps it's also a way of hiding things and this intermediate state needs to be also found according to the user you are designing for if it's in steps if it's in context it will depend a lot what they are interested in understanding and what they don't really care about yeah Thank You Matias thank you back another question after and Jose you are a company you represent a company you you are trying to establish a relationship around personal data with users do you design dashboard for that how do you engage the users yes very good question so just let me quickly just introduce myself so I'm Jose Ramon Gomez and manager of era which is the artificial intelligence of telefónica so the goal of our is create a new customer relationship based on trust we spoke about trust as a golden word and and I think that it's really the case because we need to work in this path we call the trust path internally so how to get users aware engaged informed and by that then take decisions based on the on how we deal with their personal data because it's theirs is their data is not ours so yes so basically in our I am I said this artificial intelligence so the idea that we have is not only to manage services from telefónica like talk to our and say hey and check my data usage or what was my last bill or something like that is even more is try to empower the users in order to manage their personal data that they generate by using the services and that means not only get the transparent information of what I did with my data but also get to the next level which means I know the data right generate why can I do what that so I have consent I have probably my consent to that service that generates a little more data can I get more control or even a I can get more value like my mom said so the data has value and for that we need to maybe people aware of that and be able to choice to make choices and around that so the artificial intelligence we think is the way to provide these touch points these interfaces to the people because there's different kind of users and make it the relationship in a more natural way that will lead to understand better the data I have and ask questions about that in very natural way so things like talk to out and say which is the TV series I watched last Monday for instance so these kind of questions definitely no dashboards at all we don't like dashboards because I think that's completely a barrier for for the for the different kind of fuses that may be the ones are very very techie meticulous and so on and they invest a lot of time we spoke about the time we need to invest know that you get the information about the data that's not that doesn't work and we believe that kind of a more natural interface through artificial intelligence will lead to more easy way an open way to understand what data do we have from from the uses and then then get this knowledge it's important also that we keep in mind that providing a lot of information about what we have maybe also have the bad effect the boomerang effect so there's a lot of you mentioned people we will be freaking out so oh that's a big brother that's no no it's better to be informed about what is the data we have in a more natural way with what we call the data literacy so it means these the data the geolocation is there because we need that in order to identify you the towers you know to connect to the people with with your cellular phone and and things like that so it's important in this face of transparency to really do it in the interfaces with more natural way but also provided in the answer the level of granularity to make the people really understanding and be a clear information informing then and evangelizing about that well this morning and yesterday I think well something that emerged is that of course different types of users yeah so why don't you because what were you are saying maybe it could be good for let's say lay people maybe not the ones that are intercity but what about the ones that are interested in looking at maybe dashboard so we can have a I don't know a model system maybe or something that can evolve or can you know yes I don't know maybe yeah so also the this okay - but it's not good for that people but on the other side maybe this is just for one section the action of the audience yeah so the level of granularity is there so depending on the question that you need so you can ask about more high level data questions that can be answered very quickly with a more natural conversational interface but for sure maybe you can dig deep dive into more granularity so what is exactly my location at that particular date cross with my web activity whatever you can ask about that and get into the detail combining AI interfaces like NLP so I talked and then the answer may be something that is interactive I can tap drill into and get money to depending on the kind of question made from different kind of users I get different responses okay I will say we do for the second round of questions so we'll go back the different orders so we discussed before the panel to organize a panel about this journey so transparency first awareness then control you're getting control with different types of dashboards or user interfaces may be and then it's value creation so how really users can be engaged in embedded creation so do you think this will happen sooner or later and how which way we can really think to imagine to engage users in co-creating value with the different stakeholders yes you know it's it's so much more difficult than just showing things and and explaining and putting people in control and it's about creation of data so how users can really do that so I believe that we need to work that kind of trust path with the right steps so you cannot go from transparency to value directly you need to go from transparency to action so some control and then can it value and I believe that to reach that kind of scenario where people feel comfortable you know deciding things about giving value you need first to educate them in terms of the data that they own and they have then provide interfaces in order to make action so with AI or with network devices you can do things like hey um which services I are sharing my location here in telefónica or things like so it's if you get the list you can do actions like revoke this one subscribe this and do it in a more natural way if you feel that level of control maybe it's a perception in terms of you know peace of mind or better use experience or whatever that would lead to go to the next level which is know now that I'm when dealing with the company that's honest open and allows me to do something we might take that would control I will be ready to be able to accept proposals from third parties like man on set so if a third party comes and say if you provide me or accept to deal with your data for that purpose and it changes that for them that can a value that will lead to a new economy and I don't mean they're coming in terms of monetary things for the people directly because then you know the economics doesn't fit here but it's the starting point of creating critical mass and then if you accept that with a lot of people that creates value for the third party and that will lead you with some exchange of value Mendham the change is perceived like very easy experience peace of mind or even some discount or whatever but that will lead only if you have worked through different steps in the where did the knowledge you have of the users come from so what what kind of methods and tools and activities do you have in place for knowing better the users because I mean if you don't we don't know that yeah so it is it's funny you say yeah yes no no we've made a lot of research and and but definitely there's different data points that you can learn about why the users behave and classify them in you know this is typical the guardians are really really keen about the privacy and so on there's people that turn off the router at home every time they leave so this is something that we know and and we we know exactly the people in the kind of behavior they can do how they feel about the data because they want to protect that there's other uses are more pragmatic that they are able to accept this kind of you know terms and conditions wherever because they see some value then all the uses that completely do the actions without any questions they liselle first they do it because they don't care about data so we know about that we've made research and we know that this kind of curve about confuses a small number of guardians small number of you know let's say first and in the middle there's a people is like pragmatic or skeptical and for that we can create also interface for them thank you Matthias what is your point in what is your position and perspective on this side of this journey so from awareness to control and then to value and I have one additional question that comes from this that that answer I know that some design agencies are working on trying to combine big data and you know very qualitative analyses so personas let's say in big data in order to understand better users so what kind of methods you use and what do you think we can really ask to users in this journey a journey awareness is always the first step in in any journey I would say it's in this case is the first step because we need to be aware of what's around us and what we can do and what we can't do it's a lot about education I would probably say that there the the steps go more in parallel than one after the other in the sense that for people in general experiencing things is the best education they get or at least it's a high percentage of the education they get so by experiencing how data is displaced is used how to control it they will learn and they will be more aware of what they can do and kind of do with it in that sense I think the services also learn with the people so like at the beginning a service doesn't have information about you or probably has really standard and default information and as you use a service a service can learn from you it's especially when we're thinking about AI introducing AI into into services to make them better in the sense of more personalized and more tailored and it's a journey that goes both ways so while you use it you can learn and while the service is being used can learn from you I'm an optimist and I don't think that you need to be a paranoid and close all the data sources and all the data points and disappear from the system but at the same time I think that being fair and being transparent is a lot about explaining things and also the fact that services are making a profit and are using your information should be explained because that's probably a way that you can tell to users the reason why this service can be better or is getting better is because you are using your data or sharing your their data or helping it learn about you so perhaps that's one of the intrinsically motivations to use it in and to connect it with with the other question what we do to learn and to know more about users before you you design anything you need to know again what you're trying to solve and for whom it's it's a basic question that you need to be able to answer otherwise you're just randomly designing and and that will not solve anything so there is a face of research in every design process that needs to happen and it depends on the size of the project on the type of project but there is understanding the big numbers there is understanding who in terms of business who could be a potential market which people we might want to design for but also more qualitatively why they do the things they do and what are the things that they are currently doing and what are the needs that they are currently having and that's when you go into one-on-one conversations or or observations or shadowing or there's a ton of techniques where you try to get what's behind the behaviors that they have so these two things together might end up in this type of mindsets or archetypes that that you were describing before how do they interact with data well we know they do this or they do that or they do that and we also know why they might potentially do that so we get real stories real lives and then we know that in terms of market share or interest of the company or whatever the reason is we want to specifically specifically focus on the Guardians let's say that is an example because X Y Z so it's a combination of postings and then once the services is live or it's it's started to be released to the public you can also learn as a service if you are actually achieving what you wanted to achieve that is also a way to see you can go back to these people and talk to these people or you can also see the macro numbers from the service itself and see if your hypothesis where we're true and if it's going somewhere and potentially the mindset that the Guardian had at the beginning is moving into a more trust person well the process you describe seems to be something that is only for big companies and takes a lot of money courage and absolutely this is some that you have for example practice with startups yes and early-stage companies I before feared I was working at a start-up and we we developed a an event up so in this context for instance it would be an app that has the program has profiles of all of us and and it grew in in functionalities and in features and then it always run through a similar process I always tried to keep six months cycle where we would always have research going on but there was a time where we would focus on research and then we would make some decisions based on that research and design for that and then as the service kept on going we would see if we were what we thought we would do made sense so whenever there was a new feature released or a new section of the app presented then we knew that our research was true and our hypothesis were true and and so on so it there's not to run this process you don't need money you just need intention you need to do it so I'm gonna raise your perspective on the users and what do you think about this journey so and what you learned from your platform okay so about the journey I don't want to talk only about the users if that's okay with you because I think they tie in about so many parties that you need to talk about the journey from all perspectives so for example if we take the users as a starting point of a journey I agree with everything you said about that and interesting the importance of education the fact that the Guardians the one who are most concerned about privacy would probably be the first flame to start the journey towards a better way for people to be more in control but if you look at some sectors sometimes it's not only the Guardians and the people who are like the geeks and the people who are very into privacy it's also like you like you and me like people just wanting more control for example in elf you see that collectives of citizens have gathered to say they want their data back they want the data back because they want to use them for themselves and for example the diabetic people I've started a movement called we are not waiting and they are getting bigger and bigger also from the movement opennotes where they say doctors should share the notes they they have on their patients with their patients so that could be the first way to start a journey from the bottom up if you if you may like from the individuals you could also start the journey to more control for individuals with organizations if organizations serve a point in in the opportunities and we value creation of such a model then they will be the starting point and we will try to offer to their customers to their users the way to be more in control because they see the potential for creation of value not only for individuals but also for them regarding trust but also other possibilities like this models new markets and if you take the third party all the services and apps that I described as very users of data they could also be the starting point because when you see the data portability right you know it's not going to come from four individuals they are not going to write a letter to the telco company saying I need my data back in a machine readable format standard nobody's going to do that maybe a few maybe there would be a few class action with some people really like the Guardians but I mean I probably will for fun once but I won't do it much more so what and organizations are not going to push the data to individuals so we users can be very very helpful there and start with journey in a very concrete way because as an app as a service you can tell to your user hey thanks to the portability right you can ask your telco company your insurance company your I don't know energy provider you can ask them to give back your data and I mean I need that to provide you this awesome service so just click on bad box and I will send the request for you and they could do that and make the data but a portability right very effective and make the individual more in control I think that's couldn't that be dangerous to give the stasis of people and I was thinking about how do want to get data to give I mean it's co-created it's I mean you're right to that elf there is something called the blue button initiative for the warning you know yeah not be shared with individuals they concern if they are like too sensitive for instance in the in America in us they started something called the blue button initiative where they share data with the people their concerns except for some like you can't just share a test result saying your are HIV positive without the doctor being present right so that there are some guidelines about what kind of data in hospital a lab pharmacy company can share with individuals that's that's a scam we don't have time to go into that but I think will be very interesting I want to go to the sorry I will go through the slides again for the last round questions doesn't work well I was about questions for the last one sorry it's just advertising once Mordy yeah it was about artificial intelligence machine Bernie so the last part of the title of this panel so we heard that it's we go back to - who said that artificial intelligence machine learning could be useful engaging users and this processes but then we have a new issue in terms of transparency so how do we reveal users if you think this is a need how these machine learning algorithms and this intelligence you put in your interfaces works and I mean on this issue I I always been have been you know capped by captured by the the negative perspective that is on there is this kind of like mirror effecting on this on this field and people are seems to be much you know pretty much negative on that so no one really knows how this advanced algorithms to what they do that could be a problem yes this is what Harvard Business Review think big companies developing sure no interested in fixing the problem do you have any interested in fixing this problem of not knowing how they work and I know there are some companies doing that Google you know Google with this this steel initiative they say that what I say they say that machine learning needs more transparency either so it's not just a matter of data but also machine learning and processes and they tried with some I don't know if you know these projects these are just you know attempt to visualize how the algorithms work you have a very nice example of neural networks this is a they call it a playground so it's it seems that users can play with these visualizations and understand what's going on and they have also this embedding projector simulation and that's what I say they say enable anyone to better understand but do you think really that anyone can understand and what is your do you think they users have to understand how these new interfaces with machine learning and artificial intelligence work it's very good question so I would say that AI and machine learning can be used depending on the types of purpose so to create a new interface with natural language processing and so on the technology there is just to understand the customers better that's one thing the other thing is when you suggest new algorithms in order to deal with your data that you generate for some purpose the purpose can be for a third party or for your own company to provide some value and using some data sets right so the people right now and we've make some research about that the people are really mmm focus on understanding which data you will take to you algorithm as an input know to deal with that but rather than to understand if the algorithm do whatever neural networks cooler and definitely understand algorithms is something not for you know for the critical mass for the mass market it's really for kind of uses I I see the point in that it's important to understand what the algorithms struct and get insights about that but in our case we lead the research and and we understand that it's important to them say hey you take the location and you cross it with the web whatever and then call detail records and for that you get a better understanding of my physical presence or credit disk or you know whatever that's enough but I see the point some people will you know will request even more transparency how the algorithm works but I feel that that's a really really special you know request it's not for anyone as Google says oh yeah I would say yes maybe so what is your perspective on that right I think you can explain anything to anyone you use just part of the optimism that yeah I think so then the question is if you want to and that's I'm going back to the why do you want them to know and that's a decision that maybe you want to make as a business or maybe you are forced to do because of regulation but I believe you can explain an algorithm to any kind of user you just need to know that users and different types of users will get different types of explanations so if you are willing to adapt your explanation to every single kind of user you will make nine billion different explanations and then you will be able to be clear about it of course machine learning and artificial intelligence as terms are for companies very exciting because they are not really clear what they mean they don't understand it but they just think it's really important and also understand it go a little bit but the optimistic side of things is that you can learn as a service from users and you can improve what you provide in terms of value to those users and that's when you go back and you think so in order to do that what data points do I need to take what do I need to do with them to get that result and perhaps sometimes I ask myself if there is a one transparent way of showing algorithms or actually being unbiased in terms of an algorithm but perhaps the the way is to think is is this algorithm or is this process that you're running representing your values and your principles as a company or as a whoever is designing that and thinking about that is that representative of what you mean or what you want to say and who you are is that ethical and then run with it and then if not then that's when you go into a problem and if it is then for sure you can explain it because there was a reason behind it and you made conscious decisions how you created that algorithm how those decisions are made and then you should be fairly fast to explain to your users why you chose the way you chose yeah right so I love this optimistic perspective and what do you you start you mentioned already yeah actually we have a project that thing about algorithm transparency I'm not everyone working on it but we are trying to work with organizations again to to see how we can work with designers and Weaver's organizations to do the ritual engineering of algorithm to be able to explain it to to people like you don't need to be able to code to understand the algorithm behind the price making or things like that but if you may I just want to to rebound on the word artificial intelligence there so as I said earlier you know that the companies that are working on artificial intelligence now the most talked-about companies are like Facebook Amazon Google they have their own Department making things and why because they have the day down to do it nobody else can really do it like you can't do that big advancement to say without being able to aggregate tons of different data and I quote the phrase earlier I didn't say his name the phrase if you control the data you can develop artificial intelligence it's from Morozov right so that phrase is quite simple and quite clear what is value if you control the data you can develop artificial intelligence what is that you wasn't organisations wasn't Facebook Google what is it was individuals we're in control of the data and if you are in control of your data you are able to decide to whom you share it with and what if I want to share it with companies or research organizations that are building artificial intelligence that I actually feel trusted towards for example for curing cancer or various purposes of individual artificial medium just not only perfecting the best personalized ad which this is the word we are going to with intelligent artificial intelligence we are going to towards a world where artificial intelligence is used for personalizing even more very very relationship and the ads so what if I could if I get control over my data if I become the one place where I break the silos of data I get my data from my insurance company from material companies from my bank from any kind of organizations that all date on me I am the only one we are able to break those silos and I can vent share it with other organizations and it's going to be a way innovative new market where the competition will be real it would be only Facebook Google and Amazon is aware building artificial intelligence it will be other other organizations ambitious yeah good luck well I think time is over for the panel and let me close with something I borrowed from this Luke here well I'm not sure I asked for the consent for this slide but what I well my hope and I want to close here the panel and is that you know if we really think that there is someone asking what does it mean for me to me and this is a user I think there is a missing person here missing profile and missing competence I'm missing discipline and that's what we actually are doing so if I can't guarantee you that if you put a data scientist a domain expert and a designer together into one place starting from you know scratch from raw data something magic happened so my hope is that in the next slides I will see next year I will have some new people in in the slides new profiles new competences thank you to the panelists and thank you for the attention [Applause] [Music] you
