 so for this episode of new business ideas we are specifically focusing on blockchain and cryptocurrency company so here we have Chad with heroic we have got John with consensus and we've got Brian with he's got an incubator I keep calling an incubator what's the actual name of it right now I'm with block V block V block P I was gonna say block V and I'm like no that's not what it was not what it was okay so to start off what was your first company and how old were you when you started it I mean mine I was like 12 and there's a lot in my business and really my dad started it he just told me what to do what was yours so my first business was actually my dad was an entrepreneur and he had a ceiling fan business we lived in Arizona and everybody needed ceiling fans and I would sit outside of his office and make paper airplanes and sell paper airplanes to the people that would walk by and I did fairly well for like 10 $20 no they're probably a dollar or two dollars but it would give me enough to go get some candy at the at the 7-eleven right next door and probably my first business okay John alright mine was probably I didn't start very young mine was probably when I was 18 maybe I was in college did advertising class where we put together a spec advertising campaign for watches and I love the campaign so much that I decided to start importing watches from China and try actually like going forth with this advertising campaign to actually test it out and kind of did that for maybe two years and then for reasons that all startups kind of fade eventually or not all startups fade but ours faded okay and Brian with block V yeah so I guess I was an old man compared to you guys you know I did a lot of stuff in the early days but the first kind of business I ran where I paid taxes on it was in I think I was 23 years old he was right here in Provo and I actually took over a mattress company so a BYU student started a mattress company selling mattresses out of I guess storage units and at the time they were selling like five ten mattresses a month and so my friend and I we took over the company and we built it up to where we were selling like 80 mattresses out of I'm sorry per month and what would happen is by by appointment only people would show up we'd open up a storage unit door there'd be six mattresses laid out like a showroom people come lay on them and they say ah we want this one and I go right next door open the next storage unit and there's my inventory I throw it in my pickup and go go drop it off so it's in Utah because I may have right here on robear's probably one of your buyers awesome a lot that was my first thing that I had a business paid taxes on it and things like that and it was so much fun now there's a lot of mattress companies around like a mattress firms they're like on every single corner like I don't I was watching a video last night said it was a conspiracy theories to launder money like there's too many of them for there's such a large markup on mattresses that you know you don't have to sell many to actually you know cover your overhead and make a couple bucks so as just a young dude married with one one kid we made enough money to just have fun survive and and run my own schedule okay super fun perfect so let's start with you Bryan what is your new business idea probably I'm assuming scent gonna be a blockchain what yeah so let's put 30 seconds on the clock do your intro or elevator pitch and let's hear it yeah for me I've always been a little ATD jumping from idea to idea even when I wasn't an entrepreneur I was working for other people I couldn't spend more than two years somewhere because I wanted to go learn something else I wanted to move on to the next thing so for me if I if I wasn't with block V I would start an incubator accelerator where I've got connections with marketing and funding and legal developers in this space we need more people building more cool things and so for me I want to launch that accelerator that that incubator where ideas are coming in it's similar to consensus which can be talked about you know here in a bit but really the idea is to get more entrepreneurs doing more cool things in the space we just don't have enough people building even though when you look around a cycle man this is everywhere and everybody's talking about it there's very few people actually working in the space there's a lot of people buying tokens and coins and speculating but there's not a ton of people building and so I want to help that move forward and really bring some of these cool ideas to delight okay it's gonna be hard I think for the good idea bad idea segment because I think something like that be very very valuable from my perspective but let's I mean let's say a good idea but I did let's start with Chad well I think it's a great idea specifically because we do need this there is a huge need right now for people that know blockchain development that have some experience in it and because it's so new the the workforce right now is so little and yeah it's not only do we need developers but we need really good companies that are training developers and holding their hand and taking them through the process and really giving them an opportunity to learn on the job and I love it is that part of the thing - the training piece oh yeah you bet you bet I mean I so i own a domain called blockchain boot camp comm and part of the reason I own that is simply to say there's so many good developers out there that aren't working on blockchain technologies and and every company out there block V and and consensus and others they're all looking for good developers heroic I mean there's they're really hard to find that's number one but number two is there's a lot of entrepreneurs who have a good idea but they don't know the the legal ramifications of what they're doing they don't have marketers that can actually distill their message and present it to the community in a way that it they can understand you know so there's a lot of pieces to launching a company and so this accelerator would would bring whatever piece is necessary for a certain company to actually get to market developers is one of the big pieces how does the one actually begin building a blockchain business or something on like a theory Emerson like that is like to me just seems really like I know how to build a website I know how to build simple you know mobile apps with my teams but that concept of actually like plugging into aetherium I'm clueless on can I touch on on this one point though just coming from a consensus standpoint where that's kind of their model right is like I think that the execution of it is really important and not only is block V its own blockchain or is it a company that is on top of yes so let's make a distinction real quick so I'm with block B right this is the one that yeah this is right well block V is blocking agnostic got it okay because the reason I ask is that consensus is so interesting because it's not necessarily just a production studio for these these different businesses but it's also a spokes like a a bolster for aetherium itself and it makes so much sense for Jo because it's like if you have a large stake holding in aetherium in general it doesn't even matter if most of them fail as long as everybody is talking about aetherium and people are pushing forward aetherium all the businesses can fail and he can still win because if etherium succeeds then he succeeds isn't that the great thing about blockchain technology though I mean once you're in that's what that's how this whole thing started was a community that cared about Bitcoin so they were incentivized to go out and talk about it build things you know get get get people involved and then we see theorem come out and those who hold ether they want people to be building on top of ethier and they want it to work and so even with block V we have our own native token and we want people building on top of our platform because we all win if people are building on top of Block B because Block B is also you know tied to aetherium and Bitcoin and other block chains and so that's what I love about this industry it's so open it's it it really allows for working together in a way that no other industry I've seen has has done absolutely one of the things on that is you know really what blockchain is the Internet is a data exchange protocol data goes back and forth and what blockchain is it's a value exchange protocol it provides access to significant value and giving getting people on board and helping train them and helping build on top of that just magnifies that value like with the theorem getting as many people on to onto a theorem and building on top of it it just magnifies the value of it and and helps the community move forward perfect now what is block B want to give us a rundown on what that is and how people could be get involved or partner with you yeah you bet so Block B is we call it blockchain 3.0 because we're talking about bringing the experiential layer to blockchain technologies so we talk about inter interface moments for you know the internet for browsers we talk about the interface moment for apps so the App Store you know Apple we believe block V is the interface moment to blockchain so getting getting the normal I say normal getting my mom and dad involved using blockchain technologies without them even knowing so it's it's a it is a platform that allows developers to create smart digital objects so that they they serve kind of like apps but they have the the characteristics of crypto currencies exchangeable ownable shareable and so it allows for all kinds of cool business models to be built on top of block V one of them is smart ticketing you know where you at the end of a concert your ticket actually morphs into let's say a special edition ticket stub it's on the blockchain because you want to show ownership you were at the concert you own this but maybe you went to a u2 concert with your girlfriend and she doesn't care or you don't care about Bono and u2 so now all the sudden you have this this digital object that has a value well now you can put it on our marketplace and sell it to a fan boy that's collecting these these objects of value these ticket stubs that are special edition and that's just one use case but we have medical use cases gaming use cases and it's all being built on top of our platform it would be like an example of a medical use case yeah so imagine a weakling badams those are virtual atoms okay imagine this object gets sent to you from your doctor in a prescription bottle mm-hmm and in real time every time you take a pill for instance you click it and you can see it go empty in real time as soon as it goes empty it automatically triggers a connection to your prescription provider and says okay this person is out of there there whatever the drug is right and so there's this there's this way that there's a communication now so as soon as it goes empty a chatbot opens and now you're chatting with with the pharmacy and you get a refill ordered for you and as soon as that refill gets ordered you get a ping on your phone and now I'll send that bottles full with pills again yeah okay I can go pick it up and it allows it allows the pharmacy to actually communicate with you directly and it's an experience or way for you to manage that usage of the drug perfect what about for gaming how would block be helped with that yeah what's really fun about gaming is there's one company we're working with they own 15 different titles okay games and what they want is that they basically want to put objects like Easter eggs in in all of the different games and if you find that object you can actually extract that object from that particular game send it to your phone in what we call a viewer which is an app you can then sell that on an exchange you can prove ownership of it or you can actually import it into a different game so you might be in a game where it's like swords and and you know bows and arrows and you've got a bazooka and everybody's like where did you get that bazooka with actually found it in a different game and they were able to import it over so there's this emperor interoperability between objects so doesn't matter where you get the object Pokemon go style you could take that object and drop it on a map and somebody else can come pick it up and and now they have that object that you shared with them okay perfect well thank you so much for sharing your idea before we head out is there anything you guys would like to add too you know do anything that Brian is shared no I mean I have questions but I know what's your question like I don't want to take up the entire time you would go go well so one of my questions is for the first one it's like a heavy in the internet of things right is this a blockchain that is focused on Internet of Things like with the prescription pill you know and coming up with devices that are interfacing with it or like what's the what's the 3.0 portion because some of the use cases that you're talking about I would see are available with current day blockchain technology right yeah yeah no you're right so the idea is these objects are actually programmable so when you say objects are these objects are these like actual in real world objects it can be either but for instance let's say you're from the crypto kitties okay right crypto kitties was just pictures of cats really add bet on the back in their code and it says okay if you breed this type of cat with this type of cat you could get this special edition crypto kitty and so there's value in that well imagine if that crypto kitty was actually like a 3d object they could act they could change in real time and morph in real time based on code that's on the back end so that when you when you breed it you get a different experience than if it's then just being like a picture and then you go oh actually I don't want this one anymore I'm just gonna share it with somebody well it can be shareable or it can just be one copy of it as a limited edition item where I could just send it to you and you have a viewer now you have that cat you can prove ownership of the cat right I mean that's so the idea is to say there's these objects that should be able to be programmed and have again the properties of cryptocurrency that right now apps apps lack a lot of those those those properties give block VI oh and you can read about it perfect all right why do you have an initial first use case like your first like we are going to do this thing first well what's fun is we've already done quite a few things so one of them is abundance 360 are you guys familiar with abundance 360 the conference Peter Diamandis founder of XPrize singularity University kind of a big futurist he has a conference every year the attendees pay you know I think it's twelve thousand five hundred dollars for this conference and and they become a part of abundance this group so this year they actually used us for their ticketing system and for their raffle giveaways so what would happen is when somebody signed up and said okay yeah I want to go to abundance 360 they got a vadym which was a ticket vadym in that vadym was all the information of the venue the time where to me where the registration is but it was also a redeemable ticket so when somebody showed up they would say oh here's my ticket the worker would tap it and redeem it soon as it was redeemed it automatically morphed into a video of abundance 360 saying hey thanks for being here you know and it showed this video of last year's conference or whatever then they got another one that was for a raffle so it was kind of a random number generator on the back end and so everybody in the room would hold their phone and they're watching to see if they received the vadym for this giveaway it was up on the on the screen and so that was all programmed on the back end through our platform so that's a real life use case that that's been done and now everybody that went to abundance 360 has kind of a keepsake they can prove they were there they can show ownership of their ticket and again that's just a very simple use case that we've done perfect well thank you so much for sharing your idea and join us next time for John to share his new business idea so thank you so much for joining us guys you
