 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am here with Myla, who's getting bigger now. She is 16 months old . I am just going to show you a couple ideas of things to do around this age for Myla. Yes, she can get in and out of sitting by herself. She says, "Thank you very much" She is also a little bit shyer. So, let's see what happens. I am going to roll her up to sitting where she has to work a little harder than if she's getting up from the floor. I am going to put her on my lap. It is very similar to what we did before but instead of sitting her down to the floor where it is downhill, I am going to have her from here and bring her up. Uh-huh. That's right. Very nice! I am holding pretty strongly on that pelvis to get good rotation, get those obliques to come in. A lot of times kids with low tone want to go in straight planes so working that rotation. It is just like before. I put my forearm across the upper trunk, spin the hips and then help her come up. What a good girl! You can do that on both sides. It is great for working on core strength. I hope this is the idea that you can do at home. Thanks a lot! Bye-Bye!
