 Yay! Oh, excuse me. Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist. I am here with Myla. We are going to work on side sitting on a ball. The ball could be bigger or bouncier. I an adding a little bounce with my legs. We are just going to work on side sitting. She wants to sit with their legs pretty symmetrical and turned out , so I'm just going to put her in side sit. I am going to let her work on side sitting. I can do the same things I was doing before, rocking her side to side and forward and back. Well, on a bigger ball that would be easier. When you work on one side, just make sure that you work on the other side. Yes.  I see you. Usually kids have a side that they prefer over the other. I think the other side was the preferred side. Thanks! Yes! Come on up, sweet pea. It is fun to do side sitting on the ball. It is just another way to work on trunk strength and that usually kids like. There you go. And it is something you can try at home. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye! Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay! Come on down!
