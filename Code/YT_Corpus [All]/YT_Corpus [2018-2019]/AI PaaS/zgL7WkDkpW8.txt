 Hello everyone I am the product manager, Judy from IEI and today I will be introducing an industrial AIoT solution The TANK-870AI to you The main content for today will be focusing on three parts Brief introduction of AI TANK-870AI itself And the important added values of TANK such as Intel OpvenVINO tool kit accelerator cards and QTS gateway To begin with, what is AI? AI is the “in” thing, the trend for IT migration From the time of the mainframe computer was born we were only expecting that the machine could help us quickly process or calculate complicated mathematical issues When the computing system started to evolve the machines could then act as a multifunction tool And when network computing, server architecture and cloud computing appear human has entered a next level of utilizing the virtual space So what is next? By now humans are still owning or handling the process What if the machines can take their own actions? And that is where AI, artificial intelligent takes into place In short AI is nothing but a branch of science which deals with the fact that how we can make machines work and think like human This is the big picture You have the basic AI Perceptual understanding meaning detecting patterns and audio or visual data And you have another basic AI which is data analytics building a model that enables descriptive interactive or predictive analysis over any amount of diverse data When you go deeper you have machine learning, deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN) The deeper you go, the less human intervention you see human factor is almost negligible or as minimal as it can be The machine will think respond and act Expect it to be closer or even better than human behaviors To give you a more practical idea Most common applications are facial recognition, object detection such as car plate recognition and machine vision All of these TANK-870AI can help you achieve Now entering the main topic IEI is offering an AI inference system the TANK-870AI as the gateway to unlock your value of industrial AIoT Looking inside the system Tank-870AI is using the 6th gen Intel Core processor platform offering 2 SKUs: i5 and i7 upon your preferred selection It is enriched with high-speed I/O interfaces such as multiple COM ports USB 3.0 LAN ports and more Most importantly TANK has expansion slots 2 or 4 expansion slots to choose It allows customers to easily integrate different kinds of accelerated cards needed TANK also provides a convenient 4-pin internal power connector for add-on card usage adding more flexibility to the embedded system in industrial environment Something to be mentioned that TANK is proudly selected by Intel as one of its AIoT development kits that would be jointly promoted worldwide Collaborating with Intel the added value of TANK-870AI is it is compatible with Intel OpenVINO toolkit The OpenVINO enables convolutional neural networks (CNN) based deep learning inference on the edge it supports heterogeneous execution across computer vision accelerators and it also speeds time to market via a library of functions and preoptimized kernels As I have mentioned earlier TANK-870AI expansion slots are designed to offer accelerator card usage The CPU accelerator card, Mustang-200 developed by IEI ourselves has already been launched last year Following by FPGA accelerator and VPU accelerator both are Intel-IEI joint developing solutions and preparing to put on market this year 3rd quarter These accelerator cards can help customer to easily fulfill different kinds of AI inference demand In all of those characteristics of TANK-870AI I would lastly like to introduce TANK-870AI is also compatible with QTS gateway QTS Gateway is an operating system designed specifically for IEI IPCs and fully integrated the QNAP NAS operating system breaking through the stereotype of IPCs of not having operating systems and saving unnecessary costs for installing servers and computers QTS Gateway not only allows easy monitoring of computer status through its visualized interface it also allows the use of many free application programs making it multifunctional while challenging the values of traditional IPCs Among the listed functions I would like to specifically bring up three of them which is Build-in VM application remote device management and video surveillance software Virtualization station enables virtualize desktop operations on the NAS for managing multiple virtual machines with easy-to-use interface It provides physical-to-virtual (P2V) technology that can be used to create a familiar operating system such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Android adding more flexibility to system management The Container station integrates both software architecture and development process The station extends the JeOS (Just enough OS) concept and uses lightweight virtualization technology to allow developers and IT administrators to easily and freely switch between PC TANK-870AI and cloud All your needs in IoT environment including protocol services interface and data computation or processing method are able to operate in container station The last station in VM virtual application is the Linux station Linux station creates an open source platform for unlimited potential QTS gateway uses advanced virtualization technology to perfectly run both QTS and Linux operating systems in parallel Just download Linux station from the App center and use any kinds of display ports to output entire Ubuntu desktop add a keyboard and mouse just like operating a computer Next I would like to introduce the remote device management function in QTS gateway The remote device management system QRM+ is a centralized remote server management solution designed for IT services It improves server health status control for the administrators also detect, match, monitor and control resources in your network on a single platform QRM+ even tracks system parameters of all important devices and provides alarm and event management All in all QRM+ helps you to analyze the network resource efficiency and brings up IT and employees productivity Last but not least The Open surveillance system in QTS gateway is a professional network surveillance video management system The surveillance system QVR Pro can provide real-time monitory recording, playback, and management When you operate QVR Pro with supported IP cameras you can easily manage and monitor multiple IP cameras in real-time through web browser It allows you to create an independent and expandable surveillance environment on your TANK-870AI I hope you have enjoyed the livestream If you have any further questions Please scan the barcode on my left hand side and we will get back to you very soon Thank you
