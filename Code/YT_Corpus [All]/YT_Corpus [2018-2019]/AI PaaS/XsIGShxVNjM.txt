 live from San Francisco it's the queue covering Google cloud next 2018 brought to you by Google cloud and s ecosystem partners well welcome everyone back to the cubes live coverage this is day 3 of Google cloud cube coverage here Google next 2018 hashtag Google next 18 I'm jump where am i close chip Frick our next two guests kicking off day three is a 10 F the director of product managed to Google cloud part of the apogee acquisition really part of the API is really a big part of the story here Google necks and check announcement vice-president of IT at t-mobile customer Ed thanks for coming on Chuck thanks for coming on thank you a Pidgey big part of the story hit Google next is you know the role of api's and service is huge and I won't say nuance means certainly is CEO is a new to a lot of people kubernetes yeah super a very important piece of this new cloud service platform as well as just running workloads multi Multi multi cloud et cetera what's the focus what's going on for you guys at the event take a minute to explain the announcements and what you guys did here at the show sure so you know api's are how software talks to software and what we announced this week at the show with kubernetes and sto are new ways for people to build software and deploy it in in new distributed fashions and so that's creating new ways for tying your software together microservices a lot of people are talking about now or a key part of this and so from an apogee perspective you know we're looking at facilitating how to make that communications happen how to make it secure how to make it efficient how to monitor it and so what we announced was that Apogee is making it now possible for you to have all the tools that we've given you for managing your api's for you know getting your mobile apps to talk to your cloud services and all of that now is also going to apply to these new micro services that you're building and so we think it's a pretty exciting thing a lot of our customers have been asking for this and obviously Chuck being one of them and and so you know that's what it's been all about for us this week Chuck I was the api's key part of DevOps you know it's first started with slinging some API surround stitching together developers voted with their code clearly API is the way that it's software's working microservices takes it to a whole nother level yeah now operationalizing api's seems easy and but it's you've got to start managing things differently how are you guys taking that API and this new service management piece of it and kind of operationalizing API sense into t-mobile yeah we've been using Apogee for about four years now and so over the time I think we have 200 plus internal API so we've over that time we've kind of learned how to operationalize that piece of it over the last couple years we've really been focused on the micro service layers writing cloud native applications essentially in that layer and now with the the apogee hook into sto we're gonna have a much better way to manage it and it's really nice to see the platform time starting to grow and mature along with us so that's really great I could only imagine how complicated it is to run real-time cloud native and have also legacy and I think one of things I'd like to get your thoughts on is containers have become a nice piece of not ripping and replacing to bringing the new you don't they kill the old to bring in the new with you and now with containers kubernetes and micro services and it's do you have an ability to kind of do both talk about how you guys do with this this is not perfect storm and a good way for enterprises well yeah it it's it's really good timing for us as well we're just now starting our kubernetes journey on premise if you will so we are we're a big cloud foundry shop we're starting to put our legacy applications into docker containers and moving them we'll be moving them on to kubernetes and so you can see the whole the the containerization shift as we go as we go through time it's really a for us like said it's fortuitous that there's timing because now with this teo coming in and being able to control all that that's a great thing for us I talked about you give a lot of history to use a normal API is lingua franca it's been around for a while you've got a lot of experience in that but a lot of the enterprises that we talk to a leg there's a lot of pressure in IT to do more now with cloud native and and now with the new services that are out there the kind of gift takes a pressure off IT because the pressure of akkad I gotta have sunset that app or I don't know when to kill that workload I know I go on I may be transform it but I don't want to have to disrupt all this stuff so talk about the importance of non disruption because this seems to be a conversation that's talked a lot in the hallways yeah that's its it that's exactly right so you know what what you see within enterprises is that there's a need to deliver a whole set of new applications and a lot of these are connected to digital experiences basically everything that you experience on your mobile apps every new form of engaging with your customer that's where a lot of the business growth is that's bringing you know a lot of the the funding for these these new initiatives but a lot of the core data of the enterprise is locked up within systems that have been operating very efficiently but siloed for many years and and so that's the part that that we see the most which is you know folks with NIT come to us and say look you know I've been building these these legacy systems for many years now and I know that if I can just take the data that's locked up in these and bring these into these new ways of doing business that that that it's going to have a huge impact on my you know on my business and that's you know that's where the question sits and then the the follow-up on that is hey you know we want to we want to make our businesses more like the way you know you guys are doing it in Silicon Valley and we we see what you're doing with containers and we see things like kubernetes and cloud native and we know that's the right way to build things but there has to be a way for us to bring all of these other assets that we've been building for the last thirty years along for the ride and in fact for most of these businesses are responses hey it's not just a question of building along for the ride that that's your core that's your that has been what you built your business on so don't even just think about it is this thing that you somehow have to drag along think about how you actually can amplify it because it's been the source of your business for so long well yeah the would add to that is that it gives us scale and operation a much better operational platform to work with for us we've grown tremendously our growth has been tremendous over the last five years we've gone from I think thirty million customers to 73 million customers and frankly to scale those systems up containerization is probably the only way we can go with it and and and with from an operational standpoint having one platform like kubernetes to have to operate for all of this stuff just helps us out remember we hear that all the time I think that's the biggest story around containers outside of you know geeking out on the benefits of it is that it really allows a nice bridge to the future you don't have to burn the boats as they say and you can pick your pick on the applications you want to keep around right then you refactor them to be cloud native on the ones you don't you don't have to go all the way right and so you can make it a much better that way Kirksey your take on the changing competitive environment because before you know you had these big complex systems and you want to keep them running now the pressure for more innovation more applications quicker applications to leverage not only your inside stuff but outside stuff in how some of these technologies are helping you deliver that to your customers here your internal yeah like I said scale scale is one aspect of it performance is another and the ability to move those workloads close to the customer just like just like Google's trying to do with moving closer to the customer we do the same thing right and so that the hybrid cloud is real for us we run in in almost all the clouds right now in on-premise we treat that as a cloud as well but being able to do that it can only happen when we containerized stuff and utilize similar platforms on all these places and then you'll have this huge transformational shift over the next several years with 5g right that's a thing yeah we've been at it for a couple years now for a couple years so this is going to be another huge wave of change inside your infrastructure yeah yes and it's fantastic what are trying to do to Google cloud could share take a minute explain what was the the interest in Google cloud why Google cloud for you guys well we're just getting started with it but it's really it's it's the partnership we've had with Apogee that's helped us kind of understand what's going on with Google Cloud but then the open source nature of it as well as the the focus on AI and ml that's why we're really taking a hard look at what's going on with the real cloud because it and the attitude towards enterprises is great as well cultures good fit there yeah yeah it's interesting a lot of people are attracted by some of the speed I mean we've been hearing here at the show yeah you know Google offseason built their their business on being fast yeah won't having your own network is massive as well the API and what's the future look like for API is an Apogee inside Google give us a little taste of what you guys are working on some of the projects you guys are passionate about and some of the successes you've had or any anecdotal use case studies so definitely so you know API scary our customers most important data and and data is the basis for machine learning and AI and so you're gonna see a lot of product innovation for us about bringing you know AI to the point of these data conduits that are what api's are all about it's the natural place to couple it with every business process so that's a big deal for us I think that you know the security aspect you heard a lot about security in the in the keynotes again you know api's are the conduit in many cases for again the enterprises most important data to get outside of the perimeter of the enterprise it has to be done in a secure way you know and then finally being able to go and leverage the sort of collaborative nature the stuff you see with an open source the community around all this again you know most api's are about bringing a lot more developers to you know build more applications in less time around these api's and that is that collaboration component is something that we see a ton of opportunities in terms of leveraging you know Google's unique know-how in terms of advancing and pushing the state-of-the-art in API management so I think you're gonna see a lot of that from us Chuck I'd love to get your thoughts on how you an IT obviously keys transfer when we talk about it all the time how you keep track of what's good hey it used to be in the old days the saddle is pretty not that complex and you go to Gardner magic while there a leader I'll keep the tires they come in a vendor will come in but some of the best cloud providers don't even show up on a magic watch because it's horizontally scalable api's changes the stack a little bit of new modern middleware is emerging with sto and new sets of business models and services are emerging so a lot of people like trying to how do you determine who's good you know and I think is you want to move the needle your onyx transform you got a lot of builder how do you kind of evaluate is there any you know new ways or is it gut instinct or specific things that you look at really good question the wheat we look we try to adopt the open-source stuff first but we from the company standpoint we also look at the company themselves and who's really vested in what's going on with it like Apogee four years ago was was really the only ones are really only doing API is right and and their their knowledge and the depth and their roadmap that's what we really kind of look for but to your point things are changing so rapidly that you kind of have to go with the watch the open source community where all the pull requests coming from or what platforms are they going after and then track that and that's where that's what we try to do and so when we see kubernetes and the explosion that's happening on that the tooling that's coming around that we know that's gonna be good for enterprises going forward so we're gonna be heavily invested it's interesting we always talk about developers but what's interesting that's coming out of the show that we observing is it's always about developers to building absolutely but the role of an operator inside IT used to be an operator would you know maybe provision some storage systems and some servers now the role of what an operator use mean Network off guys now it's kind of more of a holistic view your thoughts on there's no super-early but the emergence of these two personas in I t's we look at it a lot it's automation right that's where it all comes it comes to play so if you've got a platform like a kubernetes where you can have all this automation built around it and you let the developers just do their thing and focus on the the business logic that's huge so there there is kind of two personalities and the caring unfading of that platform is just as important as the guys right in the applications across its really great environment that final question for you guys observations on the show Google next what's your observation ah see you got an API perspective just globally looking down maybe kind of look soom out and look at look down at the show thoughts and commentary on what's happening here you know I think the the scale of it has been amazing you know and you know we became part of Google two years ago we were here at the show last year looking at it this year and and the level of growth activity attendee is the number of announcements it's just been amazing it's been very exciting for us to be part of Chuck it's not a super impressed this is this is our first one really that we've we've come to we were even participating onstage on the K native we wrote some applications to work with K native but it's a it's a very diverse crowd which is awesome I think you really need that some of the others I don't seem as much so I think what Google is doing and again their approaches to enterprise looking more at solutions vertical solutions very impressed with what's going on it's really great trying congratulations on all your success to the f you guys you guys have done the work and open source it's where the your employees want to work they want to meet other people and this is where the co-creation that's where the assessments of the vendors happen and source 30 - mobile comm that's that we want to be and thanks so much to you because you at the time it's a cube live coverage here in San Francisco covering Google clouds conference next 18 we right back with more d3 coverage stay with us we right back [Music]
