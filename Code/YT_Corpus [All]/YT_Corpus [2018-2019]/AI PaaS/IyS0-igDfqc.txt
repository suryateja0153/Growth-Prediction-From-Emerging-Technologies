 [Music] so welcome everyone to a high-performance computing a session on Google cloud my name is Bill Magro I'm Chief Technologist fight for high-performance computing at Intel and I've the pleasure to have with me today Peter McShane from apps broker and Bill knits Berg from altair there in the corners and we'll be we working through this together so what we plan to cover today in the session is I'm going to talk about what Intel is doing to power HPC in the cloud through our CPUs and our activity is working closely with Google and with the ecosystem but that's not enough and so we're going to transition then to Bill and he's going to talk to you about how you alter is working to really make it easy to get access to HPC in the cloud by delivering appliances essentially a pass layer and access to the applications that matter and then finally finally peter is going to tell you about a center of excellence that we've put together that's going to make it a lot easier for you to come and experience HPC in the cloud and do it with very low risk and low cost to understand how to take advantage of the value we're going to talk about today so let's dive right in so first of all I'd like to just talk about our collaboration with Google we have a long-standing about 15-year collaboration with Google and it started with in providing feedback and helping us shape the features and our processors over the years we've delivered six generations of custom CPUs to Google and they were in fact the first to offer our latest processor generation platform skylake also known as the xeon scalable processor family so it's very exciting to have so much innovation the cloud and the earliest access and as you just heard in the keynote and was announced recently we're now going to be launching instances with Google that actually use Intel's obtained data center memory octane DC to give very very high capacity at much lower cost for in-memory workloads that demand that and so if you want to go over to regime skillern session or our cloud computing GM she's going to be talking a lot more about that in the next hour look up the Intel session so Intel Xeon processors are at the heart of the Google cloud obviously performance is foundational and there's a that we've put in to our latest generation skylake to drive performance I'll tell you about that later and show you some of the results in terms of security your data security is paramount and Intel processors have things such as the AES ni instructions which actually accelerate the encryption decryption calculations and computations that protect your data that's an example of something that's in our CPUs and always advancing to give you high performance at high security and finally the virtualization features and our processors are really sitting underneath a lot of the capability of both the security and the flexibility and the agility that allows you to to share essentially a common resource in the cloud and do it safely and securely so clicking down the level into high performance computing I'd like to talk about what HPC is first sometimes you talk to people and H they're new to HPC sometimes they have very different definitions at Intel we think of HPC is an activity that really has three characteristics the first one is the purpose of the calculation is actually to gain some insight you're trying to learn something there's an intellectual product the second characteristic is it has to be a demanding workload it's not low performance computing this is high performance computing and the third characteristic which i think is really important is when you appropriately apply more resources to the problem you actually get a more valuable result so think of one of these examples like weather forecasting you could do a weather forecast on your phone but you get a 12 hour forecast and maybe 30 days that has zero value but if you can run that thing in in three hours and now determine that something's going to happen you need to evacuate some people or change your plans I can have tremendous value financial value and just personal value and those examples there are many of them across many fields that they do high-performance computing and it may be surprising to you but we think of data analytics and machine learning a lot of that actually is the high-performance computing workload and if you apply that those three tests you'll see why so why are people thinking about high performance for high-performance computing some people think it's a bit of an oxymoron use AI high-performance computing is about supercomputers right well if you go to any supercomputing site what you'll find is they have some very large applications and workloads that are driving the the characteristics and the size of the machine but they have many many smaller workloads that that could actually run somewhere else so it's still HPC not every workload needs that machine necessarily those machines though tend to be completely full 100% utilization and there's always a backlog and as soon as the queue gets shorter engineers scientists whoever's using that thing are putting more jobs in so there's always this pent up demand and so one of the main reasons people are looking to the cloud is because some of their workloads can run well in the cloud and they can manage those demand searches and by taking some of the workloads that maybe aren't demanding the on-premise resources and putting them in the cloud they actually make their own friend the system even more valuable while it stays full there's also getting access to new technologies like I mentioned earliest access to skylake in the cloud and also R&D collaboration think of teams all around the world rather than shipping data back and forth we take advantage of the tremendous network that Google cloud has and then enables people to collaborate much more easily than they've been able to in the past so how do you decide what workloads should fit in the cloud there's really two characteristics the first one is do you trust the cloud and I would argue that in the past people felt that the cloud maybe wasn't as secure and as safe as keeping things at home I think those perceptions are changing some of the best security in the world is in the cloud so there's this this boundary of public cloud but it's rising at the results of that in terms of technical characteristics as I said there's a wide range of workloads that run in HPC and any of them could run on a dedicated HPC system or a supercomputer but many of them over on the left where they don't necessarily need to scale as far they don't need as tight coupling for message passing which is the predominant way that high-performance computing applications run these are great fit and so you see in industries like finance and genomics that's where things start or in manufacturing I show them on the boundary where some of the early calculations to do design studies have done in the cloud and final studies for noise vibration harshness combustion car crash simulation and safety are run still on a traditional HPC system so finding the right workloads is key and putting those in the cloud so behind HPC in the cloud and behind the Google cloud we have the Intel Xeon scalable processor family this is our latest generation codename skylake and we drove a lot of innovations into this processor specifically to meet the needs of high-performance computing workloads they very broad benefits but HPC was one of the main drivers an example is moving from the previous generations ring architecture to connect the course to a dual two-dimensional mesh there's also tremendous cash enhancements the addition of avx-512 instructions what allows us to do twice as many flops per clock tick floating-point operations we increase the memory bandwidth by gender by a factor of two over the previous generation and finally we increase the number of cores and the efficiency of hyper-threading and as a result people are able to run much more dense calculations on a single CPU so you're seeing many more virtual machines virtual CPUs inside of a VM now are possible so where are these available Google's been tremendously aggressive in getting these out and so I think this slide is already out of date since we made it just a few weeks ago there were 13 regions google is adding the Skylink instances all around the world so if you want to use these all you have to do is say the minimum CPU and and specify this family in fact Bill will talk about that a bit in his section and you can get access to these and try out about and see how well they do for your own workload because at the end of the day that's what matters but I do want to show you some examples from some of our customers and what they're saying I think Descartes lab is a really interesting interesting company they're mining one petabyte of satellite imagery from NASA from the last 40 years to look at what's going on and and out of the satellite data correlate it to the history of the food supply in the world and using it to predict crop yields right this impacts the financial services markets it impacts food security around the world this is an application of high performance computing machine learning and obviously very very big data and they've just in this move to the latest generation saw 40% uptick almost in their performance and you can see other examples where people are seeing almost 2x especially in the life sciences area the biotech companies at the right so some date card is actually has a session tomorrow if you want to hear more about their experience and go look at it so a lot of this performance does come to you quite naturally if you've modernized your code but I do want to put one caveat out there and say if you haven't modernized your code you're just counting on the processor to make things faster you may be missing out so this is an example from financial services of a binomial tree options calculation and you can see there's a hundred and 30x performance difference over the seven years that comes from someone who actively optimized the code versus someone who didn't so you need to thread your code you need to vectorize your code you need to work with the Intel compilers that unleash the performance of this process this processor otherwise you could be leaving a hundred x performance on the table this is a this is a synthetic benchmark but we see it in real applications as well so it is work but we have things to help you out with that so what does Intel do to help you we're talking about modernizing your code well the first thing we need to do is provide a development methodology for your high performance computing applications that allows you to understand where you're leaving performance on the table and then go chase it down so some things we recommend the first one out of this parallel studio XE is use optimized libraries these have been hand tuned for latest processors they're out there today they're launched with the processors so if you're using math libraries you're getting the performance many many applications and HPC do that the second one is compile our compilers are updated well ahead of the release of a processor and allow you to actually update your application it'll still run on previous generations but it'll be optimized for the new generation be ready to go when it comes out we have analysis tools again that point you to not only where you're leaving performance on the table but also tell you how you can extract that performance by making recommendations around vectorization recommendations around threading and even projecting for you the type of performance that you could get our adviser tool and finally our vtune tool shows you the results of your analysis and whether or not you got the performance you expected and if not why not by using the hardware counters that exist in our processors and some very advanced analysis techniques and finally performance is nothing if your application isn't correct and anyone who's done parallel programming knows that multithreading vectorization if you do them incorrectly you can get the wrong results so we have a whole suite of tools that analyzed and will help you find those types of problems automatically which are tremendous productivity boosters so this is exactly what we recommend for on Prem systems it's exactly what you need to do in the cloud so we've put a lot of effort in with Google to make sure that these tools are run and run well in the cloud so please check out the parallel studio XE if you're going to be running applications in the cloud that you write yourself so the last thing I want to say before I hand it over to Bill is I've talked about CPUs I've talked about the motivations but there's there's a big distance between coming up from the bottom and having the infrastructure interfaces that you get through Google Cloud and what HPC users and HPC applications expect coming from the top and the link between those two worlds to make it possible for you to continue using your on-prem resources but put those same applications perhaps with different input datasets in the cloud is consistency so Intel has been working with the industry for over a decade to document a standard cluster architecture and it's been adopted very broadly i'm Altair's been one of our great partners in this and their appliances actually implement this and as a result are very compatible not only with their own applications but from applications across the industry so with that I'd like to introduce bill mitts Berg who will take you through some of those usability things and making HPC work in the cloud thanks Bill hey and now I get to say thanks Bill let me just start by telling you that I I believe we believe it Altair that HPC improves people's lives and and you've heard from Bill about the different places but I'm when I think about high-performance computing I think about you know making child safety seats safer making airplanes lighter to save fuel making you know my cell phone not break when I drop it it's it's about making people's lives better it's why I'm here it's why I do what I do it's why I really love working at Altair and a tiny bit about Altair we're kind of unique in that I'm gonna talk about the middleware layer which is trying to make HPC more accessible and more easy that's PBS works and I'm gonna talk about that that's where I live in Altair but Altair also has two other groups they're actually bigger than mine one makes applications physics applications that actually do high-performance computing so the folks who are actually designing you know a new outside of a phone or something or a new car bumper or something will use those applications and then we actually have a team of people around the world hundreds of people around the world who are just engineers actually using these tools using our middleware doing stuff it's it's this fantastic feedback loop we have openings if you want to never leave so PBS works is really software for high-performance computing that makes high-performance computing sort of more natural more easy and I'll give you a couple examples and I have a couple videos so we focus on making things sort of easier for administrators and managers to control high performance computing and that's both giving visibility about what's going on but also sort of setting things up doing all the you know the nitty gritty that you have to do connecting to clusters but also sort of connecting up into into a cloud or actually just running in the cloud I'll say more about that but we also focus on making things easier for actual engineers and researchers when they're using stuff and I'll show you what the vision looks like for that and then finally we haven't that's sort of Altair access so the name of the tool and then we have a tool called PBS Pro which I won't really talk about which optimizes stuff once it actually gets there tiny bit more about control so control is the control center the that we put in front of it's a GUI it's a web-based GUI for HPC administrators that lets you sort of a single pane of glass and lets you configure deploy monitor handles bursting for you connecting your private HPC supercomputer up up to something like Google cloud gives you real time monitoring reporting really nice feature that we've added is a workload simulator and I don't have a demo of this so I'll just say it you can actually take so one of the problems in high-performance computing these are really complicated systems even if you're using even if you're all cloud it's a conflict it's a complicated infrastructure with a complicated workload and if you want to optimize exactly what you're using and how you're using it it's nice to be able to say hey here's what I did last quarter could you tell me if I changed a few things around if I switched to you know if I used larger memory knows what will you know how fast would things have got done would we have had faster turnaround and so we have a simulator built-in that lets you ask and answer that question and then cloudbursting on the access side we really have been trying to reimagine what engineers do so I'm a geek I'm a nerd and so I live in command line I'm happy to install Linux although I haven't done in too many years but I'm happy to really and what we found though is is that great at the very very high end people really know what they're doing they're experts but if you want to take high-performance computing which by the way my definition of high-performance computing is is taking computing up to the absolute maximum performance level you can not quite you know just to where it almost doesn't work but right up to the edge so so performance is paramount and so at that level you have a lot of really smart people they don't mind doing a lot of stuff but if you want to make that available to other people down lower what we found is that the engineers of today are not as happy doing all the nitty-gritty stuff and in fact if you can give an interface this is crazy I don't believe it but I actually believe it that sounds crazy if you could give an interface that requires it's zero Linux shell or zero little bits about IT you can actually attract like a hundred times more people in terms of just learning curve so if you can get nobody to have to type ls' or CP you actually get this huge extra set of people and so that's our vision and let me just show you what PBS access the vision for PBS access and I don't know this is gonna work I should introduce this it's just a Windows this is a Windows desktop of how you might actually access a Google compl at forum Google compute platform running a high-performance computing application and the video is really what a day and level 58 seconds in the life of an engineer to run a high-performance application ok so that we're gonna have to do from here I think let's see what we got hmm Wow I don't know how to play the video do we mm-hmm any guy no okay we're gonna go to YouTube apparently but I don't have that screen oh there we go wait well I'm gonna do this it's gonna mess everything up we're gonna start it from the beginning okay regular desktop I'm a regular engineer usually I just have my files in front of me I'm right clicking on a file it actually gives me this new option process with which basically means run some high-performance computing I'm gonna pick op destruct which is a structural engineering optimization code that's it that right click is everything I need to do you can see in the upper right it's actually uploading some files off to the high-performance computing system or cloud it's actually submitting a job for me automatically the little file icon actually says hey stuff was uploading and hopefully by the time I finish this sentence that little file icon will say everything is now downloaded nope okay okay job has completed and it will automatically bring those files back so what did I not do I didn't log in anywhere I didn't type any shell I didn't do anything and we're actually doing some Google i/o and I don't know how to get back to this can we go back here no wait wait the witch ah hey hey okay thank you there's gonna be two videos sorry uh awesome [Music] so the vision is basically effectively nearly invisible high-performance computing so that's gonna actually attract a huge quantity of more people who don't have access to - where it's computing and that lets you get to your local local system or cloud at Altera like I said we have this broad range of applications and one of the things that you want to do in high-performance computing is you want to perform as fast as possible so these are physics applications that do the work as any and one of the nice things about our partnership was Intel we get you know access to Intel processors and we can actually do sorts of meet tests and we did one of those tests with radios a crash code and found that actually it runs 1.8 times faster on Intel skylake and just there's two examples I'll give up how you can actually choose Intel skylake because you know if you want to get performance if you're doing high-performance give you thing you want to so one is when you're creating an instance on Google Cloud you can just pick the you can just pick I want skylake and for that you're gonna actually get skylake you'll get this 1.8 times faster but how do you actually get you know most high performance computing today is actually done in private systems on supercomputers and and even though it's the most leading-edge sort of newest work that people working on the organizations are a little slow to adopting so most of the work actually still happens in-house on private clusters and we're just connecting the cloud and the way that we're connecting to the cloud is through cloud bursting if you haven't heard it before all that means is building a hybrid system a lot of works happening locally when you have specific work that fits you actually create an instance on the cloud to run that local work and with the PBS works tools we make that really seamless and let me show you I'm going to skip this slide the interest of time here let me show you how that's done and I'll just show the second video which I'm gonna have trouble with it which is why I'm skipping a slide so this is the last video I have and let me see if I can do this by clicking on the right hand side here let's see if this just works ha it works so with with PBS works we actually let you build an appliance on the cloud with a few clicks so this is the interface inside of PBS cloud IO which is the software-as-a-service version of PBS control you just say hey I want to build an appliance say a few things about what you want you pick Google compute platform because we're here you can pick the region where you want to run and then actually for the appliance in this case we're building a hyper works appliance you'll actually pick the kinds of instances you want in here I'm actually picking a 90/60 few instance so that'll get me skylake we automatically fill in for you all of this crazy stuff you need in order to actually do the system ministration stuff you can of course change it because you have to and that's it the beautiful interface I showed you on the Windows desktop also is available as a web interface it's just as beautiful but maybe not as simple because but if you want to submit a job through the web instead of through the desktop more or less the same thing you pick the application you want you say here's the file I want fill in any kind of not default that that that hat don't sorry any anything that's not defaulted and click Submit you can actually get a lot more access through the web about what's happening if you need to yeah so you can actually find out what's going on you can check the files as they're local as they're running on supercomputing Center you can check the files actually if you've bursted the cloud you can actually see the files of the running job while it's there you can get all sorts of job attributes um perhaps one of the the very neat things that you can do through this interface I don't know my timing perfect is you can also do remote visualization which means you can take something like a Chromebook here with no memory and you can submit a job a graphics job that's gonna use say you know 256 gigabytes of memory and all sorts of huge powerful stuff and you can say please run this job in the cloud but I want you to stream the bits back to my back in my browser so that I can actually do the work no matter where I am and it's as simple as sort of while I was talking what you saw there you just say here's what I want to run I want to run on the cloud we do all the orchestration behind the scenes we set everything up and you can run huge and fantastic large yeah sorry about that bicyclist fantastic large simulations even from your you know even from a really small device and with that I'm gonna turn it over to the next speaker Peter thank you come on let's give bill a big round of applause it's so exciting technology we've seen here folks who would have thought a year ago we could even do some of the things that we're doing that it's possible that Bill Magro is talking about in terms of HPC some of the orchestration tools the bill from Altair has been telling us in terms of orchestration it are incredible but I'm here to ask a question and help see how we can answer that which is given all this amazing technology why is so little of it still being used less than 10% of this great tech lab technology is being used at the moment by people that require a HPC and I have a personal interest in this as well in that once upon a time I was doing a lot of electromagnetic lynnie induction research and one of my biggest frustrations was waiting and how in today's environment can we afford to wait and that's something that we really need to solve and really need to solve quickly I think there's a lot of business people in the audience they don't really realize what's possible that's what we want to we want to help enable so I'm Peter McShane good morning everybody I represent a company called apps broker and before we help answer that question let's tell you a bit more about apps broker apps broker is an extraordinary organized we are the biggest Google practice in Europe the biggest we've got 150 staff spread across the UK spread across Romania and unusually we also have what we call customer experience officers in France in the Alps and we earn our own island where we do customer collaboration and team building so we do things differently so differently that if you wanted to spot an apps broker person just look for people wearing these red jackets because we were told it was cold in San Francisco man we are sweating so yeah very easy to spy on and just to give you a sense of what apps broker is all about is for the some of those who were listening to the solution selling workshop where we're doing things differently in financial services is you know we're helping apply regulation or helping banks enable sort of method regulation and opening up all sorts of new data sources they didn't know existed we're doing similar things in retail in supply chain optimization in the retail space but one of the things that we're really excited about is all this infrastructure that Bill magros talking about how do we start creating real time innovation how do we start getting results now and that's why one of the things that we've we're doing now is we've just partnered we set up a partnership with Intel and Google to form what we call the extreme cloud center of excellence now this is an amazing facility with three pioneering organizations in cloud coming together to try and answer that question that we talked about earlier firstly know delivering something that is not just cheaper but faster and also way easier to consume cheaper because Google Cloud is currently offering the lowest TCO in terms of changing what is normally in super computes a big capex expense into an optics expense with some of the greatest technology from Intel I mean without a doubt Intel Xeon scalable technology is some of the best in the industry at the moment but what they're doing as well is Bill talked about power studio and some of the maths Colonel libraries as well these are really making it a bit easier to use but where we're putting the wrapping on that is trying to bring people into this people in terms of apps broker experts that have been working with Google for 12 years on implementing Google platform so we understand Google but leveraging the best of Intel and Google resources as well now why is they important because one of the reasons why a lot of the change isn't happening is because it's about creating business awareness business leaders don't know what's possible it's also around creating technical awareness helping people understand what performance is really possible people that typically have their own platforms and also it's very much around creating a change in culture as well one where people are thinking about using new features all the time and not standalone static systems so we talked earlier about extreme cloud bill mentioned you know the use cases in in a number of industries and yes right now using the Google cloud platform for big companies means you can do far more processing far more analysis far more simulations you can get really good insights at very low cost the challenge you're we're hearing from a lot of customers though is well if we start adopting the cloud how are we going to have a roadmap of innovation and and that's something that Google is answering with the Intel relationship you heard today or yesterday about the Apache pass feature set that's been put onto the Intel platform and there's many many more things coming and what's great about Google is they're adopting that quickly so that's a big tick the second thing though waring from customers is this is great but what about security because despite the fact that Google's whole cloud platform was built with security you know as part of the DNA people don't really know how to use it properly a lot of them have system administrators that haven't really had the experience of deploying it's scaled in cloud yet a lot of them don't know how to do sandboxing a lot of them also concerned about Layton sees because some of them have very constrained systems where the infrastructure needs to be pretty close to the data so that's why we set up echo eko is a physical facility the first one we've got is in the UK we plan to put dots all over the map and what it's doing is allowing organizations to really get a sense of the power of the Google cloud platform in terms of HPC now how we're doing that is we're not just providing access to Google cloud on people what we're doing is real hybrid performance benchmarking what that means is we've got a facility with an in-house intel on-premise platform as well as the Google cloud so customers can start seeing which Klerk workloads to make sense to put on the cloud and which workloads make sense to leave on Prem because we're not saying that Google cloud right now is the answer to all the workloads there are some workloads that are very or many workloads that are very sensitive they have to be run on on print systems but this this offers an opportunity to really start testing that in different environments what we also have is is partnerships with some of the specialized RSV so we talked about Altair and and if you can wander down to Moscone West to the where the Intel stand is we're actually showing some of the work we're doing with Intel and it's sorry with Altair and PBS there and how can we start optimizing orchestration how can we start doing it across several different applications what you also get with with the echo environment is direct access to some of the key staff in Apps broker Google and Intel who are constantly looking at some of the new feature sets and really start enabling a sort of a hybrid cloud environment start doing real sound boxing one of the cool things as well as wherever we learning we're turning those into tools so in terms of orchestration we're looking at how we start doing consistent deployment of VMs and containers at scale which enables this we're also looking at tools for cost management as well because one of the things that customers are concerned about when moving into the cloud is how do I contain the cost how does this not get out of control it's great that I'm innovating at speed but how do I avoid this getting out of control and that's the value that we're providing as part of the echo environment now in order to to to realize scale one of the things we recognize is that you need to have a proof of concept initially and we call our proof concert process three steps to extraordinary now what this does is helps both business leaders and technical and technical fokin organizations get a sense of what the business case is get a sense of what the benchmark you what the performances and what and also what the roadmap should look like for your organization so as part of that we've established what we call the apse Booker blueprint which really helps work with you to get a sense of exactly how your HP C is performing at the moment and from that moving that into a workshop environment within the echo environment where we can start doing some option earing start not just doing whiteboards in terms of what workloads should go in the right in which place what kind of orchestration is possible but actually testing that real time so now you have an opportunity within a lab environment to start sandboxing properly across both on-prem and off prim it's not trying different types of orchestration and the results of these three steps thought extraordinary process is effectively a business case which gives you the cost benefits gives you the performance benefits which workloads perform which don't and also gives you a roadmap now that's pretty critical for customers and in fact somebody that we're working with live right now is a European hedge fund there is an immense demand in buy-side financial services in terms of quants to start up taking advantage of google cloud and a massive demand but one of the challenges that they keep on facing is well how do we make this secure how do we start actually using the capacity in the right way for different types of workloads you've got Kwan's that are doing algorithms on significant amounts of external data significant amounts of internal data who currently are constrained to I mean constraint to develop new algorithms or or constrained because algorithms take too long to run on systems this means millions of dollars millions of dollars for these organizations and so what we're doing is working with with one of the larger headphones to to look at firstly setting up a hybrid data set up so mimicking what they need in the future which is probably in a bit of an on-premise as well as a cloud platform start establishing provisioning helping them to start provisioning a scale both on Prem and off Prem helping to do setups and tear downs as quickly as possible also reproduce the third-party environments bring the is visa into the mix you know in the same way we talked about out tear and crash testing we're gonna do the same in the Kwan space bring everybody into the environment because we don't know all the answers but if we bring everybody in we're gonna get the right answers and one of the things that we're looking as well with this particular fund is how you know with the workload manager you can start allocating workloads between different types of environment and what's exciting is that the moment people start recognizing the potential is they start looking at some of the other Google products such as tensorflow and cloudy I and look at well hey we can use these to create whole new models this is the exciting thing about when people start culturally recognizing the art of the possible through the second environment and one of the other things that we've helped the hedge fund organizations is we showed the market cost control dashboard which really takes a view of what you're likely spend might be and starts notifying and messaging people in terms of you know when when things may run out so it gives you control over that spend as well so in summary I think you know we're at an inflection point all this technology that bill and Bill spoke about earlier is fantastic but it's really usable now and I think coming back to the question answered asked at the beginning of the presentation is why are you waiting why are you waiting to innovate if you're running a design business if you need insights why are you waiting the time is now and certainly if you can make your way down to the Intel stand in Moscone West we'd love to talk to you we'd love to see how we could potentially do a proof-of-concept with your organization and start making this real thank you very much [Music]
