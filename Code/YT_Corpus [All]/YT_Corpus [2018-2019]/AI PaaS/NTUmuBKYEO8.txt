 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I am a pediatric physical therapist with almost 30 years of clinical practice/experience. I am here with my Myla, who is my co-instructor. She is 10.5 months old. She loves her feet, and she has one tone and Down syndrome. We're working on ideas to help her think it's a great idea to put weight on her legs which she doesn't think it's such fun! So a simple thing to do is to do massage, deep massage through the base of the feet. You saw how she drew her feet up. She does lots of play just touching the bottom of her feet. Doing more deep massage through the ball of her foot... okay... If she could learn to tolerate that a little bit better, she'd be more prone to take weight standing. There you go! That is good. Let's try this one. So I can go one direction. I can go 2 directions. If someone massaged my feet I would be so happy. Yes, are you rubbing it off? Okay. So it's a simple idea to work on weight-bearing through the legs. Thanks a lot!
