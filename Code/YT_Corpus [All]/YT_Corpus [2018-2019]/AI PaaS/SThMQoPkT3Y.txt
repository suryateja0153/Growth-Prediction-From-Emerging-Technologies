materials they're available also right now no registration required for those and we like to make this interactive so to connect Malcolm just type in the submitted question box now Malcolm left the cover and not that much time so let me hand it to you and tell us about modern application development for digital business thanks Vince and really excited about talking about a topic around modern application development for digital business and whenever I see that word modern you know I always want to play with that word and thinking about what is modern mean today and how does it compare with how we've done work in the past especially taking an analogy to previous industries maybe non IT related but how do we actually produce products in the past now let's take a little journey in the past specifically if you saw the integration developer news session back in February of this year let's take a little bit of journey back to the past and thinking about first well what was energy product in product production like before the Industrial Revolution now if you join us before in February and integration developer news I've worked on this topic a little bit of comparing IT development to how industrial development works in the 15 sixteenth century and if you look at that back in that time frame you know such as like a weaponsmith or a blacksmith producing a product every single village every single city you need to have a grown blacksmith handy that blacksmith industry was basically a cottage industry you know they were producing individual products for a specific owner it was a very inefficient because the blacksmith had to build their own energy source by gathering the coal or wood they had to grab their own supplies manufacture device there's no standards between individual weapons like if I had a firearm from the sixteenth century there was no guarantee that a trigger mechanism on one firearm would be anywhere close to working another trigger mechanism built by another blacksmith there's no standardization we'll say between products and what we find today if you think about how corporate IT is work it's a lot like this where instead of the cottage industries for every single village every single village now being its own corporation for example you needed a software I need software to produce kind of things I wanted so just like a village in the 15th century they needed a blacksmith I needed software but you felt compelled in the 90s and 80s to build your own data center and build your own power plant and build your own mechanisms and standards for your specific organization with very little standards that allow for interoperability between other corporations so I see a lot of parallels between that pre-industrial revolution and what we had in kind of IT almost leading up to today which a lot of organizations still operate like this now this system has produced this very common metric across any Enterprise IT organization that because you're taking on so much responsibility to develop the product yourself develop not lose the product but also the components that go into that product that digital product will say that software solution that you spend so much time just in maintaining the resources maintaining the infrastructure than actually building innovating new products now we saw this in the Industrial Revolution as we move from 16th to 17th and 18th century and finally into the Model T era with Henry Ford's manufacturing lines we really streamlined the operation so preindustrial moved to industrial where all that manufacturing now went into a central development environment industrial production so instead of having numerous blacksmiths a single industry to produce say weapons or hammers or any type of item for a large number of people and then distribute that across all the cities and villages now you see a similar migration happening in inside IT right now where we're starting to migrate that Iver safai cottage industry of IT across corporations into a centralized mechanism what is the centralized industry that we call a it's the cloud where we're moving things into a common cloud infrastructure that we can save the time we no longer need to spend the time on maintaining the infrastructure so we can spend more time actually innovating and it's well even the cloud architectures are becoming more diversified so as you need to build say a car today a manufacturing plant is relying on a number of other industries suppliers will say so a single manufacturing plant is relying on another industry to build say the the tires the brake pads the engine the seats the leather all these different industries work together as suppliers that go into another industrial manufacturer to bring the finished product together and I think we're in that transition where we see that right now manifesting an IT where as we're moving from cottage industry to industrial production of ite we're now I can leverage the centralized assets of an industry such as cloud computing resources to now where I can combine multiple industrial products together to form entirely new products as we see in like the car production so what are we talking about here what is the current ear of enterprise IT automation let's talk about this a little bit more direct means of how this translates the latest trends in corporate IT cloud for example of course if you're not leveraging cloud already you should be because you're probably trying to have your own blacksmith the environment for creating digital platform or digital software solutions leveraging of course infrastructure of service and platform of service is key to maintaining that efficiency mechanism to create new innovations across the marketplace but going beyond that we see also new innovations around containers micro services and serverless computing which are all very much related micro services especially is that idea of the modern kind of industrial complex where I'm building a digital solution now which is actually a composite of parts from different industrial suppliers so I have different cloud industrial suppliers of maybe address services or maybe telephony services or maybe AI services they're starting to come together into a centralized platform those micro services are deployed in containers which are often small individually managed say server applications much lighter weight than a operating system to deploy much easier maintain unless costly to maintain for your developers and those micro services are often delivered in a server less computing concept where I simply pay for the consumption its resources I don't need to pay for the infrastructure that other cloud providers taking on to provide me with those services I simply pay for the individual services themselves and all this is going into the new paradigm of developer operations or what we call DevOps a lot of enterprises are getting tuned to as you combine these you need to focus on the fluidity for which you can build applications it's very important to think about that process of the procedures that go in in place you can't just have the individual developer anymore or say like that analogy the individual blacksmith hammering up a software solutions I need to go through a process where I have the testing rigor I have the certification of security standards I have all the necessary things in place to ensure high quality digital software solutions are delivered so where are most enterprises today I would say most enterprises they are just about reaching here which is I think the equivalent of 1920's 1930's car manufacturing where you're defined to developer operations which is the manufacturing line I know the process for which I'm going to go through I have quality control I have different people in place to apply different components or different layering different areas of the software solution such as a testing such as individual components and combined together but it's still much a very human endeavor the people inside of this I equate as kind the business users who use the applications who are following a process we set in place inside the IT environment but then we need to ask ourselves well if most organizations are here or almost here saying up that developer operation line where do they need to be in the next five years which is the current future when we think about this it's all about robotics artificial intelligence applying more intelligence to the automation systems getting the humans out of the way so you're reducing errors maximize efficiency and building a digital solution which is a composite of multiple suppliers they can bring the market very quickly maybe this is a little complex but I think it's really appropriate analogy of looking at where we're managing developer operations and building software solutions so where the technologies were thinking about on the digital horizon that we need to explore more fully such as robotic process automation how do I automate things in complete robotic manner in order to have things all those individual components that I'm working with like in typical enterprise I now have sensors and devices all over the place how am i leveraging the information to make more intelligent decisions and then how am I auditing those decisions and tools like AI and machine learning or digital process automation environments so what we're going to talk about for the next 10 20 minutes here is exploring kind of each one of these technologies Mark Foley of how we leverage these in a modern digital business application to meet the current enterprise's needs so let's talk about a little bit a pian this is really what a pian is all about is trying to satisfy again the modern needs of enterprise developers making sure the maximum efficiency is spent on the development of new and of aged solutions and not the maintenance of those old solutions at a high level the appian platform is about digital transformation of enterprise environments we make it easy to for you to build and run enterprise grade software how do we do that of course first by cloud offerings you know the appian products primarily available in the cloud removing all the burden from yourself from managing the infrastructure tuning infrastructure to meet the ideal kind of performance ease that you need but as well the development environment itself is designed for a low code application development concept what this allows you to do is produce applications faster faster through user interfaces for drag-and-drop composition it also because it allows for that nice fluid development it also allows for agile development with your business users because as I draw a picture the users can actually very quickly see what you intend to design inside the product so no longer need to say take the specifications inside a Microsoft Word document then translate those specs over to Java code and then make sure the Java code accurately meets the specs and then show the results back to the business users that whole process is very slow waking down do now inside these drag-and-drop tools like a peon is visually compose those in a chat session a joint application development session with your business users and the business users can now intuitively understand what is being built they can't really understand Java or.net code but they can't understand pictures and the composition environment for building application is all picture based and finally it's all about allowing your organization to be more innovative to generate more solutions faster satisfy the demand of business users and ultimately saw the 80/20 problem were the spend of IT resources your organization is focused on innovation and only 20% is on maintenance the actual management of the infrastructure or the security systems so moving those resources where you're gonna make a much larger impact to your business community and moving away from the areas where your business users didn't really care about the ongoing maintenance of the infrastructure so think about this a little bit more where do you apply solutions like the appium product first of course is in building brand new applications such as a onboarding apps for customer journey management such as meaning specifical legal requirements or regulation policies it's a great way to look at applying a software solution like the appium product second of course is looking at extending new functionality or extinct systems with new functionality so this might include like systems that are primarily systems a record like just database systems maybe you have a system of record which has all your invoices well invoices yes their data but there are also processes you know I receive invoices or I send invoices I approve those invoices I schedule them for payment in my financial system I then review those in my ledger I account for those later on there is a process that often flows with that data that often existing systems lack a system like a penalizes they seamlessly overlay process capabilities on top of those technologies so you can extend their capabilities through process or maybe another way is through mobile interfaces maybe you have a legacy system that's not mobile ready we can also build mobile UI so seamlessly wrap your back-end systems or possibly maybe you have a hard-coded Java or.net application that you want to extend with maybe more intelligent or easily managed business rules you can also use happiness a headless rules engine or a business rules engine to drive logic and third-party applications as well and then finally many of customers that we've seen have built applications in silos especially around something like a customer journey where I am gonna maybe onboard a customer I have my leads and opportunities and convert them into named accounts as I bring them on to as a customer sign them up then as I bring them on inside my Sales System I need to then transfer that to my support environment to handle service requests then after the service request environment well I also want to maybe cross-sell and upsell that customer so I want to get them into my marketing database and what we find is all these different point systems that touch the customer we're often developed in silos that don't initially communicate with each other this not only creates slow in efficiencies in your business operations but also it creates a disjointed customer experience where the customer is not really knowing what to expect next you know there's not a fluid pass off between environments many times you can use platforms like the a beam application to stitch those together into a more seamless customer journey uniting existing legacy systems or filling in the gaps with new ampion applications to build that complete customer journey experience so oftentimes we find adoption across customer journey business operations and GRC all great areas to think about applying products that are gonna transform your enterprise business well let's talk about in more detail some specific topics here specifically a piñar PA with blue prism this is a robotic process automation offering so a piñar PA with blue prism does exactly this it's a low code design experience that we see on the right hand side which allows you to automate repetitive tasks inside the environment so if I were to kick back when I think about robotic process automation what exactly is that so it's robotic think about what is a robot do let's go back to that screenshots or the image of that factory so we want to build something like this where I always using humans before to do maybe very manual repetitive tasks those manual repetitive tasks aren't really well-suited for humans because first humans are more innovative you're not properly leveraging their innovation capabilities as well they're not very good at making these robotic actions without mistakes robots are much better at bats so our PA tools come into place which allow you to script a basically robotic operation across computer system so looking at this design experience on the right hand side you simply design that list script through a loco design experience exactly what I'm going to do next I'm gonna get messages I'm gonna set the messages when they loop back to start add some do a cue I'm gonna process all the emails and then continue on to the next one so it's gonna go through this robotic process - maybe process inbound emails and then put them into a system so it's very repetitive maybe there's simple logic inside of here but something that's gonna be very well-suited for a robotic activity now as an example let's take a look at something more directly so let's say how you have a use case where every single day I get a spreadsheet of information in all this information side of spreadsheet I have someone looking at the information copying and pasting it and putting it inside a legacy mainframe environment now a lot of people have positions like this where I have a very repetitive tasks taking information simple logic pasting it into an overall legacy system perfect opportunity for a banach automation of their systems as well why would you want to do this because the system's I want to integrate to have very poor or possibly no api's for example Microsoft Excel I could certainly parse but sometimes in Microsoft Excel through that robotic process I need to maybe use a pivot table apply a filter or some simple logic to find the specific row of information I want to capture that's more difficulty done through an API access to the content and then on top of that I need to move it into a legacy system may be an old COBOL based system that has a very poor API and I can't really develop the API quickly but I need to solve my problem right now so again through our PA capabilities we can create that automation - copy pay information pace into the target some very quickly overcome that through a robotic action now once we have those RPA tasks defined I can then leverage it inside an overall process flow so they define say start process step one step two step three and then I step four here instead of assigning that to a human based worker to process something I'm gonna just recite to a robot and I can also manage that digital robotic workforce so I can see exactly what they're working on how effective my digital workforce is and how they're adapting to maybe exceptions inside the environment now all that information comes forward and say management consoles where now I can monitor the robotic workforce I can see exactly what jobs are running exactly what type of work they're working on so I can see change of address was 22.3% of time fun switch was 6.1% of time beneficiary update was 13% invoicing updates were one point four five percent and customer search was nineteen point eight percent so just like a human as I program my robots to do different routines I can also have them adapt to say the process behavior I can send a task to one of my robots and they can just say well one task might be to change an address another task might be to do a fun switch it's all relatively scripted but that person can or that digital robot can do that in an automated activity now if there is ever an exception we can also monitor the exceptions from the board here so I can see for my jobs - that one of my items on a change address there has an exception associated with it I can click and drill into that make a human can actually get involved to actually rectify that exception and then also track the results of the overall work force output now all these technologies are kind of leading into a higher-level digital process automation where we see a merging of things like robotic process automation low code business process management case management coming into a new market segment for enterprise upon to monitor which is digital process automation DPA is really kind of an evolution of the business process management sector primarily imbued with low code and case manager abilities and what this means for digital cross automation is the idea that we're expanding beyond using process and process development tools as simply automating humans but rather using these to automate that kind of overall modern enterprise which is the automation of micro services the automation of AI services automation of robotic process automation environments IOT environments and big data systems as some examples of what you might bring into an overall digital process automation suite now DPA tools include things like function libraries decisions such as business rules processes these are interface all kind of managed to integration hub to then connect to these three services but before we talk about more let's actually take a look at some of this in action so as we transition over to the appian application environments I'm gonna log in to an app in free trial system so if you'd like to try out a bean for yourself encourage you check out Appy comm you'll find in our pricing page and other types of areas a registration link for a free trial you'll get this exact same system that I'm gonna be working in right now as well now it's like kick into this system you're gonna set there's a few sample applications already ability I'm going to refer to these during the application demonstration to basically highlight some of the use cases that can be supported but we're also going to take a look at the design time experience how we actually build these systems so for example let's go into the order management module here it's one of the sample applications this order management module shows how we can build kind of a new UI very quickly through dragga drop interface tools to manage say all inbound orders for a company selling office equipment so here I can see a record of all the orders inside the enterprise I can go ahead and kick off new orders inside the system maybe browse the product catalog as well to see individual products use artificial intelligence and machine learning to continuously analyze the best cross-sell upsell products for them so customers to purchase that might will also like these other end products as well analyze the overall product ordering so reporting dashboard and what's going on inside the overall system well this of course is an application entirely built on the appian platform that suddenly built a napkin but also composite of many different services so let's go over to the design time experience to kind of break this one apart and see some of those core design tools so from order management let's go straight to the full application designer in the full application designer we can see right away I have a number of applications deployed each one these come in its own environment now to go into the appian sample application environment here I can see all the individual design elements involved here so exceed process models want to filter by interfaces I can very quickly filter by their design object types here so I might want to build UI so I might want to build business rules or what we call decisions inside system or maybe I need to define integrations to connected environments or maybe to a specific interfaces or across model as well so let's kick into and as an example one of these drag-and-drop design tools that the appium cross smaller well go ahead and say let's create a new process model [Music] call the sample application and as I kick into this you'll see that the full design experience for the app game product is all through a web browser as well works with Google Chrome Safari Internet Explorer or Firefox and all this is based for a lot of power for developer to build complex applications but all through an easy medium of drag-and-drop capabilities so right away on the very first area I see is as large candidates which allows me to find the orchestration for a business process the canvas itself follows standard notation things like bpm in notation are going to find things like swim lanes no ownership of individual activities left-hand side of course allows me to see individual activities you might want to orchestrate so I might want to have a human take on a step at a certain point in the process I can just go ahead and drag a user input task and I'll have that say I'm just gonna call a human step just like this wanted to find the ownership that human step I could either define it directly on the activity itself or just go right up to the lane as well which can drive ownership of all the activities inside that individual lane let's go ahead and say choose Maria Lopez and now I see Maria's picture right there and go ahead call that activities for Maria so nice visual composition you can imagine as a developer working with a business user it's really easy for me now to communicate exactly what's going on so I'm application logic I might need a decision point these are called gateway so if we need to make a decision of where to route next I simply drag-and-drop a decision gateway just like this I can have a flow made me continue on go to the end node or I can go down to my other smart services so maybe I need to incorporate another process as a sub process so I can easily include that as a sub process there have a script task or maybe have some message events or where the real power comes and we think about the modern application development we're having much more diversified application its base of composed of different services we call these ABI and smart services down below and I see this large library smart services some of these are baked into the system itself such as maybe XQ reports sing an email to someone so I can tap into an email server just like this or maybe I need to generates a documents so maybe I want to tap into some Adobe PDF api's and after I send an email to someone either need to PDF some contents and then it would make more sense if I did the PDF ink first maybe send that inside the email attachment but I can see how I can leverage each one of these services individually the former composite application now some of these service I mentioned are baked inside the product such as the document management all included inside a peon I didn t manage capabilities as well processor rules management as well but here and then I have also integration services and although like Amazon iOS service or Amazon AWS services so at some point in the process I need to maybe have an orchestration of the internet of thing so I can come in right here I think maybe to register a new internet thing device and after I registered that new internet of thing device maybe after some time I can say go up to my events maybe wait 30 days just like this and then after that I'm gonna go ahead and update my internet thing later so starting to leverage services from third-party organizations becomes very easy and intuitive I simply see the icons there on my left hand side different services available to me now I've read a certain this example a number of AWS services so I also have access to ec2 instances I also have access to s3 so I thought I need to update content or load content to an s3 system that's easily done as well right here so I can orchestrate all these actions in a single design-time experience down below as well you also have access to micro services so if I want to call a Tobias Lander services I can go ahead and deploy new micro services by deploying your land of functions AWS lambda is a fantastic micro services architecture that can develop individual services and then use those services again in the composite of the overall application managing that flow defined the overall process flow just like this so and then finally if I need to at some point to find a robotic process automation step inside the system again very easily done simply invoking that RTA step just like this and now I can say invoke an automated activity that's gonna require human invocation if I do that top lane down below be a system one and configuring it simple point-and-click configurations so how do I want to call it what's the operational on perform any parameters you need to pass as well so to explore this a little bit more further as I click on each one of these individual steps you'll notice that each one of these has a simple configuration screen there's no coding inside of here if I need to map data parameters one element to another I can very quickly take the find a data parameter like new inputs and those inputs can be defined off existing data structures so maybe I have an input which is based off of say a specific customer or a new order inside of here so actually I think I have an order filled now I have an order datatype here which was discovered from a relational database it said well I already know anyone work with this other data source so let's go ahead and just give all that data structure to the designer to have them easily work inside the system so now I can see exactly my order structure exactly the customer information the order items that they want inside of here which are related products all that data is now available to me to now work inside of and very quickly I can then transition to maybe building the form as well so that since this is a user base activity go ahead and create that interface just go ahead and call it order form hit OK and define the folder as well and I can go ahead and say edit an interface right here and again I get into that easy intuitive loco design experience let's go ahead and just load up one of my example forms as an example here here I find purchase request sample form and if I want to start modifying this I can go ahead and just individually click on the fields and have coin click configurations to map all this into now of course if I also want to leverage services from third-party systems like Microsoft Li from the interface design experience as well to imagine what a digital process automation platform is it's designed to allow you to build applications very rapidly that orchestrate all these services from third-party systems into a single holistic application so if it's see all this put together let's now process an order so here and I've configured an end-user experience I want to say some in a new order inside of here so I built this interface form inside the appian interface designer if I want to add an item I have a product search capability now that's actually looking up services from Amazon actually I think this one I specially coded to Best Buy so if you happen to have the Best Buy catalog I can go ahead and type the word phone it's searching the Best Buy catalog right now finding a specific phone for me and then hit next and then move on through that whole process so I can say okay I want to select a customer which is now this is searching my internal customer database which could be coming from a Salesforce or some other third party system combine these together Best Buy product catalog Salesforce possibly CRM system on my customer library bring for all the information submit the order and now the process submitted just like this so again building composites of multiple applications into a single interface flow very quickly inside the overall experience then once that order is submitted of course I can track exactly what's going on inside the order so here I can see that order that was just submitted John Liang is the purchaser this is the one I just kicked off I can then see also any tasks have been outstanding so I can see there's a prepare order cast going through that flow if I click on that prepare order task I can then actually accept it and then move this on through the whole process I'm gonna get this ready to ship and go ahead and hit submit that's ready to go so this is how you would build kind of these composite applications using this modern development techniques loco platform so the kind of micro services architectures that I'm calling into the overall design flows but as I said there's a lot more to explore if you'd like to check this application out yourself encourage you go to apnoea comm register free trial you'll get to this exact same environment I'm pointing to you right now and to kick off if you want to spill something from scratch happiness and design time experience if you click on this get started button right here you will actually launch you straight to the quick apps design experience which will take you through a simplified wizard for building an application less than five minutes it's going to prompt you for what information is important for you who you want to share it with and automatically build all the contracts for you for a fully functional application inside the app in experience so with that let's close up and summarize a little bit what we talked about a pians all about as I mentioned before speed of success agile developments this is probably the most important quote for us from all the rings we've had from Gartner and Forrester that a theme projects are agile time to solutions a fast among all vendors this is what we really measure the success of all of our customer deployments on is how quickly have they moved from an idea the business user had to a solution that they actually got to market that's the entire goal the appium product to make sure it's a seamless if experience as possible to go from idea to action into deployments but also leveraging the modern technologies that you expect from leveraging micro services from third party systems robotic process automation services to tap into legacy environments to automate robotic activities so if you'd like to learn more and encouraged you can either contact me directly at Malcolm dot Ross at a peon comm or course learn more at WWE more about the appium product platform and I'll turn it back to Vance thanks for the time Malcolm really great session and I love how that you connected the dots here between the need for quick and easy and fast and innovative apps and architecture it's really an important convergence of things that I think is going to really dictate the next wave as you said and you really described it very well and the demo really brought it home thanks very much no problem my pleasure man it's always great to meet all of your presentations you know let's start off with a question I got the two or three here and I'm going to kind of combine them because this closing thought you had about idea to app or idea to action I think really is one of the drivers of this whole summit that we're having on application architecture and here's kind of a question I think that a lot of people wrestle with and it goes like this I've seen several low code type of app platforms that can speed up how IT or even non-technical users can deliver tactical or longtail app requests but we're also looking to explore technologies that help us build the big disruptive apps like uber and Netflix can the appian platform help us do both yeah it's actually one of the primary focuses for a being is focusing on those enterprise applications so a paean has taken on some major projects like we power a lot of back as for the Affordable Care Act major programs to the government as well as major programs worth in organizations and retail financial services manufacturing typically what we find is that the applications that you wanted to find inside a locota application are really no different from any other application one build in a traditional code environment their customers come to us with the same expectations of UI flexibility of logic capabilities of being able to find complex business logic inside the system complex process flows the idea though the applicant application is that you can represent all these elements in a simple intuitive design even if it is very complex you can still approach it by using standard ways of noting it in a intuitive UI for process flow logic it's why we focus on very popular industry standards like the business process modeling notation BPMN for modeling crossings bpmn was a am G standard I was specially designed for building complex process diagrams to support enterprise needs but in a visual way that helps break down those barriers communicating the business and same thing with emn decision modeling notation which is what underpins our design concepts for the business rules engine of a visual way of laying a decision table logic that's easy again for business users to understand but powerful enough to support your enterprise needs fantastic content asking you know another component of that whole platform that struck me is you were going through the demo and some of the architecture was your support for microcircuit apps require us to learn how to use micro services or at a minimum use api's tell us a bit more about how happy and approaches those especially given some of the interfaces can change over time yeah this is the biggest challenge of micro services today is there's a lot of potential but it's really they remain locked in the world of developers because typically to leverage a micro service you need to be a developer who knows how to programmatically call these through restful endpoints or soap based Web Services we're using some old latest standards like Ramo and swagger and what a peon does is to things inside of this front so we allow for developers create what we call plugins so plugins make it easy for a developer to create an extension or an integration to a specific micro service or third-party system then expose it to business users as a simple drag-and-drop construct so for example I might have a specific integration to a back-end system with some complex data that's required or maybe some data mapping that needs to occur I can use Eclipse such as a job Eclipse environment to build that plugin and then deploy to the appian system and then it shows up inside the appian designer as a simple drag-and-drop item another investment app needs to be making inside of here is a low code integration design experience for modern web services so fortunately the common theme for micro services is that these are exposed as I mentioned before in Web Services what a peon does when we point to see a restful endpoint we can automatically discover things like information that's going to potentially pass we can invoke it parse the XML parse the JSON that we get back and try to interpret that in a way that makes sense to a less technical user it's giving them a simple point click configuration from building a new integration to the ampion system and the impression I got to Malcolm just to kind of put a cherry on top of this conversation is that this is going to be an ongoing library or at least service registry of Micra services or other api's that you will call as these third parties come up with cooler services that people can use and that you're committing a platform to keep those interfaces up-to-date absolutely yeah that's part of it is to focus a lot on the most common microservices platforms that our customers are using such as those from Microsoft Azure AWS Google as well as a lot of the other supporting ones from smaller vendors and make sure that you can easily leverage those technologies inside the overall design time experience of a paean so you're building these composite applications which are leveraging functions and services from third parties to form the overall app that you want when I define a business rule which is the equivalent of like a point of logic and a peon right there inside the system I have unit testing so I don't need to actually go into a separate design experience I can build up all my test scenarios right there it's a version controlled with that rule so if I modify the rule I can also see all the latest versions of the unit tests that go with it it also it has automatically baked into it all the calls and Siri to do bulk unit testing so I can say well before I merge us to production I want to run all my unit tests across my entire application to make sure everything's working and then you have functional testing we can actually build process design scenarios that actually functionally test the application itself Malcolm this has been a terrific session before we let you leave you have to tell us how folks can go hands-on or take a trial or maybe get into a sandbox and take it for a test drive on their own yes I mentioned a peanut calm is the best place to start if you go right there you'll notice links to our free trial experience and you can get your hands on the affiant product right away but of course there's a lot to learn another great resource for us outside a pink comm is also community tapia calm which is our developer community environment there you'll find all of our product documentation free training videos and active discussions on development around the appian platform Malcolm Russell vice visitor product at appian thanks very much for a terrific session and especially for taking so many questions and walking us through a demo of what people can do in this modern era are trying to bring app development into the mechanized 21st century really great session no problem thanks dance thanks for the time
