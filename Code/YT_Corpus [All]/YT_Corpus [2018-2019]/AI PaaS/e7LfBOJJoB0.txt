 Hello! My name is Amy Sturkey. I'm a pediatric physical therapist. I have been working in Pediatrics for almost 30 years now. I'm here with my friend, Myla, who is my co-instructor. She specializes in treatment of children with low tone. She has Down syndrome and is about ten and a half months old. She's not thinking weight-bearing through her legs is such a grand plan. So, I'm just giving simple ideas to help let her think that weight bearing through her legs are okay. I do something I call foot pounding. So I just take their legs they go...boop a boop. Just to start getting that weight-bearing through her legs in a way that's not standing but a little bit safer down on the floor. You can hold here. You can go above the knees, so you get some weight through the knees too. boop-a boop-boop-boop boop boop boop. So it's just a simple idea to start working on weight-bearing through the legs when it might be a little bit more tolerable for someone who thinks it's no fun. Thanks a lot! And I'll see you later!
