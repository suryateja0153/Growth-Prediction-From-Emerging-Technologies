 A noisy heating and cooling system is distracting, lowers productivity, and can even be physically harmful. To engineer an active noise control device, we created more sound. Carbon nanotubes generate sound using heat. When installed inside an HVAC duct, the carbon nanotubes effectively create an opposite sound that cancels the ventilation noise created by movement. This new technology can reduce noise, improve productivity, and help in places like hospitals that also need clean tech. As mechanical engineers researching acoustics, a quiet room is music to our ears. Tomorrow needs engineers. Tomorrow needs Michigan Tech. Michigan Technological University
