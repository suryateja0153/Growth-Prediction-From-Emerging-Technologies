 The Ujet  electric scooter looks vaguely like your average scooter, but perhaps something else entirely. Ujet calls it a sculptural, asymmetrical design, and it's driven by distinctive equipment like the center-less orbital wheels, alloy-composite construction and full connectivity. Enjoy a little extra flash and tech while scootering your way around the city. The Ujet is just one in a long, ever-growing line of folding scooters designed for nimble urban mobility. But it's one that absolutely stands out from the pack. Ujet's description of a sculptural, asymmetrical frame is spot on, especially up front. The single-sided fork shows a twisted form and crisp edges that appear crafted for visual impact, more than traditional functionality. Similarly, the rear wheel is attached on just one side. The asymmetrical construction of the mixed magnesium and carbon fiber frame is helped along by the 14-in hubless wheels, which are really the heart and soul of the Ujet. It's here that you'll find the integrated suspension and large-diameter disc brakes. The rear wheel houses the 5.4-hp 65 lb-ft motor that keeps the scooter rolling forward for up to 93 miles (150 km) per charge and provides regenerative braking. The frame construction, powertrain and removable battery are just the start of the Ujet's impressive technology suite. Its 7-in fold-up dash computer keeps connected via GPS, 3G, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and offers voice and touch control. A series of conveniently mounted buttons provide easy-access hard control, when the rider is gripping the handlebars, while a smartphone app offers remote monitoring, tracking and control. The Ujet scooter looks like a rigid frame, but it's actually a folder, compacting down in three simple steps. At 95 lb (43 kg) with the small battery and 108 lb (49 kg) with the large one, you probably won't want to lug it around on your shoulder too far, but its wheels line up side-by-side for easy rolling.
