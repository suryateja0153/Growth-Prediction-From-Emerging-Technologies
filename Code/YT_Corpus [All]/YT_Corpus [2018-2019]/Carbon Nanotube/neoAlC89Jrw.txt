 Carbon nanotubes are amazing materials. They have electrical conductivity competitive with copper. They have mechanical properties ten times the strength of steel at one-sixth the weight. They have thermal properties that are competitive with diamonds. We are able to use electrochemistry to pull apart carbon dioxide and we can literally just stitch together those carbon atoms into new forms of matter that's very valuable. These could potentially revolutionize the world that we live in, in addition to being very valuable for any technology you can imagine. This science that we've developed and the ability to produce this material cost efficiently is a really exciting step forward.
