 In this paper we work with a very interesting material, silk based materials These are natural fibers that humans have been using for thousands of years because of their unique properties their unique luster and lightweight and pleasant feel. It's been used for textiles for a long time but there's a lot more to silk fibers than their use for textiles. More recently we started to recognize the unique bio-compatibility and bio-degradable properties of these materials and that opened the door for many biomedical applications but the issue is that if we want to use the silk materials for biomedical applications we don't want it to be in the form of fibers but rather in the forms of films that exhibit interesting optical, mechanical and electrical properties so in this paper we work on developing regenerated silk fibroin films which are optically transparent mechanically flexible based on processing of these natural fibers along with carbon nanotubes where we leverage the interactions between the carbon nanotubes and the silk fibroins combined with microwave heating and solvent annealing in order to tune their properties Silk fibroin is mainly composed of kind of two kinds of amino acid: glycine, alanine up to 75% and the high content of these two amino acids results in a highly conserved protein sequence such as glycine, alanine, glycine, alanine like this and this conserved protein sequence prefers to form a beta sheet structure by hydrogen bonding between the protein molecules and this beta sheet structure leads to the exceptional mechanical properties of natural silke fibers. However during the regeneration process the beta sheet structure turns into the amorphous stage so it is very important to control the secondary structure of the regenerated silk fibroin such as alpha helix or beta sheet structures inorder to control the properties of regenerated silk fibroin. After the silk regeneration process the resulting films are amorphous and highly transparent in water this is why we need post-processing methods to induce the formation of secondary structures such as alpha helix and beta sheets which usually exhibit better mechanical and degradation properties. These methods include exposing the silk fibroin to solvents in vapor or liquid form which induce the secondary structures in a process known as solvent annealing, alternatively we can use heating to induce the secondary structures in a process known as thermal annealing. We can also use additives such as glycerol which has been shown to induce alpha rich structures in the silk matrix. We add surface functionalized Carbon Nanotubes to the silk fibroin matrix during the regeneration process and after preparation of the composite film we use microwave heating irradiation for the local heating of silk molecules nearby CNTs using the differences in electric conductivity between the CNT and the silk fibroin. And we confirm that the local heating of silk molecules leads to local crystallization so we further investigated the effect of local crystallization on the mechanical properties of regenerated silk composite films. Our films exhibited enhanced water degradation and tunable mechanical properties. The film's also exhibited enhanced mechanical properties like 90% increase in mechanical strength and and an 80% increase in elongation owing to the synergetic CNT reinforcement effects and the ductile properties of the alpha helix rich structure. The mechanical and optical properties of our films are comparable to synthetic polymers such as PET with the added advantage of better sustainability and bio-compatibility as well. Our work enables a high degree of tunability of the structural properties of the regenerated silk fibroin films and we're excited about taking this further in the future and developing both  the science and technology aspects of creating these functional materials so there is from a scientific perspective there is a lot more to do in order to understand the interactions between the nanotubes, the functionalisation of the nanotubes surfaces with the protein molecules and from a technological perspective or an engineering perspective we want to develop the process the manufacturing process for taking these cocoons of natural silk fibers and transform them into a functional thin transparent and flexible materials that are useful for many application such as flexible electronics including sensors and memory devices you
