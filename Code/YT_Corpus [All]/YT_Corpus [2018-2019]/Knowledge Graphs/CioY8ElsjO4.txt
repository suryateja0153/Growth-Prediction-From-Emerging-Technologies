  Hello students, today I'm here with a new topic 'Curve Tracing' Earlier, I have put on many videos like matrices, the rank of a matrix, eigen matrix, eigen value Cayley hamilton theorem, and consistency and inconsistency and then on partial differential, I uploaded lagrange's method, charpit method, standard forms and also differential equation-based topics like first-order first degree and second-order differential equation, Fourier transform, Fourier series if you have any of these in your curriculum, you can watch my videos by tapping on the i-icon or the notification Today we will discuss curve tracing which is a very important part as it is a part of the differential calculus and here in the upcoming concepts of finding the volume of a curve, surface area or revolution of the curve or area of the curve with the help of integration so you should know the concept of curve tracing as to have an idea of the curve Without it, we can not determine any of the above things for it It is also useful for a future topic i.e. change of order of integration So students, today I'll teach you How to trace a curve There are 3-4 very important concepts in curve tracing The first concept is 'Symmetry'   It is of two types- about x-axis and y-axis or about a line For example, you have a parabola in front of you  Students usually get confused Which parabola is what Now I'll tell you all about it in curve tracing whose power is even  If in any curve, the power of 'y' is even then it is symmetric about the x-axis   If in any curve, the power of 'x' is even then it is symmetric about the y-axis   The next concept is 'Origin' Let me tell you one more thing for a given circle 'x' and 'y', both have an even power When both the powers are even, then curve is symmetric about both axis  This circle is symmetric about both the axis- 'x-axis' as well as 'y-axis' i.e. it divides the circle into two equals when seen from the respective axis  The next concept is 'Origin' A curve passes through the origin If on putting x=0 and y=0 in any curve's equation the equation gives '0' putting x and y as 0 in this equation gives 0 i.e. it is passing through the origin but here equation does not give 0 hence this curve i.e. circle does not pass through the origin So if any curve passes through the origin then its equation should become '0' when we put x=0 and y=0  The next concept is tangent at origin It means If any curves passes through the origin it's tangent exist there Just like it is passing through an origin then it has a tangent Just like that it also has a tangent But because this doesn't pass through an origin it's tangent at origin doesn't exist  While tracing the curve we have to check whether it passes the origin or not   Now we'll see how to calculate tangent at origin. So students if in any curve when we place a least degree term as zero it results in its tangent at origin. Now this is the curve with X and Y terms the least power is of x because x is of 1 degree. so the one with least degree  So this curve's tangent at origin will be y-axis  So the y-axis is the tangent Which touches the curve at the origin. Similarly in this curve The least degree term is y   So this curve's tangent at origin will be x-axis This will be the third point. The next point will be intersection with coordinate axis.  It means that Where does this curve cuts the the x-axis and the y-axis.  To know where is this curve cutting x-axis  Then we put y=0 because at x-axis y coordinate is always zero. So by putting one coordinate's value we can calculate other     Similarly if you want to where is it touching y-axis  so we'll keep x equals to zero   This is how we check where is the curve touching each axis.    We'll here check whether the curve is open or closed curve     now comes the Reason of Existence  This is a circle, right, and this is an equation, this is curve is here only. Here you have to check the existence of the curve That this circle is formed within this area only and there is no other existence of this curve So here we will discuss 5-6 points First is Symmetry, to know if the curve is symmetric to x-axis or y-axis Second is origin Third is whether the curve is tangent at origin or not  Tangent is origin is calculated by putting least degree term as zero. Then we check intersection with coordinate axis to know where the curve touches the respective axis      The next concept is of Reason of Existence our curve is traced with these five points and with the help of 3-4 questions I'll explain you this concept. In this video I'll tell you how to trace Cartesian curve   Here we'll take our first question.  the first step will be to see the symmetry In this question we have x and y both the variable The power of y is even and the power of x is odd and because then power of y is even so it will be symmetric to x axis     you can also write it as   next we'll take origin      third point will be tangent at origin  tangent at origin means , if a curve passes through origin then its tangent exists , but because here the curve doesn't passes through the origin so we'll write   now we check the forth point that is intersection with coordinate axis. we want to see, where does this curve touches the x-axis and where it touches y-axis I would also explain you the concept of curve trace this is x-axis and this is our y-axis till now we have studied that this curve is symmetric to x-axis because the power of y is even   now here we'll see where it touches the x-axis  so here we'll put y=o      Now I want to know where it touches y-axis so we'll put x=0 and you'll see the moment I write x=0  we can also write this curve as   when you x=0 the value of y becomes infinite it means this curve touches y axis at infinite And at the time of asymptote, I explained that when any curve touches any line at infinite then it is its asymptote  so here curve does not cut y-axis next we'll talk about asymptote here we will see how to calculate asymtote I told you before that normally a parallel asymtote exists here  so in this question if we multiply the euqation  the first thing we see is what is the highest power of x so the highest power of x here is 1 and its coefficient here is  If we solve it the result will be imagery which there is no existence of any asymptote   now we check what is the highest power of y so the highest power of y is 2 and its coefficient is x=0, then yes we get asymptote at x=0, so we will write, equating coefficient of highest power of y that is     that means y axis itself is parallel asymptote to its axis. it means this y axis is a parallel asymptote about its axis. at last we will check reason of existence so this is an asymptote curve cuts at x axis, so obviously the curve that cuts  will go like this because it touches y axis at infinite point and the way it is above will be the same at bottom so the curve will be like this now there could be many questions arising in your mind about the curve like is it necessary that it goes here only why not the other side then, the curve always goes in the direction of the asymptote where curve touches asymptote is important. finally we will see Reason of existence now we want to see that this curve exists within this boundary only and not anywhere so what you have to do is you'll write the question in a way like    so what we will do here is, we will put the value here           Here I discussed five points with you first symmetry, then origin,  tangent to origin then intersection at cordinate axis then asymptote and reason of existence we'll take 1-2 more questions Next we will see one more question here, which is  here power of x is odd and y is even so the first concept will remain same that is   now if we put the value of x and y zero then this complete equation becomes zero that is curve passes through the origin  Next if this curves passes through the origin then its tangent at origin exists   to calculate the value of a curve's tangent at origin then put its least degree term as zero       so here the tangent at origin will be x-axis I'll also show you the curve what we know till now is, the curve as much is one one is same is on other side plus its tangent at origin is x axis  now we'll see intersection with coordinate axis  in this we will first put y=0 in doing so the complete bracket will turn zero and you get the value of x=0 curve passes through curve cut x-axis at       now calculate asymptote.                     Now lets talk about, reason of existence        Now this video has already got extended a lot so I'll cover rest of the questions in my next video  So students if you like my videos then please subscribe my channel and please click on i-icon to get the notification of all new video update  also share the videos with your friends as well.
