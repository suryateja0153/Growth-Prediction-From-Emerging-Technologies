 welcome to create graphs and equations of higher degree polynomials the best way to use this video is to take notes while I'm teaching pausing whenever you need to get the notes down and every time we arrive at a you try pause the problem attempt it and then press play to see the solution and the work these are the topics we'll cover in this section higher degree polynomials have the following form they can look like factored form or general form we're going to be sketching graphs given factored form of functions at this point you need to be familiar with a higher degree polynomial characteristics so if you haven't watched that video yet please go back and watch that video we're going to sketch the graph here so how we're going to do this is we're gonna use the zeros and the behavior at the zeros as well so we're going to use the zeros and we're gonna use the end behavior to help us graph this function so we've got our zeros we've got x equals 0 we've got x equals negative 1 x equals 1 and x equals 5 we're gonna talk about what happens at the 0 so that's got a degree of 1 so that's odd so it's gonna cross this has a degree of 2 which is even so it's gonna bounce this has a degree of 4 so it's gonna bounce and this has a multiplicity of 3 which is going to make it cross if you aren't sure how I got those answers go back to higher degree polynomial characteristics videos for a recap and then now we know what happens at each 0 let's talk about the end behavior so we need to find the degree of this function so the degree is going to be 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 3 so the degree is 10 and the leading coefficient here is positive so we know that the end behavior is going to look like this all right so here's what we're going to do next we're going to label the end behavior and we're going to label our zeros so we've got a 0 here we've got a 0 here and a 0 here and a 0 there and we're also gonna label what's happening at those zeros so at negative 1 it's going to bounce at 0 it's going to craw and at one it's gonna bounce and at five it's gonna cross all right so where do we start we start here so we're gonna start here we're gonna go to our first zero and we're gonna bounce it now I don't know how high it's gonna get but I do know that it's gonna need to come back down to cross through this zero and I don't know how low this is gonna get but I know it's got to come back up to balance here and I know this one's got a cross so that it can get back to its end behavior and it's gonna look something like that let's take a look at what actually happened when I graphed it in desmos pretty close but not perfect we'll try another one together sketch the graph so we need our zeros and our end behavior so we'll start with our zeros we've got x equals negative 4 and x equals 2 the multiplicity here is odd so it's going to cross the multiplicity here is even so it's going to bounce and the degree of this function is 3 plus 2 so it's 5 it's odd and the leading coefficient is positive so we know that it's going to look like this so I'll start with my end behavior and I'm going to graph my zeros I've got a negative 4 and a positive 2 and this is going to cross and this is going to bounce alright so starting with our end behavior here we're gonna come up we're gonna cross we're gonna come down we're gonna bounce and it might look something like that I graph this in desmos pretty similar and you are gonna try these two let's see how you did it might look something like that it's not going to match exactly right now we're going to talk about non real zeros complex zeros those imaginary zeros that come in pairs so the problem with trying to write an equation when we're given a graph is we have no idea how many imaginary zeros there are real zeroes because we can't see things that are imaginary so when we're determining equations from graphs we are not able to determine the exact degree it's just not possible because of those non real zeros we can get an idea from the number of real zeros and turning points remember it can have at most degree minus 1 turning points and we're also unable to determine the exact multiplicity of that zero we can only determine if it's even or odd how can we determine that because it bounces it even and it crosses at odd so it says to write an equation that might have the graph shown so we want to take a look at the end behavior to determine the degree and the leading coefficient and we also want to take a look at the number of turning points to figure out the maximum degree so we've got and behavior going up and up so we know it's gonna be an even degree leading coefficient positive let's take a look at the zeros I'm sorry the turning points we've got a turning point here so that's one there's a turning point up here somewhere that's 2 3 4 5 nope not that one undo that 1 4 5 there's gotta be one down there and so there are 5 turning points so what that means is the degree needs to be 6 or higher so we'll just keep that in mind alright so now we're going to go through and label our zeros so some of these are already labeled this guy gets labeled and so does this we're just gonna label if they're crossing or bouncing so that's a bounce that negative 1 that's a bounce at 0 that's cross and at 2 that's a cross and so we're gonna start to build this function out so whoa write f of x equals and we'll start with this first one so if the 0 is negative 3 the factor is gonna be +3 and if it's bouncing the multiplicity has to be even next we've got a 0 of negative 1 so the plus one and it's bouncing so it's got to be even multiplicity we've got a zero of zero so it's just gonna be X it's crossing so it's got to be odd and we've got a zero of 2 so it's X minus two it's crossing so that's odd now you can make these numbers in here any number you want even could be two four six we just need to make sure that the degree ends up being six are higher and then it's an even degree so we've got f of X equals now we normally put this one first so we're going to do X and maybe you want it to be to the third power so that guy's gone then we'll go and order X plus three even so maybe two x plus one even maybe four and last one X minus two is odd maybe three just do a quick check the degree here is gonna be three plus two plus four plus three so we've got five plus seven it's gonna be 12 it's even and it's greater than six so this is a possible function let's do one more write an equation that might have this graph so we see our end behavior here it's got to be even our leading coefficient needs to be positive because they're both going up and now let's check our turning points so we've got one definitely there's got to be one down there and then two somehow it's got to come back up right three so we've got three turning points so our degree needs to be four or bigger all right so now we're going to go through and label our zeros so we've got negative two that's a cross we've got zero that's a bounce and we've got four that's a cross so now we'll write a potential function so let's see we've got f of x equals x the zero is minus two so the factor is plus two cross means odd we've got a zero of zero so it's just X bounce means even we've got a zero four so the factors x my as for cross means odd and now we'll just go through and pick our numbers normally we put this guy first so f of X equals maybe X to the fourth now you know you're getting your degree 4 or higher X plus 2 maybe you leave it alone to the first power and then X minus 4 made me say to the third power just double-check your degree is 4 plus 1 plus 3 that's 8 it's even and it's bigger than 4 and that could be a potential function you're going to give these two a try and see how you did that concludes creating graphs and equations of higher degree polynomials
