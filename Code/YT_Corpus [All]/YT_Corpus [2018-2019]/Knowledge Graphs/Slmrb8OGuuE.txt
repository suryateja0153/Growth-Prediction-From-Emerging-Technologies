 welcome to moomoomath in science and climate graphs a climate graph is a graph in which temperature and precipitation are both represented on the same graph in these examples the temperature is on the left in Celsius and the precipitation is represented by a bar graph on the right in millimeters I'd like to take a look at a couple of the major biomes and see what their climber graphs look like up first is a desert this desert is pretty easy to recognize first the temperatures are either warm or hot and they don't fluctuate a lot during the year but mainly take a look at the rainfall there is very little or no rainfall throughout the year next is a grassland of North America first there's little rain in the winter and then a fair amount in the summer from the shape of the temperature graph you can see that they have four seasons they have cold winters and hot summers this next graph is a savanna and you can notice that the temperatures are steady between warm and hot and that they have a rainy and dry season next the rain force is very easy to figure out because notice that there is very little change in temperature and a tremendous amount of rainfall the deciduous force next it has a temperature graph that you can see that it has seasons the winters aren't frigid and bitter and the summers aren't super hot and you have rain feel fall all year compare this to a taiga and it's very similar to the deciduous forests but the winters are colder and the summers are not quite as hot and finally the tundra tundra is where we find the coldest temperatures it only warms up in the summer to ten or fifteen degrees Celsius most of the rain is in the summer but it's pretty steady so there we go some climate graphs of the major biomes thanks for watching and moomoomath uploads a new math and science video every day please subscribe and share
