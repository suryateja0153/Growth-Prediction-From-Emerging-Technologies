 All right, so let's think about doing a frequency analysis here, we have the variable view for the data set I'm using the ESS 1986 data set and looking at variable view because in variable view because see not only the names of our variables But also labels and the measures and so I would want us to do some frequency analysis Using a nominal ordinal scale, so I'm gonna pick race So again if we go back into our data set we'll see that we have actually tons of Columns here, but that's okay. I'm gonna go into analyze descriptive statistics and frequencies So we do a frequency analysis by looking at analyze descriptive statistics and frequencies We entered the frequencies dialog box. We know we be made it before where our Variables are upper ties and show the names and not the labels we're gonna look for the variable race So we go and we find race Yeah somewhere there we go, and we send race over to the right-hand column Now to display frequency tables we have to make sure that the display frequency tables box is selected So right now. Let's look at the only frequency table make sure that this box is selected Oh, so you won't get a frequency table and then do ok your responses pop up into the output window and As you see we get two pieces to our output one piece is our statistics box In the stats box we see that we have one thousand four hundred and seventy valid responses and no missing Responses and now down here the second box That says race of respondent is our actual frequency distribution table On in our first color we have the breakdown of our of our categories. We have white black and other the frequency variable tells you how many occur and category so for this data set we have 1249 we people responding as white 184 people responding as black 37 responding as others so we have a total number of individuals in our data set of 1470 The difference between percent and valid percent is that sometimes we have missing data If we have missing data, and the percent column will include the missing data in that value in that calculation Well as valid percent ignores the missing data. We don't have any missing data here right now, so that's not a concern but You know again if you have missing data. If you enter something wrong if we don't want to include Calculation for missing data, then you look at valid percent and in looking at this category We'll see that we have 85 percent of our respondents are white 12 and a half percent of black two and a half percent or other and the costi percent column must sum to 100 If we had missing data, then in the percent column You'll see missing and it will tell you the percent of missing data And what percent that day that made up of the of the dis of the data set? But we don't worry about that for now and our cumulative percent is our QM percentage But notice that an SPSS it accumulates downward It says see that we have 85 percent in a white only in white and in black we have only seven and a half percent and in white block and other we have accumulated 100 percent about that of our distribution so it accumulates going downward Our textbook unlike most other textbooks accumulate going upwards so you have to be aware of how SPSS presents data differently So this is our our frequency distribution table Now we also talked about how we could present our frequency distributions in graphs, so let's do a graph Let's go back to analyze descriptive statistics Ease and this is only one way that we can use to do graphs Now if we do this let's deselect play Frequency tables good, we don't want any frequency tables But when we do that we get this message from SPSS saying that you've turned off all output So if we don't pick something else to go do it won't give us any output For this purpose. We'll make a chart and We have frequency charts. We have a choice between bar pie and histograms So let's do a bar chart, and we'll do a part right eating frequencies But you can also select a bar chart doing percentages, but for now we'll pick a bar chart doing frequencies We'll hit continue We do okay, and then you see the frequencies comes up We have our descriptive stats box always pops up and now here we have the bar chart showing the number the frequency for the white versus the frequency for the black versus the frequency for other We can also Get this at the pipe as a pie chart, so We go back to charts and this time we pick pie and hit continue and let's try let's do the pie with percentages hit continue hit OK and Now we have the different slices of the pie we have a slice for the white in blue for black and green and for other in like this olive color did you see how we use frequency is to give us a frequency distribution table and a frequency distribution bar graph in the next video We'll talk about other things that we can use frequencies for thanks
