 [Music] [Music] now as we are talking about graphs let's use these graphs to also understand constant returns to scale increasing return to scale and decreasing returns to scale here we have again we are drawing ISO quant on y-axis we have K and on x-axis we have L and here we have one ISO part fine and let's say we take this particular or let me say let me take another we are taking this particular combination of L naught labor and capital now if we double the amount of labor means let's say roughly we are here and we double the amount of capital we are here so what we will get we will have another iso quant passing through this point and if it is constant returns to scale what we are going to get this is Q naught then we are going to get here as to Q naught and if it is increasing returns to scale then what we will get greater than to Q naught and if it is decreasing returns to scale then it will be less than to Q naught so in other word if we can say this that when we have constant returns to scale and we are drawing ISO quant with the equal you know the equal difference is like 10 20 30 40 okay if this is case again the pictures are not that nice but if this is the case for let's say constant returns to scale what we will get in the increasing return to scale that I stroke want will be come nearer for the same value 10 20 30 40 they will be come nearer and nearer why because if we double all the inputs then output will more than double and what we are saying that here we are saying that we are taking isoquant for quantity 10 then 20 then 30 then 40 again we are taking for 10 20 30 and 40 so what's happening here in constant returns to scale from this point you know if we are moving here we need to double cross we can find a corresponding point here let's say here we have again this is not to the scale we need to double when we reach here but here if we double constant increasing return to scale what will we get we will get more than 20 but if we want to draw the ISO point for 20 what do we need to do we need to increase the capital and labor by less than the double amount so in that case it would be closer to the eye stroke 110 in comparison to constant return to skill aiesec 1 10 and 20 so they will become nearer and nearer and you can use the same logic if you have decreasing returns to scale the isoquant will be spaced further and further for the same values in comparison to constantly turn to scale now we can talk about let's start a new topic again in the producer theory and that is cost is it clear the real thing that we talked about it's quite important to understand not just the mathematics but also graph it helps you understand the intuition behind these things [Music] [Music]
