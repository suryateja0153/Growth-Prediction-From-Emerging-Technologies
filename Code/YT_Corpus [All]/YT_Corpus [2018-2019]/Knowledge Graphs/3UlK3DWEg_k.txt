 Hi it's Carlea McAvoy I just want to briefly explain to you the difference between a bar graph and a histogram. Looking at bar graphs first. Bar graphs use categorical data and the bars do not touch. So an example might be asking people what kind of a pet they own. Notice the bars have gaps between them and the data is categorical not numerical, and this one is about the ice cream sold and scoops between May and September again the bars don't touch and the data down here is categorical. In both bar graphs and histograms use the x axis and the y axis, and they also both use bars but histograms use quantitative data and the bars do touch. So here's a picture of a histogram using looking at years notice that there's no gap between the bars and the data that we see at the bottom is quantitative or numerical. And the same thing with the second one the bars are touching, and we have numbers at the bottom not categories. That's it have a great day.
