 use slope intercept form to sketch a graph of y equals two-thirds X minus three again we're lucky this is already in slope-intercept form y equals MX plus B in this case the slope M is two-thirds and the y-intercept it's always going to be the constant term and in this case it's going to be negative 3 because it's 2/3 X minus 3 instead of plus 3 and again we can draw this line without doing any calculations we're always going to start with the y-intercept the y-intercept is negative 3 so we're gonna plot a point at negative 3 on the y axis and then we're going to use the slope to find more points the slope is 2/3 which is rise over run so we're going to rise up 2 and run to the right 3 and that's going to give us a second point on the line that's going to give us our second point and then from there we can keep following the same instructions go up 2 and to the right 3 and that's going to give us another point and then again we go up 2 to the right 3 that gives us another point and then from here we go up 2 and to the right 3 that's going to give us another point and then at this point we've run out of room but we can find some points going in the other direction so we can go down 2 to the left 3 down 2 to the left 3 this keeps giving us more points down to the left 3 and then from this point we can go down 2 and to the left 3 and that'll give us another point on the same line do you see how every time we do this even though we're going in the other direction down 2 into the left 3 the new point is on the same line we're using that fat to plot more points and the reason is so that we can make our line more accurate the line is going to be much better drawn if we have several points to plot to connect the dots than if we just have two points and try and make it as pretty as possible this method generally gives you more accurate graphs than the intercept method simply because you're getting more points on a wider part of the graph and I'm just realizing that I forgot to label this is y equals 2/3 X minus 3 so there we go
