 Hi, my name is ammar today, I will be teaching you lines and graphs Okay, so you have lines right Come from linear equations you can draw them based on their equations okay, you have the simple lines like Y=X Which means that's why it increases by 1 X also increases by one kind and we have Which means as Y increases by one x increases by two x right? Okay, so how do you plot graphs And then you also have a bit more complex lines So, lets give it Y=1/2X+2 So, Y=X, how do you plot it So, Y=X, that means, for example, You have Y here is 1 and X here is 1 So, they will be the same Y equals to X So, when Y is 1 X is also 1 So, then, for Y=2X If Y increases by 1, X increases by 2 When you simultaneously equate these two graphs, You get X=0, or X=1 So if you sketch these graphs, You will find that Where they intersect is here and here So, this is X=0 And this is X=1 So, essentially what you're doing When you're solving simultaneous equations like this Is you're finding the values of X for which The graphs intersect
