 we are asked to consider the graph of the parabola shown on the right we want to begin by determining the open interval for which the function is increasing then determine in the open interval where the function is decreasing formally we say a function is increasing on an open interval if for any X sub 1 and X sub 2 in the interval X sub 2 greater than X sub 1 implies f of X sub 2 greater than f of X sub 1 which means the graph goes uphill from left to right a function is decreasing on an open interval if for any X sub 1 and X sub 2 in the interval X sub 2 greater than X sub 1 implies f of X sub 2 less than f of X sub 1 which means the graph goes downhill from left to right looking at the graph of the parabola from left to right notice how starting on the Left moving to the right the graph goes downhill over this interval which means the function is decreasing over this interval until you reach the vertex this low point and notice how the vertex is represented by the ordered pair negative 3 comma negative 4 and then to the right of the vertex the graph goes uphill from left to right and therefore the function is increasing over this interval so to the left of the vertex the graph is going downhill and decreasing and to the right of the vertex the function is increasing so looking at the problem the function is increasing on what open interval well the function is increasing from negative 3 to the right approaching infinity and therefore the open interval is from negative 3 to infinity and the graph is decreasing on the old interval from the left all the way to negative 3 which means the function is decreasing over the open interval from negative infinity to negative 3 let's graph these two intervals on the horizontal or x-axis the open interval from negative 3 to infinity would be this interval here the function is increasing over this interval or to the right of negative 3 and the open interval from negative infinity to negative 3 would be this interval here again to the left of negative three where the function is decreasing and whenever a function changes from decreasing to increasing we are going to have a low point which represents a relative minimum but because this is the lowest point of the entire graph we can say this point represents an absolute minimum or we can just say a minimum so we can say the function has a minimum and the minimum function value is the Y value or function value of this point which is negative for the location is at the x value and therefore the minimum of negative 4 occurs at x equals negative 3 so again the maximum in function value is always the function value or Y value the location is always the x value let's take a look at a second example again looking at the graph from left to right starting on the Left moving to the right the graph is going uphill over this interval and therefore the function is increasing until we reach the vertex and notice now the vertex is a high point the ordered pair for the vertex is negative 1 comma 3 and then to the right of the vertex notice how the graph goes down and therefore the function is decreasing over this interval so the function is increasing over the open interval to the left of negative 1 to the left we approach negative infinity and therefore the function is increasing over the open interval from negative infinity to negative 1 and then the function is decreasing over the open interval from negative 1 to the right or from negative 1 to infinity again let's graph these intervals on the x-axis or horizontal axis negative infinity to negative 1 would be this interval which is where the function is increasing and from negative 1 to infinity would be this interval where the function is decreasing for this graph the function changes from increasing or decreasing which means the vertex represents a relative maximum this time but because it's the highest point of the entire graph it also represents an absolute maximum or just a maximum so this function has a maximum of the function value or Y value of positive 3 at the x value or the location of x equals negative 1 I hope you found this helpful
