 ok here we are with section for analyzing grass polynomial functions which includes graphing third degree and fourth degree equations and giving it being given a graph of Phi and finding the critical points of a graph so the critical points of a graph some things we know some things were gonna get now x intercepts you're aware of those domain and range you should know those and behavior we just did turning points okay so turning points relative minima and relative maxima really are just minimum and maximum textbooks always use minima and Maxima I guess more academic language type of thing so what we're gonna do with this is I'm going to go to so I've copied and shrunk down these things here and I'm gonna go to desmos kind of go through what those things are autograph and then I'm going to turn the camera down to the video myself on the cat the calculator and kind of show you how to use a calculator to find these critical points to find the turning points and define the x-intercepts domain and range and end behavior basically you can find from looking at the graph or understanding a graph I will say that for obviously for a parabola a positive one opens negative opens down so how does that work with X cubed x cubed we'll do this but negative x cubed we looked at with desmos would flip over the other way and do this alright so it would be a mirror image of flipping over this way same thing with the next to the fourth next to the fourth would do the same thing as these as far as end behavior okay end behavior and that's the key thing here the next to the fifth would do the same as this just like in the last section I went over odd and even degree equations in there I have similar characteristics similar end behavior that's how that applies so understand that when you're looking at an equation we're looking at a graph and knowing which way to go up or down with it so let's go transparency and alright we're on a so I have this stuff here and you know I could turn on all three of these graphs and you'd have them on top of each other but if you just click on this thing over here it does most of you use does most for anything you can have equations there but only look at one at a time if you want so x-intercepts we're pretty familiar with x-intercepts right x-intercepts this has three x-intercepts right so you find those the domain and range the domain of a third degree equation is pretty much in line with its end behavior so the domain is going this way it never stops getting wider to the right or to the left as it goes up and as it goes down so its domain is all real numbers before it's donating and for its range the range it never stops the ranges this way y-coordinates the y-coordinates never stop going down and negative infinity they never stop going up to positive infinity so they are also all real numbers for a third degree or a fifth degree or a seventh degree or a ninth degree that is something you should and must know so domain so any behavior where we go in this direction what is or this there start off in either direction right here f of X goes to negative infinity down as the x coordinates as X goes to negative infinity also the the end behavior up here goes to positive infinity thanks as X goes to positive infinity right I'm not going to keep writing that for each one of these but that's what you're doing with them behavior and the turning points okay so turning points are basically you think of them as the the vertex of an area so the relative the relative Maxima here is this point right here which will kind of be the vertex if this was a parabola the relative minima here would be this point here and that would be the vertex if this was a parabola so relative minimum is a relative maximum is are just the tops of the humps or the bottoms of the valleys of a graph okay so let's get rid of that that's a general third degree equation on a fourth degree equation same thing you have x-intercepts you want to find these you have to relative minimums and one relative maximum you want to find those points and then be able to graph it from those points and this is this equation is X to the fourth plus one so you would look here say okay it's a positive fourth so it's like a positive parabola it's end behavior is going to do this so knowing that if you knew the end behavior right the domain and range the domain never stops getting wide so the domain is all real numbers but the range here is different it will never go below these lowest points for this graph it doesn't have to be both points like if this one was up here instead of down there this would still be the minimum of the graph so this is fine negative five negative six three four so the split in quarters that's negative five and a quarter so the range would be y is greater than or equal to negative five order for that so now let's say if I turn off the graph and get rid of that and we never wrote that so if I was to turn off the graph and you knew the end behavior is going to do that and you knew the x-intercepts and the minimum maximum minimum and it's going to go back up you could draw this graph basically through those points through here down to that up through that down to that and all the way up through there all right so you'd know the critical points you can sketch a rough sketch of the graph all right let's all right so you have a fifth degree you have one two three four five x-intercepts you have a relative minimum relative minimum a relative maximum a relative maximum and behavior doing this and behavior doing that domain and range just like a third degree this is a fifth degree just like a third degree the end behavior is going to go out the domain all odd degrees are going to have domain and range of all real numbers okay all real numbers going up forever and down forever that's a range of all real numbers always stretching to the right as it goes up and always stretching to the left as it goes down would be a domain of all real numbers the only thing I want to look at there is okay what happens to if I just a negative sign go there I don't hear me as well over by the computer put a negative sign in front of that okay made a tremendous difference in the graph but still this is a fifth degree equation and now the end behavior is completely changed to this side and then down here it's going to go down forever all right I'm not a great example of that because it's hard to see them over there so let's take a look at calculator see where we are on a 15-minute possible single video we're at nine minutes so what I'm gonna do is here is my fingers in the way of that rearranging some things getting to calculator and I think max will get all excited about the green screen that I'm using with it so we want to turn it on okay and then I have a graph in there already if I don't want to graph that right now basically you go on to the equal sign and then go down to the equal sign and press Enter and when it dulls the equal sign and no longer highlights it it won't graph that okay so the equation that I'm going to graph right now is going to be 3x squared 3x squared minus 6x squared no three X up arrow will give you a cube right the UH power right there plus - 6x squared minus 6x squared be careful with your negative sign and your minus sign if you're starting off an equation you then use the negative sign if you're subtracting in the equation use the minus sign you'll get a syntax error if you don't do that plus 2x squared plus X plus 1 plus 2x squared plus X plus 1 okay and to graph that the graph button is right here so you graph that and you can take a look at the graph here not sure what we're looking at there and my y equals I don't have anything else that I'm graphing this way no there's nothing else there
