 hi everyone thanks for joining us my my name is mrs. Bourassa and I'm the head of SELCO solutions with neo4j and my plan for today is to introduce the concept of customer journey analysis then try to understand what's the business value of it and how can graphs add to it and finally in the second half of the webinar introduced the concept of active customer journey map graph based and build on near PJ so let's start with with some some definitions what's a customer journey analysis and we have here some some some definitions I've found out the web form are some of the main analysts as you can see it's a practice that that's part of your digital experience technology strategy that aims at providing a cohesive view of all your customers interactions with the organization over time and across multiple channels and in the objective of customer journey analysis is what can be optimized the customers experience of course but it can be also to predict the future behavior of your customer um or similarly it can be to identify gaps in you organizations between different processes between different departments there's a number of objects and we'll talk about them later on but as customers we've all experienced how companies analyze and optimize channels in isolation and what you see in front of you is the kind of emails that I get from my my favorite airline when I do a search that I don't conclude by by purchasing a ticket and well that can be useful in some in some cases it's true that I mean they we don't know if that has happened after after cancelling a booking after a running parallel with another searches or if I just after that search I called on the phone to the customer services and and and conclude the purchase or over the phone so these lack of context met may make this kind of of of interaction meaningless in some in some situations and the point is that these exclusive focus on individual interact or channels can miss the big picture which is exactly what what customer journey analysis tries tries to achieve so why is it why is it important well from the point of view of customers because you can you can find stats around these about these everywhere on the web but customers do do value and have a good opinion of businesses that can remember previous interactions with them and similarly we as customers appreciate relevant and personalize the information so say we all feel this disconnection and how painful it can be when we're dealing with a company whether that's for a service renewal for for for an update for for for a pulling up on on on a claim and having to every time you contact having to provide again and again all the context so well it's true that we don't make it easy because on average customers I believe it is two to three devices as a channel so it's it's important from Twitter view the customers but it's also important from the point of view of the organization's because they want to give the management an overview of the customer experience to see how they move through the sales funnel for example or think that would help to identify opportunity strategic opportunities and similarly organizations will want to uncover and and solve gaps between channels between departments that can be frustrating for the customers and that can have a big impact in the in their business so I hope that that gives an overview of what it is and what it why it's important and then coming back to the definition that there's three recurring concepts the first one is of course the notion of customer why this is a customer centric initiative that combined with the third one with a multi-channel nature of this holistic approach to to customer journey analysis inevitably suggests that there will be an element of data integration multi-channel in IT terms multiple data sources so multiple views of the customer so there will be a component of integration and and while graphs are super relevant in that space I'm probably going to leave that out of today's webinar feel free to to browse our youtube channel or all the content online and yeah so let's leave that the integration component so customer multiple channels and and finally the third I mentioned a time which is the the one that brings context and meaning to all these touch points or touch points all these all these multiple events that we'll have about about a customer about his interactions with us so we think that this is about connecting customer data connecting events connecting things across channels so it's it's all starting to sound pretty gruffly I would say and how do organizations go about doing these customer journey analysis well the the tool is is what's called a customer journey map so the customer journey map and again you have some definitions there they emphasize on the on the visual component so a customer journey map is a visual representation can be in the form of a document info graph infographic or something that that describes the different interactions in in the in the lifecycle of a customer and of course I mean it can be as you can see on the right-hand side it can be in the form of a document snapshot a frozen view of it or it can be more dynamic and as a tool it's successful depend very much on its quality on its timeliness on its level of detail and and of course in building it there's an inherent complexity and and this I love this quote from from this garner analyst that actually is kind of a of a challenge that sure is that we need a like because it's I'm not really going to use it as a as a segue to to introduce the next section because what he brings up here is well he's actually trying to explain why all the organizations are quite enthusiastically embracing the concept of customer journey mapping they're struggling to to put it in practice and to get actually meaningful value out of it and and that's because there's a significant element of complexity first of all variability and unpredictability and that's something that traditional stores traditional data management systems find very hard to deal with but that's the kind of thing that that graphs excel at as I was saying I'm going to have introduced this slide that I used very often to teach neo4j and you will see that the NE describes the typical customer needs the sort of requirements that drive our customers to to graph based solutions and and there's a significant overlap with what I've just described so there's a need to capture complexity there's a need to allow flexibility in situations where we we want to bring in multiple data sources overtime all at once and in an incremental way so these flexibility is required we're going to talk about performance later when we talk about actionable customer journey Maps and and finally whitewood friendliness this idea of a model that's uh that's user friendly that lends itself naturally to visual exploration so these are all requirements that that the property graph model which is the one that near vajay implements fulfills by by using the probably the simplest but the most powerful and expressive model which is the graph model which is just based off notes basically data points connected to other points connected to other data points which is what we called relationships or edges in the graph alright so right let me introduce you the idea of active customer journey map on near to J because it starts from from the definitions that we've seen and the first characteristics of it is the fact that it's a visualizable it I mean the visual component the possibility of exploring it visually is critical but it adds a number of elements that are my opinion are are critical and and and one of them is is this flexible and dynamic aspect right so we we understand that a customer journey map is going to be built in incrementally I mean you don't wait until you have all the information and ready to build them up you build with what you have and as new data sources arrive you will enrich it to provide better insights so this flexibility and an agile platform is very much required so that every time there is a change is not a traumatic you know IT project to to to to ingest it to include it and to enrich the graph with it which the journey with it and finally the last one that we bring as well is that it's an actionable platform it's not just a static graph it doesn't represent the snapshot of frozen snapshot of what reality is is a data-driven actionable platform that we kind of are going to be able to use to drive all sorts of initiatives and in an automated way and by the definition of for example rules on on your customer journeys so from the point of view of a methodology probably need methodologies a bit too much but it does the three steps that happen in in a kind of iterative way and the first one is the the identification and and and collection and connection of relevant data sources basically all the channels that contribute to the journey then you bring them into the into the graph platform then you run some discoveries and analysis some some identification of the of the key elements on the on the key journeys that you want to analyze and then once you identify you verify your hypothesis you build automated interactions on top of it and that's the actionable part of it and this is an an iterative process as I say and and we're gonna see more of it probably in a in a demonstration that I'm going to run for you right now so the the demonstration is about a fictitious telco company that's selling on broadband or maybe mobile plans and they're looking to other customer journeys trying to understand and analyze the customer journeys to try and and and predict and prevent churn right so in order to show you what we've built I'm going to use a couple of tools the first one is bloom bloom is our data exploration data visualization our platform that has been just recently released and one of the ways in which you can query the graph through bloom is by using what we call the search phrases right so if looking for customers we see that there is a search phrase that will pick up the name let's think of one customer for example Vulcans can swim an N I had to learn to type there you go so it's the auto-completion there and what bloom brings is a fraction of the graph let me zoom out so you can see all the elements in there so we see a representation of of Fernando tokens our customer and we see around him a number of of events we see for example the pink ones represent interactions calls from from customer services that can be marketing initiatives that can be customer service and we see that for each of these nodes linked to the customer we have a sentiment a sort of score or some kind of a score that indicates whether it was a positive or a negative interaction from one being the most negative to five being the most positive and three being neutral so we have two calls that happen over time and we see that if I don't they can denote we see the characteristics and everything all the events are timestamp remember the time was a crucial element that we're gonna see why so we have a cause from from our customer service or marketing team and we see that there have also been interactions from Francisco with a helpdesk right that's customer service chat as we call it here and similarly we have a sentiment score and that again might be based on on on Fernando's review of the of the of the interaction on some or some other metrics and on the other side we see Fernando's service right which in this case let me expand it here is an instance of a of orange extra 56 gig service maybe so it's a mobile plan and we have a number of events also associated to these to this service right 12 would be a 12 month contract and we see for example information about usage all the brown brownish notes represent events again and they're all similarly time-stamped that provide information on a monthly basis of what's the usage in terms of calls state or or minutes in out of out of planned calls similarly we have information about incidents maybe incidents in the network so that can be incidents that potentially affected Nando's service right so yeah in this case we have a service outage that took place in a particular date like all the other events and another event that was not service impacting so you can think of this as an aggregation of the same before of data coming from multiple different sources and of course we will have the event representing the service description when the contract started and we create also future events things that haven't happened yet but our milestones in our journey which is the expected service renewal right and we see how we're going to use that in a minute so this is this is a good way of exploring you know all the information about the customer and we can see that things are connected because there are other subscribers of the same service and if I expand it I can sing I can see other instances of service of that particular orange extra 56 gig and for each one of them we are have similar information to the one we found for for francisco so that's a that's the first overview of the model let me clear the sin and do another type of search so this was based on a predefined search phrase where I just need to parameterize with the name of a customer in that case what bloom can also a sort of interpret certain natural language it's not completely natural language because they have to be likely aware of what what the model looks like but I can let me think of an example in fine I want to analyze churn so the event that represents a churn is a customer churning is a non renewal event so if I look for a non renewal we see that as I type bloom is detecting maybe it would be a good idea I don't know how readable that is but maybe that will make things better so um we see that um increasing it anyway so we see that that the parser is detecting the fact that there is a non renewal type of event that is actually connected to a service to the for service relationship and that's why I mean that I need I need to be familiar with the with the with the model so if we service instance and and that would be connected to service instance that connected to a customer and for the customer you see that as I type the the the parser is is mapping it to the to the day time my graph this is the customer has a property that's the name and for example I'm going to use with cust space cuts name for example click ok and that's exactly the pattern that I'm looking for so I'm if I go back to my screen mode we see that effectively we have a we have a similar pattern through a similar structure to the one we saw before with nanda we have this loner user has a subscribes to a particular service and we have an event that it's actually the the non-renewal event but if I expand it we see that we have exactly the same information that we have before all the usage when the subscription take place type of service etc etc all right so as I'm saying this is exploratory view and you may say well I can see that that's that's nice to see all the information that we have about the customer but I'm missing one element which is the sequential element right we said that we want to look at events as they happen over time right so we've aggregated the events but we don't see these disconnection and to do that let me jump to our other surface of interaction with a graph which is the browser in the browser we have a more it's basically a query interface so we rewrite cipher cipher is the query language that we use with neo4j and we have a much more powerful and expressive interface but it's fully more technically oriented to technical technical faults so I have some queries here that I'm going to run to to show you a little bit more about the model so I was saying that I'm interested in this sequential view of events right so what this query is running for a particular customer right again our friend Fernando Vulcans I'm saying well find me this customer from the customer find the service that he subscribes to you and find the first event which will typically be the service description that's when he when the service starts he subscribes to the particular service and then from there on that note representing subs go all the way back and that's the the linked list of events that are connected through the next relationship give me all the events that we have about his interaction with us across all all possible channels and well again that's pretty technical detail but this asterisk indicates that go it's a variable length expression and mean it means go all the way back in time following the next relationship until you get to an event which is probably the expected service renewal right well back in time actually forward in time because we're starting from the point where the subscription was created so if I run this query what we get is a is a different view so here we don't have the connection to the customer we have just a chain of events that hazard at the at the root of it the service subscription a number of events it's just service you should use it reports that come every month but in interleaved we can see for example a customer phone call by that customer service phone code that might be one of the contains that we were talking about before there might be an interaction with the back with the help desk I thought that green one is not this is an incident actually the incidents were seen before so we see that things happen over time and ultimately this this journey finishes on a future event that's meant to happen next month September October 17 which is the expected as service renewal right so that gives us this this sequential view and well that's that's nice to see it's probably not the most used to where you might want to present the same information exactly the same query as you see but I'm going to present it in a more tabular way and that actually returns this for every step in the in the sequence we see the timestamp when it took place what type of event happened and all the details about the event and of course it starts with the service subscription and then there's usage reports over time things like interaction with a customer service etc etc so it's another view of of the data right good so that's that's what the model looks like so we see that I'm having detail how the whole data ingestion and integration happens I mentioned before that I would leave that out of the of today's session but once we have this this view what we want to analyze and start to to try and understand churn right so what do the paths that lead to churn look like that's the question that I'm asking and again we saw that the events the nodes representing an a customer churning are non-renewable events right so if I start from a non-renewal event and see all the sequence of events that lead to it I can ask interesting questions is a global were not specific for a particular customer but for all customers so if I run this query it's gonna scan all the all the customers I have churned have a non renewal event and it's giving me the list of the different types of events so we see that it starts with the service subscription it continues with maybe some customer service calls a chat with the help desk some incidents happening and some service usage information we saw that service user is gonna be there always because we have that on a regular basis every month and there's always going to be a service subscription so we want to look at what's what's different about each of them right so what we can do for example instead of looking at them in detail one by one I can say well give me a summary of the most frequent ones and if I aggregate them we see that the one that happens more frequently is when between the subscription and and non-renewal we have things like incidents we have something like inter interactions with with the health text desk maybe maybe with negative experience we will have to look at the other satisfaction at the score at the sentiment school that we were looking at so this just gives us an overview of what do these pads look like instead of going step by step that gives me the kind of the skeleton author of the path right so now that we know that there are these types of events that might have an influence I can start testing my my hypothesis right what do I mean by that let's say that I think that maybe having a bad experience with with customer service so with help desk may have an impact on churn so what kind of query would I write I would say well let's look at all day again all the paths that terminate in a in a non renewal in churn and let's see if there's any instance of interaction with the customer service look at the customer service chat is one of the ways that you can interact with with the help desk right before it can be chat that's the data that we have in this data set so this is the type of pattern that I'm interested in and and again I mean I don't want this to be of course a training in cipher but I hope this is at this quite self self descriptive in a way and well first of all I hope it's readable but the idea is that I'm we're asking pretty complex and deep questions about the patterns and with as you see we're doing it in one line of code so I'm saying start from a node that represents the the non-renewal and go back in time as deep as you want follow all the events and then do some aggregates and in this case what I want to understand is for all the interactions with the with the help desk what was the sentiment the average sentiment so I'm using just as a simple average function to aggregate so if I run this we'll see and again that's that's been done on on an individual basis we'll see that well in most of them there's a number of interactions right looking at these patterns so there's a number of interactions with the help desk and we see that the average sentiment is suspiciously under remember the three was the neutral so anything under three is probably negative or very negative so there will be exceptions only yeah just above but in general that it looks like there seems to be a quite a bit of a correlation between a bad experience with the help desk some pre technical problems and the fact that her customer terms again I'm facing these and I'm conscious of you know trying to to show in in a short space of time this whole process that I was describing before but this is the typically the job of a data of a data scientist that you will to some extent be able to automate us we're going to talk later discuss later but so yes we see that there's a some kind of correlation between bad experiences negative experience with the help desk and and churn and in a similar way with service usage have anything to do with with churn or we can look at that as well and we can say well again from all the all the paths all the journeys that terminate in non-renewal there will be information about service usage and the service usage has absolute values LeMond on text calls and and and and data usage but it also has a data user usage index which is a relative value saying you using 50% 40% 75% 120 % above your your monthly allowance so if I look at that and I run same query like I did before for from all of our churners here I'll see that the average usage is is also significantly low I wouldn't call it loads it's 56 60 percent but it's a I would say around 50 percent usage so that might be another another reason why if you realize that you're not using what you paying for you might decide to to to not renew your service right so that's that's another simple analysis that can we can do in one of these two line queries and what do we do with all that but basically what we will come up with the model will come up with a prediction of what based on the past can help us predicting what's going to be the future behavior so let's say we validate that and I'm simplifying this for this demo but let's say we come come to the conclusion that a negative experiences with help desk and under utilization of your service can be an indicator of of potential churn so what we do is we will build an automated predictive model yeah that basically looks it's a little bit more complicated query but still we're looking at other customers that I'll have an expected renewal in the next few months so before the end of the year so the renewal is due before 31st of December this year and again we're going to be looking at the two elements that we thought were were relevant one is service usage and highlighting those that are under 50% and customer service chat which is help desk sentiment that's under 3 which is the neutral one so if there's any any of these two conditions happening for the the customers that are due to renew in the next few few weeks few months I want to highlight that and I'm presenting that in the table so that's the simple way of producing as you see what I'm I'm describing here the logic of what I'm doing and keep in mind that we're doing it with three four lines of code so this is a list of all the customers that are due to renew in the next few weeks months and that verify any of the of the conditions that we consider relevant from the point of view of maybe helping predicting churn right so I'm gonna stop it here because I'm conscious of time and I've wanted to come back to the conclusions before we answer questions if we have any right so what's a conclusion from these exercise well first of all is that the graph gives you an efficient and flexible way of representing your customer journey data right and in that sense new Veejay being a platform that uses graph that's the way of representing and analyzing and consuming days it gives you it gives you a head start not only because it represents data like that anything makes it possible for you to analyze it like that but because he also comes with a number of out-of-the-box components connectors to to ingest data from any possible data source it comes with a library of algorithms we haven't talked about that but if you enrich for example your model with data about let's say interactions between customers you can not only predict churn but you can also try to understand what's going to be the impact of an influential customer be in case in case he or she decides to not renew and that can be based on on algorithms like centrality like a community detection etc etc so all that comes out the works with near PJ and well if if you're ready to build your active customer journey map with evj then it's my call to action so for it's a long list but first of all go and download me for Jane from our website I have a specific recommendation that I think is relevant to this webinar which is appointed to this very interesting blog post by my colleague Adam Crowley on how to build an active customer journey map on me into Jay from from Google Analytics data so it's a very detailed step-by-step description of how to do it so that's so that's an interesting resource I think and of course once you start working with you and playing with it join our online community that's the link what are you taking it seriously and you want to bring a solution into production maybe you want to reach out to us for licensing information and best practices around building active customer journey Maps that's it for me thank you very much and yeah thank you hey Zeus I'm so well try and answer a few questions now so to start off we have a question around Google Analytics so um can you think of some way to incorporate Google Analytics maybe website visits that sort of thing into this sort of customer journey absolutely and that's that's precisely it let me go back to the to the link that's exactly Adams content so what he's done is he's taking a big dump of Google Analytics data on a public data set and it's a lot more granular so what I've tried to describe in in in today's demo is more like a multi-channel overview is more focused on on clickstream on understanding how you navigate your pages what transactions happen but that's definitely a possibility and and I refer you to this very interesting blog post about it okay and from your experience in the fields and how much time from the kind of start to finish of a neo4j project tends to be spent on data collection and preparation right well that's that's of course a critical a critical element the the thing I mean it's hard to of course it will depend on the complexity of the data sources it's not the same to low that as CSV a simple flat CSV with with with ten columns that are loading a a hierarchical structure for Jason I mean it can vary a lot but the the idea is that it's a pre-standard I would say that you should be able to that's what we we do in Phil this to build the prototype in in in a in a short iteration let's say a couple of weeks something like that and then build from there it's right that's that's the idea I mean neo4j as I was mentioning before accumulates changes billed for I mean it's a schema-less platform so you don't need to know everything up front and do a massive modeling exercise you can build your solutions incrementally so I don't know that answers your question is a bit vague but I hope it gives you an idea of it okay I'm and when you demoed bloom and can you let us know how you would normally represent or visualize the timeline within bloom well the representation is actually in in the database now whether you can see that in bloom of course of course you can I don't know if that would be super useful because and that's why I focused on the other on the other visualization but you can of course take an event of any type followed by another event right and if I look for this pattern probably bloom will I mean it won't explode they will it will probably take all the older all the paths let's see what happens but it's a it's gonna be a pretty large dataset that's gonna come out of it and I'm not sure is that it's the best idea but and and that's fully down to my my laps of being a bit busy we'll see how what happens wow that's a lot of notes but not very good idea so yeah I mean as I tried to show today it's I'm visualizing this sequential link of events it's not that useful I mean it's important to have it because it enables very very interesting and very very sophisticated queries on what's what's happening in what kind of patterns of events but the visualization may may not be may not be that that useful but again that's that's just the prototype is a demo so it might be cases in which seeing the chain of events like we saw in the browser in the browser could be it could be done in bloom and another another way would be to create a text sorry I search a search phrase and we'll return the customer data in the form of a chain as opposed to two groups of nodes like we saw before okay and on a related note is there a limit to the number of nodes you can have when you're using bloom well that's a good question which I'm probably not the best person to answer I think that will come down to to the to the client machine I would say but I would assume that one hour before saying something wrong I would rather leave it unanswered check it with the bloom team and come back to you but some well could be a large number as you can see that definitely and okay so we'll try and squeeze in one more question so how would you be able to store details of an event rather than just add the sentiment score that you assigned but if you want to you know provide a bit more detail around for this ultimate score absolutely and that that's a very good question because I mean for my demo I it's something that you can present in ten fifteen minutes I want to try to simplify it to the minimum max agree you can have I mean this this sentiment score may not even exist is something yet you may want to compute on the fly based on some other elements as you described so of course there's a whole modeling exercise and and in my case I just wanted to have an element that I could use for my quiz but you can you can compute it on the fly you can you can say well if you can be flexible and say if for example the usage if it's above you know 10% or 20% of the other monthly allowance and then you do this or do these all the thing and and same with the score so you can you can hard-coded it or you can you can represent it in a different way and and in some cases I think the the the the service usage I saw an example I show an example where you have the actual details of the data usage for data calls text etc and then there's a there's a combination of all of them valued using the average but that will depend on you on your on your case
