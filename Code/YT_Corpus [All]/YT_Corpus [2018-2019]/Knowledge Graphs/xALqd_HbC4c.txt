 hello and welcome I am professor doobie and today's lesson is on recognizing the graphs of seven of the more common functions we run into in mathematics I'm using desmos to graph the functions to demonstrate them and the idea is you would recognize the shape and the equation that goes with that shape so that if you're given it an equation you have some idea what the graph looks like without absolutely plotting points and sketching it so the first one is right here and it's f of x equals 3 now remember f of X just is here the your instructions how do you find y so for this graph y is always equal to 3 that has the effect of giving us a horizontal line so our first function is whenever f of x equals a number we should recognize that the shape is a horizontal line now students tend to call this a straight line but I will point out that all lines are straight this one is a flat line it has a slope of 0 so on to our next function I'm going to shut off the first one now we have f of x equals x or y equals x that also is a line and it's a line such that every y coordinate is equal to its x-coordinate so when X is negative 1 Y is negative 1 when X is 1 Y is 1 when X is 5 y is 5 when X is negative 5 y is negative 5 this gives us a slope of 1 and this is an odd function is if you think about even and odd functions our horizontal line was an even function but this is pretty basic now you move this around probably when you study lines by putting numbers in front of the X and numbers after the X to move it up and down numbers in front to make it steeper or less steep so we will look you see looked at this kind of a function and how it moves around already but the most basic line and this is called the identity function also so y equals x is a line with slope one also called the identity function the third function will look at is y equals x squared it's over here and this one is called a quadratic function any function with the highest any polynomial function with the highest exponent of two is called a quadratic this is the most basic quadratic what you should recognize about this is that it is a u-shape and this one's pointing upward we haven't started moving in it we're going to move these around in future lessons but it's got symmetry over a line that goes through what we call the vertex and it's rounded the rounded is important because that's what makes it different than the absolute value function and the reason that you get only positive Y values for the function x squared it's because when you square a number let's go to the point where x is negative two when you square a negative number you multiply it by itself you multiply two negatives together you always get a positive so whatever you get at X is 2 you also get it at X is negative 2 the the both positive values squaring a number kind of takes away what its original sign was you don't know whether it's positive or negative because it always comes out positive so that's y equals x squared it's very important to recognize this we will move it around some by putting numbers in front of it you can see it make it steeper or by adding numbers to it I should take a number away so you can see it so I'm gonna subtract the number from it moves it down and then if I decide I want to put something in with the X and square it it will move it to the side we will look more at those movements for now your mission is to recognize this shape as being the basic function x squared the next function is very similar to what we just looked at because you see the symmetry but notice there's no roundness to it it's really the two lines two piecewise function one is y equals negative x and if you look at this right side that's y equals x so this is the absolute value function I typed it out here as maybe aspects but I think I could have done this it's when X is in the straight lines you just take whatever X is and take the positive of that value so when X is 5 y is just gonna be what X was because X was already positive it's gonna be 5 but when X is negative 5 the absolute value of negative 5 is still 5 because it's still 5 away from 0 so Y becomes 5 so that's how you get the slope of negative 1 here and the slope of positive 1 here so an absolute value has a vertex that is a sharp point unlike x squared the quadratic function that had a vertex had a rounded bottom so recognizing absolute value of x as this shape will be important now we looked at x squared this is X cubed if you look this does have negative numbers in its range when X is negative if you multiply a negative number by itself three times and that's what the 3 means a negative times a negative is a positive and then you take that and multiply it by a negative you get a negative anytime you have an odd a number of negative numbers being multiplied together then you get a negative as your result that means for all negative values of X X cubed gives you a negative value for Y it gives you a positive value for y when x positive and it's steeper than x squared if I put the x squared back there you see X cubed rises faster so that is X cubed its ends going opposite directions that becomes very important later too so now let's look at the square root of x I don't have any X values plotted to the left of the y axis over here that's because I can't take the square root of a negative number and get a real answer these graphs only show us real values of Y that would occur real values of x that we can put in and if I ask you the domain of this you can pretend this an arrow there it starts at 0 X is greater than or equal to 0 those are the only points I can plot to make this graph I don't have any points to plot when x is negative so this is a square root function and if you take the square root of 4 you see you get 2 and we're gonna learn later that this is the inverse in a sense of the right it is the inverse of the right half of the x squared function x squared does not actually have an invert okay this is um y equals the square root of x the next function is y equals the cubed root of x now look at the difference this red function was square root and it doesn't have any values above or below where X is negative but the cube root of x does if X is negative 8 I get negative 2 you can see that right there where I'm pointing to for y that means negative two times negative two times negative two must be equal to negative eight this is why we don't have a domain restriction when we have an odd root because you can multiply three three three negative numbers together or five negative numbers together to produce a negative number inside so the cube root of x has domain all real numbers so it's it's kind of get the squiggle it's almost like X cubed rotated which it essentially is all right so those are the graphs of your seven common functions square root say X cubed and let's look at X cubed with its cube root they are inverses of each other that's why you get this symmetry over y equals x we'll talk about that more later and then the absolute value and then the quadric the basic quadratic the identity line and y equals a constant or f of x equals a number this happens to be 3 if I make that 5 it just changes the location but it's still a horizontal line that's it for today's video please work on memorizing the shapes of these functions but if I only look at sorry I don't know what happened there
