 Hello my name is Atanas Kiryakov. I am  CEO of Ontotext. During this webinar i will demonstrate the power of graph analytics to integrate various data sets in a Knowledge graph and derive insights from the Graph, matching concepts and entities across disparate data sources and recognising entity references in text requires disambiguation of their meaning, and it is something that comes easy to people, but computers quite often fail to do right. In the live demo session you see how graph analytics on top of Ontotext Knowledge graph, that is 2 billion triples, loaded in GraphDB can provide entity awareness of a sort about people organisations and locations. We abbreviate this to P.O.L., how a system using this Knowledge graph can retrieve similar companies or rank organisations by popularity or by importance. I will also share with you our comparison of different sources of company data all the way from open sources like DBpedia to D&B and CrunchBase, what is the information that you can get from each of those, what is the coverage, etc. I will also share our experience in interlinking these data sets, their coverage, their overall overlap between each other and so on. Thrilled to learn more? Join us for this webinar to learn how graph analytics can enhance your data discovery solution and get chance to get your questions answered life. Looking forward to meet you!
