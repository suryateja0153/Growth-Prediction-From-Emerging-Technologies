 let's explore how we can practically verify whether any material obeys Ohm's law now before we do that let's quickly recall what Ohm's law is almost all says that if you take any material like let's say windings of a wire and if we apply a potential difference across the ends of that so let's say the potential difference across the ends of this wire is V and because of this a current starts running over here let's call it current as I then Ohm's law says that V must equal I times R where R represents the resistance that the material offers to the flow of charges through that material and we've talked in detail about this in a previous video so if you need a refresher it would be great idea to go back and watch that video and then come back over here and so the question is if I have some material with me how do I check practically whether this relationship Ohm's law whether it really holds true or not so to do this we need to first understand a little bit more about this thing called resistance you see the resistance is a property of the material and it's dimensions and something we'll talk more about in the future but what's important is that it does not depend on the values of voltage or current so even if we change these values for any given material like a let's say we have for a given wire let's say as we change the values of the voltage or the current this number shouldn't change in other words in this equation this number is a constant this is the constant and so another way to look at this is we could say if we divide this equation by I we could say V divided by AI should equal R should be a constant should be a constant so to check whether any material obeys Ohm's law V to check whether the ratio of voltage and current through that material is it a constant it means if we double the voltage the current must also get doubled because the ratio should remain the same if we triple the voltage the current must also get tripled that's the basic idea behind Ohm's law so how do we practically test this well one easy way to do this is by drawing a graph so what we like to do is we like to plot the values of voltage along the y axis and the values of current along the horizontal x axis so let's say we put some value of voltage let's say we put a value of two volts as an example and we measure the current and let's imagine the current turns out to be one ampere then we'll plot that point over here in our graph now if Ohm's law is valid then when I double the voltage if I double the voltage let's say I make it forwards then the current must get doubled all right the current must get doubled so two amperes so the next point or another point must lie somewhere here and similarly if I triple the voltage so let's say I triple it triple the voltage so I make it six volts then the current must also get tripled three amps and so that point would lie somewhere over here and what you can notice now is that if you join all these points they lie on a straight line they lie on a straight line and this straight line must pass through the origin because when the voltage is zero even the current must be zero and so to check whether any material obeys Ohm's law all we need to do is draw a graph of voltage versus current and just check whether that graph is a straight line if it's a straight line Ohm's law is valid if it's not a straight line Ohm's law is not valid and so in reality in in in practice when you do an experiment like this you may not get all the points lying on an exact straight line because there could be experimental errors there could be errors in taking observation there could be errors in the instruments and many errors because of that we would like to take lots and lots of trials but if you find that all the points that you have plotted pretty much lie on a straight line somewhat like this then we cannot then we can conclude yes this material does obey Ohm's law on the other hand if you find the graph is somewhat like this and clearly the material does not obey Ohm's law so this one does obey Ohm's law but not this one this one does not obey Ohm's law because it's clearly not a straight line and another thing we could do is once we plot a graph from the graph we can calculate what is the resistance of that material so for example over here to calculate the resistance notice all we have to do is calculate voltage work divided by the current and so for example we can do that at this point so at this point we could say the voltage is 6 volts and the current over here is 3 amps this is three amps and so if you divide the two the voltage divided by the current we get the resistance and so the resistance in this example would be 6 divided by 3 that is 2 ohms and so experimentally from the graph we can calculate the resistance just by dividing the voltage with current and you can do that at any point we could have done the same thing over here and we would have gotten the same answer you can pause and check that for yourself you can do that at any point you want and we'll get the same value for R just simply because this is a straight line and lastly things that obey Ohm's law we usually call them as ohmic materials or ohmic devices for example metals obey Ohm's law so they are ohmic materials and things which are made of metal are also ohmic an example would be filament of a light bulb they are ohmic devices on the other hand things that do not obey Ohm's law we will call them non ohmic devices or non ohmic materials non ohmic an example of a non ohmic material would be semiconductors so anything which is made of semiconductor are non ohmic devices an example of that are LED bulbs which are pretty popular today LED bulbs do not obey Ohm's law they are non ohmic devices so to quickly summarize what we learned we found that if the voltage versus current graph for any material is a straight line passing through the origin then that material obeys ohms law and we call such materials as ohmic materials and from the graph if we divide the voltage by the current we get the resistance of that material and if it's not a straight line then we'll call them as non ohmic devices because that means they do not obey Ohm's law
