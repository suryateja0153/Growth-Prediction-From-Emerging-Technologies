 in the future robots will transform everything in morphx we believe that anyone can be part of this transformation and that's why we designed the moon bot you can use the moon bot kit to create the three official robot forms now first is the moon rover this is an autonomous moving platform that's great for transport then you have the moon mech this is a flexible robotic arm that is great for grabbing things and finally there's buck moon bot is a cute little robot with a lot of emotions now the translucent shell allows you to see the electrical and mechanical parts inside of each robot as well as its status through a set of LEDs unlike other robot cubes moonbots uses cutting-edge computer vision as its primary sensor by building mortifying or even hacking the moon box everyone can learn how to use the AI technology the moon vision sensor is the artificial four of the mood puckett this tiny module integrates many image recognition algorithms like color recognition line detection fall detection human detection and card pattern recognition these algorithms legged robot see the environments and do fun things based on what it sees the moon bot kid supports all the programming environment that is compatible with a do we know you can do it either on PC or on mobile devices like an iPad the controller has 15 connector ports which provide a multitude of module combinations making it perfect for robotics education the movement kit will provide each well designed electronic modules and will support more with future updates the controller also supports third-party modules that are arduino compatible with generic mounting holes designed for adding whatever you want whether it's metal cardboard even LEGO pieces whether you're eight or 80 you can make something amazing with a bucket hi I'm Joseph Schlesinger and I'm Hani Hugh and this is Sparky Sparky is a simple to use open source or do we know base robot the lowest cost full-featured robot on the market and is an engaging introduction to programming electronics and robotics Sparky is very easy to use and to get started with just take it out of the box plug it in download our customized Arduino software and get started with any of our dozens of programming samples or you can write your own code in minutes using our online tutorials we've been conducting pilot classes with elementary and middle school students and have an amazed at what they can do we are working hard in enhancing and expanding our curriculum for Sparky improving the lessons and code used in the class Sparky is easy to use with beginner feature-packed enough for even the most passionate enthusiast or researcher and has named it anyone would ignore these subjects or to have a comprehensive robotics platform for their own projects experiments spark includes a servo mounted ultrasonic distance sensing head three light level sensors a 3-axis accelerometer to the second for an angle of the robot five line following an edge detection sensor infrared send and receive modules for inter spark a communication and to use with the included ergo control 128 by 64 pixel graphic LCD and two geared stepper motor wheels for highly precise measured movement which when combined the Sparkie center mounted mercury holder allow you to do some amazing drawings if we raise enough to reach our 200k stretch goal we will include a multi-channel video video perfect for coordinating multiple parties just farmer lies sparkies durable ABS plastic construction st. plastic use of Legos will also be made with a special texture injection will technique so that you can easily drawn it with martha's simply put you know spark can do anything ever wanted a robot to do for you thanks to our last completed pulley ship Kickstarter we've demonstrated the experience and sourcing distribution and manufacturing necessary to complete this project it's also given us the time to develop Sparky for close to a year through an evolution of dozens of prototypes and working with our manufacturing partners to refine our current version for months and as always in keeping with art products open source philosophy all designs for the robot will be released online kids love technology they all know how to use it that they almost never know how it works we wanted to break open these magic devices and let kids build our own stuff with technology that's why we developed the build your own robot get with more kids can use the magic of Technology to build their own interactive robots devices or works of art it all starts with the easy board is the brain of the robot on the one side it says input on the other side it says output the input parts are blue and the output parts are green if you connect them on the opposite side of each other on the easy board they will respond directly there are different input parts like a sound sensor a rotary knob and a distance sensor and there's also different output parts like two different motors or buzzer and led your turns their interaction with technology into a fun educational and creative experience you can create anything you want with your sometimes the scary to start at the blank canvas that's why we created the craft kits an ideal kickoff to your creativity the craft kits are created from pre-cut cardboard that you can assemble yourself using an instruction manual it's still cardboard so you can attach all kinds of stuff to it and make it to run the easy board runs on Arduino tip so when you're done building you can dive into the code and make a robot respond exactly the way you want kids constantly surprise us with what they can build with the order together we can find out what this new generation can build if they have the tools to build the technology their creativity is endless and I can't wait to find out what they were built in 2003 two robots named Spirit and Opportunity were loaded onto a pair of Delta 2 rockets the Rockets blasted off separately about three weeks apart seven months later the pods arrived streaking through the Martian atmosphere containing perhaps the most complex and advanced robots ever created the Rovers were powered up stretched their legs and made contact with their controllers on earth to begin their long missions on the Red Planet today we're proud to share our newest creation the spirit rover a desktop version of the famous rover sent to Mars our miniature version of the real thing is built around a Raspberry Pi computer and includes an Arduino compatible processor along with a ton of sensors and smarts whether you're new to programming or an experienced pro spirit is a perfect robot platform for learning to program in Python and C as well as learning the inner workings of the Linux operating system tutorials and lessons will guide you along the way you'll code and control your own Rover missions while learning how computer vision and autonomous robots work remote control your missions using Wi-Fi from a computer tablet smartphone or a game controller Spirit is an ideal platform for teaching in classroom environments playing on your own at home and even used in serious research we've combined the most common pieces of hardware available in the open-source and maker community into a single robot that's endlessly hackable and expandable not only is spirit of practical robot for learning he's also loaded with personality he has a pan tilt head to look around and tell you how he's feeling 27 neopixel style lights can be individually controlled to create any color sequence you can think of and a piezo sound chirper can create blips and tones these are the droids you're looking for the Raspberry Pi camera can be used for computer vision this is an exciting new field in robotics spirit can identify objects colors movement and even faces the rover includes a gripper along the front suitable for moving and collecting small objects spirit can see the gripper and object with this camera so remote controlling and computer vision operations are possible spirit includes several useful navigation sensors in addition to the camera the eyes are actually an ultrasonic rangefinder that measures distances to objects the main board also includes a three axis accelerometer and gyroscope these sensors can be used to move specific distances and make accurate turns an array of bottom sensors are also provided that can be arranged in various patterns the sensors can follow lines or sense edges you can also enable an emergency stop where the motors will automatically stop if the robots about to fall off an edge three ambient light sensors are provided to measure light 360 degrees around the robot we've also included a port to add an optional LED headlight or infrared emitter for communication or navigation in the dark the spirit is actually three computers in one the Raspberry Pi at the heart of the rover will handle most of your code and processing the Arduino compatible processor on the rover's main board can be used to run code by itself or used together with the pipe the third processor is a microchip pic processor it's preloaded with code and handles low-level tasks in the background you can hack it too if you like all three processors communicate with each other using simple functions allowing you to effectively control any of the robots hardware and sensors and almost any conceivable combination this is truly a hackers dream robot you can communicate upload code and drive the rover remotely from just about any computer or smartphone using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth including common sixaxis type game controllers you can even program and remote pilot the robot over the Internet use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth built onto the PI or add your own module to the main board for Wi-Fi Bluetooth and even xp for ZigBee mesh networking the robot is powered by a single cell battery with a runtime of one to four hours automatic charging is built right in the robot can be powered or charged from a USB cable connected to your computer or an optional external wall power supply we should also point out spirits high-quality components the micro gear motors are precise and allow the robot to run on a variety of surfaces the plastic frame parts are made from semi flexible ABS plastic the parts are not brittle so you won't have to worry about them cracking the rest of the hardware includes durable parts stamped from metal striking a good balance between light weight and durability you'll assemble spirit yourself from a kit using common hand tools no soldering is required and will provide Illustrated instructions to make the process easy spirit is a great solution for so many applications from basic remote-control toy to learning simple and advanced coding to learning how autonomous robots work at a deeper level you're not going to get bored with this robot any time soon easy access is provided to connect to monitor and USB devices you can use the Raspberry Pi inside the spirit just like you would a normal standalone PI all the important signal lines and ports are exposed so advanced users can add on to the robot or use the electronics on their own custom robot frame or chassis will guide you along the way through written guides and tutorials along with examples you can customize on your own for the past two years we've been creating an ecosystem of robots and guides to teach programming continuing with this effort we also plan to launch a youtube series covering all kinds of tutorials and inspiring examples for spirit and our other robots this project is not officially endorsed or affiliated with NASA JPL or any of the agencies related to the actual Mars missions but I am a huge space nerd this project is a salute to the extraordinary engineers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory NASA and the rest of the world space agencies by backing this project you'll help us by parts and larger quantities and cover the tooling costs for spirits custom parts you'll also help educate and inspire the rover designers of the future will add another awesome robot to our lineup and continue in the spirit of the open-source movement to share and freely educate thank you for your time and thank you for your support
