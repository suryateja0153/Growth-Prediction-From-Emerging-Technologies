 [Music] the name of this robot is vestry apparently a mythical nose from Norse mythology a lot of times when people see a robot screencap on the ball they're like okay knows how to screw that come from that bottle so it must also be able to screw this cap up of this bottle and that's a very easy and assumption makes you want to human do that then it's obvious they should be able to figure out and do that but for these robots sexually not at all obvious the person can learn new things very quickly they do have their lifetime of experience to draw on so we have a child like this this is the child [Music] but the goal is to enable these systems to learn autonomously to learn on their own what if it's just a video of these humans doing this house with their own arm can the robot just learn from from that raw video but simply watching they came into the house one of the big questions here is Kenny's learn to learn techniques scaled words not just a robot learning to interact with the objects in this lab but actually pushing it closer to the real world where the robot isn't just in one room but it's in many different environments and interacting with on a hundred objects the term that we often use when we talk about these kinds of technologies of generalization generalization means that the system can do something in a setting that is not the same as what it saw before can they examine the world in one setting and then still be effective when the setting changes systems I wouldn't say it's the learning that's the milestone and also needs to be the capability because that's something we can measure things like individual tasks like spraying a cop on to a bottle or picking up an object and place me at somewhere those are so the individual tasks and not really more high-level capabilities if you try to get a robot to do those things about necessarily making progress towards [Music] it's kind of very tempting to imagine sort of the science-fiction future we have a robot in your home that does all the things that you want that you want the robot to do that's actually a very difficult thing because your home is extremely complicated I think much sooner than that we'll start to see more area specific applications you know we already see companies that have for example robots in hotels that do basic things like delivery some of you might have seen robots on the street doing kind of the prototypes for delivery systems the other factors of this technology more so than technology have seen in the past builds on both technical developments done by engineers and experience collected by system itself so for that reason it actually makes a lot of sense that there will be this kind of gradual deployment where you first start off with some a cooperative environments not just because we need to do more coding to engineer the system to work in your home but because it needs to collect more experience but it's definitely at the stage where it needs to play more and the reason that it's running here right now the reason that but by itself without anyone attending to it is because we need to run a continuous so we need to keep collecting more experience and building up its understanding well the great thing about robots too is they you know unlike people they can't communicate over the Internet instantaneously with each other clamping it here great at making it so that like it's really rough once it actually becomes practical once you can put these things in people's homes offices hospitals they can collect experience and get better together we won't need to run an entire lifetime we can actually parallelize across all these robots and in this lab was part of why we have multiple robots because we can that way we can prototype this idea at least in small scale you feel like he actually happily they're certainly temperamental sometimes [Music]
