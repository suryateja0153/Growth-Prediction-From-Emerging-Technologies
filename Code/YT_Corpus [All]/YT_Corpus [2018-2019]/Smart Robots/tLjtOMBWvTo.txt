 let's be honest nobody really needs an i bow sony's new robot dog but i can't blame you for wanting one this robopup is the rebirth of sony's iconic dog which was put to sleep in 2006 and a tragic round of corporate cost-cutting this january i BOS coming back to the US with much better robotics and a cellular connection this puppy recognizes faces and uses artificial intelligence to learn and develop a unique personality over time just one problem this AIBO costs $2,900 how can you justify spending that much money on a not so furry friend perhaps we need some scientific comparison meet Lola Beyonce she's an actual puppy just seven weeks old from the San Francisco SPCA who's better I bow or Lola may the best pup win ok I bow costs $2,900 but that's about all Lola on the other hand costs just a hundred and seventy five bucks but she's gonna keep growing she'll need food toys vet bills boarding training and more the American Kennel Club says the average lifetime cost of a dog is twenty-three thousand four hundred and ten dollars what about brains I posed artificial intelligence learned through positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement - it knows a firm press on the backside means it's been bad bad Lolo learns this way - just with more treats AIBO comes with its own cellular connection so it can download new tricks AIBO likes belly rubs Lola does - Ivo does not have fur though maybe that would be a little too Westworld Lola sheds eye bows computer-vision likes this pink bone Lola likes putting anything in her mouth Ivo can play two hours at a time before it has to go nap on its charger Lola naps most of the day wherever I bow has some impressive moves for a robot with 22 joints and one especially lifelike tail but it still can't really chase a ball and it sounds like the Terminator when it runs Lola by comparison is an Olympic athlete Ivo would make an excellent spy it has two cameras four microphones that listen and watch constantly for your command Lola would not make a good spy i beaumont actually pee on your floor this is a simulated pee Lola well this is gonna be a journey Ivo would be better if it was also a smart speaker I bow what's the capital of Nigeria that is not the right answer Lobo would be better if she was a little more chill I pose an indoor only breed according to Sony but that means you never have to take it for a walk Lola requires regular walks but you'll get in your step count i Bo can be switched off when it gets annoying Lola is for life I bow is more fiction 'it than any toy i've ever played with Lola has the real thing robot pets may be inevitable but for now it's hard to beat Lola Beyonce even with the latest tech sorry I though
