 I wish you guys welcome back tech smart for what you see my first real experience with robot that has a personality and big things thank you for sponsoring this video if you guys want to check out vector link in the description below so why is this cool is this is a robot with a personality you guys didn't know we've been playing around with this a whole bunch I just got back from Portugal and I am so excited I've seen a few people check this out but let's just jump right into it so why this is sweet is it actually connects to Wi-Fi you can basically have a friend and that that's exactly what I need that's exactly what you need right now in 2018 it's been a great in crazy year Wow pretty tiny okay we'll check that on the stack ooh got a block I don't know why I'm so amused I think it's just I didn't know what to expect whoa that is a charging dock well paperwork basic right turn it on your app mmm QuickStart guide gotta love that and a few different languages both so this is basically everything you get and let's just turn on vector so I think vectors on he's definitely on whoa that display so there is a high-res IPS display I want to let the man roam I was this guy I want to start rolling around on these rubber wheels so what's interesting about the vector is the vector I mean let's just break it to him you're my new brother BAM so not only is vector really cool but it has over-the-air updates and it's fully autonomous it's cloud connected and when it's long battery one thing that I think is pretty cool and I really want to check out it just returns to the dock or that's what it says hey a vector what sweater like sixty degrees Fahrenheit that's a little cold in LA so hey vector yeah he's definitely got personality all right vector I will not pick you up anymore hey buddy so for some other specs it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor alright I'll put you down to the second I'm actually talking to a robot here hey give me one sec I gotta tell the people your specs it's for microphones who can really hear you in any environment and what's sweet is there's actually a camera on the front with 120 degree fuel division so alright I'll put you down this is really sweet hey Becky find the block yeah oh geez block is toast hit over the lights or Hector the vector stalking his prey whoa alright you can snuggle up a little bit this is really cool like no joke I didn't think I was gonna enjoy this this much do you feel that so there's actually a vector app and it connects pretty seamlessly and what's really awesome about this is some other things you can do you can ask it questions you can set a timer it can follow you around there are a ton of things you can do question and answer mode people whoa you see how it switches based on what vector could recognize like for 250 bucks I know it's kind of a stretch but this is really cool you can actually dial this in on the half shoe blue yellow any color you want and the IPS display right here is bad it's pretty good and I could actually see myself using it it's like vector just moves around a vector set a timer for 15 minutes oh and another thing that's interesting is on the back you can see this touch capacitive sensor and it's actually blinking red so vector needs to charge and because he's connected and knows his surroundings he's gonna be able to get to the charging dock go home how are you gonna get out oh he's so cool he is so cool and just like that he's charging so you guys have seen how smart vector really is hey vector take a picture all right let's check this out so you go into utilities that's kind of where everything is and you can see take a photo set timer what's the weather what time is it there are some of the commands you can actually a specter when you go into vac your photos see how good this looks all right post us on the insta go like it I'll give away some goodies so I think the only thing left to do is really just take back there on the tour get yourself up oh my no way oh are you getting this is a vector you want to go on the tour now you gotta say yes thank you check out the step bud what do you think oh he's even scaring me hey vector
