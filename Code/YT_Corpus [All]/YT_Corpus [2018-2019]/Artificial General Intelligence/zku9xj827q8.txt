 Hello I'm Patrick Burton and I'm joined here today by some of the leading figures in J.P. Morgan's AI team firstly Manuela Veloso who is our head of AI research recently joined us from Carnegie Mellon University where she was a professor and head of their machine learning department and alongside as Samak Chandarana our head of data analytics and a long term credit trader at J.P. Morgan welcome to you both I want to start firstly Manuela with you as you're just coming into the financial services industry why has artificial intelligence become such a key focus in this industry now well artificial intelligence is a science that can actually process data help make decisions and actuate some automation of these complete process I believe that the financial industry is a great set up to have AI make a difference within these three errors data decision-making and actuation and Samik what's the long-term vision for this at J.P.Morgan you've been a at the firm a while and this is a very new discipline so you know what's the vision for it here? Ultimately it'll always goes down to how can we make sure we are serving the client better and it all goes down to the time to impact that we think about all these technologies in the moment we have a lot of people on the applied side who are getting very close to each of the businesses working with the subject matter experts to really enhance the processes and enhance the way that we're working with clients then we're moving on to the whole optimization and and why are we doing some of these processes and let's help that let the data inform us of maybe better ways to do things and we're doing them today then ultimately fully transform the way in which are working and that's a great partnership between the Applied guys the Applied scientists Applied Research and then ultimately fundamental research as we go through tackling some of the more important problems that we're facing today Manuela not only as you come into the firm that there's a hell of a lot that you could focus on in this space how do you pick where you start you know how do you where do you start with all of this? again there is a lot of data is available in this industry and it's we start also by looking at the fact that this is about humans and interaction with clients so there is this challenging and fascinating interaction between the eventual science will do on data and the service will provide to the humans so we are going to start again with the data and with an area that we are calling this explained ability that will enable us to make whatever the machinery of AI will improve or will transform the way where we are doing it available to the humans in terms of explaining why is the case that the AI machinery does that so we start with this human AI interaction as the overall kind of method that we are going to focus on and something that would just add to this point is we start off with the data there's a lot of work being done on the ethics of data data and whether or not we can use some of the data in the ways that we use it or can we make sure the machines are trained in a way that you know to minimize that weren't bias yeah you're gonna be spending some time on that as well are you yes we are going to actually have these explained ability and a lot of like understanding of ethics of doing AI and making sure that in fact values human values are covered within the techniques we do and that goes through using data there is unbiased as much as possible and being in control of these ethics and values of the data yeah and something you then have to take a lot of this work and apply it to say the client experience how does that interaction between the research and the applicability work so again goes down to that point we were talking about earlier which is we have people who are very on the applied side working with the businesses working with the subject matter experts coming up with the problem statements these are people who understand the techniques to a certain degree but understand work with the clients to understand the problem statement then we go through the full of data iteration point and then we work with Manuela steam and with Lydia's team on the applied research side to really bring the techniques to the fore to create a better client experience to create better workflows to actually you know to use a word augmented intelligence make our people a little bit better with the information around them and make them more efficient in their day jobs now I know that partnerships with universities are very important and due to both of you why why are those partnerships Samik so important in this process but I think you do we can go down the traditional route of talking about the talent and that's incredibly important but really with the academic institutions provide a whole raft of people who are extremely talented and you know have a freedom in the way that they research they can tackle a significant wider range of topics than we can never do internally so if we marry that with our internal data our real practical problem problems that we're trying to solve that can actually be a really powerful combination and if you look at projects like ROAR that we have and ROAR is our real-time prediction using a secure multi-party computing and cryptography and things like this these areas that academia is spending a huge amount of time on and something that we can leverage off and partner with really really well and obviously the epitome of that in partnership with it I could be being Manuela who actually joined the firm it sounds like there's a much more experimental element to some of the projects you're working on you know can we learn something as an industry from from academia in terms of how to approach those things and and whether things fail or not or yeah so so in in academia we actually try to teach the students to do research among us and with the student in very with a lot of freedom but on the eye hand we do lack the actual real data so this combination of academia and industry will enable eventually the people of in this industry to to buy us and to drive problems in universities and we try to eventually use the freedom we have in the talent to contribute to novel solutions novel ways of thinking the problems of the industry and just to add on that point you mentioned that word failure because of that great degree of freedom within universities not every project will come to fruition this is part of the culture we want to instill at JP whilst we will attack a lot of problems we won't succeed on them all just let's make sure we learn from them as we go along and that's what will enable us to be better in the future so let me actually say that nothing in research is actually a failure eventually it's always the discovery of something you know any PhD thesis any senior project any master thesis any will produce something that may be not exactly what we were looking for but it's certainly something novel and in the AI research also at J.P. Morgan we are actually aiming at providing solutions there are more Universal than the problems we are addressing internally in connection with some extreme to solve real problems at the bank we want to contribute a new way new ways of doing things in general and solving problems more general like like we were saying the data kind of solving the problem of resolving the conflicts between data the handling the scale of the data the privacy of the data or handling the problem of explaining decisions be them driven by reinforcement learning or other types of data in general so we are driven by problems we have the real data but eventually these will be open to other communities like ROAR its predictions of any type of quantity and so it's a very beautiful and powerful contribution to be able to have an AI Research Center at JP Morgan to be able to make such broad contributions that become platforms for other people to to to develop their own industries and there aren't kind of like directions of business now you mentioned roar and and and I know some ik we're already quite a long way down this path or already what are the projects right now that you're most excited about perhaps that they've just launched or you for the future so it's mentioned Roy's probably tops the list of a lot of exciting ones but if you look at what we're doing internally at the firm the work we're doing around the intelligent pricing is incredibly exciting there you know we're only using techniques such as reinforcement learning which is showing itself as a very applicable technique within that within that world and we've got some things already in production in equities and we're looking at some of the other asset classes the work we're doing about the virtual assistants a lot of people think about virtual assistants and think about it as just the bot that answers a specific query but if you look at the way that we're now attacking it using the all the techniques within the NLP the voice-to-text and everything else we are working with or last subject matter experts to improve process improve that client connectivity right how do we make reconciliations better because we have email traffic that we can classify better how do we make sure that the client gets it to settlement query answered quicker than they would have done otherwise things like that are having real effect and then we go to the JPM topic of personalization personalization is something we're all very used to in our they day lives and all the websites we interact with now JPMM has that version of personalization on it which is a product of the TR collective teams and then we go through things like document classifiers and news analytics or and things like that which are all products that we are going to be putting out there that the community can use to actually help them out and if you go to things like news analytics it's something very natural that we'd all talk about in care that can be used in everything from kyc where it could be a trigger to think about how we reassess a client all the way through to informing trading decisions so it's got vast array of application and also let me add to this the fact that these types of projects going on have an underlying aspect of trying to merge information from multiple sources of different modalities be it like actually numerical data with the from the news like weather data all event data and that's like a challenge also for AI technology to make sure that all these different types of like information is now being used to assist better our clients so and they may not by the sounds of it necessarily be completely aware that AI is behind some of the things that to help them is there you mentioned ethics earlier is there a question of privacy and so on how do you think about that those kind of issues so I don't think that there will be anything heathen in the sense that they will in fact you know every client will be aware that it's like interacting with machinery with computing with AI now what we want is for the clients to be able and for the people that use the technology to be able to ask what if I do this what if I do that why did this happen what could have done differently it's all these interaction with eventually some software that will be able to provide those answers so we are going to actually in as opposed make it much more open than hidden so that people can actually experiment and interact in a in a way that enables them to check the values to check the explanation to check the privacy to check the the actual the all the aspects of which data was used and the sensitivity to the data we want to make it like an experience that people interact with a machine with AI in a very natural and very kind of open way there's a great deal of knowledge in the way that you know people are interacting with these machines you know this why we have subject matter experts involved all the way through and this is why we keep using that term augmented intelligence it's really important that there is as seamless as possible because you know we're a long way from the machines being able to do the full 100% and quite frankly in my head I don't think we'll ever get there because there is there we talk about complex human beings dealing with complex problems and so the whole thing can be married together really really well and this technology is incredibly exciting within that regard and for example just to add whether it's there or not doesn't matter but just to where the fact that also in my research you know during all these years we kind of like push this idea of symbiotic autonomy in which there is a symbiosis between the humans and the machines not just in terms of like the the chin always helping the human but agent can also ask for help itself I cannot handle this particular situation it's your turn so this is a very beautiful concept that machines and humans will work in symbioses from both directions not just eventually being there kind of like providing just complementarity no they can ask for help and that was also a major thing we've done in my research which was like you know autonomous robots asking for help from humans on things that they were not capable of doing we expect our AI agents within the actual applications of the bank to also from time to time invoking help from humans on things that they don't want to make decisions not informed or they don't know the values that should be applied in particular instances so we are going to have this type of like symbiosis with AI and humans now I know you're both looking to build your teams which requires hiring and what kind of person are you looking for to join the teams so we are looking for people that are actually excited about these automation about data about decision-making about interaction with humans very interpretable very ethical interaction with humans so we are hoping for people of that nature and people with a vision we want people that care about then the underlying technologies the mathematics the statistics the search the representation the the understanding of all these ethics all these values all these underlying technologies so we are looking for people in with the underlying technology expertise and also the vision that enables them to build something bigger then eventually what exists now my way I'd express that is people who are just genuinely inquisitive and you know we have a number of different roles that you'll see out there that I think really marry traditional quantitative the commercialization of AI and that's really a really really important and you know we need people who are going to really ask all the questions about the processes we do about what we do what our people do in their day jobs to you know eventually enhance what we do but it's also getting your hands dirty on the raw so I roll material side of things how do we interact with the data how do we make that data into a usable asset for us so it's all the way from engineering all the way through to advanced application okay I mean some sense just to also so you have to understand that we want people that really are very familiar with computing and very familiar with the actual use of computer technology so we want people that are digital in their thinking okay well with that we should leave it there Manuela Samik thank you for your insights you
