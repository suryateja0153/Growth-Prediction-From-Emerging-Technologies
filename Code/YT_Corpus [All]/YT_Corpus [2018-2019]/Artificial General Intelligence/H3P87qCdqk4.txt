 Artificial intelligence is here whether we like it or not artificial intelligence machine learning Robots, it's exciting and also very frightening some of the biggest names in science and technology warned about the dangers of using artificial intelligence to make weapons This is really like the scariest problem for me, that's where you need The regulator's come in and say hey guys, you'll be to pause and make sure this is safe Artificial intelligence as the potential to solve all of the most difficult problems of today and tomorrow AI will impact everything there's nothing it won't touch it is a Renaissance it is a golden age We're about to let people be more than they could by themselves. What do we want to use AI for? To solve problems and to be more prosperous and to be healthy that has to be its purpose With artificial intelligence the computers start to learn to think to rewrite to design their own programs Hey, I can give us the ability to hear better to see better to give us new capacities that we never had before You can pair a human doctor plus an artificial intelligence system To create new drugs that humans in a lab might not have considered before You could see incredible Expansion in lifetimes this all sounds very Star Trek but to believe me that's gonna happen The question is are we going to be smart enough to make choices as to what we want as a society Scientists are creating AI today and setting the course for a new tomorrow How a AI changes our lives now and in the future is up to us We're at this fork in the road where if we get things right with AI we can help life flourish like never before And really bring out the best of us This is a I Presented by IBM Many people think of intelligence is something mysterious that can only exist in biological organisms like humans Artificial intelligence has actually been part of our lives without us really even realizing can you really elicit intelligent behavior? By machines things like being able to learn being able to reason there is no Definition. This is artificial intelligence It's really a set of practices and pieces that people put together is what is AI? I think we should define it simply as the ability to accomplish complex goals So artificial intelligence is simply intelligence. That's not biological Artificial intelligence has many definitions, but at its core when machines display the ability to see/hear Understand and learn about the world like we do They're considered artificially intelligent By the words coming out of my body an understanding language is one of the biggest challenges in creating smart machines From the Star Trek computer the next hatchway on your right. Thank you. You're welcome commander Riker To Samantha and her the machines of our sci-fi world's communicate effortlessly with us Yes, Samantha To myself actually But getting machines to understand our human language is one of the hardest tasks in artificial intelligence today Languages are nuanced and complicated and present difficulties for computers that are used to fixed rules Language can also be easily misinterpreted Take the famous Groucho Marx quote To actually understand what is being said is really really hard for a computer to do What we try to solve through the field of natural language processing is to start cracking What does he mean when we use these words in sentences how our sentence is related to one another? Is this word close to this other word and why? So that is a field that for us is so easy is very hard for computers to do A little over three years ago the folks at IBM came to us with a proposal that they considered to be the next grand challenge in computing and that was designing a computer system that could understand the complexities of Natural language well enough to compete against Jeopardy's best players one of the first major breakthroughs in natural language processing Came when IBM developed an AI named Watson to take on the television game show Jeopardy Watson didn't come out of the box ready for primetime. Yell Barracuda. Everybody says, huh what you yell shark You've got a panic on our hands is said in this film Watson what is the fourth of July? No what? Max, what is Jaws? Thank you The IBM team took years developing refining and training the system including months of practice matches on a mock sect founded in 1789 to this Washington DC school was the USA's first Catholic College Sorry, I'm stoked To make Watson a contender the IBM team armed the system with advanced math called algorithms and powerful AI technologies like machine learning in February 2011 It was time for Watson's TV debut to show the world what it had learned Even a broken one of the on your wall is Right twice a day Watson tries to understand the question by breaking it down into different parts of speech It then does a broad sweep of the millions of books articles and documents that cover the wide? Variety of jeopardy topics to come up with thousands of possible answers Watson then collects analyzes and ways evidence from all the material to narrow down these possibilities Thousands of different algorithms work together to score the evidence for each possible answer Then Watson ranks the remaining possibilities by its confidence in those answers all this happens almost instantaneously Watson what is clock clock is correct? What is Christchurch? Who is Leo Tolstoy? Yes, who is Henry the eighth? Yes, what is narcolepsy you are right again then with that you move to 36,000 In a watershed moment Watson took on and defeated the world's two top jeopardy players who is Stoker. I for one welcome our new computer The team at IBM knew this technology could do far more than win game shows Watson on Jeopardy was just the beginning This technology could be unleashed on some of the world's most difficult problems by helping industries that are flooded with data If that was possible, what else could we do? IBM researchers got an email asking us. What should be the next ran challenge and At some point I came up with this notion of developing a machine that will be able to debate humans in a meaningful manner to push natural language understanding to an unprecedented level IBM scientists in Tel Aviv Israel are creating an AI system that can help us make decisions through the field of debate This team has never before attempted to build an AI system so complex when you make decisions You're probably debating about something, right? So a computer system that can actually quickly read millions of articles and then pinpoint what's Pro and what's gone It's going to help you make decisions The history of debating can be traced back to the ancient Greeks It was often used to help solve complex ethical issues in its simplest form a Proposition is posed by a moderator Each side has an opening argument a rebuttal and a closing argument all of which must be presented in an allotted time a Debater must have critical thinking skills and broad knowledge on a variety of topics In a good debate the opponents might also use humor to create a persuasive argument. I Will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am NOT going to exploit for political purposes my opponents youth and inexperience The range of potential construction of debate arguments is quite simply infinite There are so many decisions that have to be done to construct a succinctness Original and that is able to be responsive to what an opponent presents and then in the end to be able to net out all the arguments that you made as a closing arguments all This when you peel down the layers push the envelope of what computers can do on every single front The computer can read hundreds of millions of articles in seconds But it needs to be able to pinpoint exactly the relevant 1000 words of two thousand words to debate humans For computer is very difficult to understand the question and for humans. It's exactly the opposite We typically understand the question very quickly. We simply don't have enough memory in order to pull out all the relevant answers We are so used as people to understand language. We're not even aware of how difficult this is for us It's very clear how to build an argument how to connect things to each other when we try to teach a computer to understand language But we have our building blocks We can teach a computer system to understand parts of speech we can teach it to identify concepts and by that perhaps identify Similarities between concepts and then similarities between sentences, but you really have to tell the system in a way how to glue things together smart For the last year and a half The IBM debater team has held internal live debates to test the system's progress the debates You are about to see have never been shown on television I Hope that you will enjoy listening and watching full life debates between a fully automatic system and expert human debaters So have fun Our motion for the first round as you can see behind me is whether or not we should legalize sports beddings all of these topics that the Bader system has not Seen in the past and we're not part of its training and the only input is that topic on the side supporting legalization We have our very own ibn debater and on the side objecting to it. We have the lovely kaya idler So I give you I be on the baby Greetings hire so nice to meet again I hope that today I will do better than the last time I faced your convincing Arguments or at least that you will show some mercy Once debater is given a topic it first tries to comprehend the meaning of that topic Debater then scans hundreds of millions of articles to pinpoint potential Arguments that can be used to construct a 4-minute defense of its position debater. Does this by using unique natural language processing? Machine learning and reasoning techniques to understand the underlying themes of the debate and to arrange its arguments effectively and convincingly I would suggest we should legalize sports betting are we entitled to decide for people how to behave or are people entitled to decide on their actions as they choose to The purpose of legislation is not to define morality or teach ethics The question put to us by IBM debater is are we entitled to choose how other people behave and the answer is yes first of all when the person's ability to make an informed rational decision has been impaired and second of all when there's a Concrete and measurable harm to others a debater needs to listen to the opponent for four minutes Not for a single sentence The opponent is talking fast making complex arguments raising ethical considerations and the system means Somehow to understand the gist of that and to come up with a proper response After presenting its initial argument Debater listens to a counter-argument and then builds its rebuttal based on what it's heard Hyah suggested that we have an obligation to protect our citizens I would like to offer a different view We oppose using the excuse of protecting citizens to justify the limiting of freedom and of lifestyle choices Getting involved in someone else's decision-making when it concerns his own personal situation infringes on Beck person's rights The problem is that when it comes to betting the only time you're making a rational choice is the first time you place a bet And then people keep placing bets but they're not making rational choices anymore because of the nature of addiction and that's where a government has To step in and say this is dangerous for you I think we all agree that sports betting has negative effects it often involves exploiting the weak But the best way to help the weak is not by telling them what not to do but rather by changing the environment And conditions around them Therefore I believe the motion should stand we should legalize sports betting After the debate audience members vote to determine the winner So IBM debater was able to increase support by 10% and higher was able to increase support by 12% Nearly a tie The computer is getting better every time I debate against it I think the first time it felt sort of like I was much better than it but it's getting better. It's learning how to Use its points in order to convince people that it's right I've been in debating for about 16 years now since I was in high school and they coach debaters But then you see a machine that's doing the same job and it's learning each time it gets better I think it's magic what it's doing. It's incredible Although currently debating at a high school level Project debater stands to impact industries far beyond the debate podium We're moving from search to research because when you search you want to get documents relevant to your search topic And we're trying to help you research topic in the sense of going one layer deeper into that So when you start the topic you get a list and when you research a topic in the sense that we're talking about You get pro and con arguments for the topic? It can be applied to Anything that has to do with decision making you can imagine all sorts of business decisions or if you are a lawyer or a litigator and you're trying to construct an argument every kind of decision where you want to have pro and con arguments we would benefit from Debating technologies these technologies really focused on questions That do not have a clear factual answer most of the questions that we encounter in life are questions like that So I think we are touching at something which is really fundamental to our daily life And therefore we anticipate it's going to have many different applications Five years ago, I think no I'm had like one slide saying What would be the next cool thing for IBM to do? Why don't we develop something that debates which sounded to be frank impossible? I think I wanted to do something that would make a difference and Then gradually it grew this is a very non-standard experience sometimes you know, discussing moral and ethical issues and Discussing highly controversial issues. So without further ado I give you I BN debater, please enjoy the show Greetings. Hi. So nice to meet again. I hope that today I will do better than the last time I faced your convincing arguments I believe it. We should legalize sports betting the purpose of legislation is not to define morality or teach ethics I think that technology does and can continue to improve plan An AI system that can construct compelling arguments could change the way we make decisions as a society But what about split-second decisions when human lives are at stake? What happens when AI gets behind the wheel? Hey, I once belonged to the realm of science fiction But it's here. It's real and it seems to be everywhere AI is being used to translate the complex language of dolphins a real life Robocop recently joined the Dubai police force and Ford's Pizza robot could deliver your next meal But few innovations have been as eagerly anticipated as the driverless car Fb-22 tower we're heading for Chicago, please route us through Automatic control hands-off steering mind if I smoke cigars that was just wonderful air conditioning Cars that drive themselves have been a fixture in our collective imagination for decades From Knight Riders Pontiac to the autonomous outtie in iRobot I'm driving by hands, but how close are we to a driverless reality? One of the big applications of AI that almost everyone knows about already is the self-driving car That will have a massive impact But people should understand that it hasn't happened yet Despite seeing Google test vehicles out on the road or hearing about Tesla's autonomous mode The first self-driving car was in 1987 So they've been able drive themselves a long time but it takes a lot of stuff together to really work in the real world and how We get there from here is a very complex question And I think the more immediate question is how are these self-driving cars going to operate in the messy world that people operate in? The reason why we're not there yet is that driving is difficult Driving in ordinary regular conditions where nothing weird is going on That's the sole problem but dealing with difficult conditions where it's dark. It's raining It's tricky for humans and it's beyond the capabilities of our AI systems at present We have 35,000 deaths in cars and us every year Ultimately, I think it's important that we get stupid people like me out of controlling a few thousand pounds of metal moving at high velocities AI in the real world works when it doesn't matter if it fails If you look at that Roomba it often makes mistakes it bashes into the same thing three times in a row That momentary failure doesn't matter in the long term of the task. It does matter if your car bashes into the same Wall three times, that's not gonna work. It's got to work perfectly. When it it's a big mess with your you inside it Autonomous cars were primarily driven on test tracks But in the last few years companies like way Moe Tesla and Cruz have taken to the open road These pilot programs have successfully logged millions of miles to improve their performance but several recent fatal crashes have raised concerns about the reliability of the Technology uber today put the brakes on all road testing of its self-driving cars after a deadly accident Self-driving cars are technically possible, but I think it will take time The alternative is us drive around and millions and millions of people dying Safety is the most important aspect of this technology without a doubt The most important elements that a consumer cares about are very instinctual Is this car seeing the things that I'm seeing and is this car? Acting in the way that I would act based upon the things that it's seeing Those are the simple questions that consumers need to feel really comfortable Before they'll accept this technology The artificial intelligence used in a self-driving car helped answer the question, what do I see that's called perception It's taking all those images and figuring out what are the objects What are the lanes etc that are there? the other thing it needs to do is to figure out how those objects are moving and that's called predictions and Then the chorus tasks itself based on that and based on where I want to end up. Where do I go? And that's planning Some other challenges that self-driving cars have is around understanding social context that we take for granted so if you see some kids on the side of the road and that they're playing soccer you Understand that the ball may go into the street but the robot just sees people hitting a circular object now over time systems get better by learning and this is one of the biggest Advances in artificial intelligence is deep learning so that it recognizes Oh that ball may come on the street But it needs to see lots of scenarios and needs to react to those and then humans can help. It's a that's right No, that's wrong And it will learn over time similar to how a new sixteen year old gets their license and they learn over time as well With a eyes present ability to learn from experience and over eighty billion dollars invested in the technology Driverless cars could populate the streets of tomorrow in little over a decade Researchers estimate that one out of four cars will be driverless in 2030 Shared car fleets are predicted to reduce the number of cars on the road allowing for the transformation of our city escapes We're going to be able to redesign our streets so that they can accommodate all modes of transportation bicycles Walker's less cars There are approximately 700 million parking spaces in the u.s over six thousand square miles the size of the state of Connecticut 14% of cities today is parking so we can reclaim that parking and change it into parks change it into residences When I look at my seven-year-old he is not interested in owning a car He's interested in going into an autonomous car and I'm hopeful That nine years from now when that seven-year-old is 16 years old that we're gonna have this in place The future safety and reliability of driverless cars depends on how well a I can learn but how does it learn The answer is called machine learning and it's behind many of today's greatest advances in AI from mastering the game of space invaders to space exploration
