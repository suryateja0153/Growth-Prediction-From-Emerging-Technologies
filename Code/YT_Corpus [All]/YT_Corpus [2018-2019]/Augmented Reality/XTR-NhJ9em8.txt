 My name is Gemma O'Brien and I'm an illustrator, artist and designer from Sydney Australia I work a lot with lettering and typography and merging that with the illustration My work ranges from commercial projects to gallery projects and more recently a lot of large-scale, hand-painted murals My name is Craig Winslow I'm an experiential designer and I do a lot of projection mapping work I was asked by Lightform to come out and do a collaboration with Gemma O'Brien and bring to life a mural When Lightform contacted me, I'd heard the word "projection mapping" but when I looked at more creative applications, I was blown away as to what can be done When I first saw projection mapping and got excited about it you'd see all these large buildings crumbling I'm more interested in using projection as a way of augmented reality You're literally layering light as a digital, physical medium onto a physical surface We’re in a time where there’s so many new technologies and once artists get their hands on technology and are able to experiment, that's when you can really start to see how it can connect with people in a way that’s meaningful and interesting and exciting The world is your canvas now, so what are you going to do with that?
