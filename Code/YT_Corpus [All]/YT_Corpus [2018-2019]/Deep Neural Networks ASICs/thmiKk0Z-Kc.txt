  Hi, I'm David Shaw. Welcome to the weekly edition of AI News. Today, we'll explore how Intel and Microsoft enable AI Interfaces at The Edge with Intel Movidius Vision Processing Units on Windows ML. Microsoft recently announced Windows ML, an update to Windows 10 that enables developers to perform machine learning tasks. The Intel VPU, a purpose-built chip for accelerating AI workloads at The Edge, will allow developers to build and deploy the next generation of deep neural network applications on Windows. Combining Windows ML with the Intel VPU has the potential to enable more intelligent applications in CoreOS features. Some of these include-- personal assistance, enhanced biometric security, smart music, and even photo search and recognition. Read more at the links provided.
