 hello world it's Suraj and supply chains I know it doesn't sound like the sexiest word ever but it is a very very important industry that AI can be applied to and improves greatly there's a huge potential there in this video we're going to improve the revenue streams for a simulated company using this logistics wizard that iBM has provided what this is is is it's an example of how a I can be used to optimize the supply chain for some distribution company so for those of you who don't know a supply chain is the process of taking of taking an item from raw materials into a finished product and there's a lot of middlemen along the way so anything you order on Amazon Prime for it to go from from where it is to you all of that is the supply chain and there are distributors there are you know drivers all sorts of different middlemen in the middle and the weather affects the price of the shipment there's all of these variables and this is a perfect perfect example of how a I can be used to to make a process more efficient and so what this is is it's a simulated demo of a global logistics company and what they do is they ship products they've got three distribution centers five active strip mints one has been completed and four retail centers this is where the product is actually sold to consumers and what we can do is we can simulate a storm using this button so I'll hit simulate storm and what's gonna happen is it's gonna simulate a storm it's a snow storm it's a moderately severe snow storm and what happened because of this storm because of this storm we have had supply shortages in these two cities from Salt Lake to Raleigh and from Salt Lake to Boston and I can either approve these or I can deny these I'll say approve for the first one and reject the second one and what this is gonna do to my bottom line as let's say I'm the CEO of this company is it's going to either increase my revenue or lose it okay so that's the demo and we're going to look at that at the end I'm also gonna explain the like the technical details of what's happening behind the hood here how it's doing that but you know high level if you just want to try it out without like having to code or looking at the technical details this IBM demo link in the description is perfect for you anyway so right so like I said the supply chain is that network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product and the supply chain represents the steps it takes to get that product to the consumer so we can see this nice little infographic we have the start which is a factory and this person or robot then the forecasts ideally using AI right now it's done mostly using humans in forecasted demand how many people are going to want this product and based on that forecast they will create enough product from raw material to meet that demand and then they're going to allocate all of that onto these trucks they're going to optimize the routes without these trucks take to get to the consumer they're gonna sort all of those finished products in those boxes in the distribution factory and then send them to the retail center and hopefully hopefully more customers buy the product there is actually profit right hopefully there is profit after this giant process and it's a very long and complicated process to go through right I mean there's there's so many middlemen here but the problem is that what if the consumer doesn't like it right ideally you want to cut your losses as a business and right now there are people consulting firms agencies that companies hire to do this and they're very very expensive companies lose a lot of money due to the supply chain and if you as a small start-up can save any company even 5% on their transportation costs because you're using AI to optimize the ideal time that they should send this shipment factoring in the weather conditions factoring in consumer demand factoring in whatever it is if you can show to them that you can do that not only is that a big deal you will get paid so much money there is so much money to be made in the supply chain okay I've been I've been researching this store so there's a lot of money seriously this AI for business series me basically being like how can they have the applies to this oh my god this what am I doing with my life I didn't know but anyway I want you guys to make money you know what I'm saying like we're a crew we're homies you know you guys make money I get happy that's just how it works and I've got my paid course in book sales and ad revenue and patreon and speaking deals and other things that I do for revenue so with that someone said in the last video like show a little glimpse of the real Suraj so I'm showing you that also one more glimpse of the real Suraj I'm in New York right now in my makeshift studio and I'm here for this crypto Award thing which I thought like should I even go to that but I'm I'm here because like it's cool I went to this cosmos party last night cosmos is a really cool blockchain network there they're one of the few that I actually like what they helped me make Suraj coin back in you know a few days ago which not a few days a few weeks ago months even which I don't think it worked out because people took it the wrong way but the point is that they're they're pretty cool and anyway so yeah it's good to be in New York anyway so the supply chain there's a lot of components there right there's requirements planning sourcing manufacturing all of these requirements and right now this in in this in this infographic here you're seeing artificial intelligence all of that is done by humans I mean seriously this is a very old industry right this is like as old as products themselves have been and no one has even thought about applying AI to it until the past five or six years ago right because that's when deep learning really starts I'd like to to come into the mainstream the other reason is because there's so much data right these suppliers manufacturers distributors they have so much data I have a sample data set for you right here to take a look at okay this is just a very small example that I found them from Bozek data gov and its supply chain shipping pricing data okay so they have some project code and this is like real world data like it's it's not pretty it looks ugly you're like what is this what am I looking at what am I even trying to do here if you're if that's the case then you're looking at some really real real world data cuz that's how it looks it's our job as data scientists to find the needle in the haystack to find the the three keys in the simulation as a ready player one with it in that movie that's how it was so um anyway so we've got country these are all features and whoa okay so let's let's think through this for a second let's say this is our data set right like scheduled delivery dates clients okay Wow okay sub-classification okay there's there's a label that we could potentially use you know all of these different things okay so there's there's quite a lot of features here but remember if this can easily be a supervised learning problem where we have a label and then we have the input data right so all we have to do is we have to decide what that label is going to be right it could be you know what is the we want to predict what the weight is going to be we want to predict what the fright cost is going to be given all of these other conditions let's say it's that we want to predict what the cost is going to be given all of these other features okay so we can easily do that with scikit-learn right we split the training data into this is the X and here's the Y the Y is the cost the X is everything else and what this is going to come out to is a giant matrix right where all of these values right here are gonna constitute a single data point which is a single matrix right value 1 comma value 2 comma by value 3 comma but notice how some of these are dates some of these are strings some of these are numbers what we want to do first is to regularize all of this data so it's all numerical right and we'll just once it's all numbers right then we can feed it to the neural network or whatever whatever we're going to use probably a neural network because that's the best for sure so once we do that and so we have the input data we have two labels and we're predicting the mapping remember it's all about predicting that mapping and once we've predicted that mapping after a sufficient number of data points then we'll say you know what let's say I'm going to deliver it on and you say some date in the future you say ok on this day and with this kind of client with this what's the price gonna be and it's gonna tell you based on everything else here's the likely cost and it's gonna cost you okay so but I think a good way to do this that's one way I mean notice there's so many things we could predict right we could predict the the class label that is gonna be it was gonna be an HIV test is gonna be pediatric that won't necessarily be good for us but we could do that but what I think would be the most efficient would be time series forecasting right on what date should I send out this shipment such that the price is going to be the lowest so that is considered time series forecasting and notice how many features there are we could not draft this alone this data said just like this we would have to reduce the dimensionality of this data set right using a technique like t-sne or pca right which is principal component analysis both of those those techniques I have videos on so search Siraj pca Siraj t - SN e and then once we do that then it's gonna be a two-dimensional graph where it's going to be one dimension it's going to be everything all the features the other dimension is gonna be the time right every single day of the month and the year and it's going to plot out what that looks like okay and so what we want to do is we want to find that lowest point and what we can do is once we graph that out we can see what that lowest point is and then we could say well this is the optimal point right here so that's another way up we can do this but if we're trying to figure out the best date to ship something based on the weather pattern that's easily a time series forecasting problem which we can do with chaos which I'll show you at the end of this video but anyway so that's that's a that's a little bit of a data set spiel for you anyway but the problem with supply chains and there is a big problem is that there are there are these silos right there are silos it's it's not easy to just say I'm gonna make an AI startup give me your supply chain like it's like one big data set it's not always you know they're they're different companies that deal with all these things that require armies of expensive planners and they usually run complex engines at each step of the process and at each node in the supply network so they're missing out on these huge opportunities because they're locally optimized for their own you know their own little silo but if someone could get an overhead view of all of the data you could optimize the F out of everything which is awesome right so that's what we want to do we want to get that huge end-to-end data set of the entire supply chain and so if we look at you know people were were surveyed companies were surveyed what the the most costly outcomes were for for their supply chains and most people said margin erosion and the second one was sudden and change which is also a big one right so suddenly people don't want the product or suddenly you know the margin is the margin has eroded or whatever it is but which I assume is like that the product margin like let's say the cost of the raw materials went up for some reason like oil for example because of political reasons or whatever what you what have you but that's a huge deal as well and you can predict all these things you can predict that a product's gonna fail you can predict that there's gonna be a disruption in the product full flow all of this if you pass sufficient data you can predict these things this is a superpower and think about it most of these companies they don't know they don't know that anything about this you know you are literally watching a video on supply chain applied to AR so there's a lot of opportunity in this space so supply chains have a lot of data and it's all sorts of data its transactional data it's time phase data it's GPS mapping numbers that strings text dates there's a lot and we have to regularize all this data so it's in the same numerical format and then we could feed it to a machine learning model but they've got so much data and the AI should not be a black box right whenever you have a client a company a distributor distributor you've got to be able to explain to them why you made a certain decision and the best way to do that is to visualize that data right to show them here is why here here's the point here's the you know here's the minima minimum that I found here's a gradient you know things like that you have to say the word gradient but you have to show them visually how you came to your conclusion that's one way another way is I mean depending on the type of neural network you have if it's a convolutional network you could show them the features inside you could say like well here's the abstractions that it's built there's a lot of different ways but the point is that you should be able to explain your findings so what are the different ways that AI can solve this problem right so I mean there's so many different ways that AI could potentially solve this problem and if you think about it it what's really exciting is 13 percent of companies only 13 percent that were served that were surveyed by Forrester said that the supply chain was where the focus of AI was internally which is huge right it's going everywhere else marketing sales other areas but it's such a it's there's so much data there in that field and there's so much potential for increasing revenue right by streamlining and optimizing the whole the whole process so it's a huge opportunity for startups and so if you think about it the supply chain all the people who are planning it the drivers for the cars the people who are unpacking boxes who are checking for quality all these things every single part of that can be optimized can be automated and if you think about the Internet of Things and mike drop blockchain we can create a fully fully fully autonomous system your end-to-end autonomous no humans needed that can be self-aware self-governing and self determining they don't add to that self optimizing right it just gets better and better over time so and the reason I said blockchain is because right now we trust middlemen with saying that a package was sent from point A to point B and we have to pay those middlemen but ideally we could use some kind of immutable ledger blockchain that nobody controls and say and every time a shipment is sent it's time stamped onto that blockchain and then we can say hey oh it was there right this is when it happened it's on this blockchain it's immutable nobody modified it I don't have to trust anybody so that's how blockchain can be used here as well time sending shipments and when they happen and when you know different actions occur it's a publicly verifiable way so what are what are startups that have actually done this so one idea where I ways that AI can be applied to this industry right and I'll talk about startups inside of this so one is chatbots for procurement right so whenever you have someone who is running some kind of company they can say hey I want to be able to access you know this this could be like some data that they need for the supply chain or whatever and the chat bot can give them that data it can pull it from the data set and say here it is they can also say you can also ask it like if I were to do this what would be the likely outcome it can make predictions using a pre-trained model in the background so one company that is doing this is chime BOTS so what chime bot is doing is they are acting as a chat bot interface for these suppliers right so basically you know they're they're making this chat bot for different industries but procurement is one of them and they can ask these questions which is super useful because a chat bot is 24/7 it doesn't need sleep you don't need to pay it you know a lot like as much as a human and it's it's a very optimized idea so another one is supply chain planning which is what we're gonna do right so how could an AI be used to help forecast the inventory how much you need planning demand supply these these kind of things ai is perfectly suited for that clear metal is one startup that is doing that right now right supply chain visibility making predictive alerting and collaboration possible check them out and by the way I want to say that none of these startups should dissuade you from doing something in this field there's a huge opportunity there's a huge space there's a lot to share and these are just this is just an example for you to look at and say this is possible machine learning for warehouse management right if you think about who is in control of the warehouse it's a human need to make sure that the robots are in order that you know this person is getting paid etc and there's a lot for a human to keep in mind this is this a huge job and AI can definitely help that human or even replace that human in that job Rubick cloud is a good example of intelligent decision autumn is automation definitely check that one out autonomous vehicle is that one sounds like an obvious one but Google way mo you know Hoover a drive out AI comment on AI there's a bunch of potential in this space to create self-driving transports that can you know automate the driving process a portion of the supply chain and also you don't have to make a capital intensive car or truck to to make a self-driving startup you can make software for them you can make you can you can collect data aggregate data you can create better mapping software etc there's a lot of potential there as well natural language processing is another one right so the data that we're looking at is very you know it's hard to read right there's so many different features item description delivered to client data etc ideally we could use natural language processing to interpret all of this data and then create a simple Q&A system where we could just ask this ask our data set what is this and it would just find it exactly what we need and just tell us that exact day like what was the vendor iin CEO term on the fifth of November right something like that like an NLP natural language interface where we can use plain English to ask it questions and things like that data log do is doing that death taxes and data preparation you're on your own for death and taxes but we've got you covered for data preparation I love that great great little slogan so last one is predictive analytics for supplier selection right as you can see it's very complicated there's a lot of potential decisions that a human has to make here any time you can offload a very hard decision to a machine you are you've you've done something very good for society right so supplier selection who is the best supplier who's gonna be the you know optimal choice for different you know actions that you would perform in the supply chain great example of AI so to get to this logistics wizard that I was talking about earlier so IBM has this service called bluemix and bluemix is using their AI watson to do a bunch of different tasks so in this case the tasks for looking at is called the logistics wizard and what that does is it's using an AI to create the simulated environments for this global retail distribution company and simulate bad weather and so what we can do is we can track that bad weather we can trap our shipments we can see what's going wrong what's going right and it will tell us those things and it's using an AI to make prediction so what we can get into the details of you know all the different things this can do but this is like a you know ready ready to go solution and what you can do is you can actually use this in your tool set for another company right because there is an overhead to even having to look at this well you can say is it like a plain English direction like here is the best thing to do based on my data my analytics so you can actually use this for a company you can use this in unison with other models Karos tensorflow hi torch build your own models try out different models for different use cases and just have all of those in your tool sets to to use as predictive power for your client now there are different ways to build a model if we look at this right it depends on what we're trying to predict right if we're trying to predict the label or if the shipment mode the fulfillment dates the scheduled date what the price what are we trying to predict here right and that column is gonna be our label everything else is gonna be our input data right which usually in my videos is just one single column but sometimes it could be multiple columns right and that's a lot harder to think about but really it's just one giant matrix we don't actually have to think about like how the mapping is working we just know that it's gonna learn that mapping that's really the key it's going to learn the mapping between one or more columns X you know X values and the label which is whatever we're trying to predict the price the time etc and so what I want to do right now is I want to do a little bit of pseudocode just so you could get an idea of what I'm talking about here so let's let's let's see what we want to do is we want to predict the let's say the price we want to predict the price of a shipment given all the other variables and what we've done is we we have our data set here we have our price as well see here's a the fright cost in USD and let's assume were we've gathered weather data we've gathered even stock data whatever kind of data and we put them all in two columns in our giant data set and we want to predict the price and so because time is involved here their dates involved what we could consider this as is a time series problem right we're trying to forecast in a time series problem so what I can do is I can say okay this is gonna be my supply chain and I'm going to import the libraries that I need that's gonna be chaos that's going to be pandas for data pre-processing that's going to be scikit-learn for data regularization and [Applause] it's a pseudocode by the way we'll get to the real code I just want to show you how I think and you know just think through it with you so what we're gonna do what we're gonna create a function called prediction and inside of the prediction function we're going to say we've got our input data so their input data is going to be part of a panda's data frame okay so this is we're pulling this into memory and this is going to be a input dot CSV file that we saw and we're going to split it on flux say the 19th column so everything before the 19th call them all those data points are gonna be the X right the the input data and the last one is gonna be the price and that's gonna be the label and that's all we did we split the data into training and testing data what we can actually do that with scikit-learn so we could say X Y X test why test now we can take that input data which is to split and we could say we could say Sai kit learn dot split and let's just say it's already split but this just kind of formats it into four different variables okay so they're import data that was our first step then we split data into training and testing data now we'll build a model build model using curraghs of course carousel sequential and now we're going to build our network okay so we're trying to predict what that price is going to be so what we can do is we could look at Karos and we could take some of those snippets here let's just say it's gonna be a two layer model everything is fully connected ideally we would want an LS TM network which I'm about to show you but for the sake of this pseudocode demo I'm just trying to show you like how this goes lastly we're going to fit the model on the data we built it we've compiled it we defined its loss function and then at the very end we can make our prediction just like that and it's gonna be X and this is gonna be Y and now once we're done we'll predict our classes and what its gonna do is gonna print out a giant matrix of all of those features and all the values given this price right so we're gonna make the prediction about what the features would be given a price and then we could give it some price that we want ideally and they will say well here's what you should have here are the optimal levels for all of those features and we could just kind of tune it there give it more data get more accurate results etc so but what we would want in this case if we have a lot of data is an LS TM neural network a long short-term memory network as a type of recurrent network and every whenever we're dealing with sequences of data we want to use a recurrent network because the past matters right it's not just learning the mapping the past matters as well because you can't just say you know predict the next word in a sentence without knowing the words that came before it because the past matters so L SCM networks are a type of recurrent network that could predict long term sequences which is what we likely have and we can you know have some data pre-processing up here to make sure it's all in the same format and then we could just run our training loop on GL SCM Network very simple stuff but yeah I just wanted to show you that you can use this you can use Kara's to build it on your own you can find the data set I have a link to that in the description you can use ibm's bluemix if you don't want to have to code and want a very easy to use solution but there's a lot of potential in this space and i hope you found this video useful also if you have any comments any feedback suggestions definitely post them in the comment section I always read my comments I might not reply to all of them but I read all of them so thanks for watching please subscribe for more programming videos and for now I've got to attend a crypto award so thanks for watching
