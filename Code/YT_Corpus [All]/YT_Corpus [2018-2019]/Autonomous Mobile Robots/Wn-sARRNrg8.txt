 A mathematical pendulum is a classic example of an oscillatory system. Considering only position and velocity of suspension point for load position control leads to the following transition process. We used predictive control to solve this problem, in which we additionally took into account pendulum angular velocity and position. As a result, we obtained load position control quality like this. We placed a group of markers onto the scene to construct augmented reality. We calculate camera position relatively to the scene based on foreshortenings of the markers on each video frame. It is necessary for a proper placement of augmented reality objects.
