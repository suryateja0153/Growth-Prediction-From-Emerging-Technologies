 our next guest says logos will not take away jobs from people in America he says it's just an opportunity joining us now is Bill Studebaker he's the president of Robo Global now but what exactly are you saying here because robots do take away job certain kinds of jobs are you simply saying that new types of jobs will open up well yes Stuart it looks like if robots are stealing our jobs they're doing a pretty bad job of it you only have to look at the subpar productivity we've seen since the the late 2000 in 2000's and and look at the where the unemployment rates are countries that are heavily embracing automation like Japan that have been doing it for the better part of the last you know two decades have benefited by this let me looked at where their unemployment rates are they're actually historically low rate of 2.8% it's like a 22 year low so I think the evolution of work continues to evolve okay let me let me just jump in for a second bill because the jobs which all gotten rid of because of the use of robots or extremely low skilled jobs largely that's the kind of job they are so you've got assert you've got to rely on building up the skills of the people who used to have those jobs building them up to the point where they can get jobs in a more technical society that's a tough job the very least skilled are being left behind in our society well again I think the nature of work is going to continue evolve back in 1985 60% of our employment was in manufacturing median hourly income was in the seven dollar range and clerical positions we have now migrated to positions of higher value I think this is going to continue happen I do think that we need to look at the education system and how we educate people a four-year degree used to be a panacea to the future I guarantee it's not anymore unfortunately now I think we have to look at ways to educate and it's a continual education process that we need to be going through and I think it's just a result of the society that we live in we've gone from a world that was very linear in terms of progress to one that's very exponential and there's nothing really stopping this yeah there's no stopping it I mean you can't turn you can't suddenly outlaw robots haven't forbid because you're in the robot business I suspect are you not well we are the robot business I mean we're investors and I think what we're seeing from an investor standpoint is that investors see what's going on I mean our fund has gone from a few hundred million dollars a few years ago to roughly four billion dollars I think investors see what's going on and where the world is going and I think that's important considerations are you are you investing in any company which put a robot in my home I don't know whether we're there or not with robot technology but are you looking at it is that where we're going of course we think household robotics is going to be a major category I think we're a little probably five years away from that actually happening I know Amazon has ambitious plans here I think it's going to take time for robots to develop the kind of perception and dexterity that we need in our homes and at a cost point that drives value to consumers but I think that's an inevitability what what kind of thing would a robot do for me in my home five years down the road what can I do I mean who would have thought a robot five years ago would be vacuuming your floor washing your floor I think is everyone's hope you're some now you'll have robots that are folding your laundry that are helping to you know clean up around your house I think that's the kind of place we can go who would have predicted that we'd have a electric vehicle ten years ago I think it's hard to predict where this technology is advancing but clearly it is because of the cost of the of the computing power and the QPR is actually growing exponentially so this is all happening do you think we'll have like Rosie the robot from the Jetsons in my house and about what five years I'm not sure about five years but you know be prepared for some pretty interesting changes I think five years from now a lot of us aren't even to recognize the world we live in yeah I agree with it look I'm not contradicting you I'm just trying to bring you out as to where on earth we are going it's quite a future isn't it I think it's really exciting Stuart I mean I think it's hard to actually even anticipate some of the changes that we're gonna see but it's pretty pronounced and all the big tech companies are investing aggressing aggressively investing for the future and it's pretty exciting bill Studebaker lay it out for us we appreciate that thanks very much sir we'll see you again soon thank you thank you
