 SOLDIER OVERSEAS BE WITH HIS SISTER ON HER WEDDING DAY.  THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY, BUT RIGHT BY HER SIDE. THIS DANCE MEANT SO MUCH TO HER.  I HAVE FOUR BROTHERS TOTAL. HE’S MY BIG BROTHER, ALWAYS PROTECTIVE OF ME.  CAMERON’S BROTHER NICK IS A FIRST SERGEANT IN THE ARMY, RIGHT NOW IN AFGHANISTAN ON HIS SIXTH DEPLOYMENT.  HE HAS FOUR DAUGHTERS HIMSELF AND HE MISSES A LOT OF MILESTONES.  WHEN WE CAME THROUGH SHE RAN TO NICK BEFORE SHE RAN TO ME SO THAT KIND OF SHOWS HOW HAPPY SHE WAS THAT HE WAS THERE.

I GOT TO WATCH HER COME OUT. I GOT TO MOVE AROUND TABLE TO TABLE. I COULD PLAY AROUND WITH THE KIDS A LITTLE BIT. THEY HAD A GREAT TIME CHASING THE ROBOT ME AROUND. IT WAS AMAZING HONESTLY. ERIKA: NICK WAS A LITTLE FUZZY WHEN WE SPOKE TO HIM JUST BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET CONNECTION WHERE HE WAS. IT WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR AND THEY WERE SO HAPPY. THEY ARE IN TESTING, BUT PRETTY SOON THE COMPANY WIL
