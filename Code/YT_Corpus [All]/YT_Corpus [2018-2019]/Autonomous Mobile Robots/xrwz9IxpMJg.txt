 [Music] let us start with the course on robotics the first topic it is on introduction to robots and robotics now before I start learning robotics a few questions may come to our mind these are as follows what is a robot what is robotics why should we study robotics what is the motivation behind robotics how can you give instruction to a robot that you perform this particular task what are the different types of robots we generally use what are the possible applications of robots can a human being be replaced by a robot and so on so similarly there are many other questions now here actually what I am going to do I am just going to give answer to the first few questions but the last one that is can a human being be replaced by robot that I will try to answer towards the end of this particular the course now let me start with the first one that is what is a robot so I am just going to define that particular the term robot the term robot has come from the Czech word robota which means the forced or the slave laborer that this is just like a servant and we are going to give some tasks to the the robot and it is going to perform that particular the task just like a servant now the term robot was introduced in the year 1921 by current copic now current copic a Czech playwright he wrote one drama and the name of the drama was row soms universal robot or you are and in that particular drama he introduced a thumb the robot ax that is the robot but the way he described robot the robot was Lu quite similar to a human being but now it is we use a pure robots which do not look like the human being so they see the way actually the term robot was introduced in the year 1921 but during that time there was not even a single robot in the world now if you see the literature the term robot has been defined in a number of ways for example say according to the oxford english dictionary now robot is a machine capable of carrying out a complex series of accents automatically especially one programmable by a computer so this is nothing but an automatic machine then according to according to ISO that is International Organization for Standardization the robot has been defined as follows the robot is an automatically controlled reprogrammable multifunctional manipulator programmable in three or more axis which can be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications now as I mentioned that a robot is nothing but an automatically controlled machine and it is reprogrammable that means you're the same robot can perform a variety of tasks and to perform the variety of tasks will have to change its program and it is multifunctional that means the same robot the same manipulator can perform the different types of machining operation it can do some sort of peak and place type of operation and so on now here actually we are using the term manipulator so by manipulator we mean that that is a robot with fixed base now this manipulator could be either serial manipulator or parallel manipulator so those things I will be discussing in details up to some time now another very popular definition is given by our I a that is robot Institute of America now they define robot as follows it is a reprogrammable multifunctional manipulator designed to move materials parts tools or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks now these terms I have already defined for example by manipulator we mean robot with fixed base and that is nothing but a mechanical hand that means the human hand we are going to model design and develop in the form of an artificial hand and that is nothing but the the manipulator and it is reprogrammable and multifunctional now in terms of reprogram ability if he compared a robot with one incision see machine now in CNC machine like computerized numerical control machine we can perform a variety of tasks by changing the program similarly in robots the same robot I can use to serve a variety of purposes simply by changing the program but here there is a basic difference between the level of reprogram ability which can be achieved by a robot and that can be achieved by a CNC machine now it is important to note that the level of reprogram ability which can be achieved by a robot is more compared to that of the CNC machine and that is why a CNC machine is not a robot and that is why I have put one note here that CNC machine is is actually is not a robot now next I am just going to define what we mean by the robotics now the robotics is a science which deals with the issues related to design development applications of robots to perform a variety of tasks the term robotics actually it was coined by Isaac Asimov in the year 1942 now Isaac a co-op he wrote one story the name of this story was round around and in that particular story he used the term robotics fast but once again let me mention that during that time during 1942 there was not even a single robot in this world now here in robotics we use the fundamentals of different subjects for example physics mathematics mechanical engineering Electrical and Electronics Engineering computer science and that is why it is bit difficult to become a true robot assist because if you want to become an expert a true expert of robotics will have to know the fundamentals of all these basic subjects and robotics is actually a multi disciplinary subjects now I am just going to define one concept which have already mentioned little bit like in robotics we try to copy three now these three HS are nothing but the hand head and heart that means we try to copy the hand of a human being in the artificial way in the form of one manipulator that is the mechanical hand we try to copy the head of a human being that is nothing but the intelligence and we also try to copy the heart of a human being but not the mechanical heart but the emotion of a human being and that is why in future the robot will be intelligent and at the same time emotional - now if we consider the human being we are intelligent we are emotional and in robotics we try to copy everything from the human being so in future we are trying to design and develop intelligent and emotional the robots now the next is what is the motivation behind robotics why should you study robotics what is the reason now if you see today's market today's market is dynamic and competitive and if you want to be in competition and if you want to be in business so what you have to do is so you have to fulfill at least three requirements now the requirements are as follows like enough to produce good at low cost and at the same time the productivity has to be high and the quality of the product has to be good now you see the three objectives like reduced production cost increased productivity and improved product quality now it is big difficult to achieve all these three things at a time and some of them are actually conflicting now if you want to achieve all three there is only one solution and that is nothing but automation so you have to go for automation if you want to achieve all three comments now before I proceed further let me tell you something regarding the the different types of products and methods which we generally use now if you see the production methods the production the purpose of production is actually to convert the raw materials to the ferrous product now these products and could be of three types for example we can have the piece production we can have the piece production then there could be batch production batch production then there could be mass production now for piece production so we have got several designs and each design we manufacture small in number now for batch production we have got a few designs and each design we produce a period number now in mass production we have got only one design and that particular product is produced in large in number now if I just want to automate this particular batch production mass production and of course four piece production automation is not possible so there is no automation for this particular your the piece production no automation but for batch production we can go for automation and for mass production we go for automation for mass production we generally go for the fixed automation or the hard automation so Peaks or the hard automation and for this particular the batch production we generally go for the flexible automation flexible automation now robotics is an example of your the flexible automation and that is why for batch production particularly in the manufacturing unit we'll have to go for the robots if you want to survive in this particular the competitive market and that is why the robotics and the robots have become so much popular in manufacturing units but nowadays not only in manufacturing units the robots are used in different areas for example robots are nowadays used in space science used in medical science robots are also used for seabed mining in agriculture firefighting and so on so there are various applications of robots nowadays now here all such things are noted automation can help to fulfill the requirements of the above requirements and robotics is an example of the the flexible automation and that is why we should study robotics now I am just going to concentrate on a brief history of robotics now if you see the NC machine that is the numerical controlled machine that was developed fast in the year nineteen hundred and fifty but a robot came after that so the first robot which was developed that was developed in the year nineteen hundred and fifty four and nineteen hundred and fifty for the past patent on the manipulator that was filed by George Devol and he is known as the father of robot in 1956 Joseph engelberger started the first robotics company and the name of the company is unum ation so Universal is the first robotics company which was started in the year 1956 then in the year 1962 General Motors use the manipulator the name of the manipulator is unum 8 and this particular robot was used in die-casting application now next in the year in the year nineteen hundred and sixty-seven General Electric operation made one four-legged robot and this is a four-legged vehicle and they demonstrate it and it worked well then in the year nineteen hundred and sixty nine Sam was built by the NASA USA Sam was the name of that particular robot which was built by the NASA then seiki an intelligent robot that was actually manufactured by Stanford Research Institute SR I in fact seiki is the first intelligent mobile robot that was developed in the year 1969 in 70 Victor seaman demonstrated a manipulator known as Stanford arm then Lunokhod a one that was another robot that was sent to the moon by USSR then otix one another robot that was built by a datak's in the year nineteen hundred and seventy then in the year nineteen hundred and seventy three richard horn of cincinnati Mellotron corporation manufactured one robot the name of the robot was t3 that tomorrow tool then in the year nineteen hundred and seventy-five raybert at Carnegie Mellon University USA built one one-legged hopping machine and that is the first dynamically stable machine and array but in fact is known as the father of the multi legged robots in the year nineteen hundred and seventy eight you Novation the first robotics company they could develop the Puma that is programmable Universal machine for assembly and this is actually a manipulator which is having that the current version of this particular Puma is having six degrees of freedom and it is very frequently used in various industries then in the year nineteen hundred and eighty-three 1983 poetics that robotics company they introduced a unique experimental six legged device in the year nineteen hundred and eighty-six adaptive suspension vehicle in short that is ASV that was developed by Ohio State University USA in 97 NASA USA they developed the intelligent robots like Pathfinder and so Jonah and they sent it to the Mars but that particular mission was a failure and that particular failure was due to some sort of mismatch of the the specifications next in the year 2000 Honda could develop one humanoid robot ASIMO robot so a c-boy humanoid robot was developed by Honda in 2000 then comes here in 2004 the surface of the mark Mars was explode by Spirit and Opportunity and this particular mission was successful and you might be knowing what happened in 2012 the Curiosity one intelligent autonomous robot was sent to the Mars by the NASA USA and this particular mission was successful then all of you might be knowing what happened in the year two thousand 15 Sophia that is one intelligent little bit emotional he mannered robot that was built by Hanson robotics Hong Kong and this is actually as on today the most sophisticated intelligent humanoid robot and a few weeks ago this particular robot was brought to IIT Bombay and there she could talk she could communicate with other people and some of you might have seen in in paper or television so that particular the very sophisticated intelligent humanoid robot that is so pure so these are in sort the brief history of your the robotics now the purpose behind giving this brief history of this particular robotics is just to tell that we started in India the study on robotics little bit late we started around nineteen hundred and seventy nine eighty so we started lead little bit late although the past manipulator the past patent was filed in the year nineteen hundred and fifty four now I am just going to concentrate on a particular the robotic system so what are the different components of a typical robotic system now here in this particular schematic view you can see that that this particular thing is nothing but a robot so this is actually the robot and this is the manipulator this is a serial manipulator and this is the drive unit for the this serial manipulator and this is the controller or the director for this particular the manipulator now as I told that this is a serial manipulator and by manipulator we mean a robot with fixed base so here the base of this particular robot is fixed so it is a peak today's we have got one link here another link here another link here and these links are used just to transmit the mechanical power and in between the two links we have got the joints so we have got a few joint for example say if I consider that this is the base of this particular the manipulator and this is the next link so in between so these two you have got a joint here similarly inhibited in this link and that particular link we have got a joint here similarly here in between this link and that link we have got a joint here between these and these we have got another joint here so in between the two links so we have got a particular the joint now if you see the robotic joint the robotic joint could be basically up two types it could be either the linear joint or there could be the rotary joints the rotary joints now these lenient joints could be either so the linear joint it could be either prismatic joint prismatic joint or there could be your the sliding joint prismatic joint or sliding joint now here I am just going to draw a rough sketch for this prismatic and the sliding joint now if I just draw this particular the prismatic joint supposing that I have got a block like this so if I consider a block like this now here I can insert one this type of key now if I insert this particular key here so this particular joint will be nothing but a prismatic joint and this is a linear joint so this particular part say Part A can be can be just move in the linear direction here and this is an example of the the prismatic joint now similarly I am just going to take the example of one sliding joint now supposing that I have got a block like this say I have got a block like this and here I'll up to insert one pin that pin could be something like this say I love to insert a pin something like this here and this particular pin can be inserted here and there will be only the linear movement and this is the example of one sliding joint so these are all linear joint now let's come your the rotary joint now here so if you see the rotary joint the rotary joint could be of two types basically we could have the revolute joint revolute joint and there could be the twisting joint now both the rotary joint but basically it has got there is a difference between this rebel adjoint and the twisting joint now to define the difference to find out the difference between the revolute joint and this particular the twisting joint so I am just going to take one example here now let me take the example so this is the fixed base and this is the link and in between I have got a joint here now with the help of this particular joint so this particular link can be rotated something like this so it can be rotated something like this now if this is the output link and this side is input the axis of the output link is nothing but this about which I am taking the rotation and these particular axis is coinciding with the axis of the output link this is the output link this is the axis of the output link and I am taking this rotation about this particular axis so this particular rotary joint is nothing but the twisting joint denoted by T now let me take another example say this is one link this is another link now with respect to this so here I am this going to take the rotation the rotation about this particular axis now here if this is the input side and that is the output side so the axis of the output link is something like this and the axis about which I am taking the rotation is this and they are at 90 degree so if this output axis of the output link and the axis about which I am taking the rotation if they are at 90 degree so that type of rotary joint is known as your the revolute joint so this is nothing but a revolute joint denoted by R so basically once again let me repeat we use two types of joints linear joint and the rotary joint and once again two types of linear joint the prismatic joint and the sliding joint and two types of rotary joint we use one is the revolute joint and other is the the twisting joint thank you
