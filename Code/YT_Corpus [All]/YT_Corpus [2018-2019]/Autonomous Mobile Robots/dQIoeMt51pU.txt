 In this course you will learn and build a firefighting robot that detects and puts out fire. The firefighting robot that you build can detect any flame using IR sensors and moves towards the direction to blow it off using a fan driven by a DC motor. As part of this project, you will learn about the different systems in a firefighting robots such as the IR sensors, Arduino Uno Board and DC motors. You need not have any programming experience to develop this robot. To make it simple for beginners you will first use simple drag-and-drop programming to control the firefighting robot. So students from non programming courses can also do this course with confidence. For those with programming experience the course teaches you how to write program on Arduino IDE and to control hardware through software. The course is based on Skyfi Labs Learn-Do-Review methodology which ensures that you learn the technical concepts in addition to building the project with your own hands using the kit. A topic like robotics can only be learnt by building projects and Skyfi Labs makes the process super easy for you. Kit required will be shipped to you within 24 hours. And you can complete the project within one week from anywhere on earth and earn a certificate. Using Skyfi Labs courses you will not just build projects with a definite output but also learn the concepts involved in it. So you can attend and crack interviews with confidence.
