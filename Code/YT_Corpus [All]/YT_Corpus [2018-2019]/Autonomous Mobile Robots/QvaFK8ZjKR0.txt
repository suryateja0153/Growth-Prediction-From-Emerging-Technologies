 [Music] now we are going to start with another topic and that is on intelligent robots we will try to see how to design and develop an intelligent robot now we call a robot an intelligent one if it can take the decision as the situation demands now let us see how to design and develop so this particular the intelligent robots now this intelligent robots would have the adaptive motion planner the reason behind this particular adaptive motion planner I have already discussed that it should be able to take the decision in a varying situation and moreover there should be adaptive controller now while discussing the control scheme of a robot so we have discussed that each of this particular motor is equipped with one controller and if I is the PID controller so the gain values are to be determined now if I want to make it intelligent we will have to find out one controller which is also adaptive that mean that means it can take the gain values in an adaptive way as the situation demands now if you want to design and develop this intelligent robot so in up to March the principle of the artificial intelligence that is AI with this particular the robotics and if we can March the principle of AI or computational intelligence that is CI to this particular robotics will be able to make the robots intelligent now here I am just going to take one example the example of your the soccer playing robots that means here the football playing robots now before I go for these football playing robots I am just going to discuss - bit like the way one expert system whose name is deeper blue could defeat the world chase champion garry kasparov so we know that in the year 1997 one expert system the name of the expert system was deeper blue now this deeper blue could defeat Garry Kasparov Garry Kasparov the world the chase champion and this particular expert system could defeat caspere up using the principle of your the artificial intelligence now here so this particular change playing is a very simple task compared to this particular the soccer plane because the in chase playing the environment is static so we know what is happening here we know the position of the different players okay but here in your this particular the soccer plane that is a football playing task the field is dynamic so the field or the scenarios are going to vary with time so if the scenarios are going to vary with time that means you're the dynamic environment so how to tackle so let us see and this particular problem is much more difficult actually what we do in soccer playing robots so there are two teams and each team will consist of 11 players and among these players among the team mates there will be some sort of cooperation and between the two teams there will be some setup competition and using the principle of so these cooperation competition and updating so these particular the robots are going to play now each of the robot is having its own goal and that is nothing but the function of the main goal of the team that is how to win that particular the game or how to score the goal now each of the robots as I told is having its own goal and that particular goal is a function of the main goal and each of these particular robots are intelligent and they are called agent and that is why this soccer playing team is nothing but the multi-agent system that is mas multi-agent system now here in this particular multigon system each of these particular robots are intelligent or the agent and they are going to perform in the optimal sense so that the team can ultimately win that particular the game now here as I told that we need adaptive motion planner and adaptive controller that means if I want to design and develop the intelligent and autonomous robot so we have to use the adaptive motion planner and the adaptive controller and that is why the soccer playing robots has become so much popular and the main purpose of the soccer playing robots is how to design and develop that particular intelligence of these robots and show that so these particular robots can walk in a multigon system and ultimately the team of these particular robots can win that particular that the game by scoring goal now here the ultimate goal of the Robocop was said as follows so by meet 21st century a team of autonomous human a robot should beat the human world champion team under the official regulations of PIPA so that particular goal was said by the the the the investigators are the researchers working in this multigon system of robotics now to reach that particular goal actually many people are working throughout the world some problems have been solved but still there are many such open-air which had to be solved in a very efficient way so that a team of autonomous human and robot will be able to beat the World Cup champion team the football team according to the regulations of people so this is a very complicated task and to reach this particular that the target so we'll have to make improvement in different areas so that we can reach that particular the target now let us see a simplified version of that like how to implement or how to design and develop one intelligent and autonomous robot now Here I am just going to take one scenario now this is a very simple scenario but this scenario can be made much more complicated also so I am just going to concentrate on so this simple scenario now supposing that so this is actually the starting point for a particular robot and this is the goal and here we are going to consider a two-wheeled one caster robot so this is the left wheel the right wheel and we have got a free-will here or a support sort of thing and that is nothing but the caster okay now so this point indicates the CG of this particular robot now the physical robot I am just going to solve and I am just going to explain up to some time in much more details but before that let me let me explain the problem which is going to be solved with the help of this particular robot now at time T equals to say t1 say T equals 2 t1 supposing that so this is nothing but the CG of this particular the robot and supposing that this is the goal the G is the goal and we have got a few moving obstacles like we have got o 1 o 2 O 3 o 4 oh five now for simplicity so I am just going to consider only say five obstacles now each of these obstacles are moving with some velocity or speed along a particular the direction for example oh one with some speed it is moving in this particular direction similarly Oh two is moving with this particular direction with some speed oh three is moving with this particular direction oh four is moving along this direction and oh five is moving along this direction now here to solve this particular motion planning algorithm our aim is to find out the collision free and time optimal path for these particular the mobile robot now to solve this particular problem we take the help of some sort of the concept of the distance tape and your the time stick so we consider the distance tape and time step now during a particular time step so the robot is going to move through a particular the distance and that is nothing but the distance tape now at time T equals 2 T 1 supposing that this is the CG of the robot and these are all predicted position of these particular the obstacle now here if it wants to find out what should be the collision free path for this for a particular time step so what is it it will have to do is first thing it will have to find out which one is the most critical obstacle now here there are five obstacles and we consider the distance between the present position of the robot and the the the position of this particular obstacle the different obstacle and we try to find out what should be the distance between the robot in this particular the obstacle the robot and this particular the obstacle so here there are five obstacles so I will be getting five distance values and out of those five distance values so we will try to find out that which one is the the minimum supposing that the distance values are d1 d2 d3 d4 and d5 d1 is the distance between the obstacle one and the CG of this particular robot and so this is nothing but the the do you want similarly I will be getting D 1 D 2 up to d5 we compare all the D values and we try to find out the minimum now supposing that so out of all such D values and if you concentrate on this particular scenario so this d4 is found to be the minimum that means your so this particular obstacle that is over obstacle is physically found to be the nearest to this particular the robot but here so this particular the obstacle oh four is moving in this particular direction on the other hand so the oh three another obstacle is moving towards this particular the robot now if I compare the distance now here so deep or will be less than that D 3 but as this particular obstacle is moving towards the robot so this will be considered at the most critical obstacle but not o 4 that means your oh 3 is consider is the most critical obstacle because it is moving towards that particular the robot now if I just select this as the the most critical obstacle the distance between so this particular the present position of the robot and the obstacle so this is nothing but the distance input for the motion planner so C 103 C 103 is nothing but the distance input for the the motion planner similarly angle between the goal the present position of the robot and the obstacle oh three that is your G C 103 so this particular angle is another input for the the motion planner now here for this motion planner I have got two inputs one is the distance another is the angle and to avoid collision now enough to find out like what should be the angle of daeviation now here so this angle G c1 c2 is nothing but the Davy is an angle so this is nothing but the deviation angle that means to avoid collision with this particular moving obstacle the robot is going to follow this particular path or the robot is going to deviate from this particular path just to avoid the the collision with the moving obstacle so the output of the motion planner will be your so this particular the deviation angle that is nothing but G c1 c2 so this is nothing but the deviation of the the motion planner and we can also consider another the output of the motion planner that is nothing but the speed of the robot or the speed or the acceleration of this particular the robot so if I just just try to find out what should be what should be the inputs and outputs of the motion planner now if I just draw the block diagram of this particular motion planner there are two inputs one is the distance input the distance input and another is your the angle input and there are two outputs one is nothing but the deviation angle and another could be the speed or the acceleration of this particular robot so you find out the acceleration we can also find out that the speed so there are two inputs distance angle and there are two outputs that is deviation and acceleration of this particular the robot and using this particular your motion planning algorithm so we can find out so what should be the angle of daeviation and what should be the acceleration so that the robot can avoid collision with this particular the moving obstacle now let us see how to implement in the real experiment now here we can consider that this is nothing but an optimization problem and our aim is to minimize director traveling time that means the robot will be able to reach the goal starting from the initial position in a minimum time and at the same time the path should be collision free so there should not be any collision between the robot and this particular the moving obstacle and moreover the kinematic and dynamic constraint of this particular robot is to be the full field now regarding this particular kinematic and dynamic constraint actually before I discuss little bit so I'll up to saw the physical model of this particular the robot and now I am just going to show you the physical robot the physical model of this particular robot now this is nothing but a two-wheeled one caster robot now you can see that we have got one wheel here we have got another wheel here and we have got one support and that is nothing but so this is the caster so this is a two will one caster robot and this is nothing but a 2 will one caster differential Drive robot now for each of this particular will so we have got a separate motor so this motor is connected to the will and of course for each of these particular motor there must be a controller and here we some set of PID controller just to control the the this particular the motor so that we can generate some speed at the the two wheels and accordingly we will be getting that movement of this particular the robot now we will be discussing in details how to make it intelligent but before that let me tell you now regarding this kinematic and dynamic constrain so the kinematic constraint for this particular robot could be of two types for example say there could be non holonomic constraints there could be non holonomic constraints so non holonomic constraints non holonomic constraint and there could be holonomic constraints so by non holonomic constraints we mean those constraints which are dependent on velocity so this non holonomic constraints are dependent on velocity of the robot and these holonomic constraints are independent of the the velocity so these constraints are to be fulfilled otherwise we cannot generate the movement of this particular robot particularly whenever it is taking a turn now if I just concentrate once again on the physical model we can see that supposing that it is going to take a turn the robot is going to take a turn now if it is going to take a turn on the left side so on the right hand side actually the RPM or the speed of this particular wheel should be more compared to that that of the the other side then only I can take a turn and while taking this particular turn so these particular constraints like non holonomic and holonomic constraints are coming into the the picture and moreover each of this particular the motor is controlled by the controller and this motor is going to generate the required just to give some sort of rotation to the the Wills now to determine the power rating of this particular motor so we always try to find out how much is the torque requirement of these particular the winds and so this dynamic constraint is going to tell us like how to decide the power rating of the motor so that your this particular motor will be able to provide the necessary top so that it can generate that particular rpm to this particular the wind so this kinematic and dynamic constraints are to be fulfilled and at the same time the path has to be the collision-free now let us see how to carry out so this particular the real experiment now before I go for this particular real experiment the motion planning algorithm which I am going to use for this experiment is nothing but the potential field method the principle of which I have already discussed in much more details and as I told now this particular potential field method is going to work based on the concept of the attractive potential and the repulsive potential now let me repeat that this attractive potential you attractive X is nothing but hop jito attractive that is nothing but a constant value d goal x square and this d goal x is nothing but the distance between the goal and this particular the CG of the robot and this goal is going to attract that particular robot and on the other hand we have got one repulsive potential which is nothing but your you repulsive X this I have already discussed in much more details and Here I am just going to consider so this particular expression for the repulsive potential half Zita repulsive x 1 / d obstacle X minus D obstacles 0 square now this particular D obstacle X is nothing but the distance between the obstacle and this particular robot and your B obstacle 0 is nothing but supposing that I have got an obstacle here and surrounding that obstacle we consider one circle and that is called the circle of increase now if this is the center of the circle so this is nothing but is your D obstacle o set up thing okay and this D obstacle X supposing that the robot is here so this particular distance is nothing but is your D obstacle X okay now using this actually the the obstacle is going to put some set of repulsive force on the robot and using these attractive and repulsive ports or attractive attractive and repulsive potential the robot is going to move towards the target or the goal and ultimately the robot is going to reach the goal and this robot will be under the combined action of attractive and repulsive potential or attractive and repulsive force and I have already mentioned that we consider that there are two inputs for this motion planner that is your distance and angle and there are two outputs that is nothing but the angle of daeviation and acceleration or speed of this particular robot now this I have already discussed in much more detail so I am NOT going to spend much time on this and now I am just going to show you like the robot the physical model I just showed a few minutes ago now this is actually the photograph of the same robot now here you can see that so these are the wheel Kaster we cannot see now this is nothing but actually your this is nothing but the antenna used for the radiofrequency module now this robot is wireless so we will have to use some sort of RF module or the radiofrequency module so which I am going to discuss in details and with the help of this particular antenna so we are going to send signal to the controller for this particular the motor now as I told that to control the movement of this particular the will we have got a motor the motor is not visible it is there inside and each of this particular the motor is connected to the the controller and this robot is having actually the micro controller so that little bit of calculation little bit of the disease and it can take with the help of that particular motion planning algorithm now let us see how does it work now here actually we are going to take the help of one camera so this is nothing but a CCD camera and this is the stand of the camera so here we actually insert that particular the camera and this is the field on which we are going to carry out this particular the experiment okay so on this particular field we have got say the robot say say robot is denoted by R and we have got some obstacle say it is denoted by o now let us see how can this particular robot take the decision just to avoid collision with this particular the moving obstacle now here we can see that this is nothing but is actually the my vision board so this is my vision board and this particular the the hardware now it is for how to carry out that image processing online within a fraction of second now this particular my vision so we have to put it in the CPU or the computer and I'm just going to tell you the method we just carry out this particular the experiment so this my vision board has to be put in this particular the CPU and once I put this particular the my vision board now let us see how can you send this particular information of the environment so that we can carry out so this particular the experiment and this is actually the whole view of this particular the robot now let us see how can you implement that this particular the principle of the motion planning to make it intelligent ok now this shows actually the experimental setup we developed now this is nothing but the field so this is nothing but the field in a real experiment so this is the field in real experiment the same field I am just drawing it here and as I told that we have got this particular robot so this is nothing but the robot ok and we have got the obstacle here now let us see how can it take the decision to avoid collision with this particular the moving obstacle now here we use one camera that is called the overhead camera I can also use onboard camera that means the camera can be mounted on the body of this particular the robot now here we are just going to put one the overhead camera and this camera has to be calibrated so the camera calibration is the first task actually the quality of the image collected with the help of camera depends on a number of parameters for example say it depends on your what should be the focal length of the lens it depends on some sort of scaling factors and some other factors those factors are to be determined with the help of the calibration so this particular camera has to be calibrated fast and supposing that so this camera has been calibrated now in the help of camera so we can collect information of this particular the environment that means we can take the snap of this particular environment at a regular interval now depending on the speed of this particular camera so we can take snap of this particular environment at regular interval and this particular information that is the information of the environment or this particular image that will pass through the BNC cable and through this BNC cable the information of the image or the environment it will go to the the CPU or this particular the computer now here inside this particular CPU we have put that my recent board or the image processing software so the information of the image will enter this my vision board and there will be some set of image processing and through this image processing the principle of which I've already discussed in much more details we can find out the information of this particular the environment that means I can find out the distance between the robot and this particular obstacle and the angle through which so this obstacle is moving towards the robot and these two are nothing but the the inputs of the motion planner and once we've got the inputs of the motion planner now the motion planning algorithm that is the potential field method is going to determine what should be the output that means what should be the deviation and what should be the acceleration or the speed of the robot and using this particular Davies and angle and the speed of the robot so through some small programming we can find out what should be the RPM of the the two wheels now one ship calculated so this particular rpm values so what I do is so this particular information will pass it through this particular your the radio frequency module that is nothing but the RF board or the RF module and this through this RF module so we are going to pass the information to this particular robot and in this particular robot we have got your antenna so through this oil-less communication the information regarding the RPM or the speed requirement of the two wheels that will pass through your the controller of this motor which is connected to the the two wheels of the robot and now with the help of this controller like the PID controller or PI controller so this particular motor is going to rotate the will and we will be getting this particular movement at the two wheels of the robot and consequently the robot will be able to move in the forward direction or in the backward direction it will be able to take some ton either clockwise or anti-clockwise so this shows actually your the photograph of this experimental setup this is nothing but the overhead camera and this is the field and we can see that we have got this particular the robot here and we have got the the obstacle here okay and this is the the CPU which you use for carrying out this experiment and this is the display of that particular the computer and let us see how can we carry out so this particular the experiment now to carry out the experiment as I told that these are the the different steps which are to be for example the pasta peas will have to calibrate this particular camera then we can go for some sort of online image processing which have already discussed then we have to activate the motion planning approach that means here we are going to use the potential field approach then there must be some unless communication through the the radio frequency module so that we can pass the information of the requite of p.m. at the two wheels to the respective controller of the motors and with the help of this particular controller the motor is going to generate that particular the required motion or the required torque and then we'll be able to get some sort of movement of this particular the robot ok now I am just going to show you one video just to show you this particular experiment the way we carried out this particular the experiment now here edges want to acknowledge we got one DST project that is Department of Science and Technology Government of India projects with the help of this particular project actually we conducted this particular the experiment and the video of this particular experiment I am going to show you and here one a syrup walked on this particular the experiment doctor near mall born Hui who walked on this particular the project to develop this particular experiment so we are just going to show the video of our experiment like how could he develop the intelligence to the robot that means how could you design and develop and intelligent the wheeled robot the mobile robot so I am just going to show you that particular the video now this is the robot which I actually so do you and here so the robot is now moving in the forward direction and it will be able to move in the forward and the backward direction and now I am just going to show you the way it can avoid the collision with the - static obstacle now this particular robot the wheel robot can move in the forward direction and backward direction now I am just going to show you that how can you avoid collision with one static obstacle so this is nothing but the static obstacle so in the help of this particular the robot with the help of the motion planning algorithm will be able to find out the collision free path now this is another example like how to avoid collision with the the - static obstacles so the robot is going to avoid collision with both the static obstacle and it is going to reach the goal now I am just going to show you how to use the potential field method now you can see that the robot has become almost stationary and after it has crossed the obstacle the moving obstacle now it is moving with the high speed to reach that particular the goal now this is the way with the help of the motion planning algorithm and with the help of this controller we can incorporate intelligence to this particular the robot now here although we used some sort of motion planning algorithm to make it intelligent sometimes we take the help of some set of reactive control along with some sort of the motion planning algorithm just to incorporate intelligence to this particular the robot now the principle which have used here to make this particular wheeled robot an intelligent one more or less the similar type of principle we can use to make the different types of mobile robot intelligent for example we can make say multi legged robot likes a four-legged robot six legged robot or two legged robot an intelligent one using more or less the similar type of principle now here if I just consider a legged robot so beside this motion planning we'll have to consider the gait planning also now we are not going to discuss the gait planning and other things in details okay now if you are really interested you can have a look appear textbook that is the fundamentals of robotics written by by me now that particular book is a textbook for this particular course as I mentioned earlier if you have some interest to know more so enough to concentrate on that particular textbook just to collect more information thank you
