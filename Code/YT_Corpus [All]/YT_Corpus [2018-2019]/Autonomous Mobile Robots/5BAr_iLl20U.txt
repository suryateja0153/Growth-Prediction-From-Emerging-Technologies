 This technology emerging now to transport us, whether it's on land sea or air, without us being the captains of that ship. And that is disruptive technology, which bears tremendous advantages for the future. The death rate now on our highways is over 40,000 again, so we lose as many people on the highways every day as is lost with the opioid crisis. A vast percentage of death rates are due to a driver error, and we almost have totally eliminate driver error by taking over the task of control of the vehicle. The American public, though, seems quite blase about the fact that that the that the death rate is that high. Say, a patient is in an office setting here in this building, and suddenly falls off his chair on the floor with a cardiac event. Within seconds, we would have help there. But what if that same series of events happens on a rural road in Florida? Where the patient is driving down the highway, suddenly feels a little woozy, continues to drive, but then has a massive coronary event, and floats across the road. If we could get the emergency vehicles there in time, we might easily save a life. So, some sensors within the vehicle are what's exciting to us in healthcare. It's interesting that the Henry Ford Health System is the first system in the country, which has decided to put on a congress related to this subject. We are at the cutting edge of this technology in the Henry Ford Health System. That's only appropriate I think because Detroit lives at the cutting edge of the development of the automobile, so we ought to be at the cutting edge of where that automobile is ultimately gonna fit into healthcare.
