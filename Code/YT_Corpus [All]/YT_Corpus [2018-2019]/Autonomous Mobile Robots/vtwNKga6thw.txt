 if we're going to need to double the food production in the next 30 years to feed the growing population we felt there needs to be a radical change by dividing the plants lifecycle into three main sections we're able to optimize the density in the farm and each stage of the plant's life it requires different spacing and inputs like light and fertilizer it's not just that the robots can move plants around and very efficiently it's also that they can they can help you avoid ever having a plant go bad We're able to do the equivalent of 30 acres outdoor farming in just a single acre of our robotic farm so one of the great things about the robots is that they don't really get tired and they don't really care what hours they work and so as long as they've got juice in the batteries they can keep going right now fresh produce really isn't all that fresh it's traveling on average 2,000 miles from farm to grocery store
