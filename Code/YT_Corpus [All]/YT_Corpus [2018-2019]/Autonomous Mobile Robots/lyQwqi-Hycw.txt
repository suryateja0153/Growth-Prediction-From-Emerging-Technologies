 We are living in a golden ages of robotics  Where the past 50 years of promises and potential are finally coming to fruition, and robots are leaving the lab to live in the wild with us. What I find so exciting about this era is that our future with these intelligent, autonomous machines has really yet to be written. When I sit down to design an interface with an industrial robot, I look for its native features that I can use for communication. Subtle things, like their posture, their motion, or even the sound of their motors, can all be harnessed to build a body language that can better communicate with the people around them. When a group of robots are imbued with these behaviors, begin to feel less like manufacturing equipment, and more like a pack of mechanical creatures ... each with their own personality and quirks. What I hope to show in my work is that even if these machines don't look like us, or don't act like us, they can still connect with us in meaningful ways. That's the future I want to live in.
