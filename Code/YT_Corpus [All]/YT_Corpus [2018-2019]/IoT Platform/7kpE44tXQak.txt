 [Music] hi friends thanks for on this last day coming to our talk an overview of cloud IIT core I'm Gabe Weiss and I'm Gus class we're engineers working on Google's cloud platform specializing in IOT we're gonna bring Gus back on a little bit but first I want to have a little chat with you guys first thing I need to know who are you quick survey time who out there our engineers are the people that do in the work developers oh nice okay most of you good do we have any business managers sea-levels kind of decision maker ease all right got a couple here good don't worry I'm not gonna actually call on any of you that's good we call that theater of cruelty I won't do that to you do we have any data scientists in the crowd oh nice good good good all right just to make sure we're all on the same page who knows what i OT is okay most of you what about IOT core all right good um just to make me feel better do you all know what Google cloud platform is even if you don't raise your hand just make me feel good okay so for those that haven't heard of it yet there I saw a couple hands didn't go up IOT it's the Internet of Things I actually voted for 5ti things that talk to the Internet I thought it would have been a little more indicative what it is so what is IOT a computer your computer connected to Wi-Fi IOT device your smartphone IOT device smart meters connected your house electricity gas all of those I have T devices raspberry pi's micro controllers we'll get to all of these all of these are IOT devices in 2015 Business Insider along with Gartner did a study that said by 2020 30 billion connected devices 30 billion IOT devices that's the the phones and the computers you can see are a tiny slice of what we're talking about here so why aren't we there yet why isn't my world connected and smart well these things take time they take money so to really understand what the holdup is I want to do a little brief introduction to the world of world electronics does anyone know if I say the word constrained device does anyone know what that is a constrained device a couple people are nodding okay a constrained device is a tiny computer it's got its memory its processor its analog to digital signal conversion all in a single chip that's a constrained device so because everything's on that single chip it's called constrained because it's memory it's processing its storage are all severely limited this is the class of computer we're talking about when we talk about 30 billion connected devices who remembers floppy disks and I'm not talking about hold on hold on I'm not talking about the three-and-a-half inch you know firm ones five and a quarter inch the really floppy ones all right now I know some of us are old enough that remember there were bigger ones right there like the dinner size plate ones those aren't the ones I'm talking about the five and a quarter inch floppies those things held 360 K of storage these microcontrollers hold less than that on average if we remember those floppy disks a single program came on many disks so to load an application we had to switch those things in and out to load your program into RAM we don't have that luxury with microcontrollers we can't just swap them in and out to load an application that's why we need something a more powerful computer or cloud IOT core to expand the capabilities of the device so since I keep bringing it up I want to make sure we're all on the same page with IOT core what is IOT core it's a 100% managed service this means that you don't have to stand up anything you don't have to put a service up in a VM we handle all of that for you in Google there's no need for auto scaling redundancy scaling all of that is done by the cloud for you IOT core provides a global endpoint no matter where your devices are in the world it's the same endpoint so latency is to your nearest data center and back and that's it IOT core has two main pieces it's a communication broker and it's a device management for IOT core the organization of it is you have IOT core inside you create registries registries are buckets for your devices so you can create some some logical organization to them and then the devices yourselves the messages from your devices will using either HTTP or the MQTT protocol shuttle your devices data up into the cloud and io2 core brokers that's the communication piece your message is from IOT core into cloud pub/sub and we'll talk about pub/sub later pub subs our event stream manager and from there it's the gateway I o T core gives you access to the rest of Google clouds platform so to wrap your head around why where we are now and why it's really getting excited I want to go back to our little history lesson and talk about how Electronics evolved in the before times your household stuff like your blender your microwave your washing machine all of these were made up of electronic components like capacitors diodes resistors things that would respond to electric signal strength alone the more power for the signal the more it would happen in electrical components so your microwave for example how it works the magnet the magnetron inside your microwave you increase signal strength to it your food gets hotter decrease signal strength to it and it reduces the temperature that's how basic electronics work because the of the physical relationship of these components to each other as the electrical signal come in each component would actuate or not actuate the next piece is in it's like a Rube Goldberg machine and because of the tight physical relationship to it change was very difficult if you wanted to change functionality of your electrical circuit you had to make physical changes to it you had to change your bomb your building material so there would be cost associated with it the minute you add something to an electrical circuit your resistance goes haywire you might have to change the whole layout of your circuit if you wanted to mass-produce your circuits this is a problem once you've created your tooling for your manufacturing line on your circuit mass producing the same templates nice and easy if you've introduced change and now you have to retool everything to recreate your circuits so it's very expensive to make any kind of change some of these kinds of circuits we call in the analog circuits still exist today but modern electronics and why this is all exciting are a little bit different modern electronics are still composed of sensors components actuators all of these things that still work with electrical signals but instead of the way that we used to do it where signal strength was what changed things now we have things called digital protocols electrical signal will go on and off very rapidly in a predefined pattern a digital protocol that is understood by another piece in the circuit this means that we can Center our electronics around this constrained device this microcontroller which is very good at reading signals both analog and digital and speaking in this digital protocol the chip itself can now create functional change in your circuit without having to physically change anything around it it's important because they're inexpensive until relatively recently these microcontrollers were pretty expensive but now mass-market I can go out and buy a microcontroller with Wi-Fi and bluetooth for less than five dollars so adding these complex circuits and creating these complex circuits is now very inexpensive the trade-off of course is that microcontrollers are still relatively constrained they don't have a lot of memory they don't have a lot of storage so they need something else to help them achieve the capabilities that they're not able to accomplish on their own so hopefully this gives you kind of a backdrop for why we're at this tipping point with electronics where cost and complexity have arrived where we can do things at scale being able to create these cheap complex circuits with the microcontrollers allows us to think about creating those cheap or inexpensive complex smart devices that are going to connect our world so take a step and let's talk about smart devices what is a smart device at the simplest a smart device is something that can complete an objective that can do a task without human intervention I don't need to do anything for it modern electronics and the available ability of these microcontrollers makes intelligent control of these devices economically feasible and you might notice I'm really harping on economically feasible and inexpensive and I am if there's just one takeaway that I want you to walk away from this talk with it's that what a few years ago might not have been possible because of cost and complexity is easily achievable now we have the tools now to create these ecosystems of smart devices so smart devices so we can understand them there's three basic approaches to a smart device and I'm holding all three fingers first there's a hundred percent on device everything is contained and done within your single device something like Google home where I can use my voice as the input to a device it uses speech to text to convert to text it uses natural language processing to analyze what I really asked for because maybe didn't ask for the right thing and run some kind of task on device and it can accomplish it all without me having to do anything else I have a spoken word and something happens it might use the Internet to call out to do something else but that's part of the task it's already accomplishing the second there's edge or border routing sometimes we call it as the the radio Protocol approach for example Nest has released something called open thread open thread allows your device to call out to another nearby device to take advantage of its capabilities so say you've got a device that can do everything except internet but whatever the task is it needs to be able to call out to the Internet well if open thread it can reach out to another another device that's nearby and connected and borrow its internet connection in order to accomplish its task it's still doing some of the work onboard but it's using these other devices to finish off what it needs to be done and lastly a device can delegate all of its control to something else a lot of the times these microcontrollers do that so they will become a very dumb but very fast gatherer of information gatherer of data and then hand off all of that i/o to something else a computer nearby the cloud something else firmata made famous by Arduino that's the perfect example of what this is over a serial wire you can delegate all of your control all of the the information that you've gathered on one device to a computer to something else nearby so what if I told you that the computer that we're connecting to that's knit that is doing all of this power for us didn't have to be anywhere near the devices and that's where we're back that's what we're back to IOT core this side you can start to think about that like the concept of Fermanagh IOT core connects your device to the cloud it expands the capabilities of this little device and all of its data is collecting to the power of the cloud it gives your device these new capabilities without any adding any complexity you don't need more local hardware you don't need anything local all you need to be able to do is talk to the cloud so all of this so far that our history and electronics are talking about smart devices is to hammer this point home where we're in a world where creating devices that talk to the Internet it's not only easy it's inexpensive there's that inexpensive again we can all do it so I've touched on why the cloud is integral to IOT but just in case you aren't convinced yet I want to show you a couple of things to make sure that you understand let's take a look at this graph this graph is all of the oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico there's a little over 1300 of them each of these gas fields could have potentially thousands of sensors all streaming data to keep our math simple let's say it's just a thousand from there let's say that each of these sensors is only streaming a hundred bytes a second noting 100 bytes a second even if that's true that's 137 megabytes a second it's just over 8 gigabytes a minute it's 11 and a half terabytes a day you could manage that data if you want I'm just saying there's a reason the cloud was created the cloud offloads all of the infrastructure all of the overhead of managing this big data you don't have to worry about backups you don't have to worry about IT people to run your machines and make sure you've got uptime the cloud handles all of this the other point I want to talk about is security some of you may have heard about it a couple years ago there was a thing called the Murai botnet attack this is where a bunch of unsecured devices mostly routers and stuff like that were hijacked and used to attack the domain name services of the internet Dyn took down huge swathes of the internet for a pretty good amount of time in the in the internet scheme also a a temperature sensor in a fish tank last year this happened a temperature sensor in a fish tank in a casino was compromised the hacker was able to through this temperature sensor pull out all of the personal information of the casinos high rollers all through a temperature sensor that didn't happen to be secured so security is massively important if you're doing IOT you need to think about security IOT core registers all of your devices with an ssl key pair and does all your encrypted communication through TLS 1.2 or later to ensure that all of your devices are secure when they're talking to the cloud so we understand now hopefully why IOT core is awesome but what else IOT core is this gateway into the Google cloud platform what does the cloud platform have for you for IOT this is a small sampling of what Google cloud platform offers if you want a really good time go to cloud kugel comm slash products and start scrolling and just keep scrolling and keep scrolling it's really impressive there's there's enough products on there that even we don't know what all the products really do they're all specialized there's a ton of products that will fit pretty much any need that you want but back to our sample so first we've got our devices bringing their data up into GCP as I've talked about before these payloads the messages and brokered as events end up cloud pub/sub our event managing manage our event stream manager from there once it's in pub/sub we have some products that can respond to our incoming messages we've got cloud functions cloud functions our serverless functions that just exist in the server list space that you can call either with an endpoint like you're calling a URL or they can respond to events within GCP in our case the pub/sub message coming in will trigger a cloud function to run on it the other product we've got on here is called cloud dataflow dataflow is our managed service to handle transforming incoming streams it's managed so again like cloud IOT core it will scale without you having to do anything however much data it's processing it will scale to handle it it can be used to do things like filter incoming data if there's only some data you want to make it into your final storage or it can massage the data into a specific format if you need it to be processed in a specific way it also acts as a pipeline for your data cloud pub/sub is temporary messages will stay there for seven days if you don't do something with them they go away don't want your day to go away so a product like data flow can shuttle your data into the other products which brings us to our storage and analytics section there's way more than are shown here these three are just a very small sampling of what we've got first we have BigTable BigTable is our no sequel storage or sequel database option again managed service it will scale with however much data you put in it bigquery is our enterprise level data warehousing it allows you to query your big data petabytes of data with simple sequel statements that means your data analysts and your data scientists don't have to learn a new system they can just use sequel to find insights within your data they can spend their time analyzing data not learning a new system and finally we've got machine learning tensorflow is the open source software that allows you to train your models and run inference against your models cloud machine learning engine is hosted tensorflow it allows you to harness all of the power of google's backbone to train and run inference on your models faster and more efficiently finally we have tools that can visualize your data we've got a couple of options here we've got cloud data lab it's built on Jupiter so you can build notebooks to visualize the data however you want and we've got an out-of-the-box solution data studio which lets you look at time slices of data in charts and graphs however you want to visualize it so for IOT with all of these together you can do things like perform device management and monitor your health across fleets of devices you can warehouse and analyze truly absurds amount of data and lastly you can perform things like predictive maintenance on me and manufacturing your utilities to see when your stuff is going to break using tools like machine learning cloud IOT core provides that gateway it provides the device management and connectivity for all of your devices into the rest of Google cloud platform it's been only a year last year IO is one we announced cloud IOT core so I want to take a sec just to highlight the what we've done since then what are the improvements we've made first when we when we announced that beta a year ago it can only talk MQTT if you didn't have a device again do MQTT you're out of luck we've added HDPE HTTP since then so now a broader range of devices can connect to IOT core and have their data managed a year ago when we launched each registry remember those buckets of devices map one-to-one to our pub sub so any device data that was coming into your registry would only go into a single bucket of pub/sub we've now added the ability to map multiple pub subtopics to a single registry so you can charge your data that way you can organize your data into multiple pub subtopics we've added stack driver stack driver logging so that you can monitor your health through stack driver which is that's a logging and monitoring tool that we've got I forgot to mention it before and brand-new and I don't think anyone's actually announced this yet so I'm kind of excited I get to announce something Android things I'm sure you've all heard a lot about Android things across this conference Android Things has created a plugin that they're releasing next week that will allow you to easily connect your Android things devices to IOT core so all of those sessions that you went to about Android things and all the cool stuff you can create using it now let that kind of late in the back your mind what more can you do with it if it's connected to the cloud what else can you do what global reach can you accomplish with Android things now that it can connect to cloud IOT core so now that I've talked your ear off I'm gonna bring guests back up and he's going to show you in practice some of the stuff that I've been talking about thanks Gabe let's have a round of applause for Gabe and his wonderful blue hair look at this guy yeah I don't know how I'm gonna follow that just kidding actually I'll be the yin to his yang and I'll show you the things that he's been talking about so this is actually the this is the third time that I've given that I've shown kind of the nuts and bolts of how cloud IOT core works and kind of this is AI home right now and I remember a year ago the cloud IOT core team came in front of you all and demonstrated the demonstrate of the product for the first time and when they did it I I have no idea how they were able to get such a robust in beautiful demo at that point in time because there was a lot of pieces that the experience was a cliff you know the first time that I showed the first time that I should this Dibble that I'm just about to do the it it blew up in my face and that was because it was for a couple of reasons one of them was we didn't have that we didn't have the the cloud console features for IOT core so there was no visual way of doing of adding devices and creating registries and there also there also was no command-line utilities for managing IOT core and so I had to write a sample that would make API calls with the device ID the registry ID the project ID all these values that are really easy to fat-finger so when when we went to general availability the Google Cloud SDK or G clout for those who for those who don't know google cloud ships the command-line utility that's written in Python I believe and it allows you to do all the things that you can do in cloud programmatically from the command line and it actually works it works really well from from cloud resources and if you go and do the code lab I actually how do you do a lot of cloud resource management using the G cloud SDK and so today I'm going to show you how did you how to how to do the nuts and bolts of cloud IOT core just using the cloud SDK as opposed to using the the console or the command line or some API calls that I pack together in some sort of sample app so I'll just unlock my machine and we'll switch to computer all right can everybody see that good bigger smaller good okay okay awesome alright so if you remember the entry point into cloud IOT core is Google cloud pub/sub and so before we can before we can receive messages and transmit and before we can transmit messages and then process those messages from pub/sub we have to create a Google cloud pub/sub topic so I'm going to create a Google cloud pub/sub topic I'm super nervous that I type really bad okay top okay so I just hide in G cloud pub/sub topics creates IO 2018 top four topic and so now I do G cloud pub/sub subscriptions so the subscriptions will of course my sub and I forget the help alright so when you create the subscription you have to associate that subscription with the topic and then I have to create and if you see me struggling up here and know how to fix what I'm doing don't hesitate to yell that alright alright here we go - dos topic alright so now I have created a Google cloud pub/sub subscription that is associated with the with the google cloud pub/sub topic so now whenever I publish messages into that topic then they get queued up in the subscription and I can pull those those messages from the subscription so now I'm going to create a Google cloud IOT core registry and I'm not the best typer in talker and so associated with this registry is going to be an event notification configuration and so what that just means is when messages are sent to let me treat messages which could be something like sensor data from a device when those messages come in then this is this is where this is the topic where those where those notifications can go to and so you can also set you can also set this so that like you can have event notifications going to other types of things and we and the future may offer other other ways of connecting with clout so now I created a registry and after it now that it's nother to the the registry will contain devices that represent the identity of of these of your of your smart devices or IOT you can internet connected devices and so now I'm ready to add a to device and so the device connects using an asynchronous to credit or an asynchronous encrypted credential so you encrypt you pet you give us your public key and then you encrypt your data with your private key when you authorize its and you get a JSON web token and so what this is going to do is invoke a couple of I I can never type those open SSL commands correctly so but really what this all this is doing is just calling this open SSL command which will generate a public private key key pair with with jok compatible algorithms and so now that I have my device keys I can I can register a new device and I'm gonna call e 2e because that's the device that I recommend using for the intent example and if you want to follow if you want to follow on your own through a through a step-by-step example you can find this in the documentation at cloud Google com /i ot and so when I create this when I create this device I'm going to have I'm going to use the I'm going to use the the e C key that was created with open SSL and then I give it the es 256 string representing the type because that is just the the signing type that's that's correctly named for furred JWT and after this comes back then we're ready to connect to Google Cloud IOT core and so this is going to use I'm just for this example I'm just going to use the HTTP example which is the most basic connected way of connecting to Google platter to core so this is just a Python sample and so there's the converts the project ID that's the you know the cloud resource associated that with the device registry and the and the pub subtopic and so forth and then the registry ID which is the container for these devices and the device and ID and everything else that you saw me put in in the previous message and now docker is going to ask me to update I'll do that later okay so alright so when the so here's the job that is calculated from the device and because it's a brand new device you'll see that it's configuration is empty and it's also the shish yeah that's nice nice stack trace but here's the so here's the configuration for the device and you can see that I've published it published a couple of telemetry messages that will that are events representing something that this device is transmitting to the cloud and so now if I use g-cloud again hub and I could do subscriptions hole all right I'm gonna forget the name again switchin is IO 2 0 1 and when I do this I should see the messages I should see those telemetry messages that were transmitted by the virtual device to the cloud this is always a scary part there it is so sorry for my sorry for how this looks kind of funky in here but you can see the you can see attributes which is like metadata for the device that connected the time that and and and anything else that you want to push into your topic inside of this data field alright so if you've seen any of the talks before on cloud IOT core you see me do this a lot of different ways this can work but these devices are really this but this is it you've seen the entire you've seen the entire capabilities of the cloud once those messages are in pub/sub then you can process those with all the cloud resources that Google provides and so this could be this could mean processing image data and then returning labels or reacting to some sort of condition inside of that image or this could mean warehousing massive fanon of data and then being able to do analytics in real time with it and so that's fun but we're gonna do something a little bit different today and I want to show you some I want to show you this working on hardware and so I have brought with me a an Arduino device and this has sort of been a 20% project of mine it's an experimental library and for those who don't know Arduino is a physical computing platform that's very popular in education and with makers and it allows you to do things like blink lights actuate door or you know actually electro like electronic things which kind of parks back to what gig was speaking about with modern electronics so modern electronics can easily be controlled and actuated from the from Arduino devices and so I'm going to do something so that virtual devices are really good for things like load testing and and like learning about learning about the product and then the our experimental library with Arduino which I cannot recommend that you go with go to production yet as it says on my github account look out its my code and it's also Alvaro's so thank you all borrow for all your contributions and and anyone who's interested in contributing to our Arduino project is welcome to and so now I'm going to go from that virtual device which is you know something is useful for loading to a physical real world device that we can then use for that we can then use for prototyping and other things to get an idea about like when when you have your actual device built on you know one of the one of the the more robust solutions that our partners often offer but so in order to work with our team we know you can just install the library using the library manager and then after that libraries installed inside of the examples will appear Google Cloud IOT four-jaw and inside of here each of these there is is a sketch an argument of sketch is just a way of like a you know a way of specifying a source file and then it's the and it's what is open inside of the IDE and so inside of the sketches this is this header file CI HCC config and then inside of here are all of your your configuration that we just did in the virtual device except as specified with this physical device and I'm just going to connect to a Wi-Fi and it's everything else and this is the same configuration that I just that I just use from before did I this yes that say or the project ID oh yes yes so the project ID is thank you thank you yes this could have saved you a lot of frustration in a minute but yeah so the project ID is that yeah the reason the cloud resource is associated with your with all the things you created a topic and then there is a and then I'm going to do a transform on the private key which I'm going to use as for creating the connection credential and this is a open SSL command that I can never remember but maybe for yeah there's okay so now I've taken that private key and I've turned it into this string that looks a lot like this string and then I'm just gonna replace this string with that string yeah very soon now when I click the run up thank you we're doing a good job that's okay and I make sure you have the right word okay and this is a we recently I added this sport for the genuine boards these are kind of like the Arduino style boards they they have a feel to them that's kind of that's kind of nice anyways so now that I have now that this device has connected let's see me with my logs here I know something is wrong [Music] let's see but the private key is wrong did I do the public one thank you you're the best and this should be EC try this again face it oh I need to save the sketch sorry which has again and it seems I said again oh yeah actually this - no this is SOR do we know strings do support this so this is this isn't working isn't expected let's see here though sometimes the time server doesn't return the right time and that can get me and so if this there you go okay so now it's working yeah so this is an experimental library everybody and I'm yeah so heed my advice yes and that's why you don't shouldn't use in production yet but maybe someday so now so this in this sample like if the configuration message is set to something other than the value one only one light will be on on the board and then if I set the configuration message to one so the configuration for this device is set to 1 instead of 0 or hello then that then 2 lights on the board should turn on and let's see we'll set it to 1 and then everybody watch on that screen it's the the light that comes on is on the left side of the board I think and so we just updated the device configuration and then through my blazing fast internet connection there it is yeah all right ok and so this is nice devices are fun and being able to prototype stuff with Arduino is fantastic actually because you're able to do stuff really quickly and you're able to in just a short period of time and inexpensively get to have an understanding of whether or not something will actually work to the micro who my mic is on do I need to get close to you can we use can we use this mic oh I still attached that's gonna end poorly I just need to get really close to you guys here it's gonna be a great game of telephone so three weeks ago Gus needed to do a demo to this conference yeah he had nothing so he went to the sound guy who's getting him a new battery pack he had some lights he had some project is working with with LEDs and we're back yeah let's see if his sound guy all right and so yeah I had lights and and I thought I thought you all would be much more excited if I showed you robots and and so I had this toy it's a toy like this I want to show you what under here so it's this toy and this little toy has a remember game was talking about digital systems on and offs well this toy has something that I saw this on this toy it's got an infrared receiver and and it has this little remote associated with it which I have smudged off any thing that will hint at what it actually is but this little this little this little toy responds to a blinking light on here and I just showed you a blinking light so what if instead of that little light these signals these commits these configuration messages that are translated to the devices are then instead interpreted into the motion commands for this little toy and I thought that was cool and so I tried I started prototyping and on the board's very similar to that other one I showed you and I came up with this my friend added some player and some character to this little guy and so what happens is when the device comes online the it should wiggle a little bit and that way I will know it's connected to the Wi-Fi so there's a little blinking light that indicates the various stages of the boots and I'm gonna I'm gonna start a flask app alright there it is so when it just nods it nodded its little head there what was going on was it's now connected to its now connected to Wi-Fi oh you do your thing okay it's now connected to Wi-Fi and this is not the device and now I can go into my device registry here again and I can send configuration messages and then control this and what's what's interesting is that no longer is it something that's like a device that's locally here this device could be anywhere and it doesn't really it's and like at the end there could be millions of these devices and you can do things like coordinate across those devices anyway so let's send a configuration message to the device that will cause the device to turn its head and so when the device responds to the command it should just nudge a little bit there there it is okay and so you'll also notice that on the front of this device I have added a sonar sensor and that sonar sensor will pretty accurately measure distance up to about 30 meters away and so let's just do it looks like I wanted to do something that shows like you know getting data from your device's putting that data into the cloud and then processing that data so we very similar to what we do in the code lab and so I created that little flasks app and then this little flasks app has this UI that only a developer could love but when I click that button it sends a configuration change a configuration message to this device if I'm lucky if it's not cached see and and that configuration message will trigger this device to start moving in this sort of sonar pattern and I mean these are toys so I mean it's not gonna turn exactly the same amount of degrees every time but it's close enough that we can kind of get a general idea for the surroundings around this robot and then on the blazing fast internet to Mike computer it should render oh that's nice okay still good it's still good all right and so then we render it's alright to clap so then we render so a graph kind of of the surroundings of this device and so adding it so adding the internet capabilities to this toy was as easy as adding just adding a hat on top of it and also the the because of because of the the low requirements for the hardware for for cloud IOT core I'm able to build these hats at a cost of you know maybe just five dollars and so you can imagine that you can imagine in your factory or in your store or in your office or wherever that were you wherever you have these these modern electronic systems that you can communicate with with Internet connected devices then you can add internet capabilities to those devices and because they're because they're so inexpensive we actually no longer have to show my laptop the it's actually possible to produce a large number of these devices in a relatively short period of time and then kind of have some fun with them so after the sometime after this conference I'm gonna try to open-source to software so if you all want to make your own little Internet connected toys and kind of get an idea for how these kinds of things work you can check it out and for now I'm gonna do the thing that everyone wants me to do whenever I show them the robots and that is make them move as a swarm army okay and it's a it's at times like this that I really appreciate how little data the cloud IOT core product sips because I am totally not using my phone for connecting these devices totally is all right we should have a bunch of online there we go okay and it's just about time for them to March all right and we'll go back to and thank you gage for wrangling all these robots all right since then oh look out robots go it's the Wi-Fi it's probably the Wi-Fi but I mean they're blinking really pretty though they are blinking really pretty I feel pretty good about that there they go yeah so there it is thank you we have a jumper oh all right all right they've already become attention this one's trying to break free yeah yes I also wanted to do this just to make this Sunday gave haptic dancer out on stage all right so let's go back to the slides and we'll just wrap up okay so so so going back to so going back to other other approaches to to adding smart and intelligent capabilities to your devices we would be you know we I want to again say you know like there's other ways of doing this than just complete delegations in the cloud you can use edge border routing to to use to extend the capabilities of nearby devices to other devices you can use on divide smarts with things like Android things so if you have all the capabilities without the cloud or some capabilities shared with the cloud Android thinks is really great way to do this and also there's a we have stack as Gabe mentioned at the very beginning we have stackdriver logging and and snatch driver logins or some people can get them a lot of information about things like security audits and other like in that combined with the metadata of devices may be enough for a lot of what people's IOT needs are and because because we went a little bit over of the wrap up quickly and all that gate closes out so we want to hear from you how you about the the this talk so please go here and enter in our talk the cloud IRT overview thank you for coming if you wanted [Applause] [Music]
