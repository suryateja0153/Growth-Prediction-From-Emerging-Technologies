 [Music] welcome thanks everyone for coming this afternoon my name's Fraser McDonald I am a product guy on an IOT cloud at Google and I'm John hood I'm CTO at smart parking a company that's using IOT core so thank you all for joining us we want to ask you a question just to get things rolling here just to get a bit of a sense of who's joining us this afternoon for the next 45 50 minutes so just by some hands how many in the crowd today are working directly for a municipality okay so we got some hands from people that are working with cities themselves how about people that are working for vendors that serve municipalities okay so a good number there as well how about people who have lived in a city Oh what do you know all right so we've got some subject matter experts here that's great and I say that kind of a half kiddingly but one of the one of the points that John and I want to talk about today is a bit of an idea of who are we building these smart cities for what is the the reason for making him not just how you make him so I think everyone in the audience has got a bit of a voice in that so thanks for joining us so let's warm up with a bit of a teaser take a look at this kind of echocardiogram looking thing off to the side here and see if you might recognize some patterns in it does anyone have any ideas of what we might be looking at yeah you have some urban areas some parking they're definitely urban areas you're right in fact if we show the names here we're looking at some familiar areas you got the bay area off to the side New York London Tokyo San Francisco so what we're looking at here is movements of people on their mobile devices every one of these dots is somebody that has opted in in Google Maps on their phone for location tracking so you've taken that data anonymized it collected it and you're looking at the living breathing city here this is a 24 hour cycle of where people are going what they're up to and this is enormous ly valuable data it gives us a bit of a sense of context for what we're talking about today that there's an incredible amount of information it's available to us if we can make use of it so this is for people's personal uses on their phones and maps and seeing where they been but imagine how useful data like this could be to people who are planning traffic patterns people who are trying to plan pickup routes for waste management somebody who's trying to get a new freeway going somebody who's trying to choose where the next neighbourhood the businesses should grow in we're seeing a growth in mobile devices we're seeing a growth in IOT devices and we're seeing a simultaneous growth in the ability to process this data on a massive scale so this is just the beginning of smart cities we're getting into a really exciting age for it so question you might have expected coming to a tech conference coming to a Google conference that we're gonna talk purely about technology and is this what smart cities mean the technologies so yes and oh yes in that these are definitely ingredients of a smart city I mean having access to Wi-Fi is what gives us the ability to collect data having RFID transit passes are fantastic resources for municipal planners to know when and where are people going so we can make smarter routes having self-driving cars are gonna be an enormous overhaul of what it means to live and be transported inside of our cities but these are ingredients I mean in the same way that any ingredients alone don't make a cake this isn't the smart city itself what John and I want to talk about today is a bit of a shift and we're wondering if you join us in this shift from thinking about a couple of the nouns a couple of technologies of smart cities to a few adjectives that might describe them so over the next little bit we're gonna do a few things one is I'm gonna share a few stories of what we've learned at Google from some projects that we've been involved in that overlap with the smart city space so a bit of stories that we've had some learning from and a bit of what ifs and then we're gonna hear from John and John's gonna tell us well if that's the what if this is what it actually looks like John and his company are building the kind of infrastructures for cities around the world right now that let them make good use of their data and we're gonna wrap up with a Q&A so before we dive into some of these stories that we've learned from I should call out that this session is one in which we have Dory so you might have been in a session this morning that has Dory as well it's a Q&A tool that we've got at Google and we're rolling it out and trying it at this conference so if you go into the mobile app that you have for this conference and you go to our session you might notice that there's a QA portion in it where throughout the car to see something that looks interesting or a question crosses your mind in the moment you can write a Q&A question and the rest of your fellow audience members can then vote it up and at the end of the session we'll mix a bit of microphone questions and Dory questions from our moderator who will read that I would so if a question crosses your mind feel free to hop onto your app and ask it as we go okay so let's take a look at some stories of what we've learned at Google from some smart city adjacent and overlapping projects what's the first adjective that comes to mind the first adjective of smart cities that at least John and I when we were sat down and to sitting down a chat about this thought I was efficient and I think there's a reason for that is because it comes up the most regularly for smart cities take a look at this this is the list of the most common smart city projects that are underway right now in the world and if you're taking a look at it you'll probably notice a bit of a pattern to it as well you've got parking street lighting wasting energy management and then a whole bunch of transportation logistics and optimization these are efficiency problems and one part of it might be yeah these are the low-hanging fruit these are areas where an IOT sensor or actuator can really help and not be too complex of a rollout but another big reason for this is these are areas of high ROI each one of these is making the city better able to spend its money or better able to allocate its resources and a really important adjective of a smart city is one that is not wasteful with its resources so what does an efficient smart city look like in the project that we've worked on some of you might remember this demo from next 2017 this is a bit of a what-if this is something that we showed which is taxi cabs driving around a city so we've got some simulated fleets of taxis across New York and these taxis are kitted out with something that's a little different and instead of having just a display ad in the back that's showing you a clip or an ad for something they're also location aware they know where they're picking up where they're headed what time of day it is and with just a little bit of that information we were able to personalize the ads to whoever might be riding in the car with an incredible amount of accuracy it's a tiny bit of additional data but it produces a huge oak so this is an example for ads but imagine this kind of intelligence if it were applied to real-time traffic control if your city or your building a tool Forest City was able to equip the city's traffic control measures to respond to floats and parades to respond to an event that spontaneously happens to respond to live traffic conditions or imagine if this kind of real-time data and a little bit of location in time awareness was able to affect waste collection so that's exactly this next example this is a company called an AVO and their Google customer and they're building something pretty cool which is a waste management solution and instead of being the traditional take on waste management which is usually sort of schedule oriented and you know you know your time when you're gonna get a pickup the truck comes by they pick up your bin whether it's full or not and they drive off I never decided that they were going to add some sensors in a bit of an intelligence to the process so they're parking or rather they're a waste management solution is aware of how much trash is in the bin they sell this to companies that need a more efficient pickup schedule and all they did was put a couple sensors in to know when trash is getting full and slapped a GPS on their trucks and out of a small change like that their customers got better service because they had reliable pickup and didn't have to think about scheduling so much is starting to think about waste management as a service and they themselves got better optimization out of the route because they could tell the drivers exactly where to go and where they were needed so what's another adjective that might give us a bit of a place to start for smart cities participatory so what would that mean there are a couple of perspectives you could take on this and one of them is participation of the people that live in the cities themselves so here's another project that we had some overlap with at Google some of you in the audience might recognize where in the world we are flying over right now this is Japan and specifically this is an image that was captured back in 2011 when in the Fukushima area of Japan there were three nuclear reactors that melted down and it was a major public safety concern and there was a pretty incredible response in 2011 what we're looking at here is a couple people in Japan that were citizens put together Geiger counter kits they were makers and tinkerers and shipped them out to people other citizens around the country who got him built him connected him up to the web on a platform called patch Bay at the time and overlaid it on top of Google's maps and what you're seeing here is people getting involved in producing and engaging with the data of their own cities to make them smarter this was real-time intelligence on should I be in my area am i safe now this is an interesting impersonal one for me because this platform patch Bay went on to become the SciVal a IOT enterprise platform that Google just bought earlier this year and is getting rolled in as part of the IOT core cloud offering the next one here is sidewalk labs you might have heard of this one as a sister company of Google underneath alphabet and sidewalk has a mandate to not think about the city of next year or three years from now they're thinking about this what might cities look like 20 or 40 years from now so this is another project we're involved with it gives a bit of an idea of where why might we be headed and sidewalks taken on a really ambitious project it's another one that's a little bit personal to me as as a Toronto by myself growing up not too far from that watercolor toothpick on the left there this is a micro city that sidewalks taking on in Toronto they're gonna wire up absolutely everything from the municipal infrastructure to the transportation to waste management to lighting and they're gonna try to figure out what can we do with the data so this story is just beginning the sidewalk story is just starting but what would it look like if we wanted to try to affect some of these changes and play with some of these ideas right now we've done some of these projects as Google what are some of the tools as GCP that we're rolling out so that we can help companies and municipalities try some of these ideas themselves so how might I tackle efficiency in participatory city let's take a look at Google Cloud IOT for a minute so like much of GCP we're building on the exact same tools and stack that we build on for our own products when you're looking at the Google Maps infrastructure you're looking at the same company that's producing GCP tools for your company to use and we took the same approach with IOT this is an example of what an infrastructure might look like for powering a smart city project using a couple of GCP building blocks so when I left we've got our devices whatever they might be whether those are occupancy sensors they're smart energy meters they are watching out for traffic patterns these are the devices on the left that have something to say or that might be controlled like a stoplight and the tool that we put together in the middle here is cloud IOT core so this is a recent product we've started rolling out specifically for this use case there are a lot of GCP ingestion tools for huge amounts of data like pub/sub but the unique thing about cloud IOT core is that it's also meant for talking back and it specifically meant for devices so this is something that can run with any hardware that your city is bringing along any sensor or actuator over a number of different protocols mqtt is a lightweight protocol for devices that are a bit more resource constrained HTTP for something that has a bit more compute power and overhead and doesn't need quite that but this is a way for you to give your devices a unique identity and be able to talk back and forth with them and tie them in to the rest of the GCP ecosystem so you can start making use of their data and we're gonna talk a bit more about the rest of this picture of what is making use of their data look like just in a minute what we're looking at here is a bit of add these blocks together and we can start playing with the ideas that we were looking at in a couple slides earlier all right let's take a look at a couple more adjectives responsive so responsive seems self-evident you would want a smart city to be one that can correct if something's going wrong is something that's aware of what's happening in its own grounds and something that feels like it's not just all operating on autopilot what's an example of something responsive well here's an example of something that we've learned a bit from at Google and this is a parking feature that we've rolled out which is based entirely on machine learning this isn't the same level of granularity as what John's about to talk to us about in a minute this is just high-level this is just a bit of information on where people are sometimes and tried to make some estimations on traffic patterns and parking patterns based on that so if I'm planning a trip to the mall or I'm going to a city I've never been to I can get a bit of an idea of it looks like I should go at 10 a.m. instead of 4:00 p.m. and this is an example of something that doesn't just show you where the parking lots are it's responsive to when you might want to be there what's another adjective self-aware so this is one that I find really interesting and really important in the smart city space and it's quarter rolling out any new programs as a municipality or its core to being a vendor to the cities because you can't make good decisions unless you know what's going on in your own grounds what a self-aware look like for a city well a lot of you I bet have used Street View before I was just doing a trip last weekend and had never been south on Highway one before and was using Street View to check out a couple of towns and where's a nice spot for a hotel so that's an example of how I can get a bit of an awareness as a consumer but one thing that we learned at Google from Street View was the incredible richness of image data and this picture that we're looking at was useful to me is somebody taking a ride but how could it be useful to a city you might also be familiar with google lens as a consumer something else that makes a bit of intelligence from images this is an example of I take a picture of a flower or I can have that flower identified for me it was something that rolled out at a recent IO and is chasing that exact same problem of well we've got a lot of image data in cities these days is there anything we can do with that so this is a consumer example what might that look like in a smart city context how can I take these adjectives responsive and self-aware and look at some Google tools that would let me chase that that would let me learn from that so I'm pretty excited to be able to chat about this one today as it's a relatively new idea that some of our teams have been playing around with and it's a combination between some of our learnings from Street View and our machine learning and image processing tools and the GCP tools that are offered publicly so none of this is you have to ask for special permission this is all GCP tool capabilities but it's an idea that we are looking actively for early partners on so if it looks like something that's interesting to you reach out to me after the talk Geno lens is the consumer product it will take an image and tell you a rough idea of what's in the image what you might also know is that inside GCP there are a couple image processing tools that go deeper than that the vision API is effectively that for your apps if you're building something that has a photo capability you can send the image to the cloud vision API and it will return with a level of confidence what it thinks is in that image and that's great for a lot of you use cases if you want to be able to tell yeah this is a car or this is a park or this is a tree it's an incredibly powerful thing to build in with absolute simplicity to an app but what if I wanted to go one level deeper what if a city really wanted to get to know what's going on on its grounds without having to kit out an enormous sensor network let's go one level deeper to the next product called Auto ml and this is where you can start training your own image recognition models so this starts to get really powerful as cities start wanting to ask questions about what's going on on our grounds now our own Street View imagery isn't publicly available and isn't available to process for a number of privacy reasons but images that a city is taking itself are well within their right to process so what might it look like to take a look for are there trees close to powerlines that might be a risk right now are there potholes in the road that we might need to be keeping track of these two products are built for exactly that cloud vision API gives you a good idea of what's in a picture and is dead simple they integrate to your applications you pass it an image it passes back what it thinks is in that image if you want to go one level deeper and you're working on an application for a city that says we'd love to help you answer a very specific problem then cloud auto ml will let you very simply with and without a data scientist on your team create new models that will allow you to identify what you're looking for so imagine what this could do for cities if you could get a better idea of real estate value out of images if you could take a look at where are we at risk for a tree falling on a line where are we looking promising for new areas of growth based on businesses and buildings that are booming in that area an idea of could we look for indicators of energy surge of production could we look for measures quantitatively of development of poverty of living conditions in our cities these are tools that are on GCP today so we've talked to Cup a bit about a couple of the projects that were working on at Google and we've talked a bit about what we learned from them and what are some of the GCP tools that might help you ask those same questions in your cities let's go one level deeper imagine if you were never stuck looking for parking and to answer that question please join me in welcoming Upjohn [Applause] thanks Fraser yeah we're living in a changing world aren't we and parking is one of the things that we live with which really sucks and so I just want to tell you a little bit about who we are and what we've been doing for now 15 years we've had to build a lot of Technology ourselves because there are no standards but we're doing it in the real world every day today so we're based out of several locations around the world Australia New Zealand and the UK we actually dog food our own technology in the UK and we run the hundreds and hundreds of car parks across the UK with our own technology but in New Zealand in Australia and other parts of the world we have a number of very significant smart parking systems in place tens of thousands of sensors we build sensors that go in the ground just like that yes just want an example of one it's not much bigger than a D size battery and it has to last for up to 10 years in the ground so that's sort of things that we do so we've had to do Hardware we've had to do software we have to do networking etc and it's all powered today on Google cloud platform so this is just a quick list of some of the cities that today are using the smart parking solution and we're starting this is a still journey in in progress you know a lot of the things that we're doing are still just the very basics of just show me where a car park is you know tell the city or the business how the parking is used you know it being used efficiently and effectively and continuously or is it underused or is it overused is the pricing right are the types of rules such as how much time you're allowed to park in a certain parking spot actually appropriate etc so these are just some of the cities that we're running today and the big question where we're starting to pose is what about your city so today we already you know as you can appreciate we've had to build a comprehensive range of solutions and this diagram just illustrates some of the types of functionality targets or audiences that this technology delivers to first of all the person in the car driving we deliver a broad range of applications which give guidance and information about parking spaces as using Google Maps using Street View is all that sort of interactivity that convenience that connection with you and so that you understand what's actually happening and where you're going and then and then finally be able to actually pay for that parking session whether it be a pay for what you use so you know a timer starts to just tick away the time and when you've finished your car parking session and you drive away it closes that session and we do that today or you know it can be fixed you know prepaid you know you pay for 20 minutes or pay for 30 minutes or whatever so that's one class of application that we are delivering and just last week we delivered two new application two new versions of that application to customers in other cities the enforcement officer you know I know you know this is probably the least desirable aspect of parking but there are people that need to actually go along the streets and and effectively and efficiently manage where the cars that are just not playing by the rules right and and and do the necessary thing of putting a ticket on your window now what we give is live real-time information to those officers on the street telling them exactly where the car is exactly how much they paid when did it expire etc etc etc so and this is real-time information a lot of what Fraser was just talking about it's about being alive the city is alive and and these sort of things need to be constantly moving talking about IOT one of the things that we have found well is a necessity of parking is that this is actually legally enforceable IOT as you well know as being drivers and and you know you've ridden the cars and parked on cars we all have right a car can actually leave a parking space and another one pull in right away right and we're talking about wouldn't a second assuming you're not speeding too fast but it happens really really fast and if we didn't detect when that new car comes in we could give a parking ticket to that second arrival we can't allow that and this is actually the rigor and the significance of the class of IOT that parking is now also as I commented before this is a battery operated thing and it has to last for years but meanwhile we're doing this real-time communications we buried in the ground and it's usually in concrete or timac cement and so on it's very very nasty for radio communications we've had to develop that type of radio communications and finally we put big metal things overtop of it right which also gets in the way of doing reliable secure robust radio communications so these are the sort of this is the class the edge of IOT that parking is all about in smart parking has solved and I can tell you you know we've got a lot of wounds on our backs a lot of a lot of scars from learning this technology and in fact as I commented you know dogfooding our own technology has been a really really good way to make sure that we do the right thing what has actually started to come back to us from our customers you know from those cities from those customers who are utilizing our smart parking platform is once they put those gateways those communication Gateway's onto their lampposts right and getting power and and network connectivity to them either through 3G 4G or or some sort of other communications mechanisms that gateway becomes a very strategic element for building out more sensing and more capability into the smart city infrastructure and and the solutions that a city wants to actually deliver and so what we've we've been actually being told by our customers and we're responding to is building an open platform and open framework which enables smart cities and so it's not just about parking it's actually about modern life in cities pretty much as Fraser and I am talking about now and where this is taking us is actually in to building a broad range of solutions that sit on top of the smart cloud platform which is completely GCP it's actually 100% pure service as well there is no Linux operating system in it there is no Windows operating system in it it is completely built utilizing GCP serverless computing components and this is really exciting because I believe this is actually the future for how we build large-scale internet scale global scale live network computing systems which is essentially what I'm going to talk about here now the first building block that we utilized was the cloud core IOT functionality that Google provided and we did this we started using it around about two years ago prior to that we'd actually been building our own our own IOT framework for managing our devices but as we were listening to our customers and seeing the need for right before smart cities we needed an open IOT framework and it just did not make sense to reinvent that wheel especially when you had solid serverless technology that was also going to be driven by the market that was going to be open and flexible that we didn't I just our team didn't need to rebuild we didn't even need to support it you know we don't need to now maintain that technology and we can trust that GCP and Google are going to drive that more and more into the the functionality requirements of the market and we just are able to benefit from it and as I commented before this is actually giving us city scale live responsiveness we are doing today with those cities that I listed before in the order of about a million and a half to two million event sensor event transactions per day what you might not have noticed also on that slide that previous one that diagram was we also do cameras you know there's especially in in the UK we do a lot of number plate recognition and we're doing about a million images per week and and so that's the class of computing the class of the capacity of data that we're processing through this platform called smart cloud the following three things that I talk about here is one of the one of the objectives of our smart cloud platform was to actually eliminate the need to have software developers involved in everything that a customer wants we wanted to enable the customer to build their own dashboards their live dashboards to display them anywhere that they needed to without requiring us to go and hack some code the same is true for data analytics and data processing and what we have actually done is we've used bigquery and data studio which is a fantastic tool you know isn't it my analogy is you know Gmail to email is data studio to Big Data it's actually that is free like Gmail is is it's an amazing tool and I'll show you in a moment just from some displays of those sort of reports that we're generating directly from smart cloud which is using bigquery underneath it the same is true for business rules for parking there are very complex processes for managing business rules in a time of day when parking can occur for certain types of uses of that parking when is enforcement being enabled and when is it not certain car parking spaces may become non car parking spaces that set for 30 to allow traffic flow all those rules including also other things such as has a payment arrived have they overstayed their welcome and that parking space because they've gone beyond the maximum period you're allowed to park so all those business rules which historically we wrote custom code into the system and you know had some sort of a UI that you type in some data you know typically into a database now what we have is an if this thin there that rules engine which processes us continuously and I mentioned our mobile apps for guidance and payments and other things in fact the app area is just so significant and you know we're all users of apps what we also realized was you just don't want to have yet another app you know and it is you know there are a number of surveys that have already shown that you know after 90 days or so of getting a smartphone you don't typically don't load on the rap you know getting that footprint onto your phone is really really hard and so what we've built is an app framework obviously we have you know full functional apps and a smart parking app on the App Store's today is our app and and a variety of cities a number of the cities that I listed there have taken that out app and we've we've actually branded it and facilitated and with functions that this is appropriate for them but more interestingly is taking those components such as the guidance component or the payment component and embedding it in your own app and so that's the framework for mobile apps that we've also developed and finally managed API API is actually how you integrates how you enable innovation with ourselves internally how you work with partners and and software vendors as well as integration with city systems and so a full suite of of managed api's which are and that is using the apogee technology from Google cloud you know guess what so just want to quickly now show you if we can switch to the demo yay I must admit we had a little bit of a network issue as I sort of walked up but here here's a live picture of one of the cities it's actually Wellington City the capital of New Zealand so one end of the world and and what we've got here is I can unzoom Ian into the city these are the parking bays that I around the city of Wellington and I can see that that's been vacant for 38 minutes this is live live data right from the city right and this is just one aspect of visualization and because it's built into dashboards I can do such things that I push it into full-screen mode and display you know you can put it onto big screens elsewhere every every one of these dashboards is just a URL and one of the powerful things is I can create my own dashboards and there are some default ones there's the data smart zone is what we call our infrastructure area where we can monitor and see see the infrastructure and and what you saw earlier on and phrases slide is that that sort of map of the city's activities going on well here where we've got on one of the other what we call tiles is actually the 24-hour cycle of the heat map of the parking utilisation on the city and this is just another bit of insight that we're providing cities if you notice just just some of the things prove this is real-time you can see the the numbers changing there those are parking events that are happening on the other side of the world right now here's another city this is Hamilton City in New Zealand as well and I think I've lost the other ones I was going to also show a couple of cities like Cardiff and so on so can we go back to our slides so just going back to those sort of smart city requirements one of the things that we in smart parking and in the smartpak a solution I have to respond to and pretty much what Fraser was talking about is just live streaming this constant this instantaneous world that we live in and this is a change for how computing needs to be done it's no longer store something to do a database then retrieve it do some sort of processing on it produce a report and then store it back into a database etc things have to be instantaneous and responsive you know for example if you were driving down the street and you're using Google Maps and it took twenty seconds to sort of give you the next turn you'll probably be on the wrong Street up a tree or something like that so this is the new norm is live streaming the efficiency and convenience and I've been talking just indicated the things like apps that we're delivering the dashboards providing those dashboards to any display whether it be a display on on a street because it's a URL anywhere there's a browser that can be displayed and one one of the the experiments that we were actually working through is just using Android Android things to display that in remote places on to other displays and this is really great for providing that convenience of information where it's pertinent and a dashboard can be just for example how many bays are in this area of a street or in this honest floor of a parking building and so this is all about connecting insights to you and the UI mean here is there are many different audiences you know it can be you the the user of parking but it may also be the city strategist who wants to have understanding of the of what's actually really going on either the uses and mechanisms that are being operated for the parking is it optimal for the city you know as we all know it becomes very very inconvenient and and challenging when you're circling round and round blocks just trying to find that Park now using this real-time data accurate data we can take you right to that Park and when it changes we net we're letting you know as well what we're doing is we're starting to create the ability to enable new outcomes and we've done that both on the technology so rather than using classical computing and I actually class using standard traditional servers and server os's as being classical we've gone completely service completely what I call cloud native for this platform it's essentially the same way that Gmail works the same way that Google search works is how we've built smart smart cloud our platform and it's enabling ourselves and also our customers to actually achieve new outcomes and this is driving us to become more responsive with our roadmap you know a road map is no longer a 12-month road map it's actually dynamic and changing because the way we're implementing the functionality and the way we're enabling our customers to also have their roadmaps of functionality is is in a much more agile in a much more modular and freed democratized manner democratizing over word used word I think in this conference so here's just a quick view of the architecture of smart cloud and as you can see it's heavily GCP and as I mentioned totally service so I see core is where we ingest and we send out messages from and we also manage these tens and tens of thousands of devices both the gateways and the sensors that are actually in the streets or in the parking buildings I don't know if you've been to parking buildings where you see the red green lights over parking bays it's quite common in some some parts the world certainly it's very popular on in Australasia and and it changes your whole dynamic you drive into your parking building and you literally will just glance out of the periphery of your vision too seed a parking spot yet and yeah and then we put signs throughout just saying okay there are five up on level four and there are twelve up on level five and so on and and also just be able to glance at other site so this sort of information is all being managed by IIT core both the the measurement and also the control of those indicators for example we're also managing the data in a very dynamic ways I talked about using bigquery as the fundamental core for big data but simultaneously we're using BigTable which is essentially the engine underneath Google search to also manage this parking events in real time and then the API is I commented about four dashboards for payments and and actually any application so over to you now hopefully that's given you a taste of what we do the point is that what we're doing is real-world IOT that is trying to and is actually reinventing the experience for cities already [Music]
