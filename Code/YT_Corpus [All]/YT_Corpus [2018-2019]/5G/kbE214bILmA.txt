 5G. Incredible technology that will instantly connect everything – people, places and billions of things. The future the mobile wireless industry has dreamed about. And with Sprint’s deep spectrum capacity, mobile 5G will soon be a reality. No other U.S. carrier has Sprint’s amount of high-speed, high-capacity, mobile-ready 5G bandwidth. Sprint is putting its spectrum advantage to work with a game-changing, new technology called Massive MIMO. This radio moves massive amounts of data. Compared to today’s most advanced radios with 8 transmitters and 8 receivers, our Massive MIMO radios offer 64 of each. That's 128 antennae elements. This dramatically increases the data capacity of cell sites up to 10 times that of current LTE systems, while expanding and directing the horizontal and vertical reach of data. This process is called 3-D beamforming, where data travels faster and more precisely outward and upward. It boosts coverage for people on the ground and those in tall buildings. Sprint is beginning to roll out this innovative Massive MIMO technology in major markets this year, delivering better coverage and download speeds than before in high traffic areas, even indoors. Plus, Massive MIMO can deliver Gigabit LTE and 5G through the same radio, at the same time! This will allow customers to enjoy all the tech they depend on today, while paving the way for them to enjoy a seamless 5G experience starting next year. Get ready for dreams to become reality as Sprint builds out its Next-Gen Network on the road to launching the first 5G mobile network.
