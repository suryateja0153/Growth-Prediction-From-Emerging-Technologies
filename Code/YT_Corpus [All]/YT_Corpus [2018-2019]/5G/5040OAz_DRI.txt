 Hello Friends... welcome to my Channel...Anand from Anand Technical Support If You are study on 5G or you want to study on 5G Need to Keep some point in Your mind If You will compare LTE and 5G Then You will see Most of the part of 5G is Overlap with LTE only small portions of new items are to be implemented in 5G and Some small feature of LTE is modified We can see here All red color whatever feature is showing like..Multiple numerology mmWave, Massive MIMO Beam Management, LDPC, SDAP Layer These are newly implemented in 5G NR and BLUE section is showing as Uplink Waveform, Subframe structure, HARQ These feature is modified in 5G/NR Today in this Video i will discuss about all the feature Which is implemented in 5G like Multiple Numerology mmWave Massive MIMO Beam Management LDPC/Polar Coding SDAP Layer All the feature I will discuss here one by one It is important that you stay connected with me to the end of the video... If you watching this video on you tube..the plick click on red subscribe button ..and bell button to enable the email notification If you watching this video on facebook then please click to like and follow the page You will get the notification when i will upload the video Now i will start Multiple Numerology ...Numerology means 'Subcarrier Spacing’ in simple way In LTE, there is only one numerology or we can say one subcarrier spacing is used which is 15 KHz In LTE, There is no any specific term is used to indicate 'Sub-carrier spacing because in LTE There is only one 'Subcarrier Spacing’ is used Now we can see the LTE Frame structure Duration of 1 LTE Frame length is 10ms One Frame is divided in 10 subframe of 1ms of each Each subframe is divided in 2 slot, 0.5 ms of each slot and each slot contain either 6 or 7 OFDM symbol is present and its depend on cyclic prefix if cyclic prefix is Normal CP then then 7 OFDM symbol will use in one slot and if extended CP then 6 symbol will use in one slot in LTE Radio resource are located in unit of physical resource block each Resource Block contain 12 subcarrier and one slot will available if normal CP use Then PRB contain 12 subcarrier over 7 OFDM symbol if extended CP then PRB contain total 6 OFDM will present each slot ..each resource block contain 12*7=84 resource element in case of normal CP and 12*6 =72 resource elemnt for extended CP Space between subcarrier and next subcarrier is 15 KHz Then total space is 12*15KHz=180 KHz Resource Block occupied 12*15KHz that means 180 KHz in frequency domain and 0.5 ms in time domain Resource block is smallest unit of Resources.....that can be allocated to a user Resource block is 180 KHz wide in frequency domain and 1 slot long in time domain but in 5G NR, There are diff type of subcarrier spacing is used like 0,1,2,3,4... 0 for 15 KHz, 1 for 30 KHz, 2 for 60 KHz 3 for 120 KHz and 4 for 240 KHz used in 5G NR subcarrier spacing type.. ..2 is used for 60 KHz and it is used for Normal and extended and remaining all subcarrier spacing type is used for normal CP If we see the overall subframe If talk about sub Carrier space These all subcarrier spacing like...15 30 60 120 and 240.... for these all subcarrier spacing number of symbol in slot is same...and slot length is different Total 14 OFDM Symbol in one slot and it is same for all subcarrier spacing and slot length is different for each subcarrier spacing Number of slot in subframe is also different for 15 KHz subcarrier spacing total number of subcarrier is 12 and.. Space between subcarrier and next subcarrier is 15 KHz so.. Total space is 12*15=180 KHz and same for 30KHz...Sub carrier spacing Total number of subcarrier is 12.... ..which is similar to 15 KHz subcarrier spacing But space between subcarrier and next subcarrier is 30KHz so total subcarrier spac is 12 * 30 =360KHz That means 360 KHz That means Resource block occupy 360 KHz in frequency domain Now 60 KHz subcarrier spacing It is similar to 15 and 30 KHz in term of number of subcarrier Number of subcarrier is 12 and space between subcarrier and next subcarrier is 60 KHz so Total space is 12*60=720KHz That means 720 KHz in freq domain as same, now 120 KHz ..sucarrier spacing.... Total subcarrier spacing is 12*120=1440KHz and for 240 KHz subcarrier spacing...Total space is 12*240=2880KHz in freq domain Now we will see the frame structure for all the numerology 1st is for zero...is 15 KHz For 1st numerology 0 0 means it is for 15 KHz Number of symbol in one slot is 14 Number of slot in one frame is 10 Number of slot in one subframe is 1 Here we can see the numerology 0 Frame 0..length is 10ms in Frame 0..Total number of subframe will be ten....and 10 subframe contain 10 slot means... one subframe = 1 slot = 1ms and in one slot Total no of OFDM symbol will be 14 symbol and subcarrier spacing is 15 KHz Now for second numerology 1 It is 30 KHz subcarrier spacing number of symbol will be 14 symbol in one slot Number of slot in frame is 20 and Number of slot in one subframe is 2...Here we can see..... Frame 0 which contain total number of subframe is 10....but number of slot is 20 That means one subframe contain 2 slot that means 0.5 ms each slot is available 14 OFDM symbol will be available for each slot...slot length is 0.5 ms and subcarrier spacing size is 30KHz Now for 3rd Numerology....is 2 it is for 60 KHz Subcarrier spacing As per prev numerology 0 and 1 Number of symbol will be same 14 for 60 KHz subcarrier spacing Number of slot in frame is 40 slot Number of slot in one subframe is 4... slot in one frame total 40 slot and in one subframe total 4 slot will be present Here we can see in frame 0, total number of subframe is 10 subframe but number of slot but...number of slot will be 40 slot in 10 subframe that means one subframe contain 4 slot will be available that means size of each slot is 1/4=0.25ms....0.25ms = 1 slot and 14 symbol will be available in each 0.25ms slot subcarrier spacing size is 60 KHz Now next numerology is 3...It is for 120 KHz subcarrier spacing Here we can see... Total number of symbol is 14 in each slot Total number of slot in each frame is 80... for each frame.... In one frame ..total 80 slot is available total number of slot is 8 slot in each subframe As per frame structure frame 0....total number of subframe is 10 but number slot is 80 for 10ms subframe that means one subframe contains 8 slot there.. size of each slot is 1ms/8 = 0.125ms and 0.125 ms slot contain total 14 symbol will be available and subcarrier spacing size will be 120 KHz Now we will discuss over mmWave Technology Millimeter wave, which is also known as extremely high frequency (EHF) or very high frequency (VHF) if we talk about freq range Millimeter wave (also millimeter band) is the band of spectrum between 30 gigahertz (Ghz) to 300 GHz. Here Formula is ...lemda equal to c by f...where lemda is wavelength and f is frequency One question come here ...Why its name is mmWave Radio signals are measured by their wavelengths. The shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency. because lemda = c/f , lemda is wavelength...and f is frequency That means wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency Frequency will be heigher the wavelength lemda will be very small Here i told...mmwave is the band of spectrum between 30 gigahertz (Ghz) to 300 GHz. If we will convert 30 GHz in millimeter then it will be approx 10 millimeter and if you will convert 300 GHz in mmwave ...then it will be 1 millimeter That means mmwave have short wave length .... range from 10 millimeter to 1 millimeter 5G signals will use wavelengths (between 30 and 300 gigahertz) that are measured in millimeters. That's why 5G is considered a millimeter wave technology Two type of frequency range is define in 5G-NR in 3GPP First one is Sub 6GHz range is called FR1 and millimeter wave range is called FR2 Already i have discussed in last slide some subcarrier spacing that means 15 KHz and 30KHz which is only used in sub 6GHz That means in FR1 and some subcarrier spacing like..120 KHz can be used in mmwave range That means for FR2 and some subcarrier spacing like 60 KHz can be used for both sub 6 GHz and mmwave range 60 GHZ will use for both FR1 and FR2 That means 15 and 30 KHz will use for FR1 and 120 KHz will use as millimeter wave 120 KHz will use for millimeter and 60 KHz will use for both sub 6GHz and millimeter Here if we talk about channel bandwidth...then it is calculated on the basis of number of RB, number of subcarrier, subcarrier spacing and guard band If we talk about 60MHz then it is divided in some part Total 60MHz... where some part is for transmission bandwidth where all the data is transmitted and some part will use as guard band in lte we know that..in 20 MHz Total number of Resource block is 100 Resource block for 20MHz
