 Thank you so much for coming to 5g and what it means my name is Len forcus and My company is called milestone communications. We build and own cell phone towers were based in Washington DC area just to give you a little context about Uli I've been involved with Eli for Almost 20 years. I was the chair of Eli Washington and also chair of the District Council program. I'm a former trustee and it's really really fun to be invited to talk about something that I Purposely transitioned my business toward in prior years. I was a landscape architect apartment developer worked for a home builder We did master plan community development built retail centers owned office buildings So I've had a pretty broad real estate career But about in 2000 I got really interested in the cell tower business and the reason Was because I looked at it as if it was a reflectively vertical real estate But what convinced me to start a company to build cell towers was a trip I took the Phoenix visiting my brother-in-law and I noticed on a high school there was one of the light poles that lit the field that was taller than the other light poles and There were antennas above the lights and I looked at and I thought oh my god That's a that's a cell tower and the landscape architect. Didn't me? Thought that is a really good design solution to conceal the infrastructure because everyone has a universal hatred for cell towers because Their period a period scarves in the landscape and so I started a business to effectively partner with municipalities and school systems and also power companies to build towers on their properties and conceal them in a way where they could be acceptable to the community and and so that's that's that's the context of How I got into the wireless business Fast forward to today. I've got 50 partnerships in six states. I've built over a hundred and fifty towers and leased rooftops lease infrastructure water tanks and so forth So I come from a real estate background with a technology twist And so I'm not the expert on 5g but at least I hope that my goal today is to be able to Share with you some of the jargons some of the trends some of the things that are happening in the wireless industry Kind of paint a picture for you And then and really open it up to questions Because I know that you're all here because you want to you have questions you have one I have answered whether it's on your assets or on properties or Just general where where technology is going but this is I just want to share with you a couple of pictures of stuff that I build because I'm proud of this because Of what it looks like though. We've done 50 60 of these the light pole replacements we partner with Municipalities and power companies. We like power companies. We liked all transmission structures. We've done a number of those That's a tree pole tower You know some of these tree poles look ridiculous but we take a lot of pride in designing them in a way that they can be concealed and This is one of our most recent towers it's a marquee tower that we built at a park where all the equipment's designed behind a panel and the panels of the Concealment. We're all based on the the use of the park, which is an aquatic center in a Nature Center So again, that's that's my day job. That's what I do. But what I'd like to do is talk to you about Generally the world that I live in which is the wireless communications world and so 5g So just to give you a frame of reference on kind of the evolution of wireless networks When the first phones came out in you know The the late 1980s they were big and bulky and it was just effectively Analog using voice over an analog network and back then you could build a cell tower would cover six to seven miles Of distance because it was a very low amount of information that was traveling through When the Syst the second gene networks came about that's when we began to make the transition To texting and to be able to receive some limited information But again, the 2g networks were for primarily making the shift from voice to transfer to data the 3G networks effectively increased the speeds to 2,000 bits bits per second and that allowed us to be able to Take photographs and send them to social media at at Reasonable speeds not fast enough to replace the speed and our computers But but still mobile enough for us to be able to browse websites and transmit data and then in 2012 4G technologies introduced which has tremendous amount of throughput It's called LTE. We all know it because we see the the commercials for it and that's effectively where we are today but so you can kind of see how fast the speeds have been been going through through time as technologies of shift have been different shaped I like this slide because it talks a little bit about some of the the gobbledygook acronyms of all the different forms of Wireless from you know, the first the first networks were a and PS 2g was a GSM And CDMA so you can see there were different technologies introduced by different companies and they they kind of came to Two different paths. There was the path that kind of followed us and led us to LTE through 2g and then effectively, you know there have been these transition points where they call for example We didn't go from two to three They went to edge technology which became two-and-a-half G so you can see the the evolution is constant There's never a time when the scientists in the wireless world decide after they launch a technology that they stopped They're always improving they're always continuing to move forward and keep going But what was interesting was a real pivotal moment occurred when the 4G technology was being developed in 2011 of 2012 because there were two forms of technology that were considered relatively equal LTE and WiMAX and And as you can see, you don't hear much about WiMAX and I'll I'll tell you a little bit about what happened to WiMAX But the engineers as they started to focus on 5g decided that they didn't want to have to make the same mistakes they've made in the past and have a lot of waste in terms of the design of the Technology the software and the equipment so they went to the International Telecommunications Union Worldwide agency. It's actually the vid agency of the United Nations 193 member states 700 members And they developed standards for all sorts of things that are technology related to whether it's mobile communications or satellite communications spectrum Internet data, they are the go-to organization in the globe That make sure that when satellites get launched that their signals don't cross as they as they shoot toward the United States and the rest of the world and so ITU effectively Took the lead to bring in all the engineers of the world together To come up with a with a standard for 5g and here's why For those of you that are old-school guys like me you remember a VHS and beta well VHS and Betamax Were very comparable technologies. In fact Betamax was actually a better technology than VHS But we all none of us here about Betamax if it quickly died part of the reason that Betamax died was that sony felt it was Proprietary and wanted to keep the licenses to it whereas VHS was an open platform. And so they lost billions of dollars by by taking that route Same thing happened in the wireless industry in 2012 the two different versions By two different different companies and different engineers threw down and design these two networks that were relatively equal in terms of their abilities LCE proved to have a slight and small difference in terms of its usability and effectively every single wireless carrier in the in the world with the exception to Several companies like there's a company that sprint was a 50% owner in called a clear wire and clear wire took the path of WiMAX and became obsolete within 18 to 24 months of deploying and so the ITU Became the organization that would focus on creating a path To developing the software and hardware for the next generation networks so that there wouldn't be a waste of resources And creating duplicate technologies where you have a winner and loser Pretty smart pretty forward-thinking when it comes to the the folks in the world that are developing these technologies The ITU set standards for what they want 5g to What the result would be what the outcome would be for 5g and it really hinges on two Basic premises the first is speed the speed in which a megabit of data can flow through The wireless network their goal was to reduce speed to increase speed effectively twenty fold From one gigabit per second to 20 gigabits per second massive massive leap in the trends in the speed of wireless technology the second element of Of the goal of 5g and the ITU was to eliminate the latency latency Is related to speed in many respects, but but latency is actually in some respects more valuable than speed because of the of the transaction times and and really what It's a delivery mechanism. So there's there's connection speed which includes how how how much data can flow through The network but how fast it gets there also is significantly influenced by latency. So massive massive goals here in terms of the developing the standards for 5g the second element is they want this network to be able to be applicable to an Increase of devices by a hundred X. So imagine how many devices can we think of that are used wirelessly? You know, it's our phones. It's our tablets It's you know other other Devices, but but what they're planning for is that this network will have the ability to be able to support a hundred times increase In the number of devices that haven't even been thought of yet and and so it all it all relates to what many of you know is IOT, which is the Internet of Things where effectively everything that has a power source has a modem that connects to the network and and that's that could be an infinite number of devices, so the idea was to create the capacity for hundreds hundred x of what we have today in devices over the next several years the other element was to create a network that would effectively Reduce the amount of energy it takes to power up a device So their goal was to have a 90% energy reduction and And it's even hard to imagine because I think every one of us knows that if we don't get to a charger today Sometime during the meeting We're gonna run out of juice for our wireless phones our wireless devices but that's the goal is to is to be able to create a network that reduces energy consumption and also for devices that are in the field for example, whether it's a it's a wireless device that's connected to a traffic light They don't want they want this network to be able to reduce the energy so that they could have a 10 year battery life in a wireless device that transmits data from a Traffic light. Those are the big picture elements of what ITU is establishing for the 5g network the the easiest way to think about this and I can make this graph available to you is that we're really looking at instant in some areas between a ten to a hundred times increase in Capacity traffic capacity through the networks Network energy efficiency the density of data that can flow through networks the reduction of latency And an effectively spectral efficiency because all these devices are flowing through licensed spectrum that are purchased by the wireless carriers and again to find ways to be able to use the spectrum that they have available in more efficient ways and and effectively increase the user experience by a hundred times increase in terms of the user experience And so in to put it in kind of human terms You know on a 3G network You could download a two hour movie a high-def two-hour movie It would take roughly a day under 4G it takes about six minutes Under the standards of 5g which are being developed now it would take 3.6 seconds, so it's it's almost unimaginable on a device that could function that way in a mobile environment But those are the goals that the ITU is setting and that's what the the engineers of the world are working on right now To developing those standards So if you kind of look at it in more human terms, you know The first generation was about voice. The second was about email the third I you say cameras because that was kind of when devices of devices became cameras but really 3G was when we all be able to get access to the Internet and the way I look at 4G is 4G is the the speed and the quality of the technology and the devices that really uncomplete ly Completely untethered us from the computer and I think that was to me in my mind the biggest difference My wife is a very low-tech person She's got a big fat iPhone and I don't I haven't seen her used as a computer in our home in about two years Her whole world, is that phone? She can seek and gain access to everything that she needs whether on mobile or at home And I think that's to me was the trans transformation what 4g did to us really gave to us really was the the complete untethering of Needing to be connected and what 5g is is really going to be is is the number one Benefit the five you will have is will it will be the portal for entertainment. It will be able to send video Through the wireless network in in the quality and speed that we've never seen before and that's what's driving The the density and the transformation that's occurring right now and in the wireless industry In my mind the best way to describe it is 5g is fiber to the phone and if you think about how disruptive that will be when you think about how we Acquire how we acquire Internet in our offices how we acquire Internet in our homes whether it's cable companies Or FiOS or other other forms effectively. This is why ATT is purchasing Time Warner Eighty Verizon and maybe sprint a Sprint t-mobile combination They're all making the transition from voice It's a broadband to complete experience entertainment experience That's where they see their future is is the effectively the gatekeeper that get that provides to you Every every element of communication from from all those all those things bundled up So that's in a nutshell what 5g is? When is it coming? So ITU established a calendar and it actually goes way past? 2016 earlier in 2016 it started effectively in 2011 after the 4G standards were were adopted but effectively they they they worked with the all the engineers throughout the world to begin to start to focus on different modules of Of problem solving and and steps. So it's like any project management Responsibility it's the focus the focus of engineers that are effectively competing against each other to Develop the platform and the standards and the software codes For this type of technology. And so whereas leading to right now is a deployment in 2020 Now you're going to hear a little bit about The race to 5g and I'll talk a little about that from the context of the wireless carriers and what that means to them But the ITU is focusing on mobile standards You'll hear about 5g being deployed by Verizon and by Sprint and by 18t But what they're talking about when they're talking about 5g right now They're talking about something. That's very different than what ITU is working on. They're talking about a technology called fixed wireless whereas ITU is focusing on mobile wireless and all difference that differentiate that in just a few a few minutes here, so The race to 5g, so the race to 5g is not about how fast we can deploy a 5g network Because we can't deploy a 5g network because a 5g network has not yet been defined from the mobility standpoint The other element is wireless carriers have to recoup billions of dollars that they've invested in deploying their 4G network I mean this equipment and the antennas and the spectrum that they need to purchase to be able to allow all this data to flow is Extraordinarily expensive takes a tremendous amount of capital and just like any investment that each of us makes there's a return on cost There's a return on investment over time and so when you hear the when you hear the the conversation about the race to 5g What's really being talked about is the race to design? the standards for 5g the president and members Of our federal government are saying we have to win the race to 5g But what they're really saying is American scientists they want American scientists to have more of a voice as to what the design of 5g will look like and Right. Now the American scientists are not leading the design of 5g It's being led by mostly by Korea China and India with United States so you know right up there But but those three countries and the engineering brainpower That's focusing on the elements of the design of the 5g mobility network. That's what we're talking about and there's a lot of a lot of fear in the by by people in our government that somehow if Other countries are have a lot larger voice or a stronger voice and what 5g looks like that that could somehow You know be be a threat to the United States. I'm not really buying off on that But I think that's what they're talking about I see the race to 5g because there's not one wireless carrier that is racing to deploy a network that hasn't been designed yet from the standpoint of mobility But there's a difference between mobile 5g and fixed 5g So if I can explain to you what fixed 5g is and it's being it's being developed by each carrier Verizon t-mobile Sprint AT&T they all are deploying what's called? It's effectively called fixed-fixed 5g or fixed wireless and what it is is using some of the trials With some of the software that's being developed to increase the speeds On a point-to-point network. So in other words what fixed 5g is is a signal coming from a cell tower or a rooftop or a Connected transmitting device to a receiving antenna now receiving antenna in the trials right now Looks like a small pizza dish or a small square that you would mount And a building or in a location where you could get fiber from that device to your network to your to your your you know Wi-Fi distribution point in your home or to your vices and what that is is that's sending a signal from the tower and line-of-sight to the antenna, so it requires a relatively Line-of-sight clear path between those two points kind of like DirecTV has a path toward the satellites there's a clear path between that device and the antenna on the cell tower and and they're getting insane speeds Through the fixed 5g wireless and there's no standard for fixed 5g wireless Each company is developing their own design There's a technology called beam Forming which allows for the the the wireless signals to effectively move around objects, so if there's a tree or a building Blocking you from the antenna some parts of that spectrum can can beam around That device and or that that obstruction and so that's what's what's interesting is there's also another buzz Vergil here It's called the millimeter millimeter wave spectrum. It's a high band spectrum. That's that's being used to effectively connect Connect devices at super high speed from an interim a receiving antenna from a transmitting antenna. And so if you hear about T-mobile or Sprint or Verizon? We've got 5g, we're pushing out 5g. That's what they're talking about They're not talking about 5g to your phone because the true 5g to your phone hasn't been designed yet still a few more years off From that so this whole idea of race to 5g think about in the context of the race to design it Versus you know versus a the race to deploy it at least at this point another way to think about 5g from the perspective of wireless carriers is It's a first-class seat on a 4G airplane Because the 4G network just like a coach seat in a plane. It's going to get you there at the sorrell, you know Relatively at the same time but the experience is gonna be very different And so this is how when 5g is deployed. The wireless carriers are going to effectively Focus on marketing it it's going to be an upgrade To 4G 4G whilst, you know, 4G has the ability to send effectively a fiber like speed today to your to your wireless device They just haven't they haven't deployed the infrastructure to be able to facilitate that in a uniform way But you can get you get a hundred Meg's to your phone on a wireless device under 4G And I don't know about you But at home I pay for you know I'm paying a lot of money for 50 through a fiber line 4G has the capacity to go to a hundred so 4G has the capacity to give fiber to your phone right now and But again, the infrastructure is not there and the spectrum is not there to be able to do that in a uniform way That's why the 5g networks will be so valuable So that's in the context of where the carriers are what they're thinking about what 5g will be it'll be an upgrade over over a base infrastructure of 4G and I think another thing that's really relevant to point out is the amount of competition in the wireless space and how it's affected the spending patterns of the infrastructure for these wireless companies Two years ago, I've got 80 Many of you have ATT Verizon two years ago You had a data plan. And if you went over your data plan you had to buy more data well Marcella Claire, it's at Sprint and John Legere at t-mobile and it was really lazier that kicked it off in the summer of 2016 Rebranded they called themselves the uncarrier and They effectively took all took all the limits off of the amount of data unlimited data sprint follows suit quickly and over the course of between August and January February of 2017 they stole a significant amount of market share from 18t and Verizon by going by going to free and fixed price unlimited network capacity for the consumer and Finally in March of last year both ATT and Verizon conceded to stop the flow of the hemorrhaging of customers to these other networks and Match the unlimited data program and in doing so the amount of revenue that those two companies received plummeted to the point now where 18t and Verizon and Sprint and t-mobile are really not profitable from 4G Giving unlimited Speeds to every user for each device as as consist significantly constrained their revenue potential and so they're looking to 5g as the opportunity to be able to get premium pricing on top of your base plan to be able to drive drive more revenue to pay for this because ultimately Manat if the current model that they're under right now which is unlimited is just not sustainable for them to be able to continue to make the Capital investments that they need to be able to continuously upgrade their their network the recent changes in Net neutrality and tax reform were a significant positive for all these each of these companies net neutrality Really the the laws to create net neutrality Were passed under the Obama administration and they were repealed by the the most recent administration but before the Obama s tradition Administration created the laws that define net neutrality. There was no new net net neutrality and for those of you that may not know what net neutrality is effectively the concept behind net neutrality is that there shouldn't be a preference paid on the speed of Data going through the network from different companies like for example Netflix, you know Netflix Netflix will pay a premium to AT&T and Verizon and Sprint so that when their data flows through their wireless networks, it gets there faster than You know Amazon Prime, right? And so That is that was a huge revenue source For these wireless carriers was the ability to be able to create premium pricing for the speed of data flowing through wireless networks It was also not just wireless networks. It was through all fiber And so it created an economic constraint for the wireless industry so by going back to where we were before the net neutrality laws were put in place it now creates a revenue opportunity for Prioritization and there's a lot of people that feel very strongly on both sides of that argument as to whether that is Equitable to the American consumer. I won't get into that but all I know is that the going back to the model that existed before then that neutrality laws were in place is a significant positive to the wireless industry Which will then provide resources for them to be able to invest in the next generation of their networks? The same thing obviously with the tax reform a huge amount of capital was released as a result of the tax changes that were being placed in effect right now and again, accelerated depreciation as well as the ability to be able to Use utilize that cash that's coming in that was you know was in other places or overseas or whatever But all each of these companies have all had the ability to be able to benefit from just many recent changes that occurred um, the other thing that is interesting when you're looking at it from the perspective of the wireless carriers is what's happening with The companies which we're often relate to as fangs which are Facebook Amazon Netflix and Google if you take those four companies and you look at their their their their capitalization their worth Those four companies have a have an asset value of three trillion dollars Compare that with The telecommunications industry whether it's cable fiber Wireless communications talking about you know, a huge huge number of companies Together the industry that provides this information to us is one-third the size of those four companies the wireless industry that the data telecommunication industry cable industry Heavily regulated as to how they operate What they cute what's communicated their their policies toward consumers those four companies? Have almost no regulation. And so what does that mean? Well, it's just what I'm the reason I bring it up is because we've got an industry that has a tremendous amount of burden and weight in terms of being able to operate and And I think that the the the balance is going to start to sway as Congress begins to look at transparency data privacy and A whole host of other elements and we're gonna see that that's going to affect Those other those other companies and we're going to start to see see more equality. I think the wireless carriers feel that the amount of regulation that they have to to fund and be part of There's a huge disparity with respect to other companies that are in the technology space. I do want to talk a little bit about fiber and data and data centers because obviously data centers are very focused a very focused real estate space, but When I first built my when I built my first cell tower It didn't really matter if there was no fiber to the tower Because my customers would put a microwave dish on the tower and then they would relay High-speed data to the microwave dish and then to their radio cabinets and then have the data function through that and for many many years until 4G that was a very affordable and economical way to be able to create the interconnectivity for the wireless signals to be transmitted through their network, but the speed of 4G and of course 5g means that the There has to be fiber to every single tower And if it's not available In such as in very rural areas, then you're not going to see the the same connection speed That you're gonna see in in more urban areas. So every single tower that I build We've got to have fiber at that site or find the path to get the fiber to that site the second thing that's very interesting is the average distance that a An element of data travels from from the data center to the wireless NOC to the tower is 500 miles and Back so effectively the average this is not the maximum The average distance a bit of data travels back and forth from than from its originating source To the consumer is a thousand miles and as we know latency is all about How long that how fast and how long it takes for that data to flow through the pipe? So if you think about it as a you know as a storm water pipe or a plumbing pipe right a water pipe Obviously the width of the pipe is It creates the amount of amount of capacity or potential speed but the longer the distance the the slower the latency and so what we're gonna see is a transition from mega data centers to More micro data centers as a company and where I live in near Washington DC called edge connects Their whole business model is to build data centers in higher density areas to closer to where the consumers are So rather than building, you know million square foot data centers or halflings Griffin just four data centers They're building smaller data centers that are much more proximate to where the users are The company one of the biggest wireless tower companies within the world It's a the second one of the second largest tower reads called crown castle. They bought a company called io and Vapor develops effectively a module. It's a you know, it's roughly, you know 20 feet long. It's a it's a shelter building 20 feet long. It's HD wide a feet high and it can how it can host Many data centers the biggest issue they have is expelling the heat from that building but the notion is that over time we're gonna be seeing Micro data centers or smaller compact data centers at cell towers or in places where there are antennas being transmitted So when I use the word cell tower I'm talking about what's called a base station, that could be a rooftop as well But over time to decrease latency and to create a better user experience We're gonna see more infrastructure more physical on the ground infrastructure approximate to wireless wireless infrastructure base stations So, what does it mean for real estate and it's a tough question to answer because Obviously we're at the early stages of even defining what 5g is but a couple things that come to mind again the ecosystem that allows for all of our wireless devices to function is based on a large part of a large number of different forms of transmitting devices So when I use the word tower I also call it a macro sight cell tower macro site or in a rooftop installation is typically anywhere between nine and fifteen panels That are connected to radios that connect a fiber that run back to the the operators network the one thing that I've seen In the last 18 years of being in this industry is the amount of equipment that is being placed on Rooftops the amount of equipment that's being placed on my tower when I built my first tower in 2000 Nextel put six antenna panels each antenna panel was six feet high and about eighteen inches wide and Then they had a cabinet at the base of the tower and that allowed them to be able to launch their their 2g network today With the LTE network. We're seeing 15 antenna panels many these antenna panels are Feet tall two feet wide and the radios that used to be in the base cabinet on the ground are now mounted behind the antenna panels and Effectively, they're the size of carry-on suitcases then they're called remote radio heads and What that does is by moving the radio from the ground from the base station on the ground up to Behind, the antenna panel is it gives them a 15 to 20 X? 20 percent increase in the speed so they lose twenty percent of The speed by running that fiber and those coax cables down to the ground So we're seeing a lot more equipment on the tower a lot more equipment on the rooftop for the macro macro sites it the amount of just to give you an example a typical installation for Verizon or 18t is four thousand pounds of equipment on one rad Center or one space on my tower I mean, it's like hanging a pickup truck on my tower that's how much weight and wind load and so The cost to build towers now has obviously gone up because we need to buy thicker steel stronger foundations and so forth So that's that's one of the elements of some of the trends is there's a lot more gear a lot more equipment to be able to allow the the Devices in the networks to function the second form of equipment were seeing are called small cells Small cells are effectively micro or mini cell towers from the standpoint of they have antennas and Radios built in that allow for the wireless carrier to send their signal through that device Now there's another another device called is distributed antenna systems or did - and Just to give you some examples of what this looks like so far left Typical macro tower installation with antenna panels radio heads behind and then cabling it runs down to the ground Rooftop installations very similar. It's effectively a tower on a rooftop Many real estate owners are very familiar with this again more equipment more Geir And absolute need for fiber. The third photograph is a typical as an example of a small cell where it's combined with a streetlight and all the equipment is integrated into the thicker part of the pole and There's typically three panels and those three panels send out signals in These are the three azimuth and and then the networking equipment is housed on the base of the of that particular structure There's a lot of different types of designs for this being developed and that is a key element in being able to Propagate a stronger signal lower the ground below the trees. The fourth device is called a distributed antenna system so the way you think about a distributed antenna system is It's the other name for it is called neutral host and what that is It's a device that has intended panels inside but those intended panels are designed to be able to send a signal from multiple frequencies and multiple carriers So for example in that particular device Which is mounted on top of a wooden light pole a private company like x2 net or crown castle or American Tower Actually build pay for and fund and own that device and then they lease capacity to companies like Verizon Sprint and t-mobile So that's called a neutral host distributed antenna system many of you have nutri hosts distribute kind of systems in your buildings And so the carriers will pay a fee and pay a capital expense to have access to that type of network but they really prefer not to go on the distributed antenna system and the reason is because Those companies as third-party companies manage the network they manage the hardware they manage the networking equipment and They're responsible for allocating capacity with the wireless carriers want to do is have control over the entire transmitting experience that's why they're building what are called small cells and all it takes to light that small cell device up that that small cell device also can be mounted on a square panel on a parapet if you mounted on us 20 feet up on the side of a building that can be mounted on power lines or wooden poles or Street traffic lights and so forth. So you're seeing a huge amount of expansion toward toward small cells because it again it gives the wireless carrier the ability to be able to control 100% the equipment the The flow at as much or as little capacity as they would like to as they choose to To give you some economic, you know information on this for example a wireless carry the Lisa space on one of my towers will pay anywhere from Two thousand to three thousand dollars a month depending on how much equipment and loading they're putting on my tower There are similar rents available on rooftops if any of you manage rooftops for your companies or your portfolio You'll see that those that generally the rent friends There's been a lot of pushback on rent recently just because of the fact that these wireless companies are having Just a lot of economic stress, but but that in a nutshell is the type of installations Small cells we're seeing rents from anywhere from 200 to 500 dollars per month Not a lot of rent. But again, we're seeing that as something that's being deployed and something is very popular Inside buildings Neutral hosts again has been the theme although we're seeing some small cell installations inside buildings But the biggest difference that we're seeing inside buildings is that the wireless companies are no longer investing in Paying for the infrastructure to provide Capacity inside a building and one of the reasons for that is that it's a very low return on their cost but second was the invention of effectively Mobile over Wi-Fi so many of us have phones now that allow us to be able to connect to the network using the Wi-Fi network So the advances and software effectively have facilitated the the the dead zones and our buildings If you have Wi-Fi and your phone is connected to network So your phone's going to be functional even if it's in a in a place where it's not getting a signal from outside And so I think that's one of the biggest Advances that I think you're going to limit the ability to be able to fund and pay for death systems inside buildings, but we're still gonna see them in stadiums and convention centers in other places where you have, you know, a tremendous amount of users I Think you need to wrap it up if you think about how we perceive Technology and how we perceive the adoption of it You know the movie I Robot came out in 2004 and their prediction was we'd have driverless cars by 2035 Well, we're gonna have driverless cars by 2025 I Remember when Minority Report came out was the first time we had ever seen You know moving files on a on a tablet or on a device. That was a screen And they predicted that to happen in 2050 for so the the rapid pace of the the upgrades and the changes in technology I'll require wireless networks and it's just it's just so interesting to to think about where that what the head in the future So we'll talk about a little bit off the future before we wrap up and open up for questions But clearly big buzz at least in our but our industry is you know What's going to happen with mobility and cars fleets? Public transportation when when the networks are functioning to give you a perspective on speed 4G LTE network in Pittsburgh is operating the driverless car programs They have I believe it's Google I think is doing the driverless car program in Pittsburgh So if you imagine the speed of the data flowing through a 4G network the car can respond to a risk at approximately the same speed as The speed of our brains how fast we make decisions? So it's it's pretty relatively equal speed Fast forward when the 5g networks emerge we're talking ten times that speed Ten times the decision-making processing power to have that vehicle decide what to do Ten times faster than the way that our minds can process information That's where the safety really comes into play with 5g, but make no mistake running driverless cars on a 4G network is a very keep proposition and we're not going to see the Ubiquitousness of that until the 5g networks are well established and fruit on the road But but if you think about the 5g speeds 100 times faster 20 times the 20 times less the X the latency Things like machine to machine community remote surgery Drone delivery. I mean smart cities the Internet of Things everything being connected. That's what that effectively is What what foot 5g will mean I think we're done with little over time So I want to thank you all for coming. It was really a pleasure speaking to you
