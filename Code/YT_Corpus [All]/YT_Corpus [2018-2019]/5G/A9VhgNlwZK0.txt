 government could be considering a federal takeover of portions of the country's mobile broadband networks KPIX 5s and Roz Bourne is live in Cupertino and Sandra this would be a very big deal hey Kenny Oh sweetie a huge deal and that's because the private sector of course is always taking point in this industry so to have the government come in and say they want a centralized government-run network 5g that would be highly controversial now here is what we do know Axios calm claims to have obtained a memo presented to President Trump's national security council suggesting the US needs to centralize a 5g network by the end of the president's first term this would be for cyber security and also in order to protect from the possibility of China spying on us phone calls now the documents say a centralized 5g network would be easier to protect from threats an anonymous government official told Reuters this weekend that plans were being debated at a low level in the administration it would be about six to eight months away from being seen by the President himself of course only time will tell how exactly this plays out now back out here alive I can tell you that two of the biggest telecommunications companies in the US we have Verizon Wireless and AT&T Wireless they have both already announced plans to have 5g access coverage in certain places throughout the US by the end of this year so again we'll have to wait and see what happens with the government here no word yet on how exactly this would impact the private sector there's the possibility of the government working with these different networks or even renting out access to these different carriers but that 5g coverage of course is on the horizon regardless in the private sector and that's exactly why we're seeing more cell towers like this one behind me disguised as a eucalyptus tree popping up in cities all across the country live in Cupertino Sandra Osborne KPIX 5
