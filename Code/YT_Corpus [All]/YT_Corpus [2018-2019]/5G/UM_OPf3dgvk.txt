 you know when you pick up the remote control for your TV and you press power but nothing happens so you press it again and the TV finally reacts to the first button press and switches on but now your second button press also delayed cancels out the first one and the TV switches off again that's latency the lag between an action and the expected reaction and that's what this show is all about hello I'm dr. Shanice O'Meara and this is the okay but how show the series that explores the ins outs ups downs whys and how's of 5g networks for business as we saw in the series opener 5g is much much more than just a faster network though it's that too in fact 5g will take businesses forward with some really big leaps in speed capacity coverage network density and one of the most important dimensions of all the one we're going to talk about today latency or more specifically low latency first a definition latency is the lag between an instruction and the resulting response between the users action and the technologies reaction well networks have latencies too and they can cause the same kind of user experience glitches you send an instruction or request to a server somewhere and you might get what feels like a pretty fast response but in most cases on today's 3G and 4G networks there's actually a lag anywhere from about 50 milliseconds to a few hundred milliseconds is fairly normal the phone Nokia recently posted a great demonstration of network latency on YouTube using robots being controlled over a real cellular network in this first demonstration you can see on the screen here behind me we're showing the current latency of what would be a 4G network is around 90 to 100 milliseconds and on the right hand side and you'll be able to see this line move as we move the ball on the plate so what I'm going to do is move this ball right now and we can see the oscillations here tracked on this graph and how long it takes for the robots to collaborate with each other to get the information they need to balance the ball on the plate and then we're going to switch into 5g mode and we can see on this graph here that we've now gone from around 90 milliseconds to around 3 milliseconds so much much lower latency in the network and I'm going to do exactly the same again and we can see that we only took one oscillation there to correct the ball so you can see how the reduction of the latency in the network improves the communication between the machines it's such a simple but really memorable demo it lets you see clearly the impact of network see in action now for most applications the 50 to 100 millisecond lag of a 4G network is not a problem the user probably doesn't even notice it but for some applications 50 milliseconds of latency is a real barrier I'm talking about very real use cases that would be possible today if only latency could be brought down to subhuman detectable levels like 20 milliseconds or less because 5g can deliver this low latency performance these applications all of a sudden become possible there are lots of applications that need this kind of haptic feedback that instant touch like sending in a remote control robot into a collapsed building you need the operator to be there without actually being there to react instantly to changes inside the building but still keeping a safe distance latency is also a big factor in the realism of virtual reality worlds the responsiveness of massive multiplayer games the sensitivity of complex simulations in manufacturing or engineering or the safety of autonomous vehicles remember this is over a wireless network not a fiber connection I know what you're thinking ok but how to deliver these kinds of latency levels mobile network operators are doing some cool things one of the most important is core network virtualization basically that's applying the principles of IT virtualization like for servers or storage in a data center to the network node so think about the things the core network has to do things like aggregation of traffic or authentication of users call control and switching and invoking gateways and services in a traditional network that's all done on big expensive dedicated Hardware full of specialized Asics and multiple cores right and so they tend to be centralized there might be a network node here to serve a really big area so a network might only have a handful of nodes for the whole country each covering maybe a million square miles with network virtualization the operator can deploy smaller low-cost standardized Hardware so instead of three or four traditional network nodes for the whole country there could well be over a hundred when you do these core network things using software you get a lot of benefits for one thing the network node becomes rapidly and remotely configurable so the operator can optimize surfaces for specific demanding use cases maybe this node over here has a network slice there's optimized for speed for example and this one here dedicates a slice that's all about security and availability instead of speed that configure ability of the 5g network will be a recurring theme in this series as we explore the potential of 5g it changes everything but just as importantly doing these core network functions with software also pays dividends for latency partly because these lower-cost virtual network nodes can be decentralized so they can live closer to the customers essentially it's bringing a virtual representation of the entire core network out to the edge where the users are so now instead of the one big network node we have lots of smaller virtual ones where they're needed most so RAM chips can be much faster switching a request straight to a nearby node instead of routing it halfway across the country and back network virtualization is hugely powerful for flexibility configurability and for performance dimensions like latency so as 5g rolls out you want to start thinking about the potential for your business what kinds of things could you do over a low latency network that you couldn't do today maybe it's new customer experiences or new remote filled applications or robotics and autonomous equipment with 5g the network won't be the obstacle anymore for business its disruption time get creative I'm dr. Shanice Amara and you've been watching the okay but how show brought to you by Sprint business see you next time [Music]
