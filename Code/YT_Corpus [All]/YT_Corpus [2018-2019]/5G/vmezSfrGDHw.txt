 hi and welcome back Scotty sticked out info I'm Scotty with Michaels Cletus and last video I did was entitled 5g is just the tip of the iceberg and in that video I was talking about some studies that I found quite a few studies actually and the gist a link to that video in the description if you haven't seen it it's a little bit long but pretty informative and the gist of it is that when we're talking about like 3G 4G 5g Wi-Fi Bluetooth all these basically microwave digital radio signals that we use in our lives all the time some studies have been done and they've shown that it is not the the the heating effect due to the power of these signals that's causing a problem for one's health but actually the other aspects of the signal like the polarization of the waves especially the pulsed nature of them the the time of exposure and the fact that the exposure is not consistent and that sort of thing so after I published this video a whole bunch of people wrote in or wrote comments or something and they said okay well that's great but what can we do about it and I have a few few things to say about that okay so first of all you have to understand that just because they say that the power level is not what's actually harming health that doesn't mean that power level is irrelevant so in other words when you have a radio signal it's an electromagnetic wave and that electromagnetic wave according to these studies hits our body and specifically it touches the these VG cc's voltage-gated calcium channels and effectively what that is is like a little kind of like a little channel on each cell of your body and the microwave digital radio waves hit hit that hit these little these little gates and it essentially has an electrical effect on the cell which opens this little gate calcium ions flood in and bad stuff happens like neurological damage and like all kinds of stuff like DNA damage and the kill sperm cells and you can watch the previous video so the point is that it's radio waves that are having what amounts to an electrical effect on the cells of your body now according to the basic laws of physics in order for that to happen the microwave digital signals have to have a certain power level in other words if I have an antenna here and the power of the radio signal I'm sending is zero then there's no radio waves by definition right so if it's like one milla watt then there's like it's like this much and if it's 100 milliwatts it's this much and if it's 10,000 Watts a 10,000 watt transmitter there's this you know huge amount of power being dissipated in the form of these radio waves the waves travel farther if you're close to the tower the higher the power the stronger the waves are that are hitting your body so what I'm trying to get at here is that the point of those studies was to basically counteract what everyone says typically like what industry people say and everything that oh well there is no microwave of an effect you know we're not talking about a 2.45 gigahertz 1,000 watt microwave oven that's cooking your brain and giving you cancer because the power levels are so low and what they were saying was simply that it's not the power levels that cause the problem it's all these other aspects of the signals that are causing the problem but that doesn't mean that the power levels are irrelevant so what that actually means is a couple of people wrote and they said basically okay look I've got a house I live there surprisingly and like a kilometer away from my house there's a big cell tower right so like one guy he said well but what's what's you know I can't do anything about that tower that's near my house right I'm gonna be bombarded by that saying like 24 hours a day so what difference does it make then if I just you know why not use Wi-Fi in my house why not have a wireless wireless keyboard Bluetooth Bluetooth wireless mouse why not use like you know LTE on my tablet and why not just keep my cell phone on all the time and my answer to that would be because it's increasing your level of exposure because it isn't the heating effect that's having the problem but you can think of it like kind of kind of like a like a plant that that's that's poisonous in large doses right so if you eat a little bit of the plant maybe you'll just get sick right if you eat a whole boatload of the plant it's kind of poisonous so you're gonna fall over dead right so what you want to do is minimize your exposure to that plant and that's actually that it actually brings up another point which is that this exposure if it is indeed bad I mean more more research is needed more you know industry the industry leaders and everyone actually needs to listen to these studies and look into them more and not just dismiss them out of hand we need to do like a very broad thorough study and like I said in the last video that's very difficult to do now and that's part of the problem because there are a lot of people who are concerned about this and based on the studies they should be their right to be but then it's like well nothing's gonna happen and one of the things actually in in the study one of the studies that I did I quoted in my last video one of the things they said that I didn't mention was that you're exposed to these radio waves and it doesn't happen in a vacuum so it's it's kind of like the little the plant that sort of poisonous if you eat too much of it well if you're sick if you have the flu or you have some long-term illness and you need a tiny amount of that plant you're gonna get really sick you know in other words those those radio waves are going to affect you far more strongly and they would a totally healthy person so we also have to consider like what exposure means linked with everything else like what are you eating what's your lifestyle like do you exercise regularly do you have any long-term illnesses do you you know there's all these different factors that need to be taken into account but that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that if you're perfectly healthy it's not affecting you so if you have a cell tower kilometer away from your house and you don't just add Wi-Fi and a Bluetooth keyboard and a Bluetooth mouse and keep yourself phone on in the house all the time because you're just you're increasing a number of directions from which you're getting hit by these low-power signals and the more low-power signals you're being hit by theoretically according to like physics as I understand it yes that would amplify the the effects of these the pulse digital waves on VGC seas and sperm cells and neurons and all that kind of stuff so the first thing you can do is basically just minimize your exposure yeah you can't do anything about that cell tower but that doesn't mean you have to use Wi-Fi you can use an Ethernet cable make an Ethernet network you don't have to have a wireless keyboard and mouse you don't have to have your cell phone on all the time another thing to do is I live in France and in France you can't actually drive a car and talk on your phone you can't actually hold the phone in your hands and it's the same in many countries but here they're like super like OCD about it and you get like a big fine if you're holding your phone while while driving so you have to use Bluetooth hands-free well that means you're sitting in a car which is a metal shell and your car is transmitting bluetooth and your phone is transmitting bluetooth back and the phone is transmitting up to the cell tower and it's like do you really need to have your phone on are you really expecting a call because if you aren't turn the dang phone off and also if you can deactivate the Bluetooth hands-free in your car some cars now have their they cars are their own Wi-Fi hotspots do you really need to use that just turn it off man especially if you're going like a long car trip you know you can minimize your exposure is it less convenient Wow five 10 years ago you didn't have that did you die no I mean if you do you read the studies and you look at them like I do and you go wow that that's kind of concerning sure we need to do more research but like I'm gonna you know I'm gonna minimize my exposure just in case you know another thing you can do you know you stay in a hotel right Wi-Fi is in hotels all the time well there are tricks you can do there like one time I stayed at a hotel and they said it was advertised as the Wi-Fi in the hope in the whole hotel every room right well that wasn't actually true what they did is they put like one or two Wi-Fi boxes downstairs in the lobby and it was like a you know a three-story building and so if you were on the second or third floor you had very poor reception right like one bar and it would cut out sometimes so basically if he wanted to use the Wi-Fi you had to go down to the first floor of the lobby and that's like something you could do right you get in there and you you you can ask even and say is you know is there a room that's that's free of Wi-Fi and if they look at you like you have seven heads will point them to the de dam' studies or something you know or don't don't sweat it right because you know like at that place I could say you have Wi-Fi is there any you know and they'll say oh well on the second and third floors the the connection is a little bit bad and I'll say great give me a give me a guinea room on the third floor you know there you go another thing is like you're at an airport there's Wi-Fi at airports right okay well yes that means that there are there antennae everywhere like say in the ceiling of the airport bombarding you all the time but there again you have a choice right you can minimize your exposure because if you see a group of people sitting over here and they've all got their laptops and they're all on the internet that means you've got the airport's antennae that are transmitting and also every single one of those people that has a computer or a phone or a tablet or whatever their Wi-Fi is enabled each one of those is a Wi-Fi transmitter so if you sit in the middle of that group of people you're exposed far more strongly but if you look over there and you see that there's like only a handful of people and a bunch of empty seats will you go sit over there because you're still getting hit by the Wi-Fi from the ceiling right but there's far fewer people over there holding little Wi-Fi transmitters and they're in their hands which means your exposure level is less so there are all kinds of little tricks like that that you can do another one is if you have to carry a cell phone with you and it has to be on usually the antenna are on the back of the phone because when you're holding your phone pretend that's a phone you're holding up to you're here like this it's a sexy phone you're holding it up to your ear like this and that means they're not going to put the the antenna on this side because that the screen side that's up against your head you don't want to transmit through the head right uses more power drains your battery so they put the antenna on the back so if you're gonna put your phone in your pocket you put it in with the back facing out or screen towards you if you put in your pocket the back of the phone out screen facing towards you and not only will your battery life increase but it will transmit at a lower power level which brings up another point which is that like in where I live in my house I have very bad cell phone reception and so what that means is that if I turn my cell phone I leave it on in my house what happens is the signals coming from the tower are very very weak so I look on my phone and I have like one bar and sometimes zero like it's really bad reception if I leave my phone on then because the the strength of the signals coming from the tower are so low my phone knows that and it's gonna boost its transmit power higher and higher so that it can be sure to get that you get if signals back all the way to the tower because the connection is so the connection is bad right so what that means is that when you're in an area where you only have like one one bar you know your signal strength is only one bar it's probably better to just turn the damn thing off because your phone itself is gonna be transmitting at a much higher power level so that it can get the signals all the way there and again it's not the heating effects but because these signals are having an electrical effect on ourselves or so the studies seem to show that means that the higher the power level of the signal then theoretically that would mean the higher the electrical effects the negative electrical effects on our cells so yeah higher power does actually mean worse exposure assuming that the laws of physics as we understand them are accurate so yeah that's um I guess that's pretty much it the point is to just you know you just kind of think about it and you go okay look I can't you know I'm not gonna be able to like totally you know unless you want to go live in like the North Pole with Santa Claus like inside a Faraday cage you know 50 meters under the ice or something you know you're never gonna have like zero exposure but it's important to stay healthy as much as possible because then your body your body will repair itself you know your body can repair damage if it's healthy you also want to minimize the exposure level because the less you're exposed to the less damage occurs and there you go and if it turns out that the all these studies the these tons of studies that have been done over the past you know 10 15 years if it turns out they're all wrong what have you lost nothing if they're right and no further studies they're ever done and you minimize your exposure you live a lot longer and be a lot happier and be a lot healthier so you know what have you got to lose yeah and that's one final note is like man you know people also tend to get like kind of depressed about the whole thing and you know one thing you can do is like I mean share my videos go to the studies download them share them you know talk about it you know - it's like we've got these social networks and you can you can spread all this information so you can find all this information you can share all this information and you have to kind of take advantage of that what quick little story you know about 12 years ago or so I went gluten and dairy free and at that time I go to the grocery store like there was nothing that was gluten free nothing and I would tell people like yeah I stopped eating wheat and you know I feel a lot better and bla bla bla and yeah I mean dairy doesn't bother me but you know I stopped eating that too and they'd look at me like I had seven hits and I would tell people like you know I'd try to give them some of the research that's been done and say like look you know this is a week from back in like you know Little House on the Prairie days is not the same as wheat today today's wheat is like mega hybridized and all this stuff it's not the same thing many people are sensitive really have celiac disease and all this kind of stuff we don't want to turn this into a health show but the point is that fast-forward today you know back then everybody's telling me I'm crazy fast forward to today and every single grocery store I go to their entire aisles filled with gluten free and dairy free and all this stuff so you know did I have an effect to help make that happen well I don't know but I certainly did actually talk about it and their stuff with with people that I know and love and say like you know hey maybe you want to try this out maybe it'll fix this problem and many people did and they felt better and so that's kind of what you can do is you minimize your exposure and then you share this information as widely as possible and know we're probably not going to save the day and no they're probably not going to tear all the towers down but if you can make yourself healthier and happier and maybe help inform other people I mean how do you know you're not gonna send those studies to somebody who's in an IED in an ideal position to pass it on to one of their friends and one of their friends goes and and you know suddenly we have a you know abroad the long-term study or you know people start paying more attention or you know whatever so in other words don't give up hope you know there can be nonlinear effects from from tiny actions and like don't ever think that you know just because you're a little old you that you're you're never gonna have an effect I mean you take a you take a few million little old use and you have a pretty big effect so yeah there you go and like I say you know if these studies are wrong well then you didn't lose anything you just had to use Ethernet instead Wi-Fi like didn't kill you right so right so that's what you can do for more techie tipsy Scotties take down info thanks for watching see you next time
