 Everyday, millions of Americans rely on cars, busses, trains, or subways to get from point A to point B, experiencing many frustrations along the way. Delays, traffic, time and money all limit our ability to get where we need to go, safely and quickly. But, a better way to get around town is within reach. New technologies like smart roads and self-driving cars can improve the speed, and increase the safety at which people and goods move. These advances are powered by 5G technology, which will cut travel time by 40 percent, and save 22,000 lives annually with advanced safety features and precision. Not only that, but self-driving cars and trucks will reduce vehicle emissions by up to 90 percent! 5G is going to help us all drive into the future. Won't you join us?
