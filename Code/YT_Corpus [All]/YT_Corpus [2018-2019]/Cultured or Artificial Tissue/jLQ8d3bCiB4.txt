 [Music] hi welcome to this class this class is extremely important since we will be talking about tissue and cell culture now tissue and cell culture when we talk about tissue in cell culture it is important because when we our topic itself our cover course itself says that we are developing a fabrication techniques for Memphis sensors from clinical perspective so clinical problems are all the problems related to our health and when we talk about our health about human body human body finally when you go down it is all about cells right so if you have a device and if you want to load the cells if you have a device and if you want to load our organoids or spheroids if you have a device if you have a device to test the tissue properties then how to culture those tissues and cells right and what kind of laboratory laboratory could could handle this kind of tissue and cell culture what kind of equipment should be there and what kind of media that you will be using to to grow the cells and then what kind of technique is used to scrape the cells what how many cells have grown in particular petri dish or at e75 flask and lot of other things similar to that we will be learning in this particular lecture right a little bit of biology but interesting right engineer talking biology so it will be interesting of course biologists when they talk biology would be even more interesting so let's let's go through this journey and see so tissue and cell culture techniques so when you talk about understanding tissue and cell culture techniques you are not only talking biology but you are also talking engineering you are talking about medicine right and then you are talking about biology and when you talk about all these things then they are all interrelated it's a like no one can live without the another one right see bioreactor monitoring control therapeutics Diagnostics tissue engineering cell stability select and cell engineering all these things are interrelated okay so we'll be will be looking at this from engineering point of view and medicine point of view keeping biology in the center point of the talk so because our devices that we are designing our engineering devices the problems that we are addressing our medical problems and the the techniques that we had used our biology techniques thus all these three are interlinked right triangle that interlinks is not finished okay let us finish the triangle cool so what is cell culture what is sin culture first thing defined as a process of cultivating cells and tissues outside the body of an organism right so let me tell you a few terms first term is in vivo i n VI vivo in vivo in vivo it is within body next term ex vivo outside the body next term in vitro right or in laboratory environment artificial environment in vitro so let us see defined body cell culture defined as a process of cultivating cells and tissues outside the body of an organism that is ex vivo in an artificial environment like petri dish which is in vitro right which replicates the in vivo conditions such as temperature nutrition and protection from invading microorganisms cell and tissue culture are terms that are used interchangeably and basically denotes the denotes growing cells are called cluster of cells in vitro right you take a cell load in a petri dish note a particular media and it will start growing right so it can be it has interchangeable terms that we use cell and tissue culture it was first time successfully undertaken by Ross Harrison in 1907 just trivia so the cells may be removed from the tissue directly like primary culture and disaggregated by enzymatic or mechanical methods before cultivating it right and then they may be derived from a cell line that has already been established there are two ways of taking out the cells so let us see both ways in the next slide you see here first one organ so cells isolation by enzymatic or by mechanical action it is cultured and confluent culture is ready once the conference culture is ready the secondary culture of primary line is formed right secondary line subculture right we go on doing it cell division continues up to finite divisions right the primary culture it's a primary culture you got it so what we do is we take the tissue we take out the cells from the tissue either by enzymatic or mechanical actions once the tissues are when the cells is out we culture those cells and once it reaches his confluence state we do secondary culture and perform a secondary life cell line to finally we keep on culturing it until cell division until some finite divisions second way of doing it organ having a tumor cell isolated from tumor and culture right transform cells subculture cell division continues up to indefinite divisions right this is about primary culture so what is primary culture when cell or surgically removed from an organism placed in a suitable culture environment @h divide and grow they are called primary cell cultures this terminologies we need to understand so that when we talk about tissue culture it's easily understandable when this kind of terminologies are used like cell culture primary cell culture cell line other than cells confluence passage ink right so we need to understand so when we talk about primary cell culture as we have seen self surgically removed from an organisms and displaced in a culture environment and that will attach divide and grow cell line what is cell line cell line when the primary cell culture is subculture and they are demonstrated an ability to propagate indefinitely is called a cell line then there are error n cells enter and cells are when cell grows as a monolayer attaching themselves to the substrate like glass or plastic it is called encourage dependence encourage dependence there is like anchor right anchoring so because the cell will stick to the glass or plastic in a manner layer next term comes as confluence what is confluence terms used as an estimate of the number of eden' cells in a cultural desert flask and refers to the proportion of the surface my cells is called confluence messaging the process of splitting or sub culturing the cells is called messaging right now once we know this some terms right likes passaging cell lines confluence cell culture what kind of laboratory or a tissue culture lab setup looks like so a basic tissue culture lab should look like the one that I am showing here however there are several kind of different setup also so just to see you see here there is a cold room then there are air storage freezers stereo glasswares are kept here liquid sterile liquid sterile plastic cylinders are kept right then this is the area where people work there are incubators on all the sides right and there are microscope room there is a hot room there's a corner rent room then this is a corridor right again what a purification or one's an autoclaves dryer glassware washing machine sinks right this is typically how a set up looks like we have taken an example from Caltech but similar kind of short facility or smaller facility we are also developing right in my department which is electronic systems engineering in ase right and it has it will not only have the cell culture lab but it will also have a micro engineering lab where you can fabricate the device and within the same environment you can test the device in this kind of facility now we always talked about clean dome right so what is clean room and why it is important so generally a tissue culture room needs preferably preferably housed in a cleanroom environment and around 10,000 class 10,000 would be would be ideal environment for such kind of activity a typical clean room looks as shown in Figure here you can see here this is a clean room right and you can see that you had to wear gown right to avoid any contamination right it's a typical clean room for fabricating devices okay but we can work around if we have class 10,000 clean room environment now clean rooms are classified based on the amount of particulate matter obtained within the target space so within a space how much particular matter is obtained also there are ISO classification as well as Fe D classifications you can see here in the table where you talk about ISO one then it is really clean about 10 greater than 0.1 micro micrometer particles two point three seven four point two one point zero two four point three and this Maxima particles are per meter cube per cubic meter per meter cube when you talk about class one right so that will be ISO 3 and E it is it is a it is a clean room which has about thousand particles which is greater than point one micron about to 37,000 point 2 and so on till point five a total 5 microns but when we talk about a Fab Lab there is an inter class room in dental fab 32 that is written as class ten cleanroom and if you seek last ten cleanroom last ten cleanroom is here right so it will have this particular specification then comes class 100 then clums class thousand then comes class 10,000 then comes class 100,000 and then our laboratory which is cleaner and there is our room air right so for biology for pharmacy generally class 10,000 is used for experiments right we have and we will show you we will give a tour to the to my laboratory here in my department which has a class 10,000 clean room facility and like I said we are in process of developing another laboratory with a cell culture as well as the micro fabrication facility which will be class thousand cleanroom but for now for this particular the lecture and course we will be understanding class 10,000 and we'll be looking at class 10,000 in reality and what kind of equipment are there within the class 10,000 clean room environment right so like well if you see the screen what you see here is Intel fab 32 is it it as class 10 cleanroom meaning there are no more than 10 particles measuring 0.5 micron or larger per one cubic foot of air right you can see class 10 hmm no more than 10 particles now generally when you see a Fablab generally see a Fablab you will find that in a conventional clean room facility which is one hundred thousand ten thousand right you will find several equipment such as lpcvd we are just talking about CVD right chemical vapour deposition low pressure chemical vapour deposition there is a pecvd which you can see here right is from Oxford I think yes it's from Oxford then we have pi star CVD for your wet oxidation dry oxidation then you have your CMP for polishing the wafer then you have dicing so for dicing the chips then you have Bhandar for bonding silicon with silicon so you need that kind of application when we are making a microphone a chip then you have a thermal evaporator then you have a parallel in depositor this is a plastic deposition polymer deposition you have a sputtering system you may have a EBA operator you may have a then turn even thermally operator has a thermally operation you have a photoresist spin station you have a polymer spin station like su8 you have a EVG 6:20 mask aligner you can also MJ before mask aligner I'd like it you can see here it's a veggie mm jb3 you can MJB 3 4 whatever masculine or in general masculine herbal you will see then you will see a plasma system for bonding glass with PDMS then you may have wet etching you have RIE you may have fluorine chlorine and you may have DRI so these are they like a few of the equipment that you will generally find in a cleanroom conventional cleanroom which is hundred thousand ten thousand even class 10 but what we also see a a clean room where the biology experiments have to be performed in such a kind of cleanroom you may have where you can also design you can design the device you can fabricate the device and you can perform experiments right such kind of facilities are available in few of the top class universities across the world and we are trying to replicate a small facility over here as well so that kind of window where a person can work at the interface of biology medicine and engineering you will feel you will see a thermal evaporator you can see a pathology of actuation there will be a 3d cell culture about safety hood right it will be a imaging microscope there can be spin coater there can be peristaltic pump there can be upright microscope you see prostatic palm spin coater operate macroeconomic metallurgical microscope biosafety hole you can see here right you can see a fume hood here you can see a micro manipulator here you can see an incubator or oh one right di plant oxygen plasma system so on and it's not limited to only discs this many equipment there can be few more like there can be wet etching right it is a acid acid wet etching and can be solvent right then you have a mask aligner you have a inverted microscope fluorescent microscope you have hepa filters right you have an autoclave you have the you have the system for tissue right tissue microarray micro grid and it's also called microtome by the way and of course you have the vacuum or one that you can see here so so a lot of things you will see in reality in the laboratory so let me let me tell you what you will be looking at when you actually go to the Fab Lab we will show it to you as a part of this course right we will show you the microscope all three microscope will show you metallurgical microscope inverted microscope and Sedo microscope we will show you this biosafety hood right we will show you micro manipulator will show you oh one will show you an incubator well show you very static pump right then we will also show you hepa filters hepa filters will show you oh one and we'll show you auto cliff all right so it will be like half an hour or one hour on each of the system so you understand how it can be operated how it can be used not just to show you what facilities should contain what equipment are there no to show you how to operate that equipment right if you and how to enter a cleanroom what kind of precaution you should take what kind of garment you should wear right if you made a full sleeve you should have a toe cover shoe right it should cover your toe you should have error a code lab code blows right a beer covered a head cap right Google's to protect your eye so how can you how to enter a laboratory once you enter the laboratory what kind of equipment are that once you see the equipment how to use this equipment so that is the idea and that will be the part of this particular course as well so when we if you see the slide when we talk about this equipment let us see some similar facilities occur around the world so if you see the screen if you see the screen what you see is bio molecular nanotechnology Center which is at Berkley you can see here right this is a unique fabrication and experimental facility specializing in bio MEMS biomedical micro electromechanical system and microphonic devices these exciting technologies are poised to really revolutionize medical diagnostics analytical chemistry proteomics genomics and cell biology you can see biology experiments that should be done in a clean room in a clean room class 10,000 right the same way if you see nano bio lab at Brisbane Institute of Science Israel they have the similar kind of facility uua we have similar facility at Fuji electric and we also have a separate Brickman technology center at Purdue University for especially this is a whole Center dedicated for biology pharmaceutical in them to facility Iona towards research collaboration with mainly about Center bioscience Center so point is do we require such a big thing I I'm not I'm not saying we should have this right what I'm saying is if class 10,000 environment a cleanroom environment is provided then we can do research in multiple areas of biology as well as medical medicine and pharmacy and and work on biomedical devices and so on and so forth so now when we talk about cleanroom the most important equipment or a tool is HEPA filter right so what exactly HEPA filter is so the critical particulate concentration is controlled and maintained in a cleanroom environment using a HEPA filter and he passed Ann's for high efficiency particulate air so generally when you see it it works like this so there is an exhaust air that goes through here and there is a coarse filter is a rotary head air heat exchanger there is a electrostatic cleaner there is a HEPA filter and the fresh shell goes like this the exhaust air goes back right and this is how it works there is a positive pressure module and there are tower modules that can apply a positive pressure our representative air cleaning setup is shown here right it usually consists of as positive pressure module that cleans the incoming air and the role of positive patient module is to clean the incoming air and array of filters that then pushes the air into the room and to maintain it at a higher pressure so the particles don't easily enter right so that's an advantage of high pressure so that the particles from outside would not enter the room along with positive pressure model there will be at tower module for circulating of internal air these are also shown right you can see here on the in the figure this HEPA filter system forms a core mechanism through which the cleanroom environment is maintained HEPA filters are used to keep the cleanroom environment stable right so for this particular module let us stop here and we have to see another part of this particular lecture in the next module where you will be looking at equipments some chemicals related to it then how they are used right how the tissue culture is done how the cell culture is done we'll take in the next model as a part of the same class till then you just go through it this is more like an informative lecture so that you understand what kind of facilities are there and how you can culture the cells as well as tissue right and then you take care I'll see you in the next class bye
