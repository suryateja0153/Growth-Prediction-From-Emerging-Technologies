  What is clean meat and is it safe what is clean meet clean meat is a term used for any meat product that has been produced in a Bio factory setting without having our region aided from that killed animal the terms lab grown meat and cultured meat is often used for the same concept in recent years research into cells and cell growth have allowed scientist to create a method where muscle tissue can grow in the lab from a tiny sample initially this method was and still is being developed for human organ production but it opened the way for ethical meat production were no animal needs to be harm to supply meet the term clean meet originates from the fact that meet manufactured in this way is free from all disease hormones antibiotics and pesticides clean meat is also a greener choice than regular meat towel is clean meet made the first step in the creation of clean meat is the extraction of cells from an animal these cells need to be fast growing cells such as stem cells or my oblasts else how this is done can vary but stem cells for example can be obtained from bird feathers that the bird has shed still my oblast cells are most often used as they have already developed into muscle cells unlike stem cells which would need to be pre program to turn into muscle cells my oblast cells can be easily obtained from a biopsy of an animal's muscle cells with very little discomfort for the animal when the origin cells are obtain the next step is to grow those cells in a Bio a reactor which supplies the cells with the nutrition and environment they need to multiply and grow into a muscle this step is the complicated part of this process which is still being researched and optimized the method most cited today is a scaffold based technique in principle this method involves the proliferation of suitable muscle cells on a scaffold in the presence of a nutritional culture medium the soul food the scaffold is moved and stretched periodically to mimic animal movements and eventually a Lien clean muscle is produced which would mimic a real animal muscle it is theoretically possible to continue this process infinitely by extracting a few my oblast cells from each production bats however it is likely that the cells would in fact aged and a fresh batch of my oblast cells would need to be introduced to the production periodically finally the muscle is harvested from the scaffold when fully grown and usually minced future development could see the creation of whole muscles as big as those on our real animal offering choice chops with the same flavor and texture as animal meat is clean meet safe this is a big question and it is reasonable to worry about the safety of food manufactured in this manner it is a brand new technology and production mistakes may happen what is known is that there are no short term ill effects from eating clean meet other than those experienced when eating regular meet there are however no long-term studies simply because this form of meat production is in its infancy even sell in theory there should not be any bill side effects and all other than those seen with regular animal meet since there should not be any chemical differences between the lean muscle part of clean meat and the same parts in regular meet in fact Klein meat should even be safer than regular animal meat as chances of bacterial contamination in clean meet our next to none at the same time conventional animal meat can be infected by listeria be totally temple aback to ran more there is also the risk of toxoplasmosis and in rare cases quotes fell Jakob disease none of this would be a risk with clean meet clean me it would also be free of all pesticides tranquilizers and a warmers there it is however and need for preservatives during the production of clean to protect the growing meat from east and fungus still such preservatives would be similar if not the same to those used in a variety of pre made food today taking all this into account that seem self evident that while perhaps not 100% safe clean me it would at least be a safer choice than regular meat is clean meet as nutritional as conventional animal meet at the moment clean meat has a nutritional disadvantage over conventional meat as it lacks many of the nutrients that are found in animal meat however as the technology advances and costs drop there is no reason to expect that most if not all the nutrients contained in conventional meat could also be found in clean meet these extra nutrients could either be added manually to the meat or even grown into the muscle as clean meet technology advances the nutritional content of clean meat can even now be controlled to appoint for example the fat in clean meat can be exchanged for the healthy romy the three fatty acids or some other fact that would be appropriate clean meet could also be fortified with vitamins and minerals just as juice and cereals are today so in the long run clean meat should at the end be even more nutritional than traditional animal meat and most likely end up as a much healthier choice when the technology has matured somewhat maybe one day we will need to reconstruct this pier and it as clean meat will have the best nutrition of a little first there is the ethical question of whether humans have the right to slaughter and mistreat animals for meet with clean meet this becomes a moot point as the meat source is completely free of the animal cruelty and slaughter second is the environmental impact clean meat production takes considerably less land to produce the same amount of meat you would get from animals this a loan should reduce and even stop global deforestation there is also a massive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions connected to the production and transportation of the animal meat on top of this the water usage per KG of meat produced is tiny for clean meet compared to conventional animal meet so from an environmental perspective choosing to eat clean meet over regular meat is a no brainer thirdly is the reduction and hopefully elimination of antibiotics used in meat production traditional meat production is heavily reliant on antibiotics due to unsanitary living conditions and port handling of livestock this fact is quite horrible as this misuse of antibiotics is the leading cause of antibiotic resistant bacteria appearing in shod in my opinion the band globally when this is written the last form of antibiotic known to work on all bacteria is now being used in India for chicken production because of this it is simply a matter of time until a bacteria strain which is immune to all forms of antibiotics will emerge threatening a global pandemic when it comes to clean meet the facts are simple clean me will not need any antibiotics ever finally clean meet might be the final solution to world hunger since there is no limit on how much meat can be produced opposed to traditional meat production where access to land is a limiting factor if you run out of space in your factory you can just add another level on top of the one you have when we'll clean meet be commercially of a little the production cost of clean meat has continued to drop since 2013 win a $250.000 hamburger was made as a publicity stunt today it is almost down to a point which is competitive with the cost of producing meet traditionally further development should see the production price drop even further it is estimated that loud groan meat will be widely available in the year 2020 and where the increases in mass production it could mean that clean meat will in the end be far cheaper than regular meat I for 1:00 AM excited for this as I will not hesitate in changing my eating habits from traditional meat to clean meet how can I help make this real by spreading the word you can help others understand that this technology is in fact a world changing endeavour which will finally and humanities need to slaughter animals for meat so pleased share this article wherever you think is appropriate also when clean meet hits the supermarkets you should not hesitate to buy it over regular meat if the public accepts clean meet quickly it will only speed up the shift from animal meat to clean meet finally forcing your support will make it hard are for opposing lobby groups to delay the adoption of this
