 lab-grown meat is coming with at least three companies releasing products to the market in the near future lab-grown meat does not need to be genetically modified this may be the start of a new age a second domestication of animals where just the muscle cells are grown without harming the animal wasting animal parts and greatly reducing the impact of the meat industry on the environment the meat industry is responsible for around 50% of all greenhouse gas emissions growing livestock uses around 25% of available land and very large parts of freshwater reserves meat is easily contaminated and human and animal interactions can cause the jumping of diseases like avian flu and the meat industry causes vast amounts of animal suffering with the livestock stuffed into tiny spaces in addition the meat industry is the biggest consumer of antibiotics leading us to antibiotic resistance and an era of super bacteria but we're nowhere near getting lab-grown meat cheap and widely available this is the very beginning let's see how that grow meat is made and what the challenges facing - - field scale production arm let's take a look at the basic process for culturing meat a sample of meat is taken from an anesthetized animal adult muscle stem cells also known as satellite cells are separated from the sample these cells are then grown in an environment that resembles the animal body as close as possible with oxygen and appropriate nutrients present in the growth medium that is the liquid surrounding the cells the growing of these cells can be divided into two phases first the stem cells are replicated to grow their number and then the replicated cells are ushered to develop into muscle cells this is how white posts research group from the University of Maastricht made the world's first cultured hamburger costing around two hundred and fifty thousand euros or three hundred and twenty five thousand dollars the price was this high because the burger was made of around twenty thousand tiny strips of meat separately hand grown and then combined we can't grow blood vessels to the cultured muscle cells to supply them with oxygen and nutrients and that's why the cells could only be grown in very thin layers for muscle cells to grow they need a framework to attach to one method that's looking promising for growing muscle cells in an industrial scale is to use small beads as the framework for the cells to grow on that the beads can be made of starch that is carbohydrates or collagen the protein in between cells and tissues or other similar materials these beads can float in the growth medium and thus muscle cells are not limited to going on a flat surface beads are small enough for oxygen and nutrients to be able to reach all cells growing in the bead another obstacle to growing a meat artificially is the fact that animal serum that is blood with the blood cells and blood clotting protease removed has been traditionally used as part of the growth for medium it provides the cells different factors they need for a growth but it's expensive and not something you'd want to used on an industrial scale the companies rolling out lab-grown meats have researched animal-free growth mediums intensely and companies like memphis meats and just inked both claimed that they have come up with alternative solutions to make things trickier cells from different species need their own animal free growth medium recipes the cow satellite muscle cells seem especially picky and have been difficult to grow without an animal growth medium according to just in the first product teaching the markets in 2018 is going to be something avian the starting stem cell line is also something that is crucial to get right the satellite adult stem cells can only make more of themselves or turn into muscle cells they can't make bone or fat cells etc and they can only divide around 20 times another cell type that has also been studied for the starting material of muscle cells are pluripotent stem cells pluripotent means capable of many things the core important stem cells have the capability to become many more cell types than just muscle cells in fact they can make all the cells in the body and they can divide unlimitedly unlike the satellite cells since their satellite cells can only divide around 20 times new cells have to be harvested from animals once in a while in contrast a pluripotent stem cell line is like sourdough yeast once you have it going you have it poeta the only problem is that we don't have a pluripotent stem cell line from a cow taking embryonic stem cells from a cow is possible but it's proven difficult to keep the cells going on in the lab induced pluripotent stem cells are also an option here a specific set of genes is artificially activated in a cell like a fat cell and this turns the cell into a pluripotent stem cell it's really a fascinating topic and absolutely deserves a video of its own induced pluripotent Pig cells have been used to produce muscle cells and this has been done without animal serum another alternative would be to immortalize the satellite cells making them capable of infinite cell divisions an effective way to immortalize a cell is to turn on the gene producing to telomere repairing telomerase enzyme telomeres are repeating DNA the end of chromosomes that shorten as the cell divides the more the cell divides the shorter the telomeres get when the telomeres are short enough the cell can't divide anymore activating the telomerase enzyme in the cell fixes the shortened telomeres giving the cell infinite life but this requires genetic engineering and marketing the Meade product gets more difficult even when the cells can effectively be supplied with nutrients and oxygen the growth medium is perfected and cell lines are optimized for muscle cell production the end product is not going to be anything close to a steak it's going to be a mass of cells resembling minced meat a lot of research is directed towards perfecting the taste by growing fat cells with the muscle cells and finding ways to stimulate the cells to produce lots of protein but the taste of meat is determined by around a thousand different chemicals and part of the taste comes from what happens to the meat when butchered it forums lactic acid its pH drops and the tissue breaking proteins start working getting lab-grown me to resemble a steak is still far off but this technology is taking its very first steps with time and it may drastically change the way we consume meat assuming that the public is willing to embrace a technological solution to one of the great problems of modern society although growing meats in a lab can be quite energy intensive at least in the beginning the huge potential for lowering fresh water and land use limiting methane emissions from cows animal welfare and safety our goal is to strive for thanks for watching if you're liking the content and want to help this
