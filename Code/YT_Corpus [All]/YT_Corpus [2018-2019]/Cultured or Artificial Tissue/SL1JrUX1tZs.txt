 symbiodinium is a genus that encompasses the largest and most prevalent group of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates known these unicellular algae commonly reside in the endoderm of tropical cnidarians such as corals sea anemones and jellyfish where the products of their photosynthetic processing are exchanged in the host for inorganic molecules they are also harbored by various species of sponge flatworms mollusks such as the giant clams foraminifera Sora dates and some ciliates generally these dinoflagellates enter the host cell through phagocytosis persist as intracellular symbionts reproduce and disperse to the environment the exception is in most mollusks where symbiodinium are intercellular between the cells cnidarians that are associated with symbiodinium occur mostly in warm oligotrophic nutrient poor marine environments where they are often the dominant constituents of benthic communities these dinoflagellates are therefore among the most abundant eukaryotic microbes found in coral reef ecosystems symbiodinium are colloquially called zooxanthellae an animal symbiotic with algae and this genus are said to be zooxanthellae the term was loosely used to refer to any golden-brown endosymbionts including diatoms and other dinoflagellates continued use of the term in the scientific literature as discouraged because of the confusion caused by overly generalizing taxonomically diverse symbiotic relationships recently systematics of sym by adding the AC was revised in which the distinct clades have been reassigned into seven general following this revision the name symbiodinium is now a genus name for only species that were previously classified as clade a the other clades were reclassified as distinct general c molecular systematics below topic intracellular symbionts you symbiodinium are known primarily for their role as mutualistic endosymbionts in hosts they usually occur in high densities ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions per square centimeter the successful culturing of swimming Jim Nadine Hoyt sells from coral led to the discovery that zooxanthellae were actually dinoflagellates each symbiodinium cell is Co coid in hospit living in a host cell and surrounded by a membrane that originates from the host cell plasma lemma during phagocytosis figures to be and three this membrane probably undergoes some modification to its protein content which functions to limit or prevent Vega lysosome fusion the vacuole structure containing the symbian does therefore termed the symbiote zone a single symbian cell occupies each symbiote zone it is unclear how this membrane expands to accommodate a dividing symbian cell under normal conditions symbian and host cells exchange organic and inorganic molecules that enable the growth and proliferation of both partners topic natural services and economic value you symbiodinium is one of the most studied symbionts there mutualistic relationships with reef building corals form the basis of a highly diverse and productive ecosystem coral reefs have economic benefits valued at hundreds of billions of dollars each year in the form of ornamental subsistence and commercial fisheries tourism and recreation coastal protection from storms a source of bioactive compounds for pharmaceutical development and more topic coral bleaching the study of symbiodinium biology is driven largely by a desire to understand global coral reef decline a chief mechanism for widespread reef degradation has been stress induced coral bleaching caused by unusually high seawater temperature bleaching is the disassociation of the coral and the symbian and/or loss of chlorophyll within the alga resulting in a precipitous loss in the animals pigmentation many symbiodinium cnidarian associations are affected by sustained elevation of sea surface temperatures but may also result from exposure to high radiance levels including UV are extreme low temperatures low salinity and other factors the bleached state is associated with decreased host calcification increased disease susceptibility and if prolonged partial or total mortality the magnitude of mortality from a single bleaching event can be global in scale as it was in 2015 these episodes are predicted to become more common and severe as temperatures worldwide continue to rise the physiology of a resident symbiodinium species often regulates the bleaching susceptibility of a coral therefore a significant amount of research has focused on characterizing the physiological basis of thermal tolerance and in identifying the ecology and distribution of thermally tolerant symbionts species symbiodinium trench is a stress tolerant species and is able to form mutualistic relationships with many species of coral it is present in small numbers in coral globally and is common in the Andaman Sea where the water is about 4 degrees Celsius 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than in other parts of the Indian Ocean in the Caribbean Sea in late 2005 water temperature was elevated for several months and it was found that s trench II a Symbian not normally abundant took up residence in many corals in which it had not previously been observed those corals did not bleach two years later it had largely been replaced as a Symbian by the species normally found in the Caribbean s Therma phylum was recently found to make up the bulk of the algal population inside the corals of the Persian Gulf it is also present in the Gulf of Oman and the red sea at a much lower concentration coral that hosted this species was able to tolerate the 35 degrees Celsius 95 degrees Fahrenheit waters of the Persian Gulf much hotter than the 31 degrees Celsius 88 degrees Fahrenheit of coral reefs globally topic molecular systematics the advent of DNA sequence comparison initiated a rebirth in the ordering and naming of all organisms the application of this methodology helped overturn the long-held belief that symbiodinium comprised a single species a process which began in earnest with the morphological physiological and biochemical comparisons of cultured isolates currently genetic markers are exclusively used to describe ecological patterns and deduce evolutionary relationships among morphologically cryptic members of this group for most in the molecular systematics of symbiodinium as to resolve ecologically relevant units of diversity ie species topic phylogenetic disparity among clades the earliest ribosomal gene sequence data indicated that symbiodinium had lineages whose genetic divergence was similar to that seen in other dinoflagellates from different general families and even orders this large phylogenetic disparity among clades a b c etc was confirmed by analyses of the sequences of the mitochondrial gene coding for cytochrome c oxidase subunit i among Dinah Fosse a most of these clade groupings comprised numerous reproductively isolated genetically distinct lineages c species diversity exhibiting different ecological and bio geographic distributions c geographic distributions and patterns of diversity recently these distinct clades within the class of sim by adding the AC have been reassigned although no exclusively into seven general symbiodinium clade a reveal l'm clade b cleric opium clade c Duras din IAM clay d f rhenium clade a few gation clade F and jarric lidium clade G topic species diversity the recognition of species diversity in this genus remained problematic for many decades do the challenges of identifying morphological and biochemical traits useful for diagnosing species presently phylogenetic ecological and population genetic data can be more rapidly acquired to resolve symbiodinium in two separate entities that are consistent with biological evolutionary and ecological species concepts most genetics based measures of diversity have been estimated from the analysis of one genetic marker eg LSU I TS 2 or C P 23 s yet in recent studies these and other markers were analysed in combination the high concordance found among nuclear mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA argues that a hierarchical phylogenetic scheme combined with ecological and population genetic data can unambiguously recognize an assigned nomenclature to reproductively isolated lineages ie species the analysis of additional phylogenetic markers show that some symbiodinium that were initially identified by slight differences in its sequences may comprise members of the same species whereas in other cases two or more genetically divergent lineages can possess the same ancestral its sequence when analyzed in the context of the major species concepts the majority of I TS to sequence data provide a reasonable proxy for species diversity currently I TS two types number in the hundreds but most communities of symbiotic Synod area around the world still require a comprehensive sampling furthermore there appears to be a large number of unique species found in association with equally diverse species assemblages of Soret ID foraminifera as well as many other symbiodinium that are exclusively free living and found in varied often benthic habitats given the potential species diversity of these ecologically cryptic symbiodinium the total species number may never be accurately assess topic clone diversity and population genetics through the use of microsatellite markers multi locus genotypes identifying a single clonal line of symbiodinium can be resolved from samples of host tissue it appears that most individual colonies harbor a single multi locus genotype ie clone extensive sampling with in colonies confirms that many colonies harbor a homogeneous clonal symbiodinium population additional genotypes do occur in some colonies yet rarely more than two or three are found when present in the same colony multiple clones often exhibit narrow zones of overlap colonies adjacent to each other on a reef may harbor identical clones but across the host population the clone diversity of a particular symbiodinium species is potentially large and comprises recombinant genotypes that are the product of sexual recombination a clone tends to remain dominant in a colony over many months and years but maybe occasionally displaced or replaced the few studies examining clone dispersal find that most genotypes have limited Geographic distributions but that dispersal and gene flow is likely influenced by hosts life history and mode of symbian acquisition eg horizontal versus vertical topic species diversity ecology and biogeography you topic geographic distributions and patterns of diversity you symbiodinium are perhaps the best group for studying micro eukaryote physiology and ecology for several reasons firstly available phylogenetic and population genetic markers allow for detailed examination of their genetic diversity over broad spatial and temporal scales also large quantities of symbiodinium cells are readily obtained through the collection of hosts that harbor them lastly their association with animals provides an additional axis by which to compare and contrast ecological distributions the earliest genetic methods for assessing symbiodinium diversity relied on low resolution molecular markers that separated the genus into a few evolutionarily divergent lineages referred to as clades previous characterizations of geographic distribution and dominance have focused on the clade level of genetic resolution but more detailed assessments of diversity at the species level are needed while members of a given clade may be ubiquitous the species diversity within each clade is potentially large with each species often having different ecological and geographic distributions related to their dispersal ability host biogeography and external environmental conditions a small number of species occur in temperate environments where few symbiotic animals occur as a result these high latitude associations tend to be highly species specific topic species diversity assigned to different ecological guilds the large diversity of symbiodinium revealed by genetic analyses is distributed non randomly and appears to comprised several guilds with distinct ecological habits of the many symbiodinium characterized genetically most are host specific mutualistic and dominate their host others may represent compatible symbionts that remain as low abundance background populations because of competitive inferiority under the prevailing external environmental conditions eg high light versus low light some may also comprise opportunistic species that may proliferate during periods of physiological stress and displace the normal resident Symbian tanned remain abundant in the hosts tissues for months to years before being replaced by the original Symbian there are also those that rapidly infect and establish populations in host juveniles until being replaced by symbionts that normally associate with hosts adult colonies finally there appears to be another group of symbiodinium that are incapable of establishing endosymbiosis yet exist in environments around the animal or associate closely with other substrates ie macro algal surfaces sediment surface symbiodinium from functional groups 2 3 & 4 are known to exist because they culture easily however species with these life histories are difficult to study because of their low abundance in the environment topic free living in non symbiotic populations there are a few examples of documented populations of free living symbiodinium given that most host larvae must initially acquire their symbionts from the environment viable symbiodinium cells occur outside the host the modal phase is probably important in the external environment and facilitates the rapid infection of host larvae the use of apis symbiotic host polyps deployed as capture vessels and the application of molecular techniques has allowed for the detection of environmental sources of symbiodinium with these methods employed investigators may resolve the distribution of different species on various benthic surfaces and cell densities suspended in the water column the genetic identities of cells cultured from the environment are often dissimilar to those found in hosts these likely do not form endosymbiosis and are entirely free living they are different from dispersing symbiotic species learning more about the private lives of these environmental populations and their ecological function will further our knowledge about the diversity dispersal success and evolution among members within this large genus topic culturing certain symbiodinium strains and/or species are more easily cultured and can persist in artificial or supplemented sea water media eg ASP 8a f2 for decades the comparison of cultured isolates under identical conditions show clear differences in morphology size biochemistry gene expression swimming behavior growth rates etc this pioneering comparative approach initiated a slow paradigm shift in recognizing that this gene is comprised more than a single species it should be noted that culturing is a selective process and many symbiodinium isolates growing on artificial media are not typical of the species normally associated with a particular host indeed most host specific species have yet to be cultured samples for genetic analysis should be acquired from the source colony in order to match the resulting culture with the identity of the dominant and ecologically relevant symbian originally harbored by the animal topic lifecycle the lifecycle of symbiodinium was first described from cells growing in culture media for isolates that are in log phase growth division rates occur every one to three days with symbiodinium cells alternating between a spherical or coke coid morphology and a smaller flagellated modal master goat stage see morphological characteristics while several similar schemes are published that describe how each morphological state transitions to other the most compelling life history reconstruction was deduced from light and electron microscopy and nuclear staining evidence during asexual propagation sometimes referred to as mitotic or vegetative growth cells undergo a deal cycle of karyokinesis chromosome nuclear division in darkness the mother cell then divides cytokinesis soon after exposure to light and releases to motile cells the initiation and duration of motility varies among species approaching or at the end of the photo period the master goat see swimming release their flagella and undergo a rapid metamorphosis into the kokoity as cultures reach stationary growth phase fewer and fewer motile cells are observed indicating slower division rates large tetrads are occasionally observed particularly when cells in stationary growth phase are transferred to fresh media however it is unknown whether this stage is the product two consecutive mitotic divisions or perhaps a process that generates sexually competent motile cells ie gametes or is the end result of meiosis following gamete fusion there is no cytological evidence for sexual recombination and meiosis has never been observed but population genetic evidence supports the view that symbiodinium periodically undergo events of sexual recombination how when and where the sexual phase in their life history occurs remains unknown topic morphology the morphological description of the genus symbiodinium is originally based on the type species hollow type symbiodinium micro Adriatica because these dinoflagellates possess two major stages in their life history see above namely the master goat modal and kokoity non-modal stages the morphology of both is described in order to provide a complete diagnosis of the organism topic flagellated masta goat cell the modal flagellated formas jim nadine e ID and advocate the relative dimensions of the epoch own and hyper cone differ among species the alveoli are most visible in the modal phase but lack fibrous cellulosic structures found indicate armoured dinoflagellates between the points of origin of the two flagella as an extensible structure of unknown function called the peduncle in other dinoflagellates an analogous structure has been implicated in heterotrophic feeding and sexual recombination in symbiodinium it has been suggested that the peduncle may be involved in substrate attachment explaining why certain cells seem to spin in place compared to other Jimmy Dean Yogendra there is little or no displacement at the sulcus where the ends of the cingulum groove converged the internal organelles of the master goat are essentially the same as described in the colloid cell see below the transition from master goat to co coid stage in symbiodinium occurs rapidly but details about cellular changes are unknown mucus ist's and ejecta organelle located beneath the plasma lemma are found in s pile OSEM and their function is unknown but may be involved in heterotrophic feeding topic colloids cell the colloids cell of symbiodinium is spherical and ranges an average diameter from 6 to 13 micrometers depending on the species blank at all 1989 this stage is often wrongly interpreted as a dinah cyst hence in published literature the alga in hospital referred to as a vegetative cyst the term cyst usually refers to a dormant metabolically quiescent stage in the life history of other dinoflagellates initiated by several factors including nutrient availability temperature and day length such cysts permit extended resistance to unfavorable environmental conditions colloids symbiodinium cells are metabolically active as they photosynthesize undergo mitosis and actively synthesize proteins and nucleic acids while most dinoflagellates undergo mitosis as a master goat in symbiodinium mitosis occurs exclusively in the kokoity cell topic cell wall the colloids cell is surrounded by a cellulosic usually smooth cell wall that contains large molecular weight proteins and glycoproteins cell walls grow thicker in culture than in hospital Evan B the cell membrane plasma lemma is located beneath the cell wall yet little is known about its composition and function in terms of the regulation of transmembrane transport of metabolites during karyokinesis and cytokinesis the cell wall remains intact until the master goats escape the mother cell in culture the discarded walls accumulate at the bottom of the culture vessel it is not known what becomes of the walls from divided cells in Hospit one species s Pylos 'm possesses Tufts of hair like projections from the cell wall this is the only known surface characteristic used to diagnose a species in the genus topic chloroplasts most described species possess a single peripheral reticulated chloroplast bounded by three membranes the volume of the cell occupied by the chloroplast varies among species the lamellae comprised three closely oppress'd stacked thylakoids and are attached by two stocks to the PI R enoyed surrounded by a starch sheath in three of the described species the thylakoids are in parallel arrays but in s Pylos 'm there are also peripheral lamellae there are no thylakoid membranes invading the PI renoise which is unlike other symbiotic dinoflagellates the lipid components of thylakoids include the galacto lipids mono galactose l diglycerides Digga lactose whole diglycerides the sulfa lipid sulfate keno bissell diglyceride phosphatidyl glycerol and phosphatidylcholine associated with these are various fatty acids the light harvesting and reaction center components in the thylakoid membrane include a water-soluble paradeen and chlorophyll CHL a protein complex pcp and a membrane bound CHL a CHL c2 paradeen and protein complex AC PPC along with typical photosynthetic electron transport systems such as the photosystem 2 reaction Center and the CHL app 700 reaction center complex of photosystem I also associated with the thylakoids are the xanthophylls do not contain iodine Ockendon diet och Anthon and the Carradine B carotene the period contains the nuclear encoded enzyme type 2 ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase Rubisco which is responsible for the catalysis of inorganic carbon dioxide into organic compounds all cultured isolates ie strains are capable of phenotypic adjustment in their capacity for light harvesting ie photo acclamation such as by altering the cellular CH Ella and parenting in quota as well as the size and number of photosynthetic units however the ability to acclimate as a reflection of genetic differences among species that are differently adapted evolved to a particular photic environment for example s Pylos 'm is characterized as a highlight adapted species while others are low-light adapted SQ agouti or adapted to a larger range in varying light fields micro Adriatica topic nucleus in general the nucleus is centrally located and the nucleolus is often associated with the inner nuclear membrane the chromosomes as in other dinoflagellates are seen as permanently super coiled DNA in transmission electron micrograph stem the described species of symbiodinium possessed distinct chromosome numbers ranging from 26 to 97 which remained constant throughout all phases of the nuclear cycle however during M phase the volume of each chromosome has have as is the volume of each of the two resulting nuclei thus the ratio of chromosome volume to nuclear volume remains constant these observations are consistent with the interpretation that the algae are haploid a conclusion supported by molecular genetic data during S phase of the nuclear cycle the chromosomes do uncoil to facilitate DNA synthesis and the volumes of both the chromosomes and the nucleus return to those seen in the g2 stage topic other cytoplasmic organelles there are several additional organelles found in the cytoplasm of symbiodinium the most obvious of these as the structure referred to as the accumulation body this is a membrane-bound vesicles vacuole with contents that are unrecognizable but appear red or yellow under the light microscope it may serve to accumulate cellular debris or act as an auto fat chick vacuole in which non-functional organelles are digested and their components recycled during mitosis only one daughter cell appears to acquire this structure there are other vacuoles that may contain membranous inclusions while still others contain crystalline material variously interpreted as oxalate crystals or crystalline uric acid topic species the following species are recognized by the world register of marine species symbiodinium Bermudan Sark a trench 1993 symbiodinium California
