 aluminium or aluminum as a chemical element with symbol al and atomic number 13 it is a silvery-white soft non-magnetic and ductile metal in the boron group by mass aluminium makes up about 8% of the Earth's crust it is the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon and the most abundant metal in the crust though it is less common in the mantle below the chief or of aluminium is bauxite aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments instead it has found combined in over 270 different minerals aluminium is remarkable for its low density and its ability to resist corrosion through the phenomenon of passivation aluminium and it's alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and important in transportation and building industries such as building facades and window frames the oxides and sulfates are the most useful compounds of aluminium despite its prevalence in the environment no known form of life uses aluminium salts metabolically but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals because of these salts abundance the potential for a biological role for them as of continuing interest and studies continue topic physical characteristics you topic nuclei and isotopes aluminium atomic number is 13 of aluminium isotopes only one is stable 27 al this is consistent with the fact aluminium atomic number is odd it is the only isotope that has existed on earth in its current form since the creation of the planet it is essentially the only isotope representing the element on earth which makes aluminium a mono nucleic element and practically equates its standard atomic weight to that of the isotope such a low standard atomic weight of aluminium has some effects on the properties of the element see below all other isotopes are radioactive and could not have survived the most stable isotope of these is 26 out half-life 720 thousand years 26 al is produced from argon in the atmosphere by spallation caused by cosmic ray protons and used in radio dating the ratio of 26 al to 10 B has been used to study transport deposition sediment storage burial times and erosion on 105 to 106 year timescales most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of 26 all was responsible for the melting and differentiation of some asteroids after their formation 4.5 5 billion years ago the remaining isotopes of aluminium with mass numbers ranging from 21 to 43 all have half-lives well under an hour 3 metastable states are known all with half-lives under a minute topic electron shell an aluminium atom has 13 electrons arranged in an electron configuration of nay three's 23 p1 with 3 electrons Beyond a stable noble gas configuration accordingly the combined first 3 ionization energies of aluminium are far lower than the fourth ionization energy alone aluminium can relatively easily surrender its three outermost electrons in many chemical reactions see below the electronegativity of aluminium is 1.6 1 Pauling scale a free aluminium atom has a radius of 143 p.m. with the three outermost electrons removed the radius shrinks to 39 p.m. for a four coordinated atom or 53.5 p.m. for a six coordinated atom at standard temperature and pressure aluminium atoms when not affected by atoms of other elements form a face centered cubic crystal system bound by metallic bonding provided by atoms outermost electrons hence aluminium at these conditions is a metal this crystal system is shared by some other metals such as lead and copper the size of a unit cell of aluminium is comparable to that of those other metals topic bulk aluminium medal-winning quantity is very shiny and resembles silver because it preferentially absorbs far ultraviolet radiation while reflecting all visible light so it does not impart any color to reflected light unlike the reflectance spectra of copper and gold another important characteristic of aluminium is its low density 2.7 0 grams per cc aluminium is a relatively soft durable lightweight ductile and malleable with appearance ranging from silvery to dull gray depending on the surface roughness it is non-magnetic and does not easily ignite a fresh film of aluminium serves as a good reflector approximately 92% of visible light and an excellent reflector as much as 98% of medium and far infrared radiation the yield strength of pure aluminium is 7 to 11 mega pascals while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from 200 mega pascals to 600 mega pascals aluminium has about 1/3 the density and stiffness of steel it is easily machined cast drawn and extruded aluminium atoms are arranged in a face centered cubic FCC structure aluminium has a stacking fault energy of approximately 200 milli Joule x' per square meter aluminium is a good thermal and electrical conductor having 59% the conductivity of copper both thermal and electrical while having only 30% of coppers density aluminium is capable of superconductivity with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2 kelvin and a critical magnetic field of about 100 gauss 10 milli Tesla's aluminium is the most common material for the fabrication of superconducting qubits topic chemistry aluminium scre ocean resistance can be excellent due to a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide that forms when the bare metal is exposed to air effectively preventing further oxidation in a process termed passivation the strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to galvanic reactions with alloyed copper this corrosion resistance is greatly reduced by aqueous salts particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals in highly acidic solutions aluminium reacts with water to form hydrogen and in highly alkaline ones to form illuminates protective passivation under these conditions is negligible primarily because it is corroded by dissolved chlorides such as common sodium chloride household plumbing is never made from aluminium however because of its general resistance to corrosion aluminium is one of the few metals that retain silvery reflectance in finely powdered form making it an important component of silver colored paints aluminium mirror finish has the highest reflectance of any metal in the 200 to 400 nanometers UV and the three thousand to ten thousand nanometers far IR regions in the 400 to 700 nanometers visible range it is slightly outperformed by ten and silver and in the seven hundred to three thousand nanometers near IR by silver gold and copper aluminium is oxidized by water at temperatures below 280 degrees Celsius to produce hydrogen aluminium hydroxide and heat to out plus 6 h2o to aluminium hydroxide plus 3 h2 this conversion is of interest for the production of hydrogen however commercial application of this fact has challenges in circumventing the passivating oxide layer which inhibits the reaction and in storing the energy required to regenerate the aluminium metal topic in organic compounds the vast majority of compounds including all Al containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds feature aluminium in the oxidation state three plus the coordination number of such compounds varies but generally out three plus as six coordinate or tetra coordinate almost all compounds of aluminium three are colorless all four trihalides are well known unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides aluminium fluoride aluminium fluoride features six coordinate al the octahedral coordination environment for aluminium fluoride is related to the compactness of the fluoride ion six of which can fit around the small al three plus Center aluminium fluoride sublimes with cracking at 1291 degrees Celsius 2,000 356 degrees Fahrenheit with heavier halides the coordination numbers are lower the other trihalides are dimeric or polymeric with tetrahedral al centres these materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen although other methods exist acidification of the oxides or hydroxides affords hydrates in aqueous solution the halides often form mixtures generally containing six coordinate al centers that feature both halide and aquila guns when aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution they readily form complex ions such as alpha h 2o v 2 plus aluminium fluoride H 2 O 3 and aluminium fluoride 3 - in the case of chloride Poli aluminium clusters are formed such as al 13 H 2 O 12 7 + aluminium forms 1 stable oxide with the chemical formula aluminium oxide it can be found in nature in the mineral corundum aluminium oxide is also commonly called alumina sapphire and Ruby are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals the two oxide hydroxides alo o r bay mite and diaspore there are three tri hydroxides baya right gibbsite and moored strand it-- which differ in their crystalline structure polymorphs most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base heating the hydroxides leads to formation of curved these materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful aluminium carbide al 4 c3 is made by heating a mixture of the elements above 1000 degrees Celsius 1832 degrees Fahrenheit the pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centres it reacts with water or dilute acids to give methane the acetylide all to c2 3 is made by passing acetylene over heated aluminium aluminium nitride aln is the only nitride known for aluminium unlike the oxides it features tetrahedral al centres it can be made from the elements at 800 degrees Celsius 1400 72 degrees Fahrenheit it is air stable material with a usefully high thermal conductivity aluminium phosphide ALP is made similarly it hydrolyzes to give phosphine out plus 3 H 2o aluminium hydroxide plus pH 3 Topic rarer oxidation states although the great majority of aluminium compounds feature all three plus centers compounds with lower oxidation states are known and sometime of significance as precursors to the out three plus species topic aluminium I alfe aluminium chloride and aluminium bromide exist in the gaseous phase when the tri halide is heated with aluminium the composition Ally is unstable at room temperature converting to try iodide 3 Ali Ali 3 plus 2 ow display style C III Ali 2 aluminium iodide plus two al a stable derivative of aluminium mono iodide as the cyclic adduct formed with triethylamine aluminium iodide net 3/4 also of theoretical interest but only a fleeting existence our aluminium oxide and aluminium sulfide aluminium oxide has made by heating the normal oxide aluminium oxide with silicon at 1,800 degrees Celsius 3200 72 degrees Fahrenheit in a vacuum such materials quickly disproportionate to the starting materials topic aluminium two very simple out two compounds are invoked or observed in the reactions of al metal with oxidants for example aluminium monoxide aloe has been detected in the gas phase after explosion and in stellar absorption spectra more thoroughly investigated are compounds of the formula R for L 2 which contain an al al bond and where R is a large organic ligand topic organo aluminum compounds and related hydrides a variety of compounds of empirical formula ALR 3 and ALR 1.5 CL 1.5 exist these species usually feature tetrahedral al centers formed by dimerization with some r r CL bridging between both al atoms eg trimethylammonium has the formula al 2 CH 3 6 C figure with large organic groups try organo aluminum compounds exist as 3 coordinate monomers such as try isobutyl aluminum such compounds are widely used in industrial chemistry despite the fact that they are often highly pyrophoric few analogues exist between organo aluminum and organo boron compounds other than large organic groups the industrially important aluminium hydride is lithium aluminium hydride Li al H 4 which is used in as a reducing agent in organic chemistry it can be produced from lithium hydride and aluminium trichloride 4 li h + aluminium chloride li al h 4 + 3 lille several useful derivatives of Li al h 4 are known eg sodium bisque - methoxy ethoxy dihydride to illuminate the simplest hydride aluminium hydride or elaine remains a laboratory curiosity it is a polymer with the formula aluminium hydride and in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride that is a dimer with the formula BH 3 2 topic natural occurrence you topic in space aluminium spur particle abundance in the solar system as 3.15 ppm parts per million it is the twelfth most abundant of all elements and third most abundant among the elements that have odd atomic numbers after hydrogen and nitrogen the only stable isotope of aluminium 27 al is the 18th most abundant nucleus in the universe it is created almost entirely after fusion of carbon in massive stars that will later become type 2 supernova this fusion creates 26 mega grams which upon capturing free protons and neutrons becomes aluminium some smaller quantities of 27 al are created in hydrogen burning shells of evolved stars where 26 mega grams can capture free protons essentially all aluminium now in existence as 27 al 26 always present in the early solar system but is currently extinct however the trace quantities of 26 al that do exist are the most common gamma-ray emitter in the interstellar gas topic on earth overall the earth is about 1.5 9% aluminium by mass seventh in abundance by mass aluminium occurs in greater proportion in the earth than in the universe because aluminium easily forms the oxide and becomes bound into rocks and aluminium stays in the Earth's crust while less reactive metals sink to the core in the Earth's crust aluminium is the most abundant 8.3 percent by mass metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements after oxygen and silicon a large number of silicates in the Earth's crust contain aluminium in contrast the Earth's mantle is only two point three eight percent aluminium by mass because of its strong affinity for oxygen aluminium is almost never found in the elemental state instead it is found in oxides or silicates feldspars the most common group of minerals in the Earth's crust are aluminosilicates aluminium also occurs in the minerals Beryl cryolite garnet spinel and turquoise impurities in aluminium oxide such as chromium and iron yield the gemstones ruby and sapphire respectively native aluminium metal can only be found as a minor phase in low oxygen fugacity environments such as the interiors of certain volcanoes native aluminium has been reported in cold seeps in the northeastern continental slope of the South China Sea it is possible that these deposits resulted from bacterial reduction of tetrahedral aluminate aluminium hydroxide - although aluminium is a common and widespread element not all aluminium minerals are economically viable sources of the metal almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the ore bauxite blocks o3 - 2 X bauxite occurs as a weathering product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions in 2017 most bauxite was mined in Australia China Guinea and India topic history the history of aluminium has been shaped by usage of alum the first written record of alum made by Greek historian Herodotus dates back to the 5th century BCE the ancients are known to have used alum as a dyeing mordant and for City defense after the Crusades alum an indispensable good in the European fabric industry was a subject of international commerce it was imported to Europe from the eastern Mediterranean until the mid 15th century the nature of alum remained unknown around 1530 Swiss physician Paracelsus suggested alum was a salt of an earth of alum in 1595 German doctor and chemist andreas lie baby experimental ii confirmed this in 1722 german chemist friedrich hoffman announced his belief that the base of alum was a distinct earth in 1754 German chemist andreas Sigismund Margraff synthesized alumina by boiling clay in sulfuric acid and subsequently adding potash attempts to produce aluminium metal date back to 1760 the first successful attempt however was completed in 1824 by Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian ørsted he reacted anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium amalgam yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin he presented his results and demonstrated a sample of the new metal in 1825 in 1827 german chemist friedrich wöhler repeated or Stan's experiments but did not identify any aluminium the reason for this inconsistency was only discovered in 1921 he conducted a similar experiment in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and produced a powder of aluminium in 1845 he was able to produce small pieces of the metal and described some physical properties of this metal for many years thereafter Waller was credited as the discoverer of aluminium as woola's method could not yield great quantities of aluminium the metal remained rare its cost exceeded that of gold French chemist on Arrietty n st. Clair de Ville announced an industrial method of aluminium production in 1854 at the Paris Academy of Sciences aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium which was more convenient and less expensive than potassium which Wooler had used in 1856 Deville along with companions established the world's first industrial production of aluminium from 1855 to 1859 the price of aluminium dropped by an order of magnitude from $500 to $40 per pound even then aluminium was still not of great purity and produced aluminium differed in properties by sample the first industrial large-scale production method was independently developed in 1886 by French engineer Paul Aero and American engineer Charles Martin Hall it is now known as the Hall aero process the hall aero process converts alumina into the metal austrian chemist carl joseph Bayer discovered a way of purifying bauxite to yield alumina now known as the Bayer process in 1889 modern production of the aluminium metal is based on the Bayer and Hall Aero processes prices of aluminium dropped an aluminium became widely used in jewellery everyday items eyeglass frames optical instruments tableware and foil in the 1890s and early 20th century aluminium --za bility to form hard yet light alloys with other metals provided the metal many uses at the time during World War one major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes by the mid 20th century aluminium had become a part of everyday life and an essential component of housewares during the mid 20th century aluminium emerged as a civil engineering material with building applications in both basic construction and interior finish work and increasingly being used in military engineering for both airplanes and land armored vehicle engines Earth's first artificial satellite launched in 1957 consisted of two separate aluminium semi spheres joined together and all subsequent space vehicles have been made of aluminium the aluminium can was invented in 1956 and employed as a storage for drinks in 1958 throughout the 20th century the production of aluminium rose rapidly while the world production of aluminium in 1900 was 6,800 metric tons the annual production first exceeded 100,000 metric tonnes in 1916 1 million tonnes in 1941 10 million tons in 1971 in the 1970s the increased demand for aluminium made it an exchange commodity it entered the London Metal Exchange the oldest industrial metal exchange in the world in 1978 the output continued to grow the annual production of aluminium exceeded 50 million metric tonnes in 2013 the real price for aluminium declined from $14,000 per metric ton in 1900 to 2000 $340 in 1948 in 1998 United States Dollars extraction and processing costs were lowered over technological progress in the scale of the economies however the need to exploit lower grade poorer quality deposits and the use of fast increasing input costs above all energy increased the net cost of aluminium the real price began to grow in the 1970s with the rise of energy cost production moved from the industrialized countries to countries where production was cheaper production costs in the late 20th century changed because of advances in technology lower energy prices exchange rates of the United States dollar an alumina prices the BRIC countries combined share grew in the first decade of the 21st century from 32.6% to 56.5% in primary production and 21.4% to 47.8% in primary consumption China is accumulating an especially large share of world's production thanks to abundance of resources cheap energy and governmental stimuli it also increased its consumption share from 2% in 1972 to 40% in 2010 in the United States Western Europe and Japan most aluminium was consumed in transportation engineering construction and packaging topic etymology aluminium is named after alumina or aluminium oxide in modern nomenclature the word alumina comes from alum the mineral from which it was collected the word alum comes from alamin a Latin word meaning bitter salt the word element stems from the proto-indo-european root asterisk Allu meaning bitter or beer British chemist Humphry Davy who performed a number of experiments aimed to synthesize the metal is credited as the person who named the element in 1808 he suggested the metal be named aluminum this suggestion was criticized by contemporary chemists from France Germany and Sweden who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide alumina from which it would be isolated in 1812 Davy chose aluminium thus producing the modern name however it is spelled and pronounced differently outside of North America aluminium as in use in the US and Canada while aluminium is in use elsewhere topic spelling the I um suffix followed the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time potassium sodium magnesium calcium and strontium all of which Devi isolated himself nevertheless element names ending in um were known at the time for example platinum known to Europeans since the sixteenth century molybdenum discovered in 1778 and tantalum discovered in 1802 the unsub expelling alumina for the oxide as opposed to alumina compared to Lantana the oxide of lanthanum and magnesia serie and thoria the oxides of magnesium cerium and thorium respectively in 1812 British scientist Thomas Young wrote an anonymous review of Davies book in which he objected to aluminium and proposed the name aluminium for so we shall take the liberty of writing the word in preference to aluminium which has a less classical sound this name did catch on while the UM spelling was occasionally used in Britain the American scientific language used I um from the start most scientists used I um throughout the world in the nineteenth century it still remains the standard in most other languages in 1828 American lexicographer Noah Webster used exclusively the aluminum spelling in his American Dictionary of the English language in the 1830s the unspell angst arted to gain usage in the United States by the 1860s it had become the more common spelling there outside science in 1892 Hall used the um spelling in his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal despite his constant use of the I um spelling in all the patents he filed between 1886 and 1903 it was subsequently suggested this was a typo rather than intended by 1890 both Spelling's had been common in the u.s. overall the I um spelling being slightly more common by 1895 the situation had reversed by 1900 aluminum had been twice as common as aluminium during the following decade the um spelling dominated American usage in 1925 the American Chemical Society adopted this spelling the International Union of pure and applied chemistry IUPAC adopted aluminium as the standard inter national name for the element in 1990 in 1993 they recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant the same is true for the most recent 2005 edition of the IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry IUPAC official publications use the I um spelling as primary but lists both where appropriate topic production and refinement aluminium production is highly energy consuming and so the producers tend to locate smelters in places where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive as of 2012 the world's largest smelters of aluminium are located in China Russia Bahrain United Arab Emirates and South Africa in 2016 China was the top producer of aluminium with a world share of 55% the next largest producing countries were Russia Canada India and the United Arab Emirates according to the International resource panels metal stocks in society report the global per capita stock of aluminium in use in society ie in cars buildings electronics etc is 80 kilograms 180 pounds much of this is in more developed countries 350 to 500 kilograms 770 to 1100 pounds per capita rather than less developed countries 35 kilograms 77 pounds per capita topic Bayer process bauxite is converted to aluminium oxide by the Bayer process bauxite is blended for uniform composition and then is ground the resulting slurry is mixed with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide the mixture is then treated in a digester vessel at a pressure well above atmospheric dissolving the aluminium hydroxide in bauxite while converting impurities into a relatively insoluble compounds after this reaction the slurry is at a temperature above its atmospheric boiling point it is cooled by removing steam as pressure is reduced the bauxite residue is separated from the solution and discarded the solution free of solids is seeded with small crystals of aluminium hydroxide this causes decomposition of the aluminium hydroxide minus ions to aluminium hydroxide after about half of aluminium has precipitated the mixture is sent to classifiers small crystals of aluminium hydroxide are collected to service seeding agents coarse particles are reduced to aluminium oxide excess solution is removed by evaporation if needed purified and recycled topic halt arrow process the conversion of alumina to aluminium metal is achieved by the halt arrow process in this energy intensive process a solution of alumina in a molten 950 and 907 hundred 40 and 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit mixture of cryolite ma3 aluminium fluoride with calcium fluoride as electrolyzed to produce metallic aluminium the liquid aluminium metal sinks to the bottom of the solution and is tapped off and usually cast into large blocks called aluminium billets for further processing anodes of the electrolysis cell are made of carbon the most resistant material against fluoride corrosion and either bake at the processor or pre-baked the former also called Soderberg anodes are less power efficient and fumes released during baking are costly to collect which is why they are being replaced by pre-baked anode even though they save the power energy and labour to pre-bake the cathodes carbon for anodes should be preferably pure so that neither aluminium nor the electrolyte is contaminated with ash despite carbons resistivity against corrosion it is still consumed at a rate of 0.4 to 0.5 kilograms per each kilogram of produced aluminium cathodes are made of anthracite high purity for them is not required because impurities leach only very slowly cathode is consumed at a rate of 0.02 to 0.04 kilograms per each kilogram of produced aluminium a cell is usually a terminated after 2 to 6 years following a failure of the cathode the hall hero process produces aluminium with a purity of above 99% further purification can be done by the hoops process this process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte the resulting aluminium has a purity of 99.99% electric power represents about 20 to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium depending on the location of the smelter aluminium production consumes roughly 5% of electricity generated in the United States because of this alternatives to the Hall aero process have been researched but none has turned out to be economically feasible topic recycling you recovery of the metal through recycling has become an important task of the aluminium industry recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s when the growing use of aluminium beverage cans brought it to public awareness recycling involves melting the scrap a process that requires only 5% of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore though a significant part up to 15% of the input material has lost his dross ash like oxide an aluminium stack melter produces significantly less dross with values reported below one percent white dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially the process produces aluminium billets together with a highly complex waste material this waste is difficult to manage it reacts with water releasing a mixture of gases including among others hydrogen acetylene and ammonia which spontaneously ignites on contact with air contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas despite these difficulties the waste is used as a filler and asphalt in concrete topic applications you topic metal aluminium is the most widely used non-ferrous metal the global production of aluminium in 2016 was fifty eight point eight million metric tons it exceeded that of any other metal except iron 1231 million metric tons aluminium is almost always alloyed which markedly improves its mechanical properties especially when tempered for example the common aluminium foils and beverage cans are alloys of 92% to 99% aluminium the main alloying agents are copper zinc magnesium manganese and silicon eg duralumin with the levels of other metals in a few percent by weight the major uses for aluminium metal are in transportation automobiles aircraft trucks railway cars marine vessels bicycles spacecraft etc aluminium is used because of its low density Packaging cans foil frame etc aluminium is used because it is non toxic non adsorptive and splinter proof building and construction windows doors siding building wire sheathing roofing etc since steel is cheaper aluminium is used when lightness corrosion resistance or engineering features are important electricity related uses conductor alloys motors and generators transformers capacitors etc aluminium is used because it is relatively cheap highly conductive has adequate mechanical strength and low density and resists corrosion a wide range of household items from cooking utensils to furniture low density good appearance ease of fabrication and durability are the key factors of aluminium usage machinery and equipment processing equipment pipes tools aluminium is used because of its corrosion resistance none pyro for city and mechanical strength topic compounds the great majority about 90% of aluminium oxide has converted to metallic aluminium being a very hard material Moss hardness 9 alumina is widely used as an abrasive being extraordinarily chemically inert it is useful in highly reactive environments such as high pressure sodium lamps aluminium oxide is commonly used as a catalyst for industrial processes eg the Claus process to convert hydrogen sulfide to sulfur in refineries into alkylate amines many industrial catalysts are supported by alumina meaning that the expensive catalyst material is dispersed over a surface of the inert alumina another principle uses as a drying agent or absorbent several sulfates of aluminium have industrial and commercial application aluminium sulfate in its hydrate form is produced on the annual scale of several millions of metric tons about two-thirds is consumed in water treatment the next major application is in the manufacture of paper it is also used as a mordant in dying in pickling seeds deodorizing of mineral oils in leather tanning and in production of other aluminium compounds two kinds of alum ammonium alum and potassium alum were formerly used as Mortenson in leather tanning but their use has significantly declined following availability of high purity aluminium sulfate and hydras aluminium chloride is used as a catalyst in chemical and petrochemical industries the dyeing industry and in synthesis of various inorganic and organic compounds aluminium hydroxy chlorides are used in purifying water in the paper industry and is antiperspirants sodium aluminate is used in treating water and as an accelerator of solidification of cement many aluminium compounds have niche applications for example aluminium acetate in solution is used as an astringent aluminium phosphate is used in the manufacture of glass ceramic pulp and paper products cosmetics paints varnishes and in dental cement aluminium hydroxide is used as an antacid and mordant it is used also in water purification the manufacture of glass and ceramics and in the waterproofing fabrics lithium aluminium hydride as a powerful using agent used in organic chemistry org and aluminum czar used as Lewis acids and Co catalysts methyl aluminum Shan is a co catalyst for ziegler-natta olefin polymerization to produce vinyl polymers such as polyethylene aqueous aluminium ions such as aqueous aluminium sulfate are used to treat against fish parasites such as gyro dactyl ocellaris in many vaccines certain aluminium salts serve as an immune adjuvant immune response booster to allow the protein in the vaccine to achieve sufficient potency as an immune stimulant topic biology despite its widespread occurrence in the earth crust aluminium has no known function in biology aluminium salts are remarkably non-toxic aluminium sulfate having an ld50 of six thousand two hundred seven milligrams per kilogram oral mouse which corresponds to 500 grams for an 80 kilograms 180 pounds person topic toxicity in most people aluminium is not as toxic as heavy metals aluminium is classified as a non carcinogen by the United States Department of Health and Human Services there is little evidence that normal exposure to aluminium presents a risk to healthy adult and there is evidence of no toxicity if it is consumed in amounts not greater than 40 milligrams per day per kilogram of body mass most aluminium consumed will leave the body in feces the small part of it that enters the body will be excreted via urine aluminium that does stay in the body is accumulated in above all bone and apart from that in brain liver and kidney aluminium metal cannot pass the blood-brain barrier in natural filters before the brain but some compounds such as the fluoride can topic effects aluminium although rarely can cause vitamin D resistant osteomalacia erythropoietin resistant microcytic anemia and central nervous system alterations people with kidney insufficiency are especially at a risk chronic ingestion of hydrated aluminium silicates for excess gastric acidity control may result in aluminium binding to intestinal contents and increased elimination of other metals such as iron or zinc sufficiently high doses greater than 50 grams per day can cause anemia since aluminium is excreted by kidneys their function may be impaired by toxic amounts of aluminium an accident in England revealed that millimolar quantities of aluminium in drinking water caused significant cognitive deficits orally ingested aluminium salts can deposit in the brain there is research on correlation between neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease and aluminium levels but it has been inconclusive so far aluminium increases estrogen related gene expression in human breast cancer cells cultured in the laboratory in very high doses aluminium is associated with altered function of the blood-brain barrier a small percentage of people have contact allergies to aluminium and experienced itchy red rashes headache muscle pain joint pain poor memory insomnia depression asthma irritable bowel syndrome or other symptoms upon contact with products containing aluminium exposure to powdered aluminium or aluminium welding fumes can cause pulmonary fibrosis fine aluminium powder can ignite or explode posing another workplace hazard topic exposure routes you food is the main source of aluminium drinking water contains more aluminium than solid food however aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water major sources of human oral exposure to aluminium include food due to its use in food additives food and beverage packaging and cooking utensils drinking water due to its use in municipal water treatment and aluminium containing medications particularly antacid anti-ulcer and buffered aspirin formulations dietary exposure in europeans averages to 0.2 to 1 point 5 milligrams per kilogram per week but can be as high as 2.3 milligrams per kilogram per week higher exposure levels of aluminium are mostly limited to minors aluminium production workers and dialysis patients excessive consumption of antacids antiperspirants vaccines and cosmetics provide significant exposure levels consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium enhances aluminium absorption and maltol has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nerve and bone tissues topic treatment in case of suspected sudden intake of a large amount of aluminium the only treatment is de fer ox amine mesylate which may be given to help you eliminate aluminium from the body by chelation however this should be applied with caution as this reduces not only aluminium body levels but also those of other metals such as copper or iron nutritionally treatment of similar to those of other toxic metals and includes removal of sources of aluminium from environment enhancing cellular energy production enhancing activity of the eliminative organs and chelating aluminium with nutrients topic environmental effects high levels of aluminium occur near mining sites small amounts of aluminium are released to the environment at the coal-fired power plants or incinerators aluminium in the air is washed out by the rain or normally settles down but small particles of aluminium remain in the air for a long time acidic precipitation as the main natural factor to mobilize aluminium from natural sources and the main reason for the environmental effects of aluminium however the main factor of presence of aluminium in salt and fresh water are the industrial processes that also release aluminium into air in water aluminium acts as a toxeus agent on gill breathing animals such as fish by causing loss of plasma and hemolymph ions leading to ozma regulatory failure organic complexes of aluminium may be easily absorbed and interfere with metabolism in mammals and birds even though this rarely happens in practice aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acidic soils although it is generally harmless to plant growth in pH neutral soils in acid soils the concentration of toxic al 3 plus cations increases and disturbs root growth and function wheat has developed a tolerance to aluminium releasing organic compounds that bind to harmful aluminium cations sorghum is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism aluminium production possesses its own challenges to the environment on each step of the production process the major challenge is the greenhouse gas emissions these gases result from electrical consumption of the smelters and the byproducts of processing the most potent of these gases are perfluorocarbons from the smelting process released sulfur dioxide is one of the primary precursors of acid rain a spanish scientific report from 2001 claimed that the fungus geo tritium candidum consumes the aluminium in compact discs other reports all refer back to that report and there is no supporting original research better documented the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungus cladosporium resume are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene based fuels not avgas and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium however these life-forms do not directly attack or consume the aluminium rather the metal as corroded by microbe waste products topic see also
