 bioglass four 5s five commonly referred to by its commercial name bio glass is a glass specifically composed of 45 WT percent silicon oxide 24.5 WT % cao 24.5 WT % sodium oxide and 6.0 WT % p2o5 glasses are non crystalline amorphous solids that are commonly composed of silica based materials with other minor additives compared to soda lime glass commonly used as in windows or bottles bio glass 4 5 s 5 contains less silica and higher amounts of calcium and phosphorus the 4 5 s 5 name signifies glass with 45 weight percent of silicon oxide and 5 to 1 molar ratio of calcium to phosphorus this high ratio of calcium to phosphorus promotes formation of apatite crystals calcium and silica ions can act as crystallization nuclei Louis see a cheeky smiley face ratios do not bond to bone bio glass 45s 5 specific composition is optimal in biomedical applications because of its similar composition to that of hydroxyapatite the mineral component of bone this similarity provides bio glass ability to be integrated with living bone this composition of bioactive glass is comparatively soft in comparison to other glasses it can be machined preferably with diamond tools or ground to powder bio glass has to be stored in a dry environment as it readily absorbs moisture and reacts with it bio Glass 4 5 S 5 is the first formulation of an artificial material that was found to chemically bond with bone one of its main medical advantages is its biocompatibility seen in its ability to avoid an immune reaction and fibrous encapsulation its primary applicant nation is the repair of bone injuries or defects too large to be regenerated by the natural process the first successful surgical use of bioglass 45s v was in replacement of ossicles in the middle ear as a treatment of conductive hearing loss other uses include cones for implantation into the jaw following a tooth extraction composite materials made of bio glass for 5s 5 and patient's own bone can be used for bone reconstruction further research is being conducted for the development of new processing techniques to allow for more applications of bio glass topic history bioglass is important to the field of biomaterials as one of the first completely synthetic materials that seamlessly bonds to bone it was developed by Larry L hench in the late 1960s the idea for the material came to him during a bus ride in 1967 while working as an assistant professor at the University of Florida dr. hench decided to attend the u.s. army materials research conference held in Sagamore New York where he planned to talk about radiation resistant electronic materials he began discussing his research with a fellow traveler on the bus Colonel clinker who had recently returned to the United States after serving as an army medical supply officer in Vietnam after listening to dr. hench's description of his research the colonel asked if you can make a material that will survive exposure to high-energy radiation can you make a material that will survive exposure to the human body clinker then went on to describe the amputations that he had witnessed in Vietnam which resulted from the body's rejection of metal and plastic implants hench realized that there was a need for a novel material that could form a living bond with tissues in the body when hench returned to Florida after the conference he submitted a proposal to the US Army Medical Research & Design Command he received funding in 1968 and in November 1969 hench began to synthesize small rectangles of what he called four 5s five glass Ted Greenlee assistant professor of Orthopedic Surgery at the University of Florida implanted them in rat femurs at the VA hospital in Gainesville six weeks later Greenlee called hench asking Larry what are those samples you gave me they will not come out of the bone I have pulled on them pushed on them I have cracked the bone and they are still bonded in place with this first successful experiment bioglass was born and the first composition studied hench published his first paper on the subject in 1971 in the Journal of biomedical materials research and his lab continued to work on the project for the next 10 years with continued funding from the US Army by 2006 there were over 500 papers published on the topic of bioactive glasses from different laboratories and institutions around the world the first successful surgical use of bio glass 45s v was in replacement of ossicles in middle ear as a treatment of conductive hearing loss and the material continues to be used in bone reconstruction applications today topic applications bioactive glass offers good osteo conductivity and bio activity it can deliver cells and is biodegradable this makes it an excellent candidate to be used in tissue engineering applications although this material is known to be brittle it is still used extensively to enhance the growth of bone since new forms of bioactive glasses are based on borate and burrow silicate compositions bio glass can also be doped with varying quantities of elements like copper zinc or strontium which can allow the growth and formation of healthy bone the formation of neo cartilage can also be induced with bioactive glass by using an in vitro culture of chondrocyte seeded hydrogels and can serve as a subchondral substrate for tissue engineered osteochondral constructs the borate based bioactive glass has controllable degradation rates in order to match the rate at which actual bone is formed bone formation has been shown to enhance when using this type of material when implanted into rabbit femurs the 4 5 s5 bioactive glass showed that it could induce bone proliferation at a much quicker rate than synthetic hydroxyapatite ha 4 5 s5 glass can also be osteoconductive and osteo inductive because it allows for new bone growth along the bone implant interface as well as within the bone implant interface studies have been conducted to determine the process by which it can induce bone formation it was shown that 4 5 s5 glass degrades and releases sodium ions as well as soluble silica the combination of all these ions is said to produce new bone borate bio glass has proven that it can support cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro and in vivo it also has shown that it is suitable to be used as a substrate drug release when treating bone infection however there has been a concern as to whether or not the release of boron into a solution as borate ions will be toxic to the body it has been shown that in static cell culture conditions borate glasses were toxic to cells but not in dynamic culture conditions another area in which bioactive glass has been investigated to use is enamel reconstruction which has proven to be a difficult task in the field of Dentistry enamel is made up of a very organized hierarchical microstructure of carbonated hydroxyapatite nano crystals it has been reported that bioglass 45s v phosphoric acid paste can be used to form an interaction layer that can obstruct dentinal tubules orifices and can therefore be useful in the treatment of dentin hypersensitivity lesions this material in an aqueous environment could have an antibacterial property that is advantageous in periodontal surgical procedures in a study done with 4 5s v bio glass control biofilms of s sanga's where grown on inactive glass particulates and the biofilm grown on the bio glass was significantly lower than those that were on the inactive glass it was concluded that bio glass can reduce surface bacterial formation which could benefit post-surgical periodontal wound-healing the most effective antibacterial bioactive glass is s v 3 P 4 which has exhibited a growth inhibitory effect on the pathogens that was tested on it bioactive glasses that are sol-gel derived such as cap co and cap co 2 have also exhibited antibacterial property studies done with s epidermidis and e-coli cultured with bioactive glass have shown that the four 5s v bioactive glass have a very high antibacterial resistance it was also observed in the experiment that there were needle-like bio glass debris which could have ruptured the cell walls of the bacteria and rendered them inactive bioactive glass has even been applied to medical devices to help restore the hearing to a deaf patient using bio glass 45s 5 in 1984 the patient went deaf due to it ear infection that degraded two of the three bones in her middle ear an implant was designed to replace the damaged bone and carry sound from the eardrum to the cochlea restoring the patient's hearing before this material was available plastics and metals would be used because they did not produce a reaction in the body however they eventually failed because tissue would grow around them after implantation a prosthesis made up of bioglass 45s v was made to fit the patient and most of the prosthesis that were made were able to maintain functionality after 10 years the end osseous Ridge maintenance implant made of bio glass 4 5 s 5 was another device that could be inserted into tooth extraction sites that would repair tooth roots and allow for a stable Ridge for dentures this material has also been used in jaw and orthopedics applications in this way it dissolves and can stimulate the natural bone to repair itself GlaxoSmithKline is using this material as an active ingredient in toothpaste under the commercial name no vermin which can help repair tiny holes and decrease tooth sensitivity currently bioactive glass is still be researched and has yet to reach its full capacity of use topic mechanism of action when implanted bioglass 4 5 s 5 reacts with the surrounding physiological fluid causing the formation of a hydroxyl carbonated apatite HCA layer at the material surface the HCA layer has a similar composition to hydroxyapatite the mineral phase of bone equality which allows for strong interaction and integration with bone the process by which this reaction occurs can be separated into 12 steps the first 5 steps are related to the bio glass response to the environment within the body and occur rapidly at the material surface over several hours reaction steps 6 to 10 detailed the reaction of the body to the integration of the biomaterial and the process of integration with bone these stages occur over the scale of several weeks or months the steps are separated as follows one alkali ions X na plus and C a2 plus on the glass surface rapidly exchange with hydrogen ions or hydronium from surrounding bodily fluids the reaction below shows this process which causes hydrolysis of silica groups as this occurs the pH of the solution increases Co na + + h+ + o - co + + na + AQ + o - 2 due to an increase in the hydroxyl Oh minus concentration at the surface a result of step 1 a dissolution of the silica glass Network occurs seen by the breaking of COC bonds soluble silica is transformed to the form of silicon hydroxide and seal anoles co-creation occurs at the material surface the reaction occurring in this stage is shown below COC + h2o co + OC three the silanol groups at the material surface condense and re polymerized to form a silica gel layer at the surface of bio glass as a result of the first steps the surface contains very little alkali content the condensation reaction is shown below co + Co Co C for amorphous CA 2 + + P O 43 - gather at the silica rich layer created in step 3 from both the surrounding bodily fluid and the bulk of the bio glass this creates a layer composed primarily of Cao p2o5 on top of the silica layer 5 the cow p2o5 film created in step 4 incorporates o - & Co 32 - from the bodily solution causing it to crystallize this layer is called a mixed carbonated hydroxyl apatite HCA 6 growth factors adsorbed to the surface of bio glass due to its structural and chemical similarities to hydroxyapatite 7 adsorbed growth factors caused the activation of m 2 macrophages M 2 macrophages tend to promote wound healing and the initiate the migration of progenitor cells to an injury site in contrast M 1 macrophages become activated when a non biocompatible material is implanted triggering an inflammatory response point 8 triggered by M 2 macrophage activation mesenchymal stem cells and osteoprogenitor cells migrate to the bioglass surface and attach to the HCA layer 9 stem cells and osteoprogenitor cells at the HCA surface differentiate to become osteogenic cells typically present in bone tissue particularly osteoblasts 10 the attached and differentiated osteoblasts generate and deposit at try cellular matrix ECM components primarily type one collagen the main protein component of bone 11 the collagen ECM becomes mineralized as normally occurs in native bone nanoscale hydroxyapatite crystals form a layered structure with the deposited collagen at the surface of the implant 12 following these reactions bone growth continues as the newly recruited cells continue to function and facilitate tissue growth and repair the bio glass implant continues to degrade and be converted to new ECM material topic manufacturing there are three main manufacturing techniques that are used for the synthesis of bio glass the first is melt quench synthesis which is the conventional glass making technology used by Larry hench when he first manufactured the material in 1969 this method includes melting a mixture of oxides such as silicon oxide sodium oxide cow and p2o5 at high temperatures generally above 1100 to 1300 degrees Celsius platinum or platinum alloy crucibles to a used avoid contamination which would interfere with the products chemical reactivity in organism annealing is a crucial step in forming bulk parts due to high thermal expansion of the material heat treatment of bio glass reduces the volatile alkali metal oxide content and precipitates apatite crystals in the glass matrix however the scaffolds that result from melt quench techniques are much less porous compared to other manufacturing methods which may lead to defects in tissue integration when implanted in vivo the second method is Sol gel synthesis of bio glass this process is carried out at much lower temperatures than the traditional melting methods it involves the creation of a solution Sol which is composed of metal organic and metal salt precursors a gel is then formed through hydrolysis and condensation reactions and it undergoes thermal treatment for drying oxide formation and organic removal because of the lower fabrication temperatures used in this method there is a greater level of control on the composition and homogeneity of the product in addition Sol gel bio glasses have much higher porosity which leads to a greater surface area and degree of integration in the body the third method microwave synthesis of bioglass which has been gaining attention in recent years microwave synthesis is a rapid and low-cost powder synthesis method in which precursors are dissolved in water transferred to an ultrasonic bath and irradiated the resulting amorphous powder is then filtered dried at 80 degrees Celsius and calcined at 700 degrees Celsius topic shortcomings a setback to using bio glass for 5s 5 is that it is difficult to process into porous 3d scaffolds these porous scaffolds are usually prepared by sintering glass particles that are already formed into the 3d geometry and allowing them to bond to the particles into a strong glass phase made up of a network of pores since this particular type of bio glass cannot fully Center by viscous flow above its TG and its TG is close to the onset of crystallization it is hard to Center this material into a dense Network point 4 5 s 5 glass also has a slow degradation and rate of conversion to an holic material this setback makes it more difficult for the degradation rate of the scaffold to coincide with the rate of tissue formation another limitation is that the biological environment can be easily influenced by its degradation increases in the sodium and calcium ions and changing pH is due to its degradation however the roles of these ions and their toxicity to the body have not been fully researched topic methods of improvement several studies have investigated methods to improve the mechanical strength and toughness of bio glass for 5s five these include creating polymer glass composites which combine the bio activity of bio glass with the relative flexibility and wear resistance of different polymers another solution is coating a metallic implant with bio glass which takes advantage of the mechanical strength of the implants bulk material while retaining bioactive effects at the surface some of the most notable modifications have used various forms of carbon to improve the properties of four 5s 5 glass for example Torrey a towel developed a method to incorporate carbon nanotubes CNTs into the structure without interfering with the materials bioactive properties CNTs were chosen because of their large aspect ratio and high strength by synthesizing bio glass for 5s 5 on a CNT scaffold the researchers were able to create a composite that more than doubled the compressive strength and the elastic modulus when compared to the pure glass another study carried out by Lee at L looked into different properties such as the fracture toughness and wear resistance of bio glass for 5s 5 the authors loaded graphene nano platelets GNP into the glass structure through a spark plasma sintering method graphene was chosen because of its high specific surface area and strength as well as its cytocompatibility and lack of interference with bio glass 45s 5s bioactivity the composites that were created in this experiment achieved a fracture toughness of more than double the control in addition the tribological properties of the material were greatly improved topic see also bioactive glass mechanical
