 [Music] looks like meat smells like meat feels like meat sounds like meat and tastes [Music] but believe it or not there's no meat in this burger truthful move there's no doubt that most fuzzies love their meat in fact we ranked in the top 10 countries in the world for the amount of meat we'd chomp our way through but in recent years there have been more products appearing on our shelves like my burger that are made with plant-based ingredients all things like gluten soy and wheat that's because a lot of people like the taste of meat but don't like the idea of killing animals all the impact that farming animals can have on the environment raising animals for meat takes up a lot of land and uses a lot of water in fact it takes more than 15,000 liters to get a single kilogram of beef plus these guys can get pretty gassy and their burps and farts pump a lot of greenhouse gasses into our atmosphere but people do like their burgers and that's why scientists are taking fake meat to a whole new level and growing it in a lab lab-grown meat is made from animal cells scientists take stem cells from a living cow and put them in a petri dish with a serum high in nutrients under just the right conditions those cells can grow and divide just like they do inside our bodies eventually they develop into muscle tissue the scientists say the result is meat the first lab-grown meat patty to be publicly taste-tested cost a whopping of four hundred thousand dollars to produce and the flavor it's close to meat it's not that juicy since then more companies have started investing and the prices come down a lot some reckon it won't be long before lab-grown meat makes its way into our shops and onto our burgers but the questions some are asking is should it be called meat some of the farmers say no they say when people buy Meech they expect it to come from a farm raised animal and not a petri dish they're both fairly mare chicken they're poor and all the other make products they should be called plate and anything else I can come up with another name for a rare for their product some would like to see laws that stop companies calling products meat if they're made of veggies or grown in a lab and this debate is not just happening in Australia earlier this year of France decided to ban the words meat and milk for any products that don't come from animals so what do you guys think should lad meat be called meat or something else and would you try it I think I would be good to see how it tastes comparing it to normal meat I think I'd try it but if I didn't like it I don't eat them again I don't think lab-grown meat should be called meat I think it should be called something else like steak in like stem-cell bacon
