 I would like to start off our first session of the morning and introduce our first spotlight speaker dr. John glass dr. glass is a professor and leader of the J craig Venter Institute synthetic biology and bioenergy group he has been at the forefront of microbial genomics for many years and leads a team which created the minimal cell a bacterial gene which with only the essential gene set needed for life an organism that I've heard him referred to as the hydrogen atom of biology so truly a thought leader in the field of synthetic biology please join me in welcoming John glass okay let's get going so I'm a practicing biologist and it is an extraordinary time to be a biologist and when I talked to Ali about what we were going to do here and so there was first the idea that we're going to go over all of biotechnology in about 22 minutes so that you guys get all of this but but rather I want to offer a few vignettes to show ideas about what the what the edges of what is possible now and as I said it's an extraordinary time to be a biologist so let me move past those this week so among this I had I had the rare pleasure where it's not a rare pleasure it was sort of a medium well pleasure of having an impossible burger now this is a meat substitute that really tastes I think like beef because it has a biotechnology created heme protein a heme protein where they took the gene for heme installed it in a yeast in a yeast genome so that yeast produces this heme which is part of the burger really super it's also a time where the fact that I'm alive because I can have recombinant insulin that has kept me alive for the last you know 50 years made from biotechnology a one of the early products of synthetic biology if you will and as another example of remarkable world that we live in now if I wanted to I could go into my house and for not much money I could produce I have the skills and and many people in the US and around the world today have the skills to easily make enough polio virus to cause real mayhem so these are examples of what the world can see today what we can do today but as I said rather than do a whole view of synthetic biology I'm part of the J craig Venter Institute we have labs in Rockville Maryland and San Diego in in San Diego and we've been around for about 25 years now we have our building in San Diego it overlooks the ocean and it's the world's first fully sustainable lab and JCV i our synthetic biology group is sort of the brainchild of two of my scientific heroes craig Venter and ham Smith and so what I'm going to do is talk about from a personal perspective some of the things that our group at the JC VI has been able to do over the last 15 years that I think has really given an examples of the edges of what can be done using the new technologies made from synthesizing DNA the idea that instead of having DNA sequencers now we're going to write DNA and so I'm going to offer one vignette about viral systems because we sometimes refer to what we do is Synthetic Genomics rather than synthetic biology the idea that we're building genomes in order to make new viruses and cells with extraordinary properties so one vignette will be about viruses another about bacteria and the third about higher eukaryotic systems so first I want to talk about influenza vaccine improvement so for the last 60 years the way influenza virus vaccine has been made is fundamentally the same so there's worldwide surveillance to find strains of influenza that epidemiologist think will be important twice a year the w-h-o makes a recommendation so at the cusp of February and March they make a recommendation for the three or four strains of influenza they think will be circulating and important in the Northern Hemisphere later that year and that gives the vaccine makers six months to propel the hundreds of millions built to the to create and prepare hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine which will be available to the public starting at the beginning of the flu season in September they do the same thing again at this at the August September cusp for the southern hemisphere now the way this is done is they say okay this virus that came from some guy and into Indonesia so they say okay this is the virus that we want to get the hemagglutinin which is a surface protein and the neuraminidase genes from and we want to put that in a new strain that is designed to grow in chicken eggs and so that strain from Indonesia is shipped to vaccine makers who then take that strain of influenza and they inject it into fertile chicken eggs along with another strain of influenza called Puerto Rico 8 which is designed which has been adapted for growth in chicken eggs and Puerto Rico 8 so what they want is to produce a chimeric virus that has two chromosomes if you will from the snot sample that came from Indonesia and six chromosomes from the Puerto Rico eight so it'll grow well in chicken eggs and that process now takes about 35 days 35 to maybe a few more days because you have to purify the virus and make sure you've got exactly what you want and Barda came to the JCB eye and then Novartis the vaccine maker Novartis in 2012 and 11 and 12 and said can we speed this up because as they point out here when we had the 2009 influenza virus epidemic for the strain the the pandemic for the the porcine derive strain that came from Mexico when they declared the epidemic by the time we had sufficient doses of vaccine to be used for the population you can see so that's the red line the increasing amount of vaccine the epidemic had actually begun to wane so if this had been a really dangerous pathogen the vaccine would not have been ready quickly enough and so if we could cut a month or more off of the time it took to go from discovering a new virus a new potential pandemic threat to actually having the vaccine that would be super and so using a process called reverse genetics we take the DNA sequence or the sequence digital information from a virus strain and what we want is to synthesize DNA for each of these eight chromosomes and so we go from the RNA we can take that digital information from a sequencer and synthesize the DNA put them in appropriate plasmid vectors and you see the two yellow chromosomes are from the neuraminidase and hemagglutinin gene and the other six chromosomes are from the puerto rico ate the chicken adapted strain those can be transfected into mammalian cells basically just install them in the cells and three days later you produce virus this is the first the first dose of the vaccine and so using this we develop methods that from being given the the sequence of the virus genes we needed to make in ten hours where we were able to produce the proteins that we wanted I mean sorry not the proteins that the synthetic DNA that we needed and we were able to cut the time down in theory from 35 days to maybe just five to seven days to produce the first dose of vaccine as an example of the power of this in 2013 on Easter Sunday the Chinese announced the sequence of this h7n9 influenza strain and we heard about this Monday morning Easter Monday morning and by the with with no advance notice by the end of the day we had the genome synthesized and it was on a plane to our collaborators in Boston who had the first dose of the vaccine in essence by Friday mornings so this is the way that these sorts of things can be sped up now by the same notion with my skills and the skills of lots of people many people in fact in this room they could probably without anyone noticing that we had ordered the DNA to do this from synthetic DNA makers we could by 270 360 base oligonucleotides assemble them using a process called Gibson assembly and then transect them into HeLa cells and produce a lot of poliovirus really easily in a basement lab and cause all kinds of mayhem if you were so inclined but that's sort of the flipside of this ability to make a vaccine quickly we imagine s GI DNA as part of the offshoot of the vaccine project I just told you about in just a couple of years ago built this device called AB digital to biological converter the idea is that you can go from digital information on this platform to producing whole synthetic chromosomes by the end of the day on this one one machine with robotic capabilities so that say and this would be a more advanced version of this so craig Venter has talked about the idea that eventually maybe in the very near future so at the at the Holly Springs vaccine manufacturing facility in Holly Springs North Carolina where it used to be Novartis but now I think it's crk it's an Australian vaccine maker who owns it the idea is that you could in an epidemic in a pandemic we could send digital information to this facility they could make the DNA there they would never have any need for anything that came from outside of this facility but they could quickly produce hundreds of millions of doses but imagine a time in the future when we have the device that you saw here something much smaller in a hospital and you decide that this patient needs this a given designer vaccine so it could be made quickly in essence at the bedside and delivered to a patient this idea of digital information to producing a drug very quickly and there are all kinds of applications for this that I can see in the future the idea of really personalized drugs personalized vaccines that would enable medicine to advance at least to be more widely distributed using simple systems able to produce these remarkable biological entities so that's one example so the other that the next thing I want to talk about is this idea of making synthetic life and this had been one of the JCV I am ambitions when I joined the organization in 2003 we were trying to say that we were going to build a minimal bacterial cell in order to use this to study the first principles of cellular life and it didn't seem possible at the time to whittle down an existing bacterium and so Craig and ham said well if we can't do it that to get the like a simple cell like or a bacterium like e.coli and Whittle it down to the minimal set of genes in order to have something simple to use to understand life let's just build the damn thing and so we developed three key technologies for synthetic biology one was the capacity to build really large pieces of DNA quickly starting with synthetic oligonucleotides short pieces of DNA made from four bottles of chemicals and so we were able to synthesize we developed methods that allowed us to synthesize from building overlapping pieces of DNA that would self assemble we can synthesize now whole genomes so we by 2010 we had synthesized a bacterial genome that was over a million base pairs exactly right every down to the last base everything perfect and it's assembled in in vitro and then installed in a nother organism called yeast where it's put in yeast as sort of an artificial chromosome so we can park it there and store it for later use and then the third technology we developed was the capacity to take this synthetic piece of DNA and install it in a suitable bacterial chassis cell so that the new genome that were in the new cell that resulted from this installation is a cell with the genotype and phenotype encoded by this piece of DNA that we synthesized and so doing this and this is the method that Dan Gibson my colleague developed to synthesize the whole DNA really rapidly by 2010 we were able to produce what we called at the time a synthetic bacterial cell now the rest of the world doesn't quite call it that now they they well they called it that then but now many funding agencies and other countries are trying to make synthetic cells from dead parts and I'll get to that later but this was the cell that we made I'd like to have a tattoo of this but I would want an actual size because I love this organism we produced papers for the first synthetic cell in 2010 which was an exact copy of an existing bacterium and then in 2016 we made this minimal bacterial cell that we're now using to better understand the first principles of life this is a little complicated the first this minimal cell has 473 G and most of those genes you and I have two very similar genes because we have discovered that life the core the simplest this kernel of living systems is really pretty similar across life and so what you see here is each each of the horizontal lines is a comparison of the genes in the minimal cell two genes in this rain this group of organisms raining ranging from simple bacteria to man and what we were is that a large fraction of those genes that are widely conserved across all of biology we don't know what they do so a third of the genes and the simplest organism is still fundamentally unknown to biology so there's still a long way for us to go to understanding how life works and this is what we've been focusing on mostly for the last couple of years but using the technologies that we have developed to produce this minimal cell we have started some other projects so we've made a whole cell computational model that is more more sophisticated than anything has been developed so far and using these technologies I've started this really novel project so as I mentioned I use insulin but I'd like to see if we can try to solve the the type 1 diabetes problem I thought by the time I was you know when I was in my 20s I thought that this would be solved quickly so why get involved in diabetes research but now that I see that it hasn't been done I think you know I should put my two cents into the project so as a diabetic insulin is a great drug but still life is not perfect on diabetes if you have to take insulin and so there's a new understanding of the microbiome you know there are more bacterial cells in each of us than there are human cells and the idea that maybe we can take advantage of this recently was discovered that while we know there bacteria on our skin it turns out that there are also bacteria in the deepest layers of human skin you know in an intimate contact with the blood system and so imagine if we took those organisms some of them are called Staphylococcus epidermidis and I were to install in those organisms genes that would allow us to have those organisms synthesize insulin in response to elevated blood glucose and then and we would have a system so that the sensory information of these sensors that I install in these bacteria would result in the secretion of insulin that in theory could control diabetic blood glucose of course we put safety switches and so then I can imagine that I would get this cream that had it's that had these bacteria in it that I put on my skin and instead of having to have you know devices all over me that control that allow me to control my blood glucose I could do it simply with this bacterial system that unlike other approaches being tried to solve type 1 diabetes in to supplant giving people insulin which involve making new beta cells still the human immune system goes after those beta cells which is the reason I have diabetes so here you're getting a surrogate system of bacteria that we know the immune system can already tolerate so this is one notion and then it wouldn't be a modern biotechnology discussion if you didn't mention crispers which is this new technology we're talking about eukaryotes now that allow scientists to go in and edit genomes but one of the problems with Krister crispers which is a remarkable technology as you think about maybe using them in human therapeutics is unattended unintended consequences because while we're beginning to understand crispers we don't do it fully but we know for instance that sometimes crispers and stead of just inserting new DNA where you want it or making the edits you want you get unintended consequences elsewhere in the genome and my colleagues and I show you here my colleagues Pam silver and Jeff Way at Harvard and my former graduate student now postdoc at JC di David Brown we started with this DARPA funded project a few years ago the idea of building fully synthetic human artificial chromosomes because here what you're trying to do is make in essence a small chromosome that allows you to put anything you want into it that will and then you would want to install this in a human cell so that it and it would replicate along with the rest of the chromosomes in order to allow you to produce new proteins or Gibbs cells new capabilities and so this has been a method that people have been trying for decades but they've been using it they've been doing it using existing small human chromosomes and trying to whittle them down and it just has not progressed the way people wanted so our idea was to do this with a fully synthetic system so this is the way people have been trying to do this but what we want to do is build this fully synthetic system in yeast where you get all the power of yeast genetics to produce this chromosome and then we using methods we describe here we're able to efficiently install this in eukaryotic cells and in a paper we're trying to get out the door now what we're showing is that these human artificial chromosomes replicate along with the rest of the human chromosome and they function for months so far as long as we've been able to make them grow so this should allow new opportunities the idea that I could for instance let's say I harvest some of your skin cells and we would then install in those skin cells a human artificial chromosome identify the the the cells that have this chromosome and this chromosome would have an of genes for production of great antibodies let's say so there are sex workers in Thailand you never get HIV you could get antibodies to the new diseases that wander out of the jungle but you could put one chromosome that produced single chain antibodies that let you make a whole biological repertoire of new diseases that would protect you from new things or protect troops from new diseases for instance and another example is we could modify human cells for therapeutic purposes that need multiple genes because CRISPR I still wonder if they're ever going to be widely used because of unintended consequences here you're installing a separate fully fully autonomous chromosome into the genome with safety switches so if something went awry you could give people tetracycline and those cells would die for instance or something else but it would allow therapeutics so you could make plant artificial chromosomes or a number of other remarkable applications for this technology in engineering hire cells and so I'm gonna sort of stop with that and say you know here are just some examples of what a team of about 15 people at the JCB I have been able to get done over the years the numbers of people on the team have changed but generally we're about 15 people and this has been over the last decade and a half and with that I think I will say that you know it takes it takes a village to create a virus or a cell and I should also mention that we had support from Barda and some other agencies but if you've got any questions if I still have any time I'm happy to try to answer them hi John we have a question for you on slide Oh over here okay why target the skin as opposed to other human micro biomes for the insulin application and what are the policy barriers to this technology reaching the diabetic community why target the skin relative to other areas we we thought that this gives us some control that we might not have in other systems insulin produced inside the gut for instance would probably be degraded it doesn't seem to be a suitable system but one of the collaborators who with the idea that came together was Richard gallo at who's a dermatologist he's chair of the dermatology department at UCSD and he was the one who discovered that the skin wasn't sterile deep down so this was the idea and this was the first thing that we thought of for this sort of therapeutic approach but we can imagine other approaches where you would use skin bacteria at like to treat epidermis bullosa which is an absence of collagen 7 it causes skin so the idea that if I rubbed across if I had that disease and I did that to my arm I would just tear all the skin off so if you could produce new collagen 7 but this is why we chose the the this skin and it seemed to make sense at the time I'm not absolutely convinced that we could put enough bacteria in the skin to make this work that will take empiricism and then we might think about targeting other areas of the microbiome as well and then the question about the diabetes community there are a lot of biological biologists who are trying to solve diabetes and issues involved with diabetes and this is just one novel approach that at least you know in the last in the last couple of weeks we got an award that will let us try this we'll see thank you hi John you you mentioned unintended consequences and then followed and contrasted that with a very innovative idea for installing immune components in human cells that would function inside a person excuse me and you mentioned possible control systems for that can you imagine some unintended consequences that might come from that system particularly if those control features broke down absolutely which is why one of the things that we will include in such a Cell would be redundant kill switches so that should something go awry so let let's say let's say I had Alzheimer's and I found a way to put new cells into my brain to solve this and something seemed to RIE with this so we would have ways that I could give you a drug that would Norman already be approved but would be designed that if those cells saw that drug the cells would die and so let's say that the first the the our first approach at this did you know 99.99% and then some cells didn't make it so then you'd go to the backup system or the backup system but inevitably this would be a way of avoiding some of those consequences whereas with CRISPR based approaches you put something in and there's no way of knowing where it went in or what the consequences were and there's no way to get it out once you put it in Thanks sure all right please join me in thanking dr. John glass all right I'd like to move to our next speaker now dr. Justin Sanchez dr. Sanchez is the director of DARPA biological technologies office leading BTO s mission to develop breakthrough technologies and capabilities for national security as he recently noted his office is ushering in a new way of thinking as they focus on bio next and initiate groundbreaking research in neuro technology synthetic biology gene editing and more I'm honored to welcome Justin Sanchez to the stage thank you so much for the very kind introduction it's a real pleasure to be here today and share with you some of our concepts for the future you know when I heard the introductory remarks from the team here again it really resonated because there are some challenges that our world is facing that perhaps traditional engineering will not be able to address and let me just share with you a few of the things that we are thinking about imagine a future where we could detect any threat anytime anywhere imagine if we could deliver near instantaneous protection to millions of people imagine if we could help prepare a war fighters for the challenges that they may face in protecting our country enable them to really scale their effects in ways that we have never seen before these are some of the things that we think about at DARPA and especially in BTO and at the center of what we do in BTO is biotechnology and I want to make one very specific distinction here we're not just talking about biology we're talking about biology plus engineering and applying them to some of the world's most challenging problems now with that being said when you think about biology or biotechnology it's often very different than things like this okay most of the world when they think of powerful technologies they think of huge rocket systems and just these are these massive engineered kinds of systems and those have had a huge impact in the world over the last you know many decades but when it comes to biotechnology we have a very different situation and some of the previous speakers alluded to this biotechnology is completely democratized okay there's this is a competition that happens every year I Jim International genetically engineered machines there are high school students that are come together from all across the globe to use very powerful gene editing technologies while they're at the conference to try to construct different aspects of organisms and look at where those students again come from ok United States China you know 36 other countries again this is not technology that's in the hands of the few it's in the hands of the many and if that truly is the case and we're going to be using biotechnology for some of the world's most challenging problems we must have a new way of thinking ok and this is a challenge I think for this group today is what is that thinking going to be what are the capabilities that we need to develop what are they going to be how are we going to Shepherd investment into biotechnology how we're going to be able to build industries of the future in order to try to solve some of the world's most challenging problems ok so that's that's a challenge I present to you I'm really looking forward to talking with all of you throughout the day today to see where we might go now with that being said what is the the mission in the focus of the biological technologies office and it's very clear it's developed the world's most advanced bio technologies to defend the homeland all right and when I say defend the homeland again I'm not just thinking about kind of the medical side of things I'm thinking about all of the things on this screen right I'm thinking about how our adversaries could put either manned or unmanned vessels in our littoral waters or maybe how a natural engineered pathogen could affect our global travel hubs and in millions of people and even all the way down to things like our food supply and transportation and buildings there's the attack surface is enormous and traditional engineering may not be able to get us there to ultimately defend the homeland so we're thinking very deeply about what bio technologies can do in order to keep us ahead of any surprises that may occur in our homeland and even abroad ok so today the point of the whole talk I'm going to share with you a few of the ideas that we have and some of the technologies that we're developing along the way all right so let's start at the earliest part all of this how can we do that advanced threat detection and build countermeasures that effect up millions of people all right and again because we need a new way of thinking we need to try to assemble what are the pieces how do they fit together and how does time and adaptability and all of these aspects of what biotech can do for us play a role in all of this okay so let's start with something that we all live with every day so the threat of an infectious disease again this is either a natural pathogen or even an engineered pathogen you know that is it's possible by some of our adversaries now what's remarkable about this timeline here is that for the most part when our country is faced with a threat like this we're on the far right side of the timeline it's only when there's widespread illness that our country scrambles to try to try to get ahead of that or try to deal with that and I would argue argue with you know on that point and just say look it's far too late to continue to do that we need to move the timeline to the left so again from the DARPA BTO perspective let's go all the way back to the animal reservoir figure out where pathogens could potentially emerge from and do something about it right and in much the same vein what if we could even go to the part where let's say a human was exposed to a pathogen not showing symptoms yet but we could intervene in a much earlier way than we ultimately do all right so again this is the spirit of what we think about in BTO and we're asking the question what are the most advanced biological technologies that we could develop to get us more time to move the curve to the left and get ahead of any one of these these situations okay so I'm going to share with you what progress are are we making and the sounds impossible but we are making some real progress in all of these domains so let's start with that first one how can we predict contagiousness so we have a program called prometheus is run by a program manager in our office his name's Matt Hepburn and he asks a question can we from a drop of blood detective somebody was exposed to a pathogen and can we moreover predict if they've would be shedding virus in the future okay and if we could do that imagine the capability that it delivers right if you know that somebody's been exposed you can immediately in Veen and tried to prevent the spread of that that pathogen to others okay and what are we looking at so we're looking at cytokines DNA RNA any combination of biomarkers that may be in the blood all right so again this does sound impossible and this is the nature of what we do at DARPA but let me share with you some very real results so we've only been doing this for a very short period of time about a year and some of the people that we have supported to work on this problem have some tremendous results so left side of the screen they're looking at h3n2 and h1n1 so flu variants and within five hours they could predict if somebody's been exposed to a pathogen okay these are real human samples they're developing the computational techniques as well as the biomarkers to ultimately do that the right side of the screen says something even more powerful okay so if you have been exposed to let's say influenza you know the state of the art right now is to look at something like interferon and what's a difficult part about interferon is that if you're interfering I'm positive you might be shedding virus at 42 hours right but if you're an interferon negative you're kind of left in the dark so we ask the question again go back to that drop of blood look at those biomarkers and we're looking at combinations of RNAs and how they're modulating either up or down over time and even with those first few biomarkers we can within 18 hours predict if you'll be 74 percent likely to be shedding virus all right so again look at the time differences right being kind of uncertain at 42 hours or moving to being very certain at 18 hours imagine the possibilities that that could give our country the capabilities that would give our country to stay ahead of any one of these pathogens so really encouraged by these kinds of results and it's we think it's going to give us a time advantage in the grand scheme of things now it's not just the detection of of that it's what do we do about it okay and again in some of the previous presentations today we've already started to hear this concept of time right time is never on our side when it comes to pathogens again 2009 h1n1 you can see when the outbreak was was occurring right so millions of cases on the y-axis time on the x-axis when our first individuals were being protected as well after the peak of the curve it's far too late and if we want to take a pandemic off the table we've got to move the curve to the right so again if we had it our way you know we would like to be in the May June July time frame in order to try to stop that that pathogen from actually having an impact so again what is the breakthrough technology that's ultimately going to get us there and how would it work okay so we're thinking about gene encoded antibodies and let me share with you the fundamental concept for for how we kind of think about gene encoded antibodies and before I show you how the technology works you can recall back to the previous presentation if we do traditional vaccine development it's months two years to try to find that countermeasure and then we've got to grow it up and bioreactors and all of those kinds of things so the breakthrough for us is to make a pivot is not use a lab bioreactor to produce a countermeasure can we fundamentally change our thinking say can the body be used as a bioreactor so as a part of a program that we've had in our office called a death we started laying the foundations for this and the idea is if you know the genetic sequence the blueprint that your cells need to produce the most potent antibody can you construct it can you get into the right cells and let's say the muscle cells of your arm and tell them immediately what they need to produce okay and again this would be a near instantaneous but transient protection against virtually any pathogen if we could figure out what that code is again sounds like science fiction the teams that we have supported to do this have made tremendous progress right side of the screen this is my challenge with Ebola the mice that got the gene encoded antibody survived it gives 50 micrograms of kind of a level of protection the mice that didn't get it you know did not survive all right so this is proof of concept that we can make a big impact near instantaneous protection from even some of the world's most challenging kinds of pathogens now being DARPA do we just stop there with the existence proof no all right so again our our bigger goal here is defend the homeland protect the homeland how do we kind of scale this to a whole new level so we ask the second question could we do a pandemic prevention platform and there's one thing that's always amazed me about a biotechnology let's say compared to other engineering technology right so if you go to the Department of Defense they're gonna build you a big platform technology whether it's an aircraft or a ship or something like that when it comes to biotech we don't always ask that question can we develop a platform technology but in BTO we did we said could we develop this pandemic prevention platform and when a pandemic occurs can we get those samples into a biotech integrator all right so this is the platform and can the integrator grow enough virus to find the most potent antibodies to come up with the the manufacturing the formulation for all of that and actually deliver that gene encoded anybody and as a milestone of the program again our goals are not just to write papers as a proud of our work at DARPA it's a developed 20,000 doses and 60 days or less of gene and coded antibodies okay so the teams that we're funding to do this are required to try to show that demo and if we can get that we believe that we can get those countermeasures to you know thousands or even millions of people if we can actually scale it our goal take pandemics off the table and again I would challenge all of you here today let's be audacious Alaa deixa sin and how we actually go about you know setting up the vision for these problems and then find what is the most high-impact technology that can ultimately get us there okay so that's infectious disease now does our thinking just stop with infectious disease so so viruses and it's know right so if we think about the national security landscape there are other pathogens that threaten our country so there's bacteria so 99 percent of the bacteria that may exist in the world are virtually unknown and we're very interested in understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype but we do not have a way today in order to find the relationship between genotype and phenotype is phenotype especially in bacteria so we have a new program called friend or foe s being led by program managers her name is Paul Sheehan he's asking the question can you culture bacteria and can you play 20 questions with that bacteria to see if it's pathogenic or not again are you grandpa's native gram-negative do you resist Tet recycling again come up with a end-to-end strategy in order to deal with that okay so that's bacteria what they're kinds of threats are on the table and how are we trying to deal with those so you heard in some of the introductory remarks today could we do biosurveillance in a profoundly different way right so most of the world thinks about biosurveillance engineering a system in order to do the detection we think about that can we engineer plants to detect any number of the things so Kim Rad nuke whatever it may be plants are remarkable organisms they're persistent they have their own power sources they have three genomes there's a lot of genetic capacity through which we might be able to engineer into them the sensitivity to those threats and maybe even produce a signal that could be detected at standoff it's a revolutionary way that we think that we could solve this problem I know that there's people in this room that are thinking very deeply about how we could ultimately do that now this our thinking stop on the land absolutely not in DARPA vitia we're also thinking about the oceans the littoral waters how can we do surveillance in a whole new way to tech manned or unmanned vehicles and the crazy idea that we have on the table is could we help solve this by leveraging what natural organisms do in the ocean so you may or may not know this but submariners when they're using their sonar they often have snapping shrimp that create a lot of noise and in their sonar and we said well you know that's their problem but let's invert this can we take that noise and actually use it to an advantage and we think that we could develop next-generation technologies that could use those signal properties in order to detect man or unmanned vehicles so Laurie a tornados the program manager that's running this program is called pals okay so with that let's pivot real quick here and go to the next step so that that was all about detecting threats and developing countermeasures can we get critical resources where and when we need them so again if we're gonna take broad threats off the table and even in austere environments like our military operates and we have need a new way of thinking about how to do that so some of the technologies that we've developed over the years or platform technologies for doing pharmacy on demand okay so it's if you're in an austere environment can you develop a box that has a precursors for a wide variety of medications that you may need out in that all-seer environment so small molecules or biologics you press a button and you get the drug in the field if we have something like this and it serves the military it could also serve us in terms of defending the homeland put these boxes at let's say CVS is all across the the country maybe you have a whole new way of thinking about how we put countermeasures out into the field and moreover it's not just the countermeasures themselves when our body is subject to injury or illness we again as I've been saying we need to buy ourselves more time we just launched a brand new program called bio stasis it's run by Tristan McClure Begley and the whole idea is during the Golden Hour when military personnel are injured could we develop a new molecules or interventions kind of slow down the movement of of all of those molecules essentially buying us some time and then when we actually get that person to a place where they're getting their therapy could we reverse it again sounds impossible at Tristan and his team think that they can go go about and actually deliver it okay so that's delivering resources where you need it the last part of the talk here and the idea set of ideas that I'd like to share with you is how do we think about accelerating warfighter performance and repair okay so again the challenge is that our military personnel are going to face in the future are going to be very different than the challenges that we see today how do we prepare them how do we make them more resilient how can we accelerate the performance to ultimately deal with all those challenges and the lens that I would like to share with you at least are some of our initial ideas and we got a lot more coming in this space is first through the through the lens and neuro Technology ok so again you heard a Ralph talk about how there's been a lot of work that's been done here APL and laying the foundations for neuro technology but let me just walk you through like where did this come from it's amazing to me to think that in 2001 scientists write the world's most esteemed scientists we're saying that it was near impossible to put sensors in the brain read out information in real time to actually do something useful with it DARPA started a program back in that time to work in non-human primates to prove out that foundational technology and we did but again being DARPA we didn't just stop there we took a next major step and okay 2005 let's go directly to humans let's not just do movement but let's also do sensation show that it actually could work okay so look we're building complexity we're building knowledge and how we can do this again does DARPA just stop there no we keep going 2013 we launched a program to do direct neural interfaces closed-loop neural interfaces in humans for memory we push the envelope again 2013 said can we do two more complex functions of brain let's say neuropsychiatric health again restore neuropsychiatric health to our military personnel who have been under extreme kind of conditions and service of our country all right so again the take-home message in all of this is that there are some challenges that seem near impossible but when some of the most brilliant minds come together in a very focused way we can deliver those technologies and show that they actually work now one last stuff you flip in this chart that I would like to show you is that all of that that I've shown you so far has been in the medical domain but we see a huge potential and possibility for neuro technology for those of us who's that do not have medical conditions so we're asking the question can we develop non-invasive neuro technologies that have the same resolution that the invasive kind do and let's ask the question will what might you do with your brain in the future okay so that's a progression of what we've done in DARPA BTO but you know that the point of all of this is about what neuro technology does for people in their lives and let me share with you a couple of videos to show you what people can actually do with neuro technology in their life alright so the first one is about the peripheral nervous system so a person living with amputation they have a direct neural interface and we can not only read signals to infer what their movement is but we can write signals back into the peripheral nervous system today and actually feel something in the environment and it's not just the physical world that this person is interacting with it's a virtual world okay so let me play the video and this is what a person can do right and again for a person living with amputation this is transformative for them okay and yes this is a medical kind of a condition this is how neuro technology can change that but I truly think that an example like this it fundamentally changes how humans and machines and even virtual environments what will ultimately you know change over time all right so that's peripheral nervous system that's virtual environment let's take another step okay so this is Nathan here he's paralyzed from the neck down he was injured in an automobile accident he has a direct interface to his brain okay so sensors in the motor system as well as in the sensory system of his brain you can see that robotic arm that's there that robotic arm was actually developed here at the Applied Physics lab and the experiment is he's blindfolded can you touch the fingers of the robotic arm and can he tell you which fingers that you're actually touching okay middle index and middle all right so he has individual finger resolution through that robotic arm directly to his brain so I can remember that statement where's our profound change in how humans and machines are interacting this is the first example of what may be possible in that space now again this is you know pressing on fingertips a question that was naturally asked here at the Applied Physics lab will is well can we sense things other than just forces applied to the finger tips okay and the question that came up in the engineers that were working on this problem was could we place an infrared camera on the palm of the robotic hand and could we put a infrared source in the environment again the person cannot see what this is and can you actuate the arm under direct brain actuation and then if you can feel where the infrared sources stop the robotic arm and again remember this person is feeling with their brain that kind of infrared signal so this is what Nathan was actually able to do as a part of this test all right so the robotic arms in a start position there's a target that's on the screen you can see in the far right corner where the actual infrared target was all right this is gonna start in one second right so it's in the upper right-hand part of the screen is where the infrared sources again Nathan can't see this but the camera that's on the palm of that robotic arm is sending signals from the environment directly back into his sensory cortex and then when he gets the arm actually over that target he hovers the hand and he signals to us that he can feel that's where the infrared target is all right so kind of the first time ever that a person has felt infrared game-changer for how we think about humans interacting with machines okay now again the the extraordinary engineers that the Applied Physics lab didn't just stop there they were asking the questions well look if we can rican troll a robotic arm what else can you control just by thinking about it and they ran this extraordinary experiment with Nathan again control a primary aircraft but also control two additional unmanned aircraft and canyou can control all three just by thinking about ink and this is an example of what Nathan was able to achieve he's flying that primary aircraft again using direct brain signals in order to change the direction of the airplane at the top of the screen you can see the two additional aircraft that are there he gets a cue that he's got to move those additional aircraft to two locations while still maintaining control of the primary aircraft and he was able to actually do that so what natural question emerges from an initial proof-of-concept like this is you know how much can you control under your you know your direct a volition through a direct brain interface again the possibilities are really opening up for us to answer questions like that okay now did we just stop with movement and sensation I showed you that trajectory of neuro technology as a part of our work the answer is no we got into the memory domain again why did we work in memory domain there are hundreds of thousands of military personnel that come back from their service which romatic brain injury memory is often a function that is affected by that we asked could we develop a direct neural interface to help them form and recall declarative memories again in the example that I'd like to show you today again this is very different than anything we've ever shown in this domain we have enough understanding about the neural codes for declarative memories that we can provide somebody let's say a an image that we want them to memorize and let's say it's just a gray square and but if we can write a specific neural code into the memory center of the the brain we can associate that that gray square with a particular image out of a set of images that that were interested in having them remember okay so the experiment goes like this before I play the video person touches a screen after they touch the screen they're shown this gray square while they're shown the gray square we write the neural code for a particular one of those images that you see in front of you and then we'll hear what the person what their recall was as a part of this task okay so here goes so touch the screen they're showing that ambiguous image we write the neural code for one of the images that you saw before and then this is what the response I have to pick the one that we wrote the neural code says she likes that one but I think it was this one that was actually the one that the neural code was written to great once you take the one you lectures once I was Oh okay and that was a breakthrough moment for us again we have enough understanding about how the brain forms in and recalls memories that we can actually use a direct neural interface for a task like that think of the implications for all of us in the future of what it could do okay last video before I wrap up here again we're building in complexity we started with movement and sensation we've gone to memory now what about extreme neuropsychiatric illness this is a person that has epilepsy they're undergoing monitoring for that epilepsy but she also has extreme anxiety there's a direct neural interface that went to multiple locations of the brain that can assess how the neurons of the brain are involved in that neuropsychiatric state it can deliver a direct targeted kind of intervention to help this person with their extreme anxiety and this is what she actually experienced so this is stimulation off this is how she's living with their anxiety and now we turn the stimulator on closed-loop neural interface our excitement maybe there we go it's good okay that go that do you think that do I don't actually my goodness all of a sudden I have some energy but I like energy feels good it really is Wow what do these do this is excellent is due to this kind of it oh good days okay oh yeah there are so many things I just love love to do when I'm not having yeah and this is normal love is excitement it's a think about what you just saw here there's a possibility for the future that people don't have to live with extreme depression extreme anxiety extreme PTSD we have a deep enough understanding of the brain that we can start to break into these spaces where we think we can develop medical technologies that could be transformative for people okay so let me just wrap up here there's one last very important topic that I'd like to share with you everything you've seen here today they're very powerful technologies and because they are very powerful technologies we have a responsibility to think about the ethical legal social implications of all of them and I'm so happy that I'm at a meeting here today that that topic is also on the table thinking about who has access to biotechnology is biotechnology a right or a privilege how does it impact our daily lives not only our national security lives I would share with all of you answers to those questions are not just for the technologists they're for all of us okay so let's make sure that we do a really good job at addressing those while we're trying to develop some of the world's most advanced biotechnology so thank you so much and I'd love to open up the floor for questions I just and we have a question from slide Oh our our own us ethical constraints a problem for us to compete with other countries experimenting with cutting-edge biotech whether cloning or building super soldiers most of these concepts are met with cultural antibodies you know that's a terrific question and you know what's the issue that's on the table ethical legal social implications are not uniform o'clock across the globe alright that's just the reality of what we're dealing with and you know what I would say is that we need to come together technologists as well as a meth assist to understand that landscape to to take actions so that we're never surprised by what may come across the globe and to make choices as humans to help to protect what we feel is really important and valuable for us as a society and the only way we're going to get there is to be thoughtful about it to be open about it and to address the issues head-on so again this is one thing that I think it is a challenge for all of us and we need to look at it from multiple angles but terrific question other questions sure I have another question from slide oh how will the 60 days from virus to twenty thousand doses work within the current regulatory framework ah yeah another terrific question so you know let me preface this with this statement while I've served at DARPA one of the things I've always tried to do is build new partnerships with the FDA again right government to government we can come together and you know I've seen a real partnership emerge the FDA absolutely wants innovation for our country okay at the same time they want things to be safe and effective and that is absolutely something that they must do and the questions that we often ask together when we meet and try to form these new pathways is okay there's a technology that's emerging you've never seen before how do we work together to define a regulatory pathway to ultimately get there and then moreover it's not just government to government that's involved in these conversations we encourage the people that we fund to engage with the FDA unless and we say look let's have some open conversations there are going to be things that again the the regulators have never seen before let's talk about what those technologies are let's make sure we're doing all of the tests that we need to do in order to get through that regulatory pathway and again DARPA will fund work to do that and and again I think what we've been able to define over the last handful of years again DARPA are performers in the FDA is a entirely new vision and perspective on how to do this right so again if anybody is uh you wants to learn more about how to do it right you know come talk to me I'd love to share with you some of the lessons that we've learned over the years but I see a very I'm very optimistic about how even with gene encoded antibodies we can find a way to actually put those technologies into play ok other questions I see I just had a question it seemed so you're able to code a thought right that that's what a generative memory some memories a very comp or memories very complex we did one small sliver of memory so far right what seems interesting I think you know in your application it's a miracle for the person but can't you be using that for pacification or correct thinking you know in future applications that thought of if you can program memories or work with the brain in a way that you can be telling it exactly what it should be doing how do we prevent you know malicious use of that or use for mass control that type of thing because it seems like something that could make populations that you don't feel are tractable more tractable so get tremendous question and what you're what you're getting at is dual use ok so again let's be very direct about everything that you've seen here today and I would even argue almost every technology has dual use right is we are trying to develop technologies for the most beneficial use of that but there are people in the world that may not use it for those beneficial purposes and you know I say part of our mission is to understand all of the complexities of technologies so that we won't be surprised by all of those okay so that's kind of issue one let's address that yes there's dual use let's understand all about that that Julius and prevent dual use from happening and again that's the kind of the second part of it we need to make good decisions along the way in order to to prevent that dual use from happening okay but it's a very complex issue and and one that we think about not only from the technological side but also the ethical legal social implications of it so again thank you very much to the question okay I'm sorry that will have to be our last question please join me in thanking all right I'd like to turn to our final speaker of the session now dr. Megan Palmer dr. Palmer is currently a senior research scholar at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University she's founded and led numerous programs aimed at developing and promoting the best practices policies and the responsible demonstration and development of biotechnology a self-prescribed scientist and engineer turned policy wonk please welcome Megan Palmer to the stage it is really such a pleasure to be with you here today and I am really grateful that you are asking these questions these ethical questions upfront and in an integrated way with exploring the potential uses and misuses of biotechnology I call my comments here how to be smart and secure in a biological age and I pose it as a question because this was a question that a do-it-yourself biologist asked me and I think that the answer to this actually lies in asking Andry asking the question continually over time what does it mean to be smart and secure as we continue to develop these technologies and if we think about the capabilities that we need I think that there are capabilities around asking these types of questions that we need to experiment with I'm gonna start off with a disclaimer some of you may have seen early on that all Tatara was supposed to join us today and I bring this up because my first disclaimer is I am NOT Alta I am also not an ethicist and I am certainly not a lawyer but I am an advocate for engaging with ethical legal social questions continually I am an engineer and I engineer and I study these engagements and so I hope that we you can join me in continuing to do that Engineering is a little bit of background I work here at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University and I'm really grateful to be here because we bring together natural scientists and engineers along with scholars and the social sciences and in the humanities to study critical questions around our shared security so we work a lot in nuclear as well as in cyber and increasingly in bio technologies and are able to draw lessons across these different domains but as an engineer some of my favorite places to be are here so several of you in the audience were with me just a week ago in Boston this is the International genetically engineered machine competition that Justin mentioned where thousands of young excited genetic engineers came together to share their designer organisms and Here I am up on stage trying to appear cool holding my globe and convincing them that talking about responsibility in the world is critical to their shared future I am very lucky that I'm not alone in this pursuit I have many collaborators some of which are in the audience today and many people that I've worked with and again I think that building teams of many shared disciplines is really critical to be able to ask and answer these questions so what's happening with all of these exciting new developments in biological technologies is that we're seeing a proliferation of technology policy puzzles we haven't talked today yet about gene drives but the ability to actually develop technologies that can propagate genetic traits through populations right there can be really exciting for certain applications but also somewhat puzzling and and disturbing we develop technologies to develop new custom drugs how do we make sure that they're not misused how do we you know work in these technologies that can enable better health but can also enable selection of traits and what do we do when the technologies are not under just our control but our you know so-called democratized how do we make sure that our values are embedded in these types of technologies and the reality is these are really old questions this is just one example this is from the Rolling Stone magazine in 1975 that I have up in my office the Pandora's box Congress where scientists and the first generation of genetic engineers got together to look at some of the implications of their work and and again this is the need to continue to ask these questions we're not going to come up with all the answers but we know that we're not you know we're already in the situation of risk right where you have to develop these technologies to solve many of these problems and I like the little quote here from this article that says you know human sex is a moderate risk experiment right we are made of biology we are doing risky things all the time and we need to figure out how to take those risks Martley unfortunately what happens is our narrative is often caught in this dichotomy right this is not my article this is Laurie Garrett and foreign affairs a couple years ago talking about by Allah brave new world and her lesson is to be happy and worried unfortunately we often think about biology as the technology that will solve all of our problems right to be to be the root of health and wealth and flourishing of Nations or otherwise we think about it as being potentially the end of our civilization and really contributing to insecurity and the reality is that instead of a weapon of mass construction or a weapon of mass destruction really biology right now is a weapon of massive ambiguity and uncertainty about what exactly we should do and so I think that the answer here is to be happy about a little bit of worrying and to exist in this grey zone because the inescapable questions are where do we draw lines what do we do if we see somebody crossing those lines and this question is asked in many different technologies but it's incredibly important with this technology because it is literally what we are made of right and also it has special moral obligations around the misuse of that technology and so being able to navigate in this gray space requires serious ongoing integrated engagements with ethical issues and expertise the things I want to stress here is this is not free right it is not just a lunch conversation it is not easy and it but it is also not new right there are models that we can use and it's also not about slowing down but moving more smartly forward I just offer this as well this is science magazine the CRISPR one of the CRISPR articles that you know is proclaiming this revolution and the ability to use these technologies and in a tiny little box up at the top there is a in font it says managing biological risks and in that article myself and a couple of my colleagues at Stanford argue then unfortunately all of us are short-sighted in thinking about the fundamental shifts the fundamental cracks in the foundations of what we think technology and governance looks like we need to be much smarter about looking ahead so I want to talk about three key aspects of getting smarter embedding reflection evolving our policies and thinking about governing in networks and to do that I'm going to return back to I gem IgM as one of these places where perhaps we can learn from the kids so how many of you are intimately familiar with ajam how many you have never heard of it before okay so there you know we have a mixed bag here um so the quickest introduction that I can give is probably many of you more familiar with the FIRST Robotics Competition so I did first in high school and the basic idea is you get a kit of parts mechanical electrical parts and you get to build a robot that plays a game and I am Canadian and so of course I had to build a robot that played hockey and even though we go out to last place it was a transformational experience and I John works the same way except instead of mechanical electrical parts you have genetic parts genetic functions and instead of playing a game you get to choose your game you get to choose to develop the technology that you think is most useful so this is what it looks like this is the kit of parts the kid of genetic parts very tiny parts and a genetic and a representation in the digital space so these are not just physical but digital constructs and then these teams of largely undergraduates choose what they think is the most useful application of biotechnology and you've heard about some of these already from Justin and John but these exist across environment and health to new manufacturing to fundamental technologies so just as one example some of these are very simple tools so one team this is in 2009 they just really wanted to see what they were doing and so they developed pigments pigments that could be expressed by cells and then they coupled it to sensors developed by other teams and then they didn't just develop the tool they tried to explore what that tool might be used for so in this case a colorimetric sensor right that could be ingested and then it would maybe detect something in your gut and then you get a really useful readout of what is going on and so these teams come together and they present they make a website they present in front of all their peers they present to some of their heroes here at George church and they also deposit these parts in a repository and then this is a microcosm of really the world because they both compete against themselves for achievements but they also compete against each other for recognition against the back best applications and the best overall prize and they're judged by their peers so in this case near peers their mentors and others there was 175 judges this year I believe that came from across the world and so what these types of platforms have developed is this sort of virtuous cycle of problems and people and funding and tools and really the incentives to grow this over time so when I started at MIT in 2003 2004 it was the size on the left just a sort of rough cadre of people coming up with this idea and this year we had I believe about 6,000 students in 340 teams from 48 countries participating along the theme of today this technology is here today so this is one of the folks that was in that early picture who presented about a week and a bit ago about you know the vision for his now I think billion-dollar valued company that started off as ideas in this competition and he's pointing and say the future leaders are in this room and so the question is where tomorrow what are these kids going to be thinking where will they be working what will they be doing what questions will they be asking so I'm going to get just a few vignettes of the what we've done with this type of setting that might be useful inspiration so I'll start with embedding reflection so we run a number of programs within this competition to think about these ethical conundrums they work together one is called human practices the other is the safety and security program and another is responsible conduct and some of the leaders of these programs are in the room this is a this is what it looks like and I leave human practices this is a hugely embarrassing video of me on the internet talking about how we need to think about human practices as the study of both how your work affects the world and how your world how the world affects your work and there's parts of this program we provide guidance to teams this is not strong guidance it basically says you need to think about this and show us how you've thought about it and there's a team really from across the world that helps to shape this program and this is the key the key here is providing incentives and these are graded incentives so that collaboration and the competition teams don't just compete for the technical savvy and the best whiz-bang gadget but rather on how carefully they've considered the purpose of their work the risks of their work and they get different levels depending on how deeply engaged they are with those questions so first is just compliance but then to get anything else you have to show you've gone beyond compliance and you've actually innovated and developed new ways to ask ask and answer these questions there's many creative examples there's 2,500 projects or so I won't be able to go through them but I think this example from one team at Imperial College London shows human practices embedded here within their engineering design loop teams work on many different challenges from how to engage with their local communities to ask deep philosophical questions to work on the policies that apply to their labs that don't cover synthetic biology and work on accessibility and new partners and I'll just give one example from this year of the type of things that can happen so this is a team from from Germany billfold that were really concerned about the problem of electronic waste you know how are we going to deal with these problems and so they thought it would be a really good idea to come up with a microbe that could degrade electronics because of these types of incentives to think about whether or not that is such a good idea these teams put this at the front right and not only did they think about the dual dual use aspects of their work but they actually developed a system to educate other teams about the dual use aspects of their work and think about how that should enter into their design choices so how can we be inspired by these kids this is just two of the different programs one is sin burkas is an NSF 10-year multi-million dollar program that I helped to lead and when we think about the resources involved the research and practice agenda coupled to these types of questions ended up being up to 20% of the budget right so think about the types of resources involved and I've been really heartened to see programs like DARPA that really takes some of these questions and put them at the forefront having panels and questions in their Elsi and leader programs and having their mission space directed at these questions of how do we safely develop genetic engineering through the safe jeans program so a little bit more quickly on these last two aspects the second is evolving policies so in addition to the human practices program we have a safety and security program that's spun out of this effort and my colleague Pierce millet also has a similarly embarrassing video online that you can watch and this is a paper that came out to describe really ten years of investment in designing these adaptive policy settings where because we're at the cutting edge of prototyping technology we also have to be at the cutting edge of prototyping a policy of to keep pace there's many layers of this program I won't be able to go through them all but it involves also incentives guidance screening of projects and parts um it also involves policies so these are some of the policies and I will say this list changes every year it is updated every year that we go through the competition because of the surprises kids are really good at questioning the fundamental rationale of your policies they will find ways to break them and to question them and show you why they aren't they aren't working we also work with the team to review all these projects early and often and this is part of it is that it's not just a review and a yes no it's actually a mentorship it's a shared responsibility between the many different people that work on these committees and the teams so that they can come up with solutions and so it's not just a sort of ad-hoc group of academics that are working on this but it's actually now governments and organizations from all over the world that are investing and figuring out if they can test and adapt their policies through these test beds right so there are places to begin to test that what breaks and what works and we've had to figure out how do we develop context specific risks but assessment beyond policies deal with differences in international rules and regulations around say the use of animals how to deal with things like cutting edge technology and the prevention of misuse so this is another example here from the University of Minnesota and about I think it was about six months or less than a year after the development of the concept and proof-of-concept of gene drives these teams decided as their project they developed a gene drive this hit the news but one of the best things about this hitting the news is it explained how the teams were actually working on technologies to make gene drives safer and they did not develop a gene drive and describe the mentorship of the safety and security and the human practices committees alongside it so this is key in having the communication the transparency the accountability around these processes who would explain the justification of why we're trying to both push the envelope but not push it too far and we can again adapt and clarify our policies and these policies are done with representatives from all around the world and teams again I can give you many more examples of teams partnering with governments and with industry to figure out how their technologies can contribute to safety and security and also expose some of the vulnerabilities in our system in ways that that make us more secure again what are is our inspiration I think here we're seeing a lot of inspiration with programs like the IEEE output program funds e-cat here developing technologies that are really critical to advancing policies right being able to to screen and detect things better have more resolute policies requires us to develop the technology in concert I also see a little bit of inspiration in the type of strategies that have been developed or proposed to work and devoting resources to the supplied biosafety and biosecurity research in our bio defense strategy so in the last minute I'm just going to come back to this problem of governing networks so this is one of my favorite comics this is xkcd it's really a nerdy comic but this is an attempt to map out online communities this is one of a series earlier versions of this comic had a large territory occupied by in my space and now it's like a small island nation and Facebook has a large territory and I wonder what does this type of map of who is shaping our activities and behaviors look like in biotechnology I think I gem is one of those organizations right one of those platforms that shaping the standards and the technology what technology standards are we promoting all around the world but also these norms and values so there are interesting groups investing in these technologies and the social and technical infrastructure the FBI is one so the FBI is a sponsor of I gem for two reasons they see the forefront of the technology and what's happening and they can also enlist the help of this whole global community this is them on stage talking about how you should know your local WMD coordinator but the key here is actually the reverse this is a team from the University of Calgary in which my hometown at the biological weapons convention and here it's where the kids are coming in to teach the adults about how they've thought about these risks and taste aid on top of the technical horizon and I think we're seeing now inspiration from some of these kids that have grown up and again this is ginkgo Bioworks starting to see commitment to working together on the platforms and the technologies that can contribute to our national and international security so I'll end there and just say let's learn to live together in the gray zone let's develop the capabilities for this type of ethical reflection and let's make sure that we keep the kids in mind thank you the question from slide Oh over here how do you transition your silver all silver and gold level beyond mere policy compliance aspirations beyond the competition to other spheres such as publications tenure and hiring considerations and venture funding I think that's a really great question you know we have experimented with some of this with venues like the National Science Foundation Center that I mentioned before with with Cimber where we really tried to align the types of incentives around working on these problems is something that could be a legitimate research agenda things that could be published on the idea of having you know technologies and and policies are not decoupled and so we see this in academics is there being journals that have applied biosafety biosecurity research and an industry having these funding and incentives and programs where a company can actually you know work on solving some of these challenges and some of the deep technical aspects and so I think we need to figure out how do we align again the incentives for this but also realizing that it takes resources and money and and leadership hi Megan thanks so much for a great talk I wanted to get your thoughts on where students go after the item experience so and and what lessons they're taking with them over the long term so gingko is a great example of that I'm wondering if you're planning on looking at that and any sort of formalized longitudinal way to say you know how are these practices being carried forward which are the parts that are resonating and being carried in to industry academia and Beyond where we don't necessarily have some of these programs in place already hey I feel like I planted that question so one of the reasons that I spend so much time with with I Gemma so I think it is a possibility to ask these types of questions about both examining a gem is sort of a microcosm of what's happening in our world but also as an intervention and so part of my research program at Stanford is actually being able to look at can we find out yeah where the kids go when they when they grow up and so what is it about the environment that there from the training they've received the mentorship that might be predictive of their attention to risks so we don't have all the answers to that yet but we're starting to ask the questions and would love you know others who are interested in similar questions to offer you know their potential help or or or guidance yeah another slide Oh question for you how do we extend the ethical training in I gem to today's larger policy environment I would say at the start invite the kids into the room I think we've learned a lot from again that you know new folks who are training in these areas you know at the at the intersections of disciplines have a lot to offer right away and so you know sharing sharing that table is is really important I don't think it's the only answer but I think it's a really important one and I also think we have a lot more room for comparative comparative work and there's a number of different disciplines that are really need to be engaged here it's not just you know an ethicist but there's many different angles and so that policy forum it means making sure we have mixed teams right we're working on these from the outset negative so the robotics community for kids to learn robotics it's a much larger community but they face very similar ideas in terms of the risk maybe not the risk of destroying the world but at least the risk to the project and so are there philosophical differences between the way I gem teaches risk and the way that the robotics community teaches risk and then are there consequences of those two different approaches yeah I think well I think first it's a great question when I was in first robotics I was not trained to ask these questions in the context of what I was doing it was more of a sort of whiz-bang gee you know gee whiz this is cool and so there's just a different in approach at the beginning on that we're trying to develop but I also think it's recognizing that yes there are questions that come up with any technology around its use and misuse but I do think that there are even more fundamental questions when we are as I said dealing with the thing that we are made of right we are altering ourselves and our living world and that is you know deserves awe and respect at the same time and so I think it's asking the same questions but more often in a different way and in a way that's really much more integral to to what we're who we are
