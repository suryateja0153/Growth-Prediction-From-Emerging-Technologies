 Today, we're going to do something special. I have already deinstalled the motherboard because the BIOS chip is corrupted and has to be exchanged. This laptop is a high quality device, you can see that immediately by the cooler. It's an Asus G74SX Gaming laptop with 3D display, priced at about 3000 Euro. How can you detect the BIOS chip? In the last few years, BIOS chips are only fixed serial, which means they are small elements with just 8 pins. This special flashs are called SPI flashs. They can easily be detected because they have to be near the chip set. As you can see, the chipset which is here, is the only 8 pin nearby. On top of that, SPI flashs are normally inside a 200 mil casing which means the distance between the solder points is 200 Mil or 10 millimeters. This is contrast to the common 8 pin ICs, which are placed in 150 Mil casings. You can see it here. Here it's 150 Mil, here it's 200 Mil. If you know this, the identification is relatively easy. Just to make sure, we can check it trough the designation. When unsoldering, we practically always work with heated air which means we have to remove all heat-sensitive elements. Fortunately, there are none in our case and we can start right away. Heat-sensitive elements are foils for example. When operating with semiconductors, it's important to pay attention to the PIN1 designation. In our case, the thick line is the PIN1 designation. The new IC has to be soldered right reading. If it isn't, then it will break The designation is also marked on the Chip itself. In this case it's marked by circle. Clear and clean the solder points. Spud in the new IC, align it and then solder the PINs. That's it. After the successful repair of the BIOS chip, the device is fully operational again and even the network is recognized again. As you can see, the LAN is connected and functional. Thanks for your attention. If you have trouble with you laptop, feel free to contact us.
