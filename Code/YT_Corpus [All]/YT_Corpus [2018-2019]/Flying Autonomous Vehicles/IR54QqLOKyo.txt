 (MM) YOU MIGHT REMEMBER BACK IN APRIL---- THE RHODE ISLAND D-O-T SAID----- THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A COMPANY TO BRING AUTONOMOUS PUBLIC TRANSIT TO THE OCEAN STATE -- (HE) NOW WE'VE LEARNED FOUR COMPANIES HAVE SUBMITTED PROPOSALS, THREE FOR AUTONOMOUS BUSES OR SHUTTLES -- BUT THE FOURTH, IS WELL, A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. (MM) EYEWITNESS NEWS REPORTER KIM KALUNIAN JOINS US WITH A STORY YOU'LL SEE ONLY ON EYEWITNESS NEWS. OK HAVE YOU EVER BEEN STUCK IN TRAFFIC AND IMAGINED YOUR CAR LIFTING OFF THE GROUND AND FLYING ABOVE THE GRIDLOCK? ONE BOSTON-BASED COMPANY WANTS TO MAKE THAT DREAM A REALITY, AND THEY'RE BUILDING THEIR PROTOTYPES RIGHT HERE IN RHODE ISLAND. It's the Jetsons, just with a track THAT'S TRANSIT X IN A NUTSHELL ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY'S FOUNDER MIKE STANLEY. HE'S HOPING TO BRING HIS SOLAR POWERED, AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM OF SUSPENDED "PODS" RIGHT HERE TO RHODE ISLAND -- THE PODS HOLD FOUR TO FIVE PEOPLE AND MOVE AT 45 MILES PER HOUR 14 FEET ABOVE THE GROUD. Let's say there's a pod over there you bascially as you're approaching the stop you wave to it and make eye contact so then the pod comes down you board it like a car, and then you've already set your destination, it already knows where you're going, because you've either taken it before or you enter almost like a floor number so you're entering a stop number or putting in an address and it will take you directly to your destination without any stops. THE LIGHTWEIGHT POD IS MADE OF CARBON FIBER -- It always starts as a textile and we introduce the resin to it, sometimes the resin is introduced ahead of time and it's consoldiated in the mold and the part's made. MATT DUNHAM'S COMPANY MADE THIS ONE RIGHT HERE IN BRISTOL. Oh the manufacturing would be great for this state. STANLEY SAYS TRANSIT X IS ALREADY IN THE VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGES IN ATLANTA -- THOUGH THERE ARE STILL SEVERAL MORE HURDLE TO CLEAR. THE PRICE TAG FOR THE RHODE ISLAND PROJECT? 400 MILLION ... BUT WITH PRIVATE INVESTORS BACKING HIM, STANLEY SAYS IT WON'T COST THE STATE A DIME. Nothing for the capital costs and nothing for the operations, then their biggest risk is just continuing with the status quo, it's - we represent the lowest risk option for Rhode Island. SO YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING: DOES THIS THING REALY WORK? STANLEY SAYS HE'S PLANNING A DEMONSTRATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY UP IN LEOMINSTER MASSACHUSETTS NEXT WEEK. NOW JUST BECAUSE TRANSIT X SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL TO RIDOT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'LL BE SELECTED -- THE DOT SAYS THIS IS STILL AN OPEN SOLICITATION AND THEY EXPECT THE CONTRACT TO BE AWARDED IN THE NEXT MONTH.-- KK EWN.
