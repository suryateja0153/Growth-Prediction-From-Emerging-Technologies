 [Music] when I saw it take off I was inspired by it this team of Boeing engineers was able to do the impossible and deliver a prototype in a matter of three months we took a concept on a piece of paper all the way to a flying vehicle so this is an octocopter it's fully electric done some Boeing custom-designed batteries the goal is to grow into a large-scale cargo platforms if you extend the range and extend the payload a little bit when you think about delivering 250 to 500 pounds over a 10 or 20 mile radius you can change the way that the world connects you can change the way that we deliver goods you've really got a convergence of technologies right now in terms of hybrid electric propulsion vertical takeoff and landing and autonomy that is going to unlock air travel in areas that we haven't seen it before it becomes the testbed for future businesses such as maybe electrically vertical takeoff cargo this is my dream job of trying to come up with something new that the industry doesn't have yet so it's exciting the company earlier is trying to change the future the world they are driving and on the leading edge and pushing the envelope but doing it in a smart way Boeing is at the cutting edge of technology in aerospace we have a chance here to really change air travel and we'll look back on this day as a first step in that journey you
