 This is an autonomous vehicle. We want to make it easier for clients and partners to run their business by presenting a highly effective system for moving goods as a complement to what's available today. The pace of society and increasing global trade is placing high demands on efficient and sustainable transport solutions. E-commerce is growing fast and we have a widespread shortage of truck drivers. Autonomous, electric and safer vehicles have a great role to play and can help meet many of these challenges faced by society and the industry. The autonomous vehicle is part of a larger system and has the potential to optimise transports in highly repetitive, short-distance transport flows with large volumes of goods, such as ports, factory areas and logistic megacentres, offering better delivery precision and flexibility. The autonomous electric vehicles operate together in a network and are connected through a cloud-based service and management centre. It is a future transport system that can be an important complement to today's solutions and solve many of the challenges faced by society and industry.
