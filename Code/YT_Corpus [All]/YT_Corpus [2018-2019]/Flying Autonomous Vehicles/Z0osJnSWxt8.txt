 [Music] a drone is an unmanned aerial way at the moment we define drones as quadrocopter that's flying flying objects basically the drone itself is a kind of sophisticated helicopter drones are like an expanded consciousness is almost like an extra eye that allow us to reach to places that otherwise we never read it is something co-opted from the military and has a has a really dark side to it is an autonomous machine that kills people on the other Islanders you know Martha Stewart with her drone flying around if the drone with a camera and you've seen that happen with the Internet when all of a sudden this technology which began in the hands of the military appeared on everyone's desk or in everyone's pocket I mean drones 10-15 years ago were immensely expensive complex objects and now you can just buy them at a toy shop we're now at it went where there is more civilian drones flying in the air right now and there are military drones and that's a really profound one currently the growth in drones is very much in in areas like agriculture and checking of infrastructure but also I think going to places where it's very difficult for humans to go gathering information continually what drones are really good at as many robotic objects are it's repetitive and accurate physical activities which humans aren't terribly good at day to day use a drone a lot it's a really useful tool for an architect whether we're surveying a new site it is fantastic for flying over and survey all the trees certainly in Japan they're using them to inspect the solar panels they can fly over and check the heat spots on them and work out which solar panels are dead or alive now you do an aerial scan and you just get it you know precisely by the cubicle meter they will just fly over and give you a free D model with a texture map of the location and you just get a data set you could not acquire by any other means no way you would never have that precision in that resolution and that's incredible that's a real game-changer the most incredible moments with flying drones though is when you are not required as an operator anymore when it just hovers or when it just does when you just press a button and it doesn't maneuver you could never perform what we're seeing now that drones are in the hands of every person on the street they're potentially as disruptive as the Internet and they're gonna fundamentally change the way that we relate to each other across space across territory and across the city there is a lot of implications in terms of drones changing the way architecture is perceived and you know eventually also in the future the way architectures being I mean the first thing is of course about the candidly of it the rules used to be very much part of the invisible series of a place where people who put the trash or storage of all kinds of things in our Sun becomes very much part of the visible see there is this overview effect that you experience that astronauts used to experience you know they see the world and the earth from the point of view that was previously restricted to people who could go that far but if it's a drone anyone would momentarily experience flying while still having your feet grounded that's really incredible it is changing architectural photography because it's giving us a whole range of new perspectives on a building west before we were limited to the ground I think the use of drones in photography will start to change the way architects design they're building this because these buildings will be seen from all sorts of angles it's kind of fascinating DC a serpentine pavillion by Francisca ray of course emphasized a lot the roof because he believed the canopy which serves as a fallon for a walters from inside the pavilions from also outside you just see the fan of it you don't really see his extraordinary roof this extraordinary platform which of course through the drone becomes visible I think I've always been influenced as an architect by a passion for flight for decades I've piloted and being continuously intrigued by the aerial perspective the reality of our existence is at the ground level and the perception of the ground but you certainly do see the big picture from above and you do see that fifth elevation and so the experience of flight is to heighten that sense of awareness [Music] the Apple Campus is a great example you wouldn't be able to receive the building from ground level it was almost designed to be seen from above it's been built like most Apple products in a lot of secrecy so it's really difficult to see but because of drones you can see above and there's a drone sequence of it each week so you can see the progress I was frequently opening my phone and seeing drone coverage of our Apple project so in that sense it was and is very much in the public domain Architects are using wrong some of them are using them to actually build buildings that kind of leaving the building's through those others like Kalavati use drones to paint facade to bathing to large scale paintings because out of a sudden a very big facade of a building which used to be very complicated they needed scaffolding becomes very easy the drone becomes the brush drones in construction is something which is happening quickly I mean we probably all seen the video of the drones making a bridge using fibers between two objects the aerial construction research project investigated the potential of using flying robots to build tensile structures flying robots provide access to three-dimensional space in entirely new ways for architecture effectively this allows us to access points in space we couldn't access before we can assemble things differently it doesn't matter anymore rather be necessarily built from the ground up I believe that there will be a huge impact on the built environment once we actually start using these machines and construction living drones are essentially gonna be an extension of public service infrastructure in the same way that a garbage truck moves about the city providing a service to us so too will the drone don't deliver our packages they'll bring us fresh milk in the morning freshly baked bread we can imagine them being an extension of the network any service we can generate through the network they can bring to us in physical form we're working with a project in Tokyo already where the drone question is coming up it's for a large warehouse the actual location of the projects has changed the warehouse is coming closer to town they're getting smaller because the drones can only take smaller packages but it's gonna be very very quick so all of these things are really changing the cityscape delivery drones are here right now you can go online and look at them delivering objects all over the world and I think the next step is going to be humans traveling in drones the technologies there and I think this is going to happen quite quickly Dubai has relaxed some of the regulations in flying around the city and they're saying that 2018-2019 they may have autonomous taxes flying now so I think it's happening it's just in what form I think you could well see the development of aerial highways so if you have a motorway the airspace above that would be a natural route in the same manner the heli routes in London follow green spaces we used to think of cities as being glommer ations built around large permanent infrastructure networks road networks water power but the drone had the potential to do is totally rewrite them because all of a sudden you're dealing with a nomadic form of infrastructure that can move and drift around the city up till now cities have been very much developed on roads and once we're released from that it allows development in different ways it's almost as fundamental as some of the first railways then we came to cities if you think of here in London Metro land and the development of the early metro system which allowed the city to expand it was a linear development because of the infrastructure and I think with flying autonomous vehicles that could be an equally big step change in cities because we're not bound by linear infrastructure because you can fly wherever I was approached by an individual who had an idea that you could combine the technology of the drone with a building type to answer the needs of continents like Africa which doesn't have the infrastructure which we take for granted of roads and railways so how do you leapfrog that and the idea is that you use the drone it can move economically quickly and deliver urgent supplies and that was the genesis of the drillin port in the future you're going to be entering buildings in a completely different way you're going to be entering probably from the roof from a balcony that formal approach to a building is really going to change you know the classic house with the front door or the car in front of it or a flat if you're beginning to access buildings from different levels then of course it opens up complete new opportunities in city development parking for the drones would all be on the roof recharging for the drones retention on roof when suddenly the ground plane is moved up into the air there'll be different layers of transport happening I think at the lowest level it could be people flying at a couple of hundred meters above that it may be the packages and above that you've got commercial aircraft so suddenly gonna get this layering in the sky but they won't have to follow roads they'll get to go from point to point they've got a sense one another so instead of you seeing these sort of sort of streams of ants in the air I think it's gonna be you know probably this cloud or watts or earth place weed has developed a film called in the Robot skies which is the first fiction film shot entirely through autonomous pre-programmed drone technologies and what we're trying to do there is explore a world where drones have become as ubiquitous as pigeons they serve a London council estate and they monitor wayward youth in courts wearing a police or drinking in public and have been confined to their tower blocks and the drones watch over them the equivalent of an ankle bracelet I think we should question whether we want drones to be part of other civilian space of our cities the fact that is available as a technology doesn't mean that we want it to be part of our lives our idea about the public space has already changed we are already used to the idea that some sort of machine or gaze is looking at us drones probably will be a step further in our studio at super flux we wanted to explore the cultural political and social consequences of living with civilian drones we created a speculative film called drone Avery to understand what it might be like to live in a city with drones flying over our heads we were interested in aspects of autonomy and artificial intelligence that these machines might have we specifically looked at what sort of civilian drones might exist in our cities and our landscapes how might we interact with them what might it mean to live in a city where drew is watching you collecting data about you and perhaps making decisions based on that data that you we Avera as drones become more and more frequent in the airspace above people's houses and buildings I think there will be an issue of ownership of that space you wouldn't want drones constantly buzzing around your windows that does raise whole issues of privacy which is one thing with viewing an Apple building from the air which you can do from high up and an aircraft which I've seen frequently or whether it's low down with with a drone but on the other hand if this is your private apartment and there's a drone the other side of that pane of glass and you have to draw the curtains and that does raise a whole series of other issues so like any emerging technology it raises other social issues one now is a very attractive space in the top floor of a high-rise with wonderful views suddenly become the perfect that scene for drone surveillance so questions about privacy and security are been redefined because of the drones and that affects the way in which we think about buildings force architects and designers that is already drones and cities to police are using them and there is drones used by protesters before the power is in the hands of the police but now a crowd can launch a bunch of drones in the air and they can document police violence or they can make people accountable surprising how little Hospital happened with commercially available drones that you buy on Amazon because there is stuff that can carry considerable payloads and there's been a lot of near misses at airports but also like just dropping things into a crowd it's a real option it's a real option and gladly nothing has happened there yet but it will in Syria district or top handmade drones so some of the rebel groups they built their own surveillance drones who fly them and Isis to the sames and apparently Isis hadn't drawn map and all of that is obviously scary reason why we're having this conversation now why everyone's talking about the drone now is because it's now got to the point where that technology has become democratized because they're now in the hands of everybody and then you start to see them being used for ways in which they weren't intended it's an urgent moment to be thinking about what the possibilities are [Music]
