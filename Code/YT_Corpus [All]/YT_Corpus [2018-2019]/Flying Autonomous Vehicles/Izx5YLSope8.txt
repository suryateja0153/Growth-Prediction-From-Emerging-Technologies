 Right now the way supplies are moved around the aircraft carrier deck are with these things called weapons skids, they're these big metal carts that you load things onto that you push around the deck. it takes 4 sailors total to move them around, one to steer and like 3 or 4 guys to push, and we took a look at that and we thought that was a lot of guys pushing things around the carrier deck. We're trying to see if there's a way that we can reduce the amount of sailors that are needed for that task maybe they could be going off and doing something else instead. And so our vision for the future of the carrier deck is one sailor, basically, with a control panel showing where all of these robot weapons skids are, send them to places to pick things up, put them on and tell them to go other places. Is this thing going to be robust enough to be out there on the carrier deck - is the materials that it's going to be made out of resistant to corrosion and to be robust enough to deal with the ship shaking around, you know there's a lot of noise, there's a lot of vibrations during aircraft operations. We come up with an algorithm for obstacle detection and avoidance. recognizing, alright there's somebody right in front of me they're pretty important let's let them go through or maybe, no I'm a little more important maybe they'll get out of my way. We need to make sure they won't bump into personnel, they won't bump into each other, they won't bump into obstacles or objects on the deck, We want these robots to integrate well on the carrier deck environment and we don't want sailors having to worry about robots running over their toes. We need to make sure that what we do down the line is fleet ready, and it is a strict improvement over what they have now because that's gonna be the way that we're gonna sell it to the fleet.
