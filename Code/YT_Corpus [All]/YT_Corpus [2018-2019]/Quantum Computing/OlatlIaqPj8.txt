 [Music] you so let us start a new subject or rather a new module in the study of quantum mechanics that we have been engaged in and it is called as the quantum computing and possibly it's one of the most interesting topics that will keep the scientists busy over the next decade or so because there are lots of developments that are happening and lots of open problems which need to be solved and attended so in this particular lecture or this section of the lecture I'll give a brief introduction to this quantum computing and sort of this will be more like a popular introduction which should be acceptable or rather understandable for more general public and then we'll go on to the details of various sub topics that we'll mention in this lecture so once again we go back to this Schrodinger's cat which we have talked about earlier so just to remind you of this situation that there is a cat which is left alone in a room and nobody is watching it there is a hammer that you can see which is hanging on a green colored portion kept in a bottle and this hammer is connected to a pulley so if the cat comes and disturbs the pulley the hammer will fall on to the glass tube and will the the portion will came will come out and the portion is assumably poisonous so the cat will die and if it decides to stay away from it then it will be alive and if it doesn't I mean tamper with the pulley then the hammer will be where it is and there'll be no spilling out of that poison and it will be safe so unless one does a measurement one doesn't know whether it's dead or alive so it's in the superposition of state in the mind of an observer before an observation is made and so it is in in a state which may be given by a superposition a super Post 8 which is a sigh alive plus a sigh dead and just to have proper normalization we can write 1 by root 2 so that the probability of being it alive is 1/2 and the probability of being it being dead is also 1/2 now as soon as one does a measurement it is it collapses into one of the available states which is either dead or alive and say it's alive then the then the amplitude that is associated with a life becomes 1 and the other amplitude that is associated with the state dead is equal to 0 so as long as one hasn't made any measurement it is in the superposition of state let's talk about this coin are tossing of a coin and biased coin so it will be when it spins goes up and then comes on to the ground either between between your palm or on the ground it's found in one of the states that's head and tail so once you make a measurement once you want to decide say who would bat first in cricket it collapses into one of these head or tail so quantum mechanical coin in a sense is always spinning because it's in the superposition of state and never now the moment it comes down and you make a measurement it becomes classical so measurement actually in some sense kills quantum mechanics now so there are various such examples of these two state systems just like it is mentioned here and we have given the example of coin tossing giving head or tail or it could be just the the two states of a spin 1/2 particle particle which are given as up-down or take as the on/off state of a switch or it could be the ground voltage V equal to zero and an excited voltage which is say V equal to some V so zero and we can also be taken as a two-state system so we'll show that this two state system and the superposition that goes along with it forms an important part of this quantum computing or the quantum information as as a name goes so we'll discuss what are called as qubits which are nothing but just an amalgamation of the two words quantum and bits bits we are familiar in the context of classical computers bits are 1 and 0 and every number is formed by the combination of 1 and 0 and when we discuss it in the context of quantum mechanics then it is called as qubit so we are talking about particularly two-level quantum system we can actually talk about multi-level quantum system which we just briefly will touch but two-level systems are most important and convenient for us to discuss so as we have just said that there are two level quantum systems a many of them such as photons having the polarization of photons the spins of the electrons the nuclear spins and and a large variety of them as we have just seen so let us just draw two coordinate axis and label them as 1 and 0 you can also label them as Dead or Alive you can also label them as up or down in the context of the spin half particles but let us just talk about 1 & 0 just like the classical bits are being introduced so these are the zeros and ones are the computational basis states which are going to be useful for our discussion so we are just looking at a vector which is formed by the combination or the superposition of 0 & 1 just recall that we have written down a state like this in the last slide of the cat being dead and alive so the zero say corresponds to dead and the one corresponds to alive with their individual amplitudes given by alpha and beta and so this is a vector that's drawn in that space which is spanned by the 0 & 1 cats there is of course a normalization condition which is what we have seen there is a 1/2 possibility of the cat being dead and the half of it being alive so the amplitude square should be normalized that is the Alpha mod mod alpha square plus mod beta square should be equal to 1 so this is a statement made by Richard Fineman he said that all we do is draw little arrows on a piece of paper so you see that with 0 & 1 one could write a unique classical number which is usually the numbers that are you know fed into the classical computers that we all are familiar with however in this particular case there can be infinite number of numbers that can be formed with different choices of alpha and beta the only constraint being alpha square plus beta square of the mod alpha square plus the mod beta square equal to 1 so say for example alpha equal to or alpha square equal to point 99 and beta square equal to point zero one would give rise to a particular state and this another distinct state can be obtained by taking alpha more alpha square equal to 0.98 and mod beta square equal to point zero two so they are distinct quantum states and could be made to carry distinct information okay and there are infinite number of such combinations that are possible so just by using the bits 0 & 1 in a superposition sense we can actually build an infinite number of other store infinite number of numbers so in some sense let's talk about postulate or rather a piece of information which is which is important in this context so is associated with any quantum system there is a complex vector space known as state space ok and the state space that we are aware of are all complete which means they are orthogonal to each other each entries orthogonal to the other and they are also normalized so they are ortho normalized and in that sense they are complete and an infinite vector space he has a special name which is called as a Hilbert space after the name of a mathematician called Hilbert the state of a closed quantum system is a unit vector in the state space just as in the slide that we have seen that this is the vector so a state of a system is represented by this vector which is alpha 0 and beta 1 where clearly that the 0 and the 1 form the coordinate axis for this particular problem will of course a mainly work with qubits as I told so which have a state space which we write as C 2 because these are complex vector spaces so VI with a C which denotes a complex vector space and two denotes two-dimensional complex vector space so a cubed alpha and 0 alpha on 0 and beta on 1 is actually written by a 2 column vector which is alpha beta so this is a notation that is somewhat universally accepted and one can simply write within a like a column vector alphabet it would mean that we are talking about a cubit with amplitudes alpha and beta corresponding to the 0 and the 1 states a few more conventions if would actually help us to understand things better so we write vectors in state space as sigh okay which is equal to alpha multiplied by that 0 ket plus the beta multiplied by the 1 ket so this called as a ket notation which you are aware of and we nearly assume that all our physical systems are finite dimensional state spaces of course for the sake of learning quantum mechanics we have seen that they are actually they could be infinite dimensional in fact all these X and P the position and the momentum the basis in which they are written are actually infinite dimensional but for our the the needs for this particular subject we can think of finite dimensional state spaces and they are orthogonal orthonormal to each other and not only that if they are not orthogonal they can be orthogonal eyes by a technique which is called as a gram-schmidt orthogonalization so we can actually think of a d-dimensional space instead of a two dimensional space and we can write down state space or state vector sy alpha 0 0 and alpha 1 1 alpha 2 2 and all that and all the way going up to alpha D minus 1 multiplied by the ket D minus 1 and in our shorthand notation it will be alpha 0 alpha 1 alpha 2 and all that to alpha D minus 1 and as we have learned earlier that this corresponds to our D dimensional complex vector space so this is called as a Q did instead of a qubit date for a d-dimensional space how these concepts of quantum entanglement and various other things would be elaborated later in the next lecture or in the next discussion but let us a priori define them and try to at least get ourselves motivated that these are important things to study in the context of quantum information so quantum entanglement is a uniquely quantum mechanical phenomena and has no classical analog and this what it means it's a property of a multi qubit which is a tensor product of individual qubits and can be thought of as a resource in quantum computing the key to entanglement is the property that the state space cannot be decomposed into component spaces so the composite space remains composite and no combination or other no choices of some complex coefficients we would be able to write that as a product of two spaces or two qubits so in summary if we want to just say before we do things in details in summary by measuring one qubit it is possible to affect the measurement of other qubits or qubit or qubits in the system and this also has relevance to EPR paradox epi Barack's are this epr are the first letters of the names of Einstein Podolsky and Rosen and these are so Einstein actually questioned that can quantum mechanics be complete because this quantum entanglement actually gives rise to the possibility of faster-than-light communications and since relativity clearly states that there can't be anything which moves faster than light so is quantum mechanics is in confrontation with relativity and whether it's complete and Einstein had this idea of that there are hidden variables however they are negated by Rosen and by the bells inequality there is another very interesting concept in in physics which has found a lot of mention in the science-fiction books and movies it's called as quantum teleportation so quantum teleportation is about carrying a fixed amount of information through the system of qubit so this certain amount of information is being carried ok and basically this if this transmission of information happens at a speed which is faster than the speed of light then we can say that there are you know teleportation of information that that happens and it means that to replace a state of one qubit with that of another ok and the interesting name of course the name is very interesting it's called quantum teleportation this name is derived from the fact that the state is transmitted by setting up an entangled state space of three qubits and then removing two of them from the entanglement via measurement well of course these are these let them remain as words little complicated that too however will make sure that one one understands what is being conveyed here so since the information of the source qubit is preserved by this measurements the information lands up in the third that is the destination cubed so this is all about quantum teleportation and I you would find them as I said that mentioned in the science fiction movies or books then we would also discuss what's called as a super dense coding which is in some sense it's the reverse of quantum teleportation so the idea is to send two classical bits of information by sending one quantum bit or qubit so it works by first pre communication of this EPR pair so EPR pair are those variables which one when one being determined the other automatically gets determined that's called the EPR pair that is shared between the receiver and the sender let's just introduce the quantum logic gates which are analogous to the classical logic gates so if you have quantum not gate so an input qubit would pass through a quantum not gate and would give me so if it acts on a 0 will give me 1 and if it acts on a 1 it will give us 0 so the output qubit will be if the input qubits are 0 and 1 as it's written on the left-hand side of those two equations then the output qubit would be what appears in the right of those equations that is namely 1 and 0 corresponding to 0 and 1 cubed so the question is that now if we want to do this operation on the on a qubit which is given by a combination or a superposition of alpha zero and beta 1 then what happens so alpha 0 actually goes to alpha 1 and Peters 1 goes to beta 0 so 1 actually gets the interchange interchanging of the probability amplitudes or the amplitudes of this state spaces so the matrix representation of such a thing can be written as 0 1 1 0 and so that the 0 is converted into one and one is done vertices 0 and so on and so forth and this is nothing but if you see that this is like a the power matrix the X component of the poly spin matrix correspond to spin equal to 1/2 and so the general dynamics of closed quantum systems including the logic gates can be represented by unitary matrix we have given the definition of a unitary matrix unitary matrix is defined as u T u or u dagger u is equal to an identity matrix so that's the definition or rather that's a test for a unitary matrix so let us look at this the poly gates which are Sigma X or Sigma 1 and that you know just acts like a not gate so it converts 0 into 1 and 1 into 0 and also there's a Y gate which is written as Sigma Y or Sigma 2 and this has a particular form which is 0 minus I I 0 do not mistake any of these having complex entries to be non hermitian operators they are all hermitian operators they have real like in values so one can check that so this is a why gate also known as the Sigma Y or Sigma 2 as I told you and there's a set gate also Sigma said and Sigma 3 and that is just returns back the states accepting for the one state it returns a minus one so it's written as 1 0 0 minus 1 and this is nothing but the Z component of the poly matrix okay so as an exercise you can actually show that that X into y is equal to I into Z so this take this matrix and multiply it with this matrix so let's do that for the moment so X y equal to 0 1 1 0 and a 0 minus I I 0 so this is equal to 0 and I so then 0 minus I and 1 0 so this is equal to 0 1 0 this is also equal to 0 1 minus I so this is minus I and this is equal to I and this is 1 0 0 minus 1 so this design to Z okay and so on so these are easy things and there is also another 2 by 2 matrix which is of importance here that Sigma 0 which is equal to the identity matrix and it's important for you to know from the mathematical point of view that any two-by-two matrix the Caleta ABCD they can be written in terms of of Sigma X Sigma Y Sigma Z and Sigma 0 by properly choosing coefficients any two-by-two matrix also as an exercise one can show that the X square equal to Y square equal to Z square equal to an identity matrix so let us give a very brief introduction to the quantum computing power and why quantum computer we'll take a center stage in in research and in learning for the next day you know maybe a decade or even more than that it's because the integer factorization which is impossible for digital computers to factorize very large numbers which is the product of two primes of nearly equal size and quantum computer with two n qubits can factor numbers with lengths n bits which are binary lengths quantum database search as an example one can see that to search the entire Library of Congress for a particular name give given an unsorted database in classical computers it'll take hundred years whereas in a computer quantum computer it should take half a second and that's a miraculous speed that we are talking about so what's the quantum computer the computer that uses quantum mechanical phenomena to perform operations on data through devices such as superposition and entanglement which is a little of it we have already seen we'll see more of that and classical computer as opposed to the quantum computer it uses voltages that flow through circuits and gates and can be calculated entirely by classical mechanics so one of the very important thing about quantum computation quantum computation is factorization of very large numbers and there was an algorithm put forward by Peter shor in which it is this algorithm is used to factor numbers into their components which can potentially be prime just like we have seen just a while back and it does this in roughly order of n cube quantum operations okay so the best-known classical algorithms are at the best exponential since the difficulty of factoring is believed to be exponentially hard it forms the basis of most crypto systems okay thus factoring in polynomial times in so basically because the quantum computing does it in polynomial times which is n cube it has attracted a significant amount of attention let us look at these Grover's search algorithm which says that in some sense you know the parallel version of the classical computer is already inbuilt into that so if you want to understand how the classical computers work they actually work with the flow in time which means that one job gets over and the next job starts like if you think about the multiplication of two large matrices it will multiply the row of the left one to the column of the first of the second one and then store it as the first element sum all these entries and stories are the first element of that resultant matrix and then it will go on to do it for the the second row and the second column however all these things are done in a parallel fashion in a quantum computer let's see how that happens so let's say that we are thinking I'm thinking of a number between one and hundred and say I have thought about a number which is three so the classical computer will keep asking that is the number one is the number two is the number three is the number four and all that and then once it gates gets the answer yes it stops its operations so it's like this the classical computer you keep going one no two no three no and so on so they'll be in such queries by which it will be resolved that actually the number that I have thought about is three however in a quantum computer this is done very differently it's put as the entire you know one 200 is put as a superposition and so there's input that is given to the quantum computer is one plus two plus three plus four and so on and so it will keep doing it no no no and then guess for third then no no no no and for the rest you know ninety-seven entries or 96 entries so this is called as a Grover search algorithm so the quantum computer will find the answer to the query in very lesser number of you know queries as compared to the classical computer so the practical quantum computer applications is that the quantum mechanics simulations in physics in chemistry material science nanotechnology biology medicine computers can simulate millions of variables at once and all are limited today by the slow speed of the quantum mechanical simulation and then there are something called as crypto analysis they kept capable of cracking extremely complicated codes and this RSA encryption as a name goes and typically uses numbers with 200 digits so let's have a brief look at the history and then the main ones in fact so this is the quantum computing history in 1993 Alexandre hallo hallo vu published a paper showing that the qubits can carry more than classical mechanics bits of classical bits of information 1981 richard fineman determines that it's possible to efficiently simulate a evolution of a quantum system on a classical computer 1985 David Deutsch of the University of Oxford described the first universal quantum computer 93 dan Simon at Montreal invented oratory program our problem for which quantum computer would be exponentially faster than the conventional classical computer this algorithm introduced the main ideas which were then developed in Peter Shor's factoring algorithm will give a detailed account of this Shor's algorithm and Shore's problem the factorization problem 1994 Peter shor at AT&T Bell Labs it discovers an algorithm to allow quantum computers to factor large integers quickly Shor's algorithm could theoretically break many of the crypto systems in use today in 1995 sure proposes the first scheme for quantum error correction in 96 Grover which is we mentioned his work and Bell Labs invents a quantum databases search algorithm so that's the Grover search algorithm in 97 David Correy Fahmy Timothy hovel and Gershenfeld an AI Zheng Shuang published the first paper on quantum computing so it's not very old it's about 20 21 years old when the first paper had come out 98 the first working two bit two qubit NMR computer demonstrated at the University of California at Berkeley 99 first working three cubic NMR computer demonstrated at IBM's Almaden Research Center the first execution of Grover's algorithm was achieved in 2000 first working five qubit NMR computer demonstrated as IBM Almaden Research Center in 2001 first working seven qubit NMR computer demonstrated as IBM's again Alban and Research Center and of course these activities are going on it hasn't stopped at 2001 but I have just given a brief history of that how it developed in the initial days so what are the quantum computing problems and the current technology or the 40 qubit operations operating machines needed to rival current the classical equivalent errors are posed by the decoherence there is the tendency of the quantum computer to decay from a given quantum state into an incoherent state as it interacts with the environment interactions are unavoidable and induce breakdown of information stored in the quantum computer resulting in computational errors and error rates are typically proportional to the dish of the operating time to the decoherence time so that's the errors rates or one can estimate errors by that and the operations must be complicated much quicker than the decoherence time so these are some of the problems that are going to come up or that have already come up however there are also efforts to negotiate or mitigate those difficulties and problems so with this I'll end this somewhat popular introduction to the quantum computing however I'll take on the each of the topics or most of the topics in details for a better understanding of the subject you [Music] you
