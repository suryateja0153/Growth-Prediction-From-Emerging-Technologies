 this episode is sponsored by brilliant hey guys Jade here thanks for joining me today to learn about quantum superposition so if you're just starting out on your quantum physics journey a quantum superposition is a really good place to start because it's very fundamental to quantum physics and basically if you don't understand superposition you aren't going to understand anything else about quantum physics before we start I just want to say that I know quantum physics has this really intimidating reputation but really I find that the problem with most people in learning quantum physics is that it's this kind of mental barrier and it's trying to fit the results or the observations of quantum physics into a model of the world that they know and understand and I'm just going to tell you right now that that's that's not gonna work so um so for the next 15 minutes or however long this video ends up being just keep an open mind anything is possible I really think anyone can learn quantum physics it's not hard it's just odd so yeah with that let's get right into it quantum superposition here we go so I thought the best way to do this would be to simply describe the results of an experiment and then talk about what the results mean at the end so say we've got a box of neutrons it can really be any quantum particle but I feel like neutrons are often neglected because they're probably the most boring particle having no charge or anything I'm a middle child and can sympathise with being forgotten so neutrons it's your lucky day now I'm going to steal a beautiful analogy from an MIT professor Alan Adams it absolutely blew me away when I heard it so I want to share it with you guys now saying it's an empirical fact that neutrons have two properties color and shape in the real world this would be analogous to spin but spin is a kind of complicated topic and you really don't need to understand what spin is to understand superposition so just forget the real world for now now neutrons can have two colors blue or green and these a binary meaning it can only be or the other and it's the same with shape they can only be circular or square note curvy turquoise squares allowed now say we want to test whether color and shapes have some kind of correlation or relationships so someone has built two machines that can sort them for us a color machine and a shape machine so when a neutron is fired from the neutron box through the color machine the machine sorts them into blue and green groups so just quickly this ambiguous Wiggly cloud represents that we don't know their shape yet it isn't the actual shape and likewise with the shape machine it sorts them into square and circular groups the machine doesn't in any way change the neutrons just sorts them now the actual mechanisms of the machine don't matter at all it could be a tiny demon inside doing the sorting or it could be magnets and other fancy expensive equipment the point is that these machines have been built and they work nothing described in this experiment has anything to do with the mechanisms inside the machine so you fire some neutrons into the machine and it sorts the blue and the green interestingly we get an exact 50/50 split the same thing happens with the shape machine exactly half the circular and half a square so now to see if there's any relationship between shape and color we combine these machines in a few different ways we test how many blues turn out circular how many greens turn out square how many circles turn out green and how many squares turn out blue we try every combination and find that the answer is always 50/50 it's completely random as far as we can tell there is no correlation between shape and color knowing one tells you nothing about the other okay fine no big deal now I'm gonna do something and just humanely say we send the neutrons through a color books collect the green ones then send them through a shape books collect the secular ones and then send them through a color box again what do you think will be the percentage of blue and green neutrons as they exit the third machine I want you to pause the video and think about it and then vote in the poll that just appeared okay so if you're a reasonable kind of person you probably guess that a hundred percent came out green and zero percent came out blue the first machine sorted the green neutrons out then pass them through the shape machine and then back through the color machine so it makes sense that we'd have gotten all green neutrons here but it's not what happened fifty percent came out green and fifty percent came out blue so this is where the fun begins now remember these machines don't change anything about the neutrons they just measure them so maybe the neutrons can change color on their own then maybe these properties are just ephemeral and they can change at will all right next experiment this one is a bit trickier but not much we have the random neutrons from the box going into a color machine being sorted into blue and green then the green ones are sorted again by a shape machine now these things are mirrors and they don't do anything to the neutrons except change their trajectory so the square neutrons take the upper path and bounce off this mirror and the circular neutrons take the lower path and bounce off this one then they're all recombined at the beam splitter and sort it again by color the beam splitter doesn't do anything except recombine the square and circular neutrons and then send them through the color machine just for clarification let's assume the neutrons are being fired one by one so they're not interacting with each other in any way now think really carefully about this one and cast your votes what percent emerge from the final color machine blue and what percent emerge green feel free to backtrack and take a look at the previous experiments so in the last experiment we unexpectedly got a 50/50 split between the blue and green Neutron we had a color books a shape books and again a color books exactly the same as what we have here so it would be reasonable to guess that we get a 50/50 split again Bowie don't 100% of the neutrons came out green and 0% came out blue so what the hell right remember what we said about keeping an open mind next experiment let's block this lower path here the circular path with a wall so that none of the neutrons can get through furthermore let's make the paths a million miles long so that the neutrons taking the upper path couldn't possibly know what's going on with the neutrons in the lower path of course neutrons aren't sentient or anything like that I'm just using the word no for lack of a better word so with this new added wall let's cast a vote again what percentage of the neutrons will emerge as green and what percentage will emerge as blue again feel free to backtrack I'm very interested to know how you guys vote at this time but I'm just gonna tell you half turned up blue and half turned out green what is going on open mind open mind okay so if you think you've digested all of that let's try and make some sense out of it in the first experiment we sent the green neutrons to be sorted by shape but then when we measured the color again half for blue and half a green so we knew the shape of the neutrons that came out but not the color in the next experiment we introduced a couple of mirrors and a beam splitter we sent green neutrons to be sorted by shape recombined and then sorted again by color and this time 100% came out green and 0% came out blue so what changed well did you notice what the difference was when we introduced the beam splitter the recombination meant that we didn't know whether the neutrons entering the final color machine with square or circular so from our perspective it's kind of the same as if the measurement was never taken so in the end we knew the color but not the shape I'm sensing a pattern here alright then what about the next experiments when we blocked the circular path and sent the green neutrons through the shape machine half came out blue and half came out green these are the same results as our first experiment and from an outside perspective we have the same information because we blocked the circular path we know that one the electrons which passed through the first color machine are green then the ones that make it to the final color machine a square but then when they pass through the final color machine they're not green anymore they're random it seems like we're not allowed to know both the color and shape of the neutrons at the same time but what does that mean not allowed to know like it's not like neutrons have something detter against humans and a playing some big practical joke and even if they were this path is a million miles long how did the neutrons taking the square path know that there was a wall blocking the circular path so let's try to explain this experiment let's focus in on the second one where one hundred percent came out green what did the neutron do in this barrier of mystery here well there are really only four options that make sense one it went along the square path but when we blocked off the circular path with a wall we know it took the square path but we got that half the neutrons with green and half for blue so we know that's not it - it took the circular path but we could just use the same argument switched around so we know that's not it either three it took both paths maybe the neutron is sneaky and split in two or duplicated itself or something but if we place a detector along both paths we find that only one Neutron is ever detected so that's not it for the neutron took neither paths well if we put a wall in the way of both paths we find that no neutrons come out so that's not it either but there is a fifth option and that's just that the neutron is doing something that we can't on and if not taking the square path it's not taking the circular path it's not taking both and it's not taking neither it's doing something entirely different and the word we use to describe this behavior is super position the neutron was in a superposition of being square and circular at the same time we can't know both the shape and the color but it's actually deeper than that the neutron doesn't have a shape and a color at the same time having a definite shape means not having a definite color to talk about the shape and color at the same time doesn't mean anything measuring the shape resets the color and vice versa there is something fundamentally unpredictable about physical objects quantum superposition ladies and gentlemen this experiment has been repeated many times with different particles neutrons electrons protons photons bucky balls and it always turns out the same the original experiment was done with the spin of silver atoms and it's called the stern-gerlach experiment named after its creators otto stern and walter Gerlach if you are interested in learning more about the weird and wonderful world of quantum mechanics brilliant Borg has an entire course dedicated to quantum physics starting off with a detailed description of the stern-gerlach experiment including all the physics behind it as well as the notation used to describe spin probabilities called bra ket notation it includes interactive step-by-step quizzes so you can learn at your own pace and check your understanding at every step the course also covers the math used for quantum physics and takes you all the way to Schrodinger's equation and something I absolutely cannot wait for is the quiz on quantum entanglement coming soon not to mention all the other courses included on the website mainly about math physics and computer science the first 200 people to click the link below and sign up will get a 20% discount just go to brilliant dot org slash up and atom the link is on screen and in the description so I hope you guys were able to understand a bit more about quantum superposition from video if it still feels pretty fuzzy don't worry quantum physics take some time to settle in and you have to remember that we didn't evolve to understand these kinds of concepts back when we were cavemen and women we were thinking about how fast we have to run away from Tigers and the trajectory of throwing a spear we had no use for knowing how quantum particles worked so it's not surprising that we have a hard time understanding it and a hard time forming an intuition understanding quantum physics is going to take some brain rewiring and that's going to take some time but just keep trying and stay optimistic and I promise you one day this stuff will kind of start making sense I've laid Allen Adams MIT lecture down in the description I would strongly recommend us anyone looking to learn more about this topic it's pretty easy to follow and his enthusiasm is just contagious so with that I'm gonna end the video good luck on your quantum physics journey I do hope you pursue it I will be doing more quantum physics videos on my channel so if that sounds good to you then subscribe and I'll see you in the next one bye [Music]
