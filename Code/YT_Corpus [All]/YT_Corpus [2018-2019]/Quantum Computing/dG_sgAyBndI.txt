 I kind of think of like, Schrödinger's cat,  but the the cats inside a computer I guess it kind of sounds like something from a James Bond film, like something with a lot of ice Computing, like software design or something like that? Umm, is it kinda like quantum physics in space, but in a computer? it's to the number of atoms to the power of 2 I've just googled it, so.. according to Wikipedia, quantum computing is a quantum mechanical phenomenon so ahhh yeah, I know everything now. Okay, let me have a go at it. A quantum computer is a machine that processes quantum information. So what is quantum information?  So imagine we have particles like electrons or photons or atoms, even tiny superconducting circuits they behave quantum mechanically, which means in contrast to the way a normal computer would store information, which is through a bit which can be 0 or 1 these objects actually can be 0 and 1 at the same time. now AND is not a very good descriptor, but it'll do for now. When we have many of these qubits we are essentially describing binary strings existing in a way all at once. and these are in these complicated entangled states so when a quantum computer computes and runs an algorithm it's actually manipulating the interactions between these quantum objects, between the qubits in such a way that the probability of measuring a particular binary string at the end of the calculation is amplified to be that which is the answer to your problem. Now if all of that is a little bit spooky don't worry, anybody who claims to understand quantum mechanics actually hasn't understood the first thing about it.
