 integrative medicine based on quantum physics quantum physics explains the nature and behavior of matter and energy on the atomic and subatomic level it explains from the smallest particle how the entire universe works these scientific discoveries fundamentally change how we perceive our entire reality from the fastest computers in the world to your everyday grocery store scanner the application of quantum physics is at the leading edge of modern technology today the language of quantum physics helps us to better understand integrative medicine various alternative healing modalities from both ancient and modern medical traditions become as logical elegant and satisfying as the interpretation of quantum physics itself quantum physics proposes consciousness as the fabric of reality it is a model for a deeper understanding of the universe and consequently the art of healing with an in-depth knowledge of the gifts of quantum physics to medicine we are better equipped to prevent disease and promote optimal health for every human being in the world one of the great challenges within the current model of medicine is to break free of the traditional linear ways of thinking doctors and medical schools continue to use Newtonian physics perpetuating a materialistic approach to healing quantum University has stepped into a new paradigm using the principles of quantum physics to explain how healing takes place our education is transformed by a vision of achieving full potentiality for health and an expanded understanding of our reality the field and consciousness itself merging quantum physics with various modalities of Integrative Medicine creates solutions that address imbalances in the body mind and spirit to achieve optimal health students and graduates gain a better understanding of health and disease and how the body mind and subtle energies all need to be addressed for optimal healing quantum University brings world-class educators and leaders together to create an innovative unique curriculum dr. Paul drouin MD founder and professor of Integrative Medicine says my objective in creating quantum University was to add the missing pieces of the puzzle of how healing occurs teaching integrated medicine based on quantum physics is our role at quantum University creating the future model of Medicine one student at a time join us
