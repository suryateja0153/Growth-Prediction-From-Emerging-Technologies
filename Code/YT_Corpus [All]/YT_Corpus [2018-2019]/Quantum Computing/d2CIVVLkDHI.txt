 [Introductory music] We started working in this field three years ago, within QuTech and at that time most of the people working there were physicists, and they were working on building different qubits based on different technologies, and at some point they realized that if they wanted to build a computer, they needed engineers. Because, as you may know, building a quantum computer is not only about building technology or building the quantum processors, but also about developing an entire quantum computer architecture. Our work focuses on the high-level layers, let's say quantum compilers, quantum applications or algorithms, quantum instruction-set architecture, and micro-architecture.
