 hello and thank you all for coming here my name is r D'Amico chintz key and i'm a researcher at the Santa Fe Institute before proceeding I would like to thank our sponsors first and foremost we want to thank Thornburg investment management for generously underwriting SF ice community lecture series without their funding these lectures would not be possible we also want to thank the lensing Performing Arts Center for allowing us to host these lectures in this beautiful space lastly we want to thank Enterprise Holdings foundation for their recent renewed support in today's lecture we will hear from dr. chris monroe dr. Monroe is a leading atomic physicist and quantum information scientist she received his undergraduate degree in physics from MIT his PhD in physics from the University of Colorado Boulder he then did postdoctoral work and worked as a resident researcher at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and while working there in the mid 90s he demonstrated the first quantum logic gate an essential component of quantum computers chris is currently distinguished University professor at the University of Maryland in College Park he is a member of the joint quantum Institute in the center for quantum information and computer science among various other awards chris is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences beyond that today learned that chris is also percussionist in the Columbia Symphony Orchestra in Columbia Maryland and he has even manufactured some instruments for this Orchestra such as a machine that makes wind noises and is now in his garage this talk is part of the SFI community lecture series this series allows researchers both from the Institute and from afar to share their ideas and cutting-edge research with a broad public today's talk connects with several recent community lectures which concern fundament questions in physics and computation this includes past events such as an interdisciplinary panel on the nature of time with Sean Carroll James hurdle and David Krakauer a lecture by dr. Sabine Hassan Felder which considered the relationship between aesthetics and the search for fundamental physical laws and not least the most recent lectures bio suffice own Chris Moore on the limits of computers in science and society which was a wonderful introduction to the ideas behind the theory of computation and the growing impact of computing and machine learning on society and before proceeding I'd like to tell you that the next lecture in this series which will be the last one of the season will take place on November 13th it will be Michelle Gervin who will talk about predicting chaos with machine learning which is another fascinating topic on the frontier of computer science so today's lecture will be about quantum computers which are computers which operate according to the principles of quantum physics quantum computation is one of the most exciting and active and may be hyped research fields in physics and in computer science and at the same time the development of large-scale quantum computers may hold the potential to revolutionize technology science and society apart from the applications in my opinion it is one of the most intellectually exciting areas in contemporary science because understanding the relationship between physics and computation involves far more than the simple application of physical knowledge to engineering problems rather we increasingly see information and computation essential principles that underlie much of the structure of statistical physics and quantum physics for this reason understanding the relationship between computation and physics is as much about design designing the next generation of computers as it is about understanding the fundamental nature of reality so with that please join me in welcoming dr. Chris Monroe okay thank thank you you guys thank you so much it's lovely to be here one of my favorite places in the world and thank you for the kind introduction it gets us started right off being Santa Fe I thought I would start I have I have lots of pretty pictures not too many equations the topic is indeed quantum computers so we're gonna have to delve into what we're gonna have to delve into quantum physics which has a sort of mystical following and I'll tell you right off that you're not gonna leave today understanding any more about quantum physics than you had before on the other hand I hope you're gonna leave with with the knowledge that you don't need to and that's maybe the point here another way to say it is that is that a line Stein didn't believe in it and so we're in we're in good company if we don't believe in it either it's not about believing it's it's a very interesting theory but it does call into question what what is science and you know and what is what is religion in a sense for quantum physics calls us to basically define what reality is which is very strange and so I'm a working experimental physicist likes to work on cars and build things and to come up against such very high-level philosophical thoughts is interesting to say the least but I'm of the opinion that I used the theory because it works very well and maybe you'll indulge me in this story about how this strange theory might play a role in our ability to compute this is a painting one of my former students gave to me about 15 years ago Boris Bleen office and he's at Washington Seattle now and at the time so I'm an atomic physicist I work with individual atoms and we that they're wonderful test beds for for quantum physics experiments including quantum computing and at the time Boris worked in our laboratory we were we were playing around with individual cadmium atoms why cadmium because they had certain features that were amenable to what we wanted to do and if you're in oil Pina you know that that the bright yellow pigment in oil paints is cadmium it's called cadmium yellow so he he he painted this for me and I he didn't want to interpret it but he is as being too cadmium atoms and they're entangled and I'll talk a little later about what entanglement means but that's what this stuff is it's sort of the fabric of space it's and I don't mean to sound mystical but entanglement is rather mystical you can lose your mind thinking about it too much so that's that's a painting of two cadmium atoms in and at the end of the lecture I'll talk a little bit about how individual atoms might play a role in the next next generation computers to do certain tasks so following our exhaustive introduction into the topic of computing and information as a physicist I've found that this topic is is is great fun because we don't usually think about physics and information is necessarily mixing but in every case when you think of information what it is how you store information it is physical it could be a switch that's in the on or off position we tend to think of bits information unit of information has two states 0 and 1 you can store you can use other bases if you would like but 0 and 1 are sufficient so we tend to use that it could be an electrical current going one way or the other way on/off anything that can be in two states can act as a bit and store information magnetic storage it we're the the direction of a small magnet whether it's pointing up or down well information is physical and all of the computers that we've had since the beginning of computation which is a long time ago have been based on physical principles this is a picture many of you who've probably seen the first digital computer in this country is called ENIAC was developed in the mid twentieth century it was used for the defense industry to calculate missile trajectories and so forth but this machine is pretty on wieldy it it was composed of vacuum tubes these were the switching elements that would that would store zeros and ones now what's interesting is a computer when you use computers you don't really think of what's inside of them and that's the beauty of information theory it doesn't matter what's inside as long as they obey certain certain types of rules whether they store electrical currents or magnetic little magnetic domains in a hard drive for instance or even optical discs they store little pits that can reflect light in two different two different ways so there is a beautiful picture in the in the advertisement for this talk that of this this picture here this is the first solid-state transistor and it's interesting 1947 it was right after ENIAC was unveiled it's a radically different type of a medium and in fact it doesn't look very doesn't look very stable this is this dark piece of glass it looks like glass it's actually called germanium it's a semiconductor it doesn't really conduct very well unless you do something to it and what what they're doing to this there's a piece of glass with a little gold film and it's pressed against the germanium and when you when you apply a signal on this gold the germanium conducts current very well when you turn that signal off it doesn't conduct so it's a it's an electronically controlled electronic switch it doesn't look like the basis of all computation and in over the last six years but it is the solid-state transistor because it's solid-state and not a bulky vacuum tube it could be it could be shrunk down in size down to really tiny dimensions and that I wish we could talk more about the the beautiful work that has taken this big unwieldy mess into little tiny transistor elements that are part of modern computers these days so you've probably heard of Moore's Law Gordon Moore was the founder of Intel and and back in the day in the 50s and 60s he and and and others aimed to to engineer this system so it would work well well it worked very well they got they were able to make them really small and over the course of time this Moore's law represents the growth in the number of transistors the number of these things on a single chip over the course of the last few decades this is a this is an exponential growth every every decade we get about a factor of 10 more transistors in nowadays this is even little outdated nowadays were at 10 billion transistors in a chip if a few you know inch or two on a side well it's interesting I'm talking about Moore's law this isn't there's really nothing to do with quantum quantum physics you might argue there is some quantum physics happening right at this little interface but it's not really needed to understand the basic principles here but this is going to Moore's law because it's ending is going to indeed motivate the use of quantum physics for a new mode of computing well why is it ending actually it's pretty simple the transistor is getting so small that if I if we follow this line for another couple of decades each transistor will be the size of an atom and at that point there's no more making it smaller unless you want to split the atom inside your computer and I don't think that's gonna that's gonna happen that takes a lot of energy so Moore's law in fact this laptop I bought actually I just bought last year but the laptop out but before this three years ago was about as powerful the batteries are better the display is better but the computing prowess of processors is already showing signs of saturating you probably recognize that yourself so what are we going to do I mean Moore's law you could argue this exponential growth was the engine behind the information air behind the economy in the last 50 60 70 years what are we gonna do well let's talk about quantum mechanics because in fact why Moore's law is ending and is in a sense because matter is granular and we have to confront dealing with individual atoms as circuit elements so I'm going to quote Richard Fineman who has a proud history in this area of the country of course during World War two he's also one of the father figures of quantum physics and he had a speech a long time ago called there's plenty of room at the bottom and he it's a it's a three or four page lecture it's just wonderful and there's gems everywhere but my favorite paragraph is right here and he's I think he's stimulated by these solid-state devices that can be made really small and he says well when you make things really small we get down to the size of individual atoms there's a completely new opportunity for design why well when you get down to single atoms when when you get down to the very simple granular part of matter that system obeys a new law of physics it's not really a new law but it's its laws emerge that are different than then then what we use for baseballs and and things that we see in everyday life those are the laws of quantum mechanics now Fineman didn't know what these opportunities would be but he he was a visionary and this is so long ago it took many decades for us to find what those opportunities are and I think the the verdict is in that that opportunity is quantum computing so I want to talk about that to do that we have to talk about quantum physics though I'm going to try to teach you quantum physics in about five minutes and and you shouldn't laugh because the the precepts of quantum physics are very simple there's the problem is that there's two of them and you can't derive one from the other now in physics we like to think of ourselves as the king of science so we have to have one law the very top everything derives from that law even if it's very hard to to actually do that to derive how a baseball will fly through the air based on particle physics we're comfortable in the fact that a baseball is made of particles we could do that if we had to so the principle at the very top there's the standard model or in Newtonian physics force equals mass times acceleration you can derive almost everything indeed everything in classical mechanics using that very simple law well the problem with quantum mechanics and this is why physicists hate it is that there are two laws there's like two peaks and you can't get from one to the other there are two separate rules but once you accept those two rules or you're comfortable using them everything's okay just it's it's more of a sociological thing I think well why people are afraid of quantum physics so there are two rules of quantum physics and I would say these are they going to give this opportunity that Fineman preface long time ago what are they the golden rules of quantum mechanics there's two of them the first one you've probably heard this is that everything is a wave well quantum physics is it quantum mechanics is a wave theory we're familiar with lots of wave theories mechanical waves sound waves water waves and we understand that a wave is sort of an oscillation that travels in space but also in time if you if you take a picture of an of a wave like if you take a picture of water waves you'll see sort of a ripple but if you also stay at a particular point on the surface of the ocean the water will also ripple up and down in time and space and there are differential equations to describe waves they can get nasty but that math doesn't necessarily help you understand everything just the concept of a wave we know it when we see it so one of the properties of waves that we're very comfortable with is that they can be in super positions when you play two notes on a piano your ear can experience both of those sound waves at the same time no problem and your brain can resolve those tones in general water waves can have many different can be very complicated and you can see many different structures on the surface of the ocean for instance so the idea when you throw when you throw a rock into a pond we we know that we'll have these circular waves emanating from this from the core where is the wave well it's everywhere it's delocalized is this technical term so waves can be in superposition now I'm going to apply this to information remember bit these zero or one well if we apply it to information we should if we're going to say everything's a wave well we can have information in wave form we can have both zero and one at the same time so this is a little jargon and I don't want to avoid the jargon of quantum mechanics is if you ever see that line and a little bracket next to it that means this is this is a quantum thing it's a quantum state we use that all the time and this is what we might call a qubit a quantum bit it's a superposition of something that can be in one state and another state and I've chosen 0 and 1 just as labels you can call it up and down left and right heads or tails doesn't matter and the plus sign is not your usual plus sign it means that there's they're both there together you can't just add these like like arithmetic they're both there like maybe one one note on a piano and another note on a piano and these parameters a and B are the waiting's of how much 1 in how much 0 there are it could be 50 50 or 90/10 so this is the simplest superposition we can have just of to two levels now here's a pick a depiction of a pretty poor depiction of an atom that has one electron on it orbiting the core that one electron is in two orbits at the same time and atoms can do that because the electrons are waves and we have to take it a little bit of a leap that that matter can behave as a wave but we should be comfortable with the idea of this wave-like phenomenon now here's where the math comes in but again don't be bogged down by the math a and B follow a wave equation called the Schrodinger wave equation I'm not going to talk about it at all it can get very messy but all waves have equations it doesn't have to be just quantum this is no more complicated than water waves yeah so there's math behind a and B and you can change the waiting's a and B if you if you poke the system just right and I'm talking about water waves a lot this is of course if the the famous Great Wave off Kanagawa painting this great wave and we all know what's going to happen to these poor folks in that boat they're the mathematics behind this wave it's very complicated I would say it's even more complicated the quantum wave and you know I don't even know how to solemn know exactly what these all mean I think they have to do with viscosity and what the waves going to do over space and time that math doesn't give us any more insight in this wave at least not me I know what's gonna happen I think we all know what's going to happen when waves come into the shore at the beach the the water gets shallower and the waves actually get higher and they get slower we just you just understand that we don't need a wave equation understand that so that's that's my advice you don't get bothered by the math okay that was rule number one I spent a little too long on it but what about rule number two what does it mean to have a superposition well a quantum superposition means that the the existence of something is in two states at the same time this Cup in principle if it's quantum it can be in two places at the same time that's okay according to quantum mechanics but it's not okay according to real-world experience so we have to invent another rule and this is what drives people crazy is that we have this other rule and this is a little bit of a joke the way I state it but the rule number two says yeah that superposition stuff's fine as long as you don't look and so it this cut nothing wrong with a cut being in two places we don't experience it but it only works if you don't look at it but actually that if you think about quantum mechanics from that perspective you can go a long way and I'm going to define what it means to look and I'm not going to define consciousness either believe it or not because looking at something doesn't have to involve a living body let me let me explain what I mean there what happens when you do look and of course if we're gonna build a computer based on these bits we're gonna want to measure the answer we have to look so what happens when we look at a quantum superposition well that's where the waiting's play a role because when we do look the system randomly pops into one or the other definite state with a probability attached to it and the probability is given by a and B it's not exactly a and B but you can think of it that way so if we have a 50-50 superposition than half the we're going to see zero half the time we're gonna see one and if we repeat it over and over again it's like flipping a coin it's going to be random and noisy this should really bother you this rule number two by the way this is it that's quantum physics done I think I took like seven or eight minutes sorry but this rule number two is very strange I think of it as being strange on two accounts number one it appears that by looking at something you change it and that's that's a totally foreign concept to all of science we expect if there's an experiment running it's going to do the same thing whether we look or not but quantum physics says that by extracting information that's a little more technical but by looking at a system it appears to change it another way to think of this rule number two is weird is that where did the probabilities come from anyway what are probabilities well you all know what probabilities are we use them all the time when we're ignorant when we're ignorant of something or we don't want we're too lazy to characterize everything we don't want to calculate the trajectory of every molecule on the air to predict the weather in principle some would argue we can't anyway but I think in principle we could it might be a chaotic system and my maryland colleague michelle Gervin will tell you more about that next month about chaos but probabilities like flipping a coin I could calculate the results of any coin toss if I know precisely how hard I toss it precisely the value of gravity and so forth humidity temperature all that stuff but I don't want to lazy I'm ignorant so we use probabilities we're comfortable using we're not going to quantum physics is the only theory in all of nature where we can't do that we have to use probabilities and that's weird whenever probabilities are there you want to wonder well who's cooking the books who decides in a measurement what what you get it's a good question and it's really why Einstein didn't believe in this theory you know many as famous lines one of them God does not play dice so there's something in the background that seems to be playing dice here so what about consciousness what about looking eye when you look what if there's no human or no consciousness to observe something well we have an answer for that too or at least we we we think of things in a very funny way in in quantum superpositions remember my cup in two places well let's say I have that cup in two places but that's tricky because now the air in the room has to has to reorganize itself depending on where the cup is if the cups over here there's definitely no air where the cup is is the cups there and there's air over here but if the cups over here there reverses through so the air has to sort of get involved well let's get rid of the air pump out all the air and let's say there's one air molecule one nitrogen molecule it's zipping on the stage here and it's going to hit this Cup only when it's here but if the cups here it's going to go right through well if the cups here the the air the nitrogen molecule is going to bounce off this cup say and hit that wall but if the cups here the air is gonna go straight through so the air that molecule has to make a decision but it doesn't have a consciousness it doesn't have a free will we don't think it's just it's just a nitrogen molecule so what how do we deal with this well if we made the trouble of having this Cup in two places we can add one more molecule to the system so let's have the molecule also being in a superposition of going that way correlated with the cup here and going that way correlator the cup here but we're not done because this molecule hits that wall and that wall so now the the walls are part of the system yeah invite them they're part the whole building shakes one way and the other way the building yes come on we're all here well the earth moves one way or the other so you see the problem is these super positions tend to blow up and we have to like predicting the weather we have to know the state of everything in the universe and in practice we can't do that so what we do and here's how we deal with it we box up this cup and we say it's perfectly isolated and nobody's looking there's no light there's no air there's no information as to where this cup is leaking out so you can see right away there's there's a there's a very deep connection between quantum measurement and information so maybe no surprise it should be used for computing but it's such a fun topic you've probably heard of Schrodinger's cat which is another of the of the rebellions against quantum physics back in 1935 Schrodinger made up this this he even called it a ridiculous case of what quantum might predict here we have a single atom and the way he posed it it's a radioactive atom and if you wait one half-life of the radioactive atom it's in a superposition of having decayed and having not decayed that's how we treat the single atom quantum mechanically a radioactive one well he hooks a single atom up to a Geiger counter that's perfect it registers a click if it decays and that Geiger counters hooked to a hammer that smashes a flask of poison cyanide and so there's a cat in the box by the way and the cat therefore is both alive and dead at the same time and he says quite ridiculous case it is ridiculous because we don't I mean a cat has lots of atoms that's 10 to the 22 atoms in there and we it's very hard to think of a cat as a quantum system it's too many too much stuff there so it's very hard to apply just like just like the air hitting the walls and the building getting involved it's very hard to isolate such a big system and when I look at this thought experiment Schrodinger's cat you know the hardest part of the experiment it's not the or the Geiger counter over the cat it's actually the box if you have to isolate it from everything so it brings you know there's lots of thought experiments like that and we can if we ascribe quantum mechanics to the system we have an atom that's in one state correlated with the cat alive and it's in the other state cat's dead this I'm gonna comment a little more on this kind of a quantum state it's just a superposition of two situations it's also called entangled and I'll get to that in a minute so here you can sort of go off the deep end and in quantum physics there are lots of interpretations as to what really happens the problem with interpretations is that they all predict the same answer in any conceivable experiment so the differences between interpretations to me is not necessarily science it's very interesting I love reading about those here's one interpretation you've probably heard of this and it's a very neat one it says that that rule number two remember that that when you measure you get one or the other well let's just say the universe bifurcates at that point and if we say that everything is neatly tied up because we only see a definite answer in our universe and our alter ego sees the other the other answer in the other universe so I guess that works that works for some people to me it to me it has a big expense because now we have to think about all these universes and there's not just two of them there's a gazillion universes every time a quantum system gets resolved how to keep track of that until we can travel between those universes it's very hard to think of this as a as a I don't know how to test this so it's hard to call it science but some people say well it's the only thing it did buy it you know if you eliminate a huh if you eliminate everything else that's the only thing that makes sense Einstein in the same year 1935 hit this title his papers are wonderful a very very easy to read them his title here is basically his quantum mechanics even right it seems like somebody's cooking the books there's other stuff going on and he for the first time introduced the idea of an entangled state what does that mean well here now we have two qubits this is the simplest version of an entangled State two qubits a red one and a blue one and they're prepared you can think of two coins if you want both heads and both tails so it's a superposition if we're going to allow super positions this is not a big deal here right we're allowing a superposition of these two situations what's interesting about this particular superposition is that the red of the blue system are different they're separate in fact they can be spatially separated they can be you can take the red one on the moon if you want and leave the blue one here and what's neat there is that if if I look at the blue one here on earth whatever I measure I know exactly what the one on the moon has if I measure is zero remember this is a 50-50 superposition if I measure zero I know that the moon qubit is also zero and what bothered Einstein in particular is that I know that information faster than light could could have beamed the information to me so that's strange he called it another one of his famous quotes he called it spooky action at a distance and therefore it must be wrong there must be something going on it turns out I think his heart was in the right place it's just super weird but quantum mechanics as far as we know it's correct we can make entangled States and make measurements on them faster than information could be communicated the trick is there if you think about this from information theory point of view and information theory was not really invented until the early 40s the resolution of this so-called EPR einstein-podolsky-rosen paradox is that if you do this many times and you should imagine I have a bunch of coin numbered and you have a bunch of coins numbered and they're all entangled they're all the same value but each one of them is random if we repeat it we're just gonna get random numbers I'm not going to learn any information that you could encode in your system by measuring mine all I know is I have the same random bit you do and random bit streams contain no information so the resolution of EPR paradox from information theory actually so it doesn't violate any physics principles this idea of entangling but it's still kind of cool there's some kind of a connection between these qubits I think of a tangle man as wires without wires wiring without wires and these correlations as will maybe get a hint at their behind all the power of quantum computing ok so there's only one analogy I know of entanglement and it's based on a visual illusion and so let me just go through that quickly so you all gone through the exercise of trying to draw a cube on 2d surface on a chalkboard in fact I've drawn this incorrectly I've drawn this so all the lines are exactly parallel so it has ambiguous perspective where's the front face is it this one or is it that one is it up and to the right or down to the left that's a little like a superposition you can sort of see it flipping back and forth it has both but then when you sort of lock on to one perspective it stays that way that's sort of like a measurement and the beauty of this there here the two definite perspectives of course the beauty of this this analogy is it works for entanglement here are two qubits both zeros and both ones and I'll bet you when you resolve the perspective they're the same you can try to trick it but it's very hard to do that it's only an analogy but the fact that these two sort of shimmer back and forth together is the essence of entanglement and they're connected even though they're not connected they're connected by our consciousness I guess but it's a little bit like the mystery of entanglement and there are the two definite perspectives and unfortunately this analogy falls apart when you get them too far apart now because they're too far apart the visual illusion disappears okay so I want to talk to her a few minutes on what a quantum computer is well it's a collection of qubits clearly we're going to be storing we're going to be storing superpositions of numbers and so there's a few numbers on this next slide but the high level is pretty clear we're going to put a lot of qubits together and see what happens and I think of it as a good news bad news good news story and the last piece of good news is only recent the last decade or two the last couple of decades what's the good news well when we put lots of qubits together the system sort of blows up exponentially why because one qubit can store two values you're on one two qubits can store four values right heads heads heads tails tails heads tails tails three qubits can store eight numbers and qubits can store two to the N binary numbers all right so this is an illustration of three qubits and we have eight numbers and the shading of grey tells you sort of how much zero there is how much to there is how much seven there is and so forth so this is really good news because you can do parallel processing in a way that you only have one input but the input has all the numbers at the same time as long as you don't look that's it so you have to compute this function in the dark no information leaking out and so forth but in principle we can do that and we can get all these answers here's a quantum state of three qubits it has eight wait waiting's and they should all add up to one because the probabilities have to add up well eight is not very big so three qubits is a pretty small system but if I put four cubits in here we get sixteen five qubits is 32 so we have exponential growth if we put three hundred qubits together that's two to the three hundred states we can represent and I picked that number because it's huge it's more than the number of atoms in the universe so even if every atom in the universe is part of a regular PC like this or some conventional computer it wouldn't have enough space to store information merely in three hundred atoms or three hundred electrons in a quantum computer so this is the really good news it's explosive good news this exponential growth we're tempted to say well there's a solution to Moore's law we have this exponential growth well what's the bad news we have to look at it we have to measure the quantum computer and when you when you make a measurement you only one answer you could have two to the three had 10 to the 90 inputs you only get one answer and it's random it's totally noisy so it's almost like it's really bad news it's devastating news because it seems like there's nothing good that can come from this you don't know what the output was because it's probabilistic you have to reverse the function to find out what input corresponding to that output so why not just run it serially with every one of the inputs so at first glance that doesn't seem to be anything to be gained here but at second glance and this took 30 or 40 years after fineman's original observation of this quantum opportunity David Deutsch a computer scientist physicist mathematician at Oxford pointed out that well before you make a measurement you can take all of these inputs all these qubits they're maybe two to the three hundred of them sorry two to the three hundred pieces of information you can have them interfere in superposition that's another wave-like phenomenon interference well if these if if these this is sort of be sort of like time now I feel left to right and these red dots they're called quantum gates just like in classical computing we combine information in ways to do computation we can do that with quantum gates in quantum states as well there are some algorithms where if you allow them to interfere in just the right way only one answer appears at the end or just a few answers before you measure and so now that that answer can in some cases depend on all of these inputs and that's something you could never do with conventional computers if the inputs are sufficiently large and now when you make a measurement there's rule number two is no problem now when you make a measurement there's only one answer you're going to get and it can depend on all the inputs in an important way I'm being kind of vague here because quantum computers are not a panacea they're not they won't solve every problem this is a so-called one to one problem where every input gives a unique output cronic computers are bad for that for the obvious reason that as I said this bad news will kill you but there are problems that are not one-to-one where some output depends on lots of inputs and in in the mid-90s a killer application emerged that really gave birth to this field as we know today and it's a actually a simple recipe in in in number theory factoring factoring numbers 39 is 3 times 13 that's easy it's a small number but when you make the number big that you want to factor into its primes it becomes exponentially hard there's no known fast algorithm to factor big numbers so with with a thousand digits you just can't factor it now factoring seems sort of esoteric except the inability to factor big numbers is the basis of all modern encryption standards so if you can factor big numbers you can break codes and there are lots of three-letter agencies that want to do that well actually it's interesting they they not just want to break codes they want to know can somebody else break our codes when will a quantum computer exist it's powerful enough to factor and well the good news in a sense is that I think we're at a conversation last night with my sister who is a computer scientist at Los Alamos here in Santa Fe and she said well it's always 20 years away 20 years away all the time well factoring is a really hard problem you need millions of qubits billions of operations isn't it and as I'll tell you in a little bit the state of the art now is dozens and hundreds not millions and billions so we're a long way away but the way factoring works is if you imagine we want to factor the number 39 well we store all of those numbers at the same time and how would you factor classically one not so efficient way is to test every number smaller than smaller than you don't have to go above the square root of 39 but every numbers smaller than a number just test and see if it divides it it's trial and error and of course if this this number has a hundred digits then you have to test 10 to the 100 numbers and you're out of luck but we can store a superposition of all these numbers in a quantum computer again and here's where it's sort of the magic happens we can we can apply quantum gates in the system so that the quantum state ends up being this it sort of gets forced into the answer and that number 39 encoded in this particular pattern of these gates and that's the art of quantum computing algorithms and again this is a killer application it's a big deal because it's it's it's it's a fast algorithm on a quantum computer exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm so there there are some other applications that over the last few years have come to light and I'm going to be very vague here they have to do with optimization any kind of problem where the answer depends on all the inputs is something that quantum may be good at this is a very spiky function you can think of it as a topographical map or something what's the minimum value of this function as a function of these two variables well it's clearly right here you can see that but what if we have what if we have 10,000 variables we very hard to plot that since we only have three dimensions so what's the minimum value of a function that has lots of inputs well you have to test every one of them and that's a hard problem well the minimum is a global property of all the inputs and there are quantum computer algorithms that might allow us to approximate where that minimum value is and this is going to hit this could hit all kinds of different walks of life any kind of optimization problem there is there are people thinking about how to apply quantum computers to it that said it's a very speculative game it's not clear how how well quantum computers will do in these problems one of my favorites is a well known problem called the Traveling Salesman problem if you specify a bunch of cities on a map what's the what's the path that hits every city once and only once and covers the minimum distance that's a really hard problem classically in fact it's exponentially hard with the number of cities quantum mechanically it looks like a quantum computer might not be able to solve it either but it might get a better approximation than a classical algorithm could and this is sort of where a lot of the field is right now this is an article just a couple months ago on the Wall Street Journal it's nothing about quantum it's about models for instance autonomous driving we have models of how cars can recognize certain things on the road solving some of those models are really difficult and that's I think maybe where quantum will play play play a role so I want I want to close by actually you know I haven't talked anything about experiment and I'm an experimentalist and I've given you sort of an exotic platform for computing and remember that a quantum system to be to to work as a quantum computer has to be isolated to an extreme level and then when you're ready to measure you need to look in there so we have to have very controllable hardware to do this and it's really exotic stuff there exist a few different types of systems that can be built now for quantum computers and in fact two platforms in particular they're very exotic they're being built right now one is superconducting circuits and I think of this as sort of a coil of wire where the current flows without resistance so it flows forever yeah without bumping into any material it's a fascinating physics phenomena phenomenon that was discovered a long time ago super conductivity you've heard the terms well in this case we can run currents in two directions at the same time and nobody's looking and you know even the matter in the wire is not looking because the the the electricity flows without resistance so that's an interesting platform to store a qubit and you can physically wire these things up this is actually five cubits this is an IBM chip here where they wire five superconducting qubits and there's lots of investment in this area from big companies that you've heard of to build quantum computers out of this there's another platform that is really sticking out as well this is even more exotic and this is the one I work with it's individual atoms and the strength of individual atoms is that they're all the same they're given to us they're all the same same element same isotope so we can scale up in a way that you could never do if you have manmade manmade qubits and so this is a picture of one of our devices this is a chip it's a silicon chip by a centimeter on the side there's nothing quantum about this chip what's quantum is the floating atoms above the chip in fact I've expanded it by maybe a factor of 50 these atoms sit right here above the surface about 1/10 of a millimeter above that surface and here you can see there are 75 atoms in that chain each dot is a single atom they're all the same and the reason you can see them is that we're shining laser light on them and that laser is tuned to a particular wavelength that this particular atom will respond to if you don't know what the atom is it's you terbium YB it really doesn't matter so much that that determines the lasers we're going to use and so forth they're separated by a few microns a few millionths of a meter these are ions they're charged and that's why they repel each other and step and and form this crystal it's anatomically perfect crystal and each atom is a qubit why can you see single atoms well because this is in a vacuum there's nothing there there's nothing else there of course you can see things if there's no noise so these atoms behave as wonderful qubits quantum bits and we can we can actually shine lasers on them to to to perform quantum computations and this little animation will kind of show you about that so this is just a collection of five atoms we initialize them using other lasers and we're gonna poke lasers at these individual atoms you should think of them as like masses connected by Springs and when we when we when we poke them with lasers they move around a little bit and that causes them to be coupled that's how we wire together two atoms and this is actually a quantum computation a circuit here and we point lasers at the atoms I won't go into details don't have time to do that but in the end we do a chronic computation based on those gates and then we measure them all if it's in one state they fluoresce if it's in another state they're dark and we collect that light on detectors so this is a very simplified version of what we do and here's again that picture of these individual atoms and these individual atoms are on top of that chip and I didn't show you the best part this chip has about 100 electrodes and we have controllers and lasers and the chip is right in there now all the action is here this is all support but this is the this I don't want to say it's noisy we think about it but that that sorry one a little too fast in that little cubic meter is where all the action happens and we even have visions to scale up those those boxes by using optical fibers again this is this is lurching into the science fiction area of my research but we have working prototypes that work with small numbers of qubits and this is what you have to think of course when you see that system we're at the level where the things are really really complicated still and and you know these systems are very hard to maintain but nobody's tried yet to engineer these individual atoms and we're trying to do that both that in my university research group and also our small company inq I'm happy to say you may have noticed on a slide I said before Honeywell Corporation is also investing a lot in this this this interesting platform but it's pretty exotic and there are other platforms that are more researching now anything that sort of shows quantum coherence individual atoms individual electrons if you can isolate them there's an interesting defect in diamond that makes Diamond turn red when there's a vacancy of the carbon atom and next door there's a nitrogen atom defect those two together make for a very interesting type of qubit people think about that it's called envy diamond so the you know there are a lot of ideas out there and what's what's what's the coolest for me is that this field is still in its infancy on the hardware side and there's just lots of good ideas out there and so what what happens in the future well we turn to Tom Clancy of course so he he he and his ghost writers they like to read up on modern research and put little zingers in their books and actually they you know he talks about quantum computing here and there but his hero actually builds builds a device that's stable and it's scalable and it works really well and he's asked well how did you manage to do that if it's so hard he says because I'm smarter than all the rest and that's the great thing about this field there's so many smart young people that may might not know quantum physics the math behind it but but they can understand the concepts just well enough to maybe think about new systems it can be built you know there's wonderful you know wonderful directions that are out there it bridges physics chemistry mathematics information theory computer science of course electrical engineering all forms of engineering and I guess one of the challenge in this is in this field and I I'm hoping that I dispelled a little bit of that is that most people are not comfortable with quantum mechanics some of them some people don't even believe it they just think it's a you know it's an ivory tower subject engineers especially older generations of Engineers that build airplanes we need these systems and huge engineers to apply their skills to quantum they won't touch it it's it's it's just such a goofy theory to them and I think this culture is starting to change now but there's sort of a gap between universities and industry in this field I often say that universities at universities are very comfortable with applying quantum physics but we don't build things we don't build things that are useful for others to use like computers you never build an airplane or a computer at a university industry has the opposite problem they build things they have systems engineers that have worked 15 years on one thing perfected it prototype after prototype but they're not comfortable with quantum mechanics yet so there's sort of a gap now in in this I think of it as a workforce issue and for that reason actually the US government is very interested in this for many reasons one one is that the countries of countries throughout the world are putting lots of effort into quantum computing u.s. has mighty industry we can take your risks and so forth but we don't have that workforce in the middle so actually Congress this year is the unanimous have the House unanimously passed a law called the National quantum initiative that would that would direct agencies to sort of bridge that middle ground and the Senate will probably act by this year's end and the White House is actually engaged in this there's an expert in quantum physics in the White House right now who is sort of advising and coordinating the agencies hopefully in this field and again hopefully in 10 or 20 years you know this won't be needed we'll have a culture of folks that are at least comfortable with quantum physics so don't worry about not understanding it none of us do but just get comfortable with it and then when you go home you can read interesting books and think about the mystical nature of what could be the backbone of high-performance computing in the future thanks for your attention so okay so if anyone has any questions oh I have one right here the Brent okay how does this relate to the Chinese satellite that we heard had split a photon and uses the positions of this photon in two different locations to transmit indecipherable code good question so I did mention that quantum computers could break codes but actually quantum information and you may have gathered from just the background you can also encode information in a very interesting way because if somebody reads it they destroy it remember rule number two so there's something called quantum cryptography where you can actually send quantum bits like photons through a fiber or through space and if somebody reads it you know in principle that they are eavesdropping that's kind of neat so indeed the Chinese launched a satellite and there was a marvelous engineering task to send single photons up to the satellite and they could basically communicate it wasn't a very fast rate of communication but they could do it knowing that the communication was secure so how does this relate to that yes that's an example of something called quantum communication I will say on the other hand the direct use of qubits for encryption is not necessarily so interesting because if you want to break if you want to if you want to spy on the person sending information from here to the satellite I would not maybe not break try to try to intercept it along the line I would look behind the back of the guy who typed in the information or try to blackmail and maybe or or do something on the satellite at the other end when he gets read so you know those problems are still there it does solve the problem of the channel itself being broken but there's always an element at either end in fact this country is not necessarily so interested in quantum for that reason but it's a marvelous engineering feat and I would I'll give I will say that if you share photons with say many parties there are protocols that can take advantage of it this is more in game theory so you could imagine having an election system where nobody trusts anybody else how can you be sure there's a fair election there's a way to use entanglement maybe to help in that direction so it's very researchy but the Chinese satellite I mean it's a very expensive and beautiful engineering project it also made a lot of noise and I think that's the design they they wanted to really hear the kind of make make a lot of press out of that I have another one over here in the aisle I'm just curious it's it sounds as if you're talking about it is what I would consider the extremely low level of hardware's if you're talking about okay we're here we can take a quantum analogy for a a computer gate and sort of sort of logic gate but of course computers you know you build the CPU out of multiple gates and you have the memory and you have then you have on top of that you have software so it seems like there's maybe I'm one of those slightly older engineers who's just uncomfortable with all this but it seems like there's a huge gap between what you described and what I would think of as as even anything approaching software like how does that where does that come in yeah good point there's a huge gap so so when I think of software I in quantum I think of applying individual gates I mean that is really low level I mean in classical software we're I mean I remember doing a little bit of assembling language code in the 70s and that was very low level but the gates behind it or even much lower very hardware driven so you're absolutely right there's a huge gap between what we can do at hardware and the highest level say the cloud user interface however in these quantum systems like any computer if you can abstract away the hardware whether whether we have superconducting loops going one direction or another or atoms that are that are in one state or another if you can abstract even just to the gate level that's very powerful and there are currently lots of software people even Microsoft's by leading the charge developing quantum software it's still very low level and right now you can't cheat you can't throw away a memory like we look like we do these days you have to really squeeze out every piece of efficiency you can but you're absolutely right and we're dying for for the hardware to graduate so that we can add more software layers to it that's that's going to be absolutely necessary but yes I'm sorry to say that you know I can agree with you entirely that we're we haven't even started on the software side yet thanks I guess I don't I've had trouble understanding what the scaling dimension of this is like in the ordinary in say the non quantum computation we scale on space that is we know we can get down to half M levels and and we just do this kind of arbitrary computation unit in a smaller space right but what makes two quantum computers different from each other in terms of scale like once you get one of these things working how do you get the next step that is the 2o version how is that going to be faster in the first one yeah ok question has lots of lots of directions so just the number of qubits is in a sense you get to exponentiate that number or take it to you know so 2 to the N is in a sense the naive power of n qubits so every time you add one cubit you've doubled the power of that system in a sense the problem is every time every time you add a queue the system gets a little more messy and you have to probably operate more gates so as you make the system bigger you have to also go deeper you have to have deeper circuits and here's here's the real challenge as I see it in the laboratory is that quantum systems when you make them big they become classical they they get noticed it's very challenging to scale up a system and maintain quantum coherence and that's the central challenge in the hope and the entire endeavor now one thing I didn't talk about I wish I had time is the idea of quantum error correction and it turns out if you make your quantum system big enough it can be stable against errors and you can scale it up unfortunately the overhead to store a really good qubit might require 10,000 plain Cubans classically we have error correction as well but it's much more efficient you can you can make the errors go infinitesimally small just by adding a tiny bit more redundancy and how you encode but there's so many new types of errors that can happen in quantum you have to encode things in a mass massive entangled state but so I'm not sure I'm answering your question but the scale up of quantum computing depends on the algorithm it depends on the system and again I sort of revert to my earlier answer where it's such an early stage we just want to build one that can do something demonstrably different than what we do classically maybe that factoring algorithm applied to a small number and think about scaling that up or maybe some simulation of some molecular dynamics and see if you can scale that up so I hate to be wishy-washy but boy we still don't know what what quantum computers are good for it's a slightly peripheral question but say quantum computers are realized and the killer app being factoring large numbers is a solvable problem the peripheral question is since so much of our security computer security type protocols are based on that can you say anything about as quantum computing develops in 20 years 50 years whatever the number is can you say anything about the directions that computer security is going that is not based on that breakable encoding yeah good good point and just like quantum cryptography this decryption application is a little overstated because there are cryptographic schemes that that can be proven quantum can't break it's called post quantum cryptography and and NIST's the nationalistic standards that technology is developing several of those that the government use I'm sure NSA is way ahead so indeed I find the factoring problem you know not so interesting I mean it's academically interesting because it's a different complexity class of a very classic problem but the application of factoring there's not much there because we cannot we will change our cryptography standards in the coming maybe in a decade or something but it's still true that people are listening in right now and writing down ciphertext they can't break and and maybe in 20 years they can break it so if you want to keep a secret more than 20 years you should be careful right now sort of taking action now so so indeed I'm not an expert in cryptography but there are many different many different forms of cryptography that seem to be quantum quantum secure I'm not a techie but the other night I was listening to a report on the various currencies and they were discussing Bitcoin and others so is the Bitcoin what you mentioned just now is it felt I mean what was that last expression you mentioned just now crypto what I mean is the Bitcoin crypto secure boy I wish I knew more about that but the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are based on this this blockchain protocol that as far as I understand it's very much related to the classic type of cryptography based on the ability to factor and if you can factor you can maybe mind bitcoins I think that I think that's true but I don't think it has to be true I think you can adopt different standards for for crypto currencies that are also a quality cure but I'm actually not the guy to ask it's one of those terms everybody talks about it about and nobody understands it I have a device question for you I'm looking at the space you had one picture of the IBM system where the superconducting circuits and it looks like those are Josephson junctions can you kind of describe the physics of those oh yeah a Josephson junction so basic loop of wire here it has inductance and capacitance it's an oscillator so the circuit oscillates if you had a Josephson junction in there it becomes nonlinear and therefore you can store it you can make a qubit out of it an oscillator has infinitely many levels quantum levels but to store a qubit you need to make the levels differently spaced and the Josephson Junction does that so it's a little it's the Josephson junction is this this little thing there it's a tiny gap where the electrons tunnel through the gap and that gives the non-linearity it's it's it's a little bit technical but that some people in that field would call this thing an atom they call that big it's a big atom it can be 1/10 of a millimeter on the side it's an atom and has a very simple degree of freedom everything else is frozen out because it's it it's at nearly zero degrees Kelvin it's it's it's it's in a dilution refrigerator very low temperature and everything freezes out except this one degree of freedom so Josephson junctions actually were popular in the 80s for making a new type of conventional computer classical computer based on Joseph's no chance because there was very little dissipation and it's thought that was important turned out not to be it's still looking got smaller and smaller they just engineered the heck out of it and you know silicon conquered but I have to been involved in that project act or make me did yeah yeah it's it's no surprise that I should have included Northrop Grumman here IBM and Northrop Grumman now have sort of legacy Josephson computing groups maybe you were involved with something maybe older TRW that went over to Northrop and these same people are now making circuits for quantum so it's a very yeah it's a very active field very exciting this may be a little mystical that there's a Santa Fe can I give to me so the human human mind is pretty good pretty smart and there's a handful of well-respected physicists and others like Penrose and Hameroff who in fact think that the human brain is a quantum computer and I know there are issues with how that can be but I'm just wondering what your thought my gut feeling is that something hot sticky and wet is no place for quantum physics so I find it hard to believe but I wish I could say the same say more to it there are many biological effects that seem to have quantum coherence at their core one is the one is the rhodopsin in the back year I can detect the olicity of single photons and there's the magnetic field sensing of certain birds that apparently they can they can detect it at the single atom level of magnetism and so their quantum coherence and even superposition could play a role the problem is rule number two always gets in the way when you have something hot or when you have something that's super big how does how does how can you think of quantum in that context and you know they're really interesting ideas out there I think it's fascinating I think it's a little bit fringe which is too bad I think there shouldn't be Oster shouldn't be ostracized for for thinking that way but I I just don't know how to think that way I'm if you've gathered the the platform I like our individual atoms you know ten or twenty that's a lot so I'm sort of a bottom-up kind of kind of person and it's very hard for me to think of applying quantum to a really complex system with ten to the twenty atoms in it so you know sorry it's not mystical I think that's it's really interesting and I think biology is kind of the one of the frontiers of science right now if we can only link it with physics mark would be great actually next month's lecture Michelle will talk maybe a little in that direction
