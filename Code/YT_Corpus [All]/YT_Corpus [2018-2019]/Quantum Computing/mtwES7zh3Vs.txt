 I believe IQC represents a sweet spot in between academia and industry. There is so many talented people, with such diverse expertise all in one place. At IQC itself, at the University of Waterloo, and nearby at the Perimeter Institute. There's no other institute that is this large and working on this many different technologies. In terms of quantum information and computing. IQC is one of the largest quantum communities in the world. And as an experimentalist, it is a great pleasure to have the experimentalists, especially the young experimentalists, together, so that we can learn from each other, and grow together. A lot of the collaborators are the professors here, are industrial partners, and so you gain a lot of contacts in the industry world, as well as the academic world, so you can really choose a broad horizon of careers after your time at IQC. It's not easy to find an institution where this engineering as well as physics aspects can be brought together, and here I found it.
