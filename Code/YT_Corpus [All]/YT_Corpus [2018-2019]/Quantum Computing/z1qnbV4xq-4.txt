 Aslamualikum Bismillah Ar Rehman Ar Rehem  K&T presents a new video   In this video I will tell you about quantum computer and artificial intellegence.  SUbscribe my channel.

China already made world fastest supercomputer  and now china has made world first fastest quantum computer  Quantum computer works on basis of quantum theory.   It uses quantum entanglement and quantum bits to solve its complex calcultions.  In quantum computers we can use 0 and 1 in three forms.   Only 0 Only 1  Or both O and 1 at same time.  Chinese scientists also done a successful experiment.  Chinese scientists also done a successful experiment.  They done a successful teleportation at distance of 1400 Km.  This was done between earth to satellite in space.  In this experiment no object was teleportated but  Only photon particles were used.  In this centuary the computer science  and Quantum physics  combinely made a new branch called  Quantum computer  Transistor is the basic component of  all electronics  Transistor is also based on quantum physics(quantum mechanics)   With the advancement of quantum computers  it is hoped that Artificial intellegence will progress  The invention of quantum computer will revolutionize the artificial intellegence technology.
