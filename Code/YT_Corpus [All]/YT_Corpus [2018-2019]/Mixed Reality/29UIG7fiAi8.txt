 (gentle music) - Mixed reality combines what you actually see, the room you're in with other things like holograms. When I saw what it could do the applications were clearly university wide. So what I did now is. - Much of what we do with interior architecture we call the experiential. - And look at the desk, see the desk right there. - We can take people through spaces and that's something that we've never really been able to do. The project that we've been looking at today was created by one of our thesis students. The model is allowing us to go from floor to floor and look at the relationships between floors. What struck me about it was how immediately effective it was and how it was clearly going to transform the way that we work. It reminded me a little bit of the first opportunity to create a digital image. Nothing was the quite the same again. - The applications are in medicine, in law, in research, in business, design, you name it. And you're gonna see this everywhere. - The nicest thing about working across campus and working within different departments is that we're questioning what the role of new technologies can be. - So I go over to. I've been in education my whole life. And so the most important part for me of any piece of technology is how can I use it to do something better than I have been before. Plus it's a lot of fun.
