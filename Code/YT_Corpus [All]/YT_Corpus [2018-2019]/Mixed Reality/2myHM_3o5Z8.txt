 okay so to warn you guys straight ahead of time got a little bit of a head cold so it might be coughing a little bit I know some people get all pissed off when you don't have perfect audio so let's go mourn you ahead of time don't want to hear no complaining okay a little bit of smudge on the lens Oh much better okay get it on my face right get it attached to my head okay got the earphones okay and then get the eye distance too perfect okay okay okay so we are facing the living room straight forward about sort of so obviously we're here to play Skyrim headsets falling off my face shit hopefully doesn't make you sit through that ridiculously long annoying intro you guys know what I'm talking about where you're sitting in a freaking cart for 30 minutes talking about stupid shit okay Oh character setup I wonder how that's gonna work oh yeah here we go here we go oh man it's stable well wait for it press any button oh man that compass is trippy as fuck a little more about him hide what what the fuck right hand Oh your default movement is set to teleportation point in a location and move to move the desired location instantly you can change your movement mode at the first station now I don't want to get sick so I think teleportation sounds pretty damn good ah shit I only have hands I don't have arms that is so stupid I'm already considering returning it no arms how fucking lazy of a developer do you have to be not to have arms I mean VR chat did it and they don't even make money oh wow Oh move in the direction you want to move hold L grab to sprint your movement will also change with the direction your controller is pointing I mean let's try it at least whoa okay yeah a little sick already though oh I see what it's doing okay so if I oh no that's making me sick go back go back that's making me sick shit how do I do that oh no menu button settings VR teleportation physical sneaking hell yeah I don't know what that means fov filter no excuse me that's a lot of settings what's back okay I'm gonna have to go to well where's my FPS counter like it let's try hi see what happens shadow distance whoops changes occlusion shadows let's try those are these try hi shit back saving look okay Wow of course you have to restart the fucking game guess desktop of course you have to restart the game to make changes it's not like it's 2018 okay and I haven't worn this headset in a while it's so comfortable hope my stream is working okay launcher again I'm always paranoid that if I'm not facing forward when I launch a game it's gonna launch the game in the wrong direction like I feel like steam should give you the option to change which way is forward but if you don't set it up right in wmr then it's not gonna work right and steam which is unfortunate they need to fix that they need to tell you they need to give you a way to change which way is forward let's just play the game I have less than three hours to decide if I'm gonna keep this game or not it's fucking accurate look at that click-click-click I like that okay all right here we go let's try this again okay okay I am right hand dominant continue Hey whoa whoa hi compass okay that was I like teleportation so I don't get sick can make fun of me if you want compass just keep it low so it's out of my way yeah that's fine okay move to the next station to choose your preferred turning

you okay that big giant freaking thing is gonna be getting really annoying really quick gun here I'm gonna cook it steal your shit okay uh what does take all left d-pad okay right if you swing shut up okay fur boots right hand axe normal clothes no magic yet left hand I want they said magic is probably the most fun with this specific VR I'm going to see if I can find some way out I don't have magic yet but are you kidding oh there we go I was gonna say whoops whoops okay left hand flames right hand axe how hard is that burn motherfucker burn burn that is kind of fun what what what oh shut up oh yeah there's not even a hand on the axe why can't you the developer put it off this is stupid there's no hand on the axe burn burn oh you're weak so it looks like they never fixed the glitch with leveling up on rail off but yeah using an axes it's pretty pointless honestly let's switch to magic only I think we'll do this cat is magic only I can't really see a reason to do so we're gonna do flame destruction and then healing left hand since it's probably kind of tough to switch in the middle of shit I don't want to slow the gameplay down oh yeah I'm healing my crotch oh yeah wait where's my healthy burn we are found the key oh yeah that's right now I can loot shit wish I had feet to kick you with least I have hands it makes me feel less retarded with hands still stupid you don't have an arms or a body at least their cat hands at least they they did that right take I'm gonna weigh my ass down here pretty quick take all I mean eventually I'll start taking things only by their value and hopefully do they allow mods on this game because then you could have a sky you eye oh I love sky UI okay search take all those empty search get a little motion sick again okay so since I'm gonna be magic magic pairs with mage armor which is light armor so I need to make sure I'm wearing light armor only armor 23 armor 25 okay I can't even see my own character so that's kind of stupid anyway okay run oh there's more loot burn burn burn shut up it burn I don't like how there's a crosshair can I turn the crosshair off vibration difficulty floating markers maybe that's what that means I don't know what that means actually yes save on character menu who would disable that okay display okay we are okay no crosshair what is realistic swimming I'll try it movie filter while turning movie filter while we're moving I'm assuming that makes you less sick it's at least try it okay so you guys probably won't see it you don't have fov at all but maybe after east of Oh Eric oh let's keep moving yeah I don't like that at all settings VR screw that okay okay then I want to do a hard save okay burn yeah no more crosshair all this floaty shit's annoying honestly but anyway anything valuable no see if the room scale still works right like yeah I can like duck and fucking jumping okay all right let's fuck some shit up fuck some shit up want some bad guys all to myself screw rail off oh that floaty shits annoying bad guys die bullshit bullshit burn burn burn search a call see if you can find any potions search I will take that potion take it take it okay I will take that potion and I will take salt pile worthless and I will take a dose of motion sickness I think there is a potion and a barrel but I just need to get to the main like I said decent fighting of the game to see if I want to the dungeon torturer get em ah he's shocking me search numbers I should've known that okay we are going to drop any well shit cuz oh yeah okay that's what we're gonna drop what's a drop drop drop okay what's our high wait items this shit ain't worth anything okay okay how do I back out them in you carry weight two out of three hundred what gets your carry weight up I think that's a stamina right or is that is that a different game is that follow grab anything useful and let's go don't really need them Oh lockpick do I need a dagger I don't need a dagger okay nothing in there okay let's pick this shit oh god l to rotate R to rotate the lock this is gonna suck oh no fuck this oh my feeling they didn't bother to polish those minigames to well now how do you activate it to read it well that's stupid okay we're gonna quit quit okay I got my major robes on now the problem is I didn't read the book items books yes so do I want sparks or flames I mean I like flames flames are cool I guess we at least try them there's no nope don't care okay see magic destruction cheaper - alright now normally I would go and pick up every little thing of value and go and search and pick but in VR I feel like that would be extremely boring and tedious I just want to go what fuck shit up all I want to do okay where's the next enemies a few guys in role will never arrive because you will be dead ha dodge the bow dodge toe he's dead hey who's taking my kills not on my watch fucker take my kill okay we have more careful Bob what we steal here let's see no take let's

he's gone for good this time no way to know if anyone else mate man that looks like shit ah man I'm not even sure what to what does that mean what is dynamic resolution temporal aaaa maybe this is why it looks like garbage yeah look at that that makes a huge difference fuck it super sampling out alive you shut up is going to be swarming with them soon enough I remember right there's one another little well my sister Gurdurr runs the myth man the graphics are junk well in Riverwood just up the road till too much sure she'd help you out it's probably best if we split up I wouldn't have made it without your help today let's see you want to go man the graphics look like garbage I don't know what the deal with that is it's the everything gets blurry in the distance which isn't how that's not how the real world works there's got to be a way to disable that stupid shit is that what you see back okay no no it's super sampling is Oh was that it does that fix it it's dynamic resolution turnoff dynamic resolution fuck finally I figured it out now that might screw me on fire here for months so much better grab it die rabbit die butterfly oh that looks so much better already dynamic resolution is the bane of your existence in this game unless your computer is complete garbage die box don't you bitch me is there a mage stone over here I don't even remember what the hell oh there they are oh

store store store store weights down to 195 that should be good and well that might not be good enough to get through here like should I go sell shit first I should really go sell shit first dammit ok do it the responsible way yeah turning off dynamic resolution made a huge difference there's still some depth of field issues hopefully somebody will find a way to turn that depth of field shit off that's not realistic oh oh shit fuck you I have surround sound motherfucker you can't sneak up on me anymore douche oh shit yeah you can ah wait is that a free arrow no it's okay run cat run even

the carpet but then what's the point of playing there's a catch touching me go away cat okay I'm gonna stand back up I think the whole point of the yards to kind of not sit down and be lazy right okay uh nothing valuable over there let's see what this realistic swimming is all about move your head onto the surface of the water arty and lt and move your arms front and back oh my god oh my god holy shit oh oh this is ridicu no thank you no thank you kind of cool okay no realistic swimming that's that's garbage okay don't need to hear your thoughts go I don't give a shit sorry for the coffee head

I don't even get to use my healing powers I'm so awesome guess I could turn the difficulty out but I'm sure it'll get difficult quick okay still have a pickaxe to mine shit with yeah I will take that and that and that and that and that shows the path not that I give a shit but I still want to learn it and then I think the right thing to do is to lockpick this so you kind of gain the experience of lock oh shit bye-bye amethyst now I'm not gonna grab the key fuck I'm gonna grab the key I'm too lazy take-take-take no thank you and unlock a search chest give me some nice shit please alteration

arms and a body it's so dumb anyway where's my next quest marker also I wish there was like a real time like a little clock somewhere like this is what it is in the real world don't forget you got to

interesting load it's really no I want to just load into the most recent game it's fucking stupid okay system settings I don't get it yeah it makes a huge difference but why is it like fucking the menu up when I do that what the hell well now the game is totally fucked yep game's totally fucked now can't move can't turn it definitely worked but why is the game fucked now okay let's try again
