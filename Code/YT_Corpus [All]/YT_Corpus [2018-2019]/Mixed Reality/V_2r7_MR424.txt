 Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers are responsive, accurate, and synced to your movements with no need to install hardware on your walls. Let’s take a look. We’ll use an HP headset and PC, but there are lots of great devices to choose from. To turn around, move either thumbstick right or left. To get around in mixed reality, teleport. Push either stick forward, point to where you want to go, and then release. Pull backward to back up. And to virtually walk, press the stick straight down, then push it in the direction you want to go. Hey look, you’re flying! Use teleport to get the perfect viewing angle. Press your thumbstick forward, point inside the app window, and then release. That huge private screen looks even better now. Need to scroll? Pull the trigger, then move the controller up or down. You can also scroll using the touchpad. To zoom in or out, pull both triggers and point inside the window. Then move your hands apart or together. To resize the entire window, point one controller at the app bar... and one inside the window. Motion controllers give you superpowers over 3D objects and apps. Point your controller and pull the trigger to move things around... To make things smaller or larger, point both controllers, pull the triggers, and then move your hands together or apart. To rotate things, move your controllers like this. And remember: you can do all the same movements on an app window. Just point one controller at the app bar, and point the other one anyplace else on the window. For more tips, go to aka.ms/windowsmixedrealitytips.
