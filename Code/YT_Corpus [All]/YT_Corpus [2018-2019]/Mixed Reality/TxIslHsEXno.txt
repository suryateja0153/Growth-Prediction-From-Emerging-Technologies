 With 3D app launchers, developers can create a unique 3D representation for their app that users can place in their mixed reality home. Start with a 3D model in the glTF format – an open standard that is used as the primary format for our runtime 3D assets. Please note that your model must have less than 10,000 triangles. To optimize your object for Windows Mixed Reality, run it through our Mixed Reality Asset Converter, which you can find on GitHub. Once you’ve converted the model you’re ready to add it to your application. Assigning a 3D launcher is just like adding a 2D logo. First import the converted object into your project and make sure to mark it as content so that it will be included in your app package. Next, go to the app manifest and add the UAP5 namespace declaration. Then specify the 3D launcher using the MixedRealityModel element on your default tile.  Note that if you’re working in Unity, you must first build your app before you can edit the manifest in Visual Studio. To check out your new 3D launcher, build and deploy your solution. Once in the Cliff House, launch your app from the Start menu. You should see your new 3D launcher appear in the world, where you can place it wherever you like. 3D app launchers, along with the Mixed Reality Asset Converter, let you creatively personalize your virtual reality world.
