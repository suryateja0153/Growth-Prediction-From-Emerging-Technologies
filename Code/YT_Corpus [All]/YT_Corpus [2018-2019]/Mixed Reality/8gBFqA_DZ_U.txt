 In this chapter, we’ll learn how to override the controller model with a custom 3D model. Select the MotionController object, and then search for the BrushController object. Assign this prefab to the Alternate Right Controller. Then make sure you are always using the Alternate Right Controller model. To check out the child components of the BrushController model, drag the BrushController prefab into the hierarchy panel. Expand to find the Tip component and then zoom in to see the tip of the brush. We’ll use this transform to start and stop drawing lines. Delete the BrushController from the Hierarchy panel, save the scene, and click Play. You’ll see the right motion controller represented as a brush. Switch back to Unity and this time look for ColorPickerWheel. Add it to our scene.
