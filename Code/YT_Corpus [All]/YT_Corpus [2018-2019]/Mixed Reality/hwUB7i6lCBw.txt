 What would I tell them about me? Who I am is really based on teamwork and trying to take on just out of reach challenges with a group of people who are really excited about them. I have played a lot of sports in my life and I played Ultimate for 20 years now, competitively. I'm now a curler. Basically, I love the outdoors. I think it's really important that there are more women in tech because an equal and balanced workplace is different than one that not balanced. It's subtle, but it's better for all of us if it's balanced. I've been inspired by so many fantastic people that I've had the privilege to work with. But the first was my mom, who since I was a little girl told me that I could do whatever I wanted and I should dream big. She gave me a lot of visualizations and goal posts. In terms of just suggesting what I could do and really nurtured that envisioning process. Through my career I've just had the absolute pleasure to work with so many people who were my mentors and who pushed me and who motivated me, who solved problems differently than me so I could grow and watch them approach problems in different ways. What led me was an introduction from a friend. She said, oh you've been going on about mixed reality for quite some time and there's a job in this field and I think you should apply. It was everything I've wanted to do for the last year and a half. Something that was told to me just recently by senior woman here at Microsoft was, just be authentic. Learn, engage, enjoy and be true to yourself and you will do well. I think it's really important to have diversity in the workplace for the same reason that our CEO says we need diversity in the workplace. It represents our customers. Our customers are around the world and they all use our products and if we don't represent them within our company than how can we build product for them. I believe that won't stop now, that is only increasing.
