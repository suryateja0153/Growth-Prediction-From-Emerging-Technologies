 I'm surrounded by mother nature's beauty this  mountainside is a prime location that provides   breathtaking views but all these trees all  this dry vegetation unfortunately increases a   fire danger and as the climate warms the danger  is only getting worse now wildfire season has   become a year-long threat burning twice the area  now than in 1970 it's true that these fires they   can reinvigorate nature but when they flare up in  populated areas they all too often lead to total   destruction now of course weather plays a huge  role on how explosive a wildfire can be and over   the past few decades the climate over the western  US has become more conducive for wildfires with   overall warmer drier weather like where I am today  the overgrown brush has dried out from the lack of   rain leaving plenty of available fuel to burn the  air is hot and extremely dry with dew points in   the teens with winds getting stronger now believe  it or not more than 80% of wildfires start because   of human activity often it's a straight ember from  an unattended campfire or a tossed cigarette that   can ignite a firestorm and it doesn't take much  and can spread it quickly now climate trends warn   that these fires will continue to be more intense  and burn longer than just a few decades ago now   the smoke itself is hot and races high into the  sky becoming visible for a mile so let's get   above that smoke for a better view unfortunately  the strong winds are really giving these flames   of life in fact by the looks of it this fire is  spreading at ludicrous speeds and becoming in a   stoppable firestorm fires like this one can  consume up to a football field every second   just like the Thomas fire did in December of 2017  and since heat rises fires travel faster as they   move uphill wind can also push embers downwind  and start new fires this is known as spotting   putting homes on the mountainside in great danger  wildfires concerned into nearly unstoppable raging   inferno with temperatures reaching over 1,500  degrees Fahrenheit winds carry the thick smoke   for miles turning day into night and making it  difficult to breathe if you live in a wild fire   prone area be sure you and your family had a plan  of action residence could have a few hours - only   a few minutes to escape to safety now hopefully  your neighborhood will never be in the path of   a wildfire like this one but the frequency and  size of the extreme fire disasters has increased   as the average temperature rises and seems like  this could become a frightening new reality
