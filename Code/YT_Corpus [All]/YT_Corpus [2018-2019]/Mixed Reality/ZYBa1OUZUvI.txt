 Ciao Guys Tyriel Wood here in this video gonna talk about cyber shoes a new kickstarter coming very very soon that is aiming to compete with of course the more expensive treadmills with a different solution but can it really do it let's see it together but first thank you so much for watching for new from the channel feel free to check out all the other video in the channel and if you like what you see I want to keep an update about via impact in general just flickered up the subscribe button so you don't miss anything but let's go back in topic here let's see together how this technology works and out there trying to aim to the treadmills competition and of course if this is really worth it or not for what was my first demo at experience at the tree so let's start to talk about the adword itself I have to interview over you're going on but of course the idea was very very bad on the floor so I'm just gonna talk over that I hope you don't mind so what you're seeing here is the cyber shoes itself it's 3d printed right now but you're gonna go with a kickstart Dan with a different way to have a mass production of course and so what is composed off is pretty much these big soul that you're gonna put under your shoes and the strap that is just as knob or strap and that's very clever because it's a very cheap way but it totally works I never felt like that food was getting far from the base also there it come from Austria so it kind of makes sense that they're using his not worth paying for it and also we have the wheel under the movement of the wheel is received by some magnets and of course is gonna need energy so you're gonna have to recharge them and there is a micro USB on the side for that purpose so you're gonna be able to recharge and then just open the game and everything's gonna work via bluetooth with the computer where it's gonna run a software that is gonna understand the movement of course of the shoes so what you need for these to work is gonna be the cyber shoes the carpet and of course the chair and everything is gonna be included in the package when they're gonna present it as a Kickstarter so let's start talking about what was my experience in the demo and what I and why so I up teams carom VR because of course is the perfect game to just walk around and explore and so I thought it was the best way to experience avoid a treadmill way stuff the other demo was doomed VFR so being seated you have to have a movement that this kind of awkward because you don't usually really walk when you're sitting you don't really spin your legs around and that was the kind of problem with this demo where after like my 10-15 minutes trainer I always like destroyed like my legs were starting to hurt and it was was really like a workout to go around like when you walk usually it's not like that so dissolution is a kind of interesting also there were some glitches going on because of course he's an early beta and they were using a better software because it's not even their last software as you can see from all the codes that work going on because that was more reliable for a demo and they had the new software they're working on with of course customization and stuff there's gonna arrive of course later with the Kickstarter for what was the demo was interesting because the movement wasn't really related anyway to my real movement they set it up a little more so when I was working I was going farther than what I was expecting some time was shorter there there wasn't really a real feedback on it so I was kind of hard to rely on the movement from your legs and that kind of disconnection between the two movement was kind of creating a weird sensation of course here we're talking about the beta we are talking about just trying for 15 minutes really probably you have to get used to like you get used to natural locomotion and steam when you use your armor for to do a locomotion but the experience in there was a kind of weird sometime I was going back even if I wanted to go forward so yeah it was a kind of a mixed bag to be honest but I appreciate the fact that they're trying to do something to be a little cheaper of course again what was the treadmill and maybe just sitting like iron or maybe using just what I can think about instead of a regular spinning chair like the one they are using maybe use a bicycle seat that is not gonna be super comfortable but L lease your legs are gonna be more free to move around so probably that would be ideal also they're not planning on used by truckers to really understand the movement on your legs or just relying on the wheel that is under the shoes and that's okay that's all their software and that's why of course is cheaper that what you will expect even if not super super cheap I'm gonna talk about that later also they're included a white box that it showed me at the end where there is a slider that you can just put up and down to change the speed without relying on the software so maybe you're in VR instead of like going the software on the desktop and stuff you just can move this slider and go up and down with the speed and really give the feedback that you really want from the game they're not going with the real speed because they said that is not fun that's kind of I don't know for me I would like to ever my real speed because I would like to feel that I'm really really working and weed out that is like there's still a disconnection on the real movement and not by the way also the wheel has a twisting mechanism so you can understand a little their rotation so if you want to rotate a little in fast pieces shooter that is gonna help for sure but to move you're gonna always rely of course on your chair movement so on your direction in real life and that make it more interesting of course but in the demo everything was related to my ad so it wasn't really like a wool expect in real life so they have still F to work on it for sure by the way the Kickstarter is gonna start pretty soon and the price is probably not what would expect so the price will start at 350 for the first part of the Kickstarter where you're gonna have the chair the carpet and of course the to cyber shoes and little box for the speed and ambach price after the Kickstarter is gonna increase to 500 so I leave you just with the price and I don't know what you think about the price is like too expensive what would you really expect what you really willing to pay for an experience like this to me probably is a little I still now because the experience wasn't like a mind-blowing like I was expecting of course it's just still early so they need to work a lot on it and I hope they're gonna get to a position where the experience can be really really great anyway guys if you liked the video like if you didn't like the video dislike let me know in the comment below what you think about it and what you think about the price of course and subscribe to the channel for more about VR and DAC in general and see you guys next video ciao
