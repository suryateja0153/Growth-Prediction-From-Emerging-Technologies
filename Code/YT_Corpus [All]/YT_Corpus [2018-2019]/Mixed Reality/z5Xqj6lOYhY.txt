 dig me hey Bob Cooney I'm back and I'm in creative works I tried to do this yesterday and my battery died so I apologize for that but I'm here to talk about voxel but I also want to address some comments on my video yesterday when I was talking about hollow gate and somebody came on and made a comment about it being a ripoff and they're you know they're selling something for $90,000 that you can buy for twenty thousand dollars or whatever and and that and I don't know I don't know who I don't know the guy personally but my guess is he's a VR enthusiast he's running a VR arcade and I actually understand his point he was a little dickish about it but I could be a dick too so I'll forgive him for that but his point was that if you look at you know could you buy for HTC vibes and PCs and for twenty thousand dollars have four stations yes you could but if you're an FEC owner the last thing you have to think about is putting together a technology integration package for four freaking HCC vibes then where am I going to get the content and how do I know the contents going to be refreshed and how do I do the user interface and how do I have my 16 year old minimum-wage employee be able to run it and and and how do I make it look good in my f you see that I've spent five million dollars building alright and say you're going to a VR arcade and they're using drape and pipe and shower curtains sometimes to separate these things and nobody gives a what the thing looks like that's fine that's your thing but you have to understand MVC owners they're running ten million dollar a year businesses they've got hundreds of employees they've got full kitchen men used to deal with they've got hundreds of devices they have to manage as far as games and payment systems and POS and parties and corporate events and ownership they don't have time to think about it so are they willing to spend ninety thousand dollars have somebody else take care of that for them absolutely so just because you don't understand another market sometimes it's best to keep your mouth shut alright so um anyway I want to turn around we're gonna show you a voxel so this game is called punch beat and what they're doing is using a technology that's called cave what's cave stand for manual the game stems for cave automatic via Island Earlham that's a cable that's a ricochet like running yeah all the recursive fashion game stands for cave automatic virtual environment yeah yeah and so um and so what it is essentially it uses 3d projectors short throw projector so you're projecting onto the floor and onto the wall and then you're standing inside the projection and you're using 3d cameras and so it everything is popping up out and I wish I could show you the effect but I need some kind of a 3d video camera to be able to do it and so but this game punch beat it's a rhythm game it's super fun and super active voxel also has a library of titles that aren't quite polished yet and so punch beat was the one that they decided to polish for the show and so they've got a surfing game which I really like they've got another game called future runner can we cue up future runner well is he gonna play whatever it will play what play whatever he's gonna play and so um and so they've got two launch titles that are polished they've got a third title did you guys announce yeah you did make the announcement of with pop stick yeah so they did announce at the show they've done a deal with with specular Theory which is an award-winning VR studio who had licensed her to Transylvania 3 and created a music game called pop stick and so specula theory and scale one portal have done a version of that for the voxel and that's going to be coming out imminently so there'll be a Hotel Transylvania 3 game and look and the thing I love about this is it's really super cute friendly and so anybody can play it you don't have to worry about the headsets you don't have to worry about any of that I believe that this can be run unattended but creative works is positioning it as it does need an attendant so we'll have to see how that plays out but it's it's super simple it's super accessible it's super fun and yeah and so we're calling it mixed reality it's not for originally they were calling it virtual reality but we thought that was a little bit inauthentic but it really does feel like kind of like an AR experience because of the 3d nature of it it's super immersive so so I'm gonna head over and I'm also gonna head over and go see the four player 1 so it's over in the coin op pavilion right or what is it 2:54 I get a long walk so so they also have a 4 player version of it my friends in Halle Gate junta wall line obviously they're crushing it so I tried to find out how many sold but he wouldn't tell me so and I wouldn't tell you guys anyway but until they did well I think they've had a great show so let's turn this around you guys probably gonna get sick so I'm gonna go over so there's two more things I want to do I want to check out the 4 player voxel and then I want to go check out ubisoft's tryout Tech they've changed the VR maze so last year at a Appa and at an Asian amusement expo I reviewed the Rabbids VR maze and they have an assassin's Creed game I really love the games but they were really short and had a backpack and I was talking to Brent Bushnell and the guys actually I don't think Brent to Camille who somebody was an Erin told me this from to the circus and he said that they've been running it and the problem is it creates all kinds of problems for the attendant so like running a hot backpack system in a 3 minute game and what I mean hot I mean you're running you're busy you're cranking it out you're putting people through as fast as you can and so the challenge with that is when you have a hold on I'm going to dance with this robot all right got a dance with the robot when you see the robot so and so the problem with it is you have your employee who's putting a backpack on a new player every three minutes or four minutes and they said it's just exhausting and so employee engagement is a big part of the our right you need these employees to love their jobs and a lot of them are passionate about VR but if you run them into the ground this is one of my problems with foot tracking to you know is making your employees put on people's feet all day you better have a damn good reason for that in the game before you put foot tracking in the game anyway these guys know if you remember these guys were at so this is a 4dx company so these are the guys that do the theaters from Korea and they had this at age and amusement expo doesn't look any different and they're they're showing the VXR solution from my friend Nick Cooper and that was at CinemaCon so awesome still showing the emoji movie is emoji movie still the best game you have ah that's not what I asked is it still the best game you have what's the best game you have okay so Pacific Rim I cool any new ones since Pacific Rim what do you got right now we only got room in the immediate area all right oh yeah no Wi-Fi Wi-Fi if the show sucks doesn't it all right cool awesome thank you that sucks because the emoji movie was terrible but the game was actually kind of fun Pacific Rim game wasn't very good and so the problem with those guys is they're just getting marketing demos from the studios and most of them suck and they can't get the studios to develop a decent game and so that's something that we're working on on them I'm working on the background with some guys and because there's actually so the game was um what was the movie with a rock Jumanji and so now Jumanji the VR experience was so bad that it's become a verb and they say don't Jumanji the game which means don't make a shitty VR game so anyway I'm here it I'm gonna I'm gonna wrap this up no wait where's vauxhall I got to finish the voxel thing actually I'm gonna wrap this up I'll come back to you with with le eyes Rabbids and ubisoft's vr mazes
