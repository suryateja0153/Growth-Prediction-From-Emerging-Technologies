 (upbeat theme music) - I promised my wife I would not come in on Sundays. The students, I mean they were always here, seven days a week. - Well, because the original vector I tried to use. - Originally we started scheduling appointments. We didn't have to do that anymore, because everybody was always here. - What type of input does the... - It reminds me a bit of when I was in the military. We had a very tight-knit kind of a brotherhood, kind of a bond.

They're not getting money. They're doing it because they like physics and they like the technology. One of the students from NESAD, she's become like us, she's here all the time now, working on the computer, designing. - We've talked about before, well what if we just start a company after all this, or hopefully we get to all go to the same grad schools and work in the same fields. One thing is for certain is that we'll know what a good healthy team environment looks like in the future. - My students who are graduating this year, one of their assignments is to teach everybody else fast. - [Paul] When I was in the Army we had this mentoring class, and one of the things that they said was it's really important for you to train people to take your job. You want the projects that you're working on to carry on into the future. And for new students to grow into it and expand it and maybe take it their own direction. So what we're trying to do now is get them with hands-on experience, and also a little bit of leadership experience on their own so they can take a project, whether it's this project or their own, and run with it.
