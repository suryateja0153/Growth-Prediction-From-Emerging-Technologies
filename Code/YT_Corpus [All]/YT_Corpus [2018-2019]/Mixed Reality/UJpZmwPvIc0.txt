 so what's the deal with microsoft hololens - and will and robin i have any mixed reality capabilities all that and more on this week's ask dan stay tuned do you think Microsoft will have some kind of unique mixed reality capabilities built into a drama no so that it can be positioned as a differentiator in the market are you folks sure love your questions on Andromeda so let's dive into this one and as to what we're hearing now I've seen some patents out there showing like a holographic display we're not there yet folks I don't believe at least haven't seen nothing to suggest that this thing will have a display that will have Holograms coming out of it as cool as that would be maybe another five years I don't know but I'm not hearing anything about that for this device and speaking of Windows mixed reality directly well I teased some of this in the last video and I'll come out and say it 3d scanning now this shouldn't be that big of a surprise Microsoft showed it with surface studio during its announcement in late 2016 there though they use the elite x3 to scan a 3d sandcastle and then it goes into the device and that works for 3d paints we've never actually seen that actually come to fruition but I am hearing this device actually supports that and a combination of hardware I don't talk about the hardware specifically yet we are hearing a couple things about the camera speaking in that camera don't expect a Lumia 950 you or Lumia 1020 rebirth here this will be a nice camera but I don't think that's its main focus but 3d scanning will be a part of this and that is kind of how this works with Windows mix reality I think more specifically the idea is you can scan an object put it into there and then manipulate it use it that way for creating objects it's not necessary for viewing windows mixed reality although who knows they may have augmented reality with its camera as well sort of what Google is doing with its Android stuff now another bit of rumor we're starting to hear is in regards to hololens - which i'll talk about a little bit later on as well we are hearing that this device will work closely with hololens - and probably surface hub that is these devices will all work together to allow collaboration along with Windows mixed reality inking and more so welterweight for Microsoft see give some more details but that's how I envisioned this device we use as a tool to help create Windows mix reality not necessarily view Windows mix reality are there any rumors on the next iteration of hololens have you heard anything through the grapevine speaking of Windows mix reality what's the deal with hololens - now I hear a lot of people always say well hololens is dead and who cares but no hololens is still around windows mix reality is definitely a thing and we are actually hearing some cool stuff with windows makes reality by the way that's coming out including hopefully sharing your cliffs house with a neighbor so yes your friends can come over and visit you and hang out virtually which would be really cool stuff well it's how about hololens - it is still a thing it's still being developed - now I think some of this is gonna be kind of obvious you can piece it together for instance we'll be running an Intel Atom processor like the last one probably not where's Mark stuff going with all this stuff lately well Windows 10 on arms so why not expect a snapdragon 845 or 850 processor involved there after all then oh could you put that on there but now hololens would be mobile yes you can use that on an LTE network that's sort of a limitation right now with hololens it could only work on Wi-Fi well that's kind of cool having LTE on there would be even cooler that's even more important for people who want to use this out in the field like right now there's a lot of constructions and engineers and architects who are using hololens and having LTE you will be a big deal another thing I can tell you about hololens - is probably what version of the OS it's going to run it's going to be Windows core OS specifically Oasis so that is the codename if that sounds a little bit familiar because we talked about Polaris before and a dramatis Oh Oasis is the Windows mixed reality composer for Windows core OS and so that is something we can expect as to what that looked like what it all means well we have to wait and see these composers will be coming online through 2019 Microsoft's going through a process right now and drama is the first one then comes Polaris then Oasis and a few other ones as well including Xbox later on as to when to expect hololens - I wish I could tell you about maybe not until 2019 I do expect a leapfrog though in technology it should be smaller should be lighter it should get better battery life it should run Windows 10 on arm should have LTE and hopefully be cheaper as well well are not Microsoft now pushes it into the consumer market remains to be seen I still think it'll be position for a more prosumer at that level but we got some time to figure it out so stay tuned I used my lumia 950 primarily as a camera that does social media texting and web browsing should I stick with it or buy a dedicated camera instead alright so if you're a Lumia 950 user in 2018 well god bless you I don't know what else to say I know it's a fun device I like the size of it and everything but that processor right now kind of kills it for me it's quite a few generations behind and it gets pretty hot and doesn't get very good battery life if you're happy though using it by all means stick with it there's no reason to switch however in saying that I would say the competitor cameras have really caught up whether you want Android or iOS I think they're good options on either one of those I'll fulfill that need as to buying a dedicated camera such as a small point and shoot all those have dramatically improved over the coming years and you can definitely buy one I don't really prefer them anymore it's just an extra device to carry around I would rather get a pixel - it's so small its tiny fits my pocket it does all the stuff you need it to and it has easily the best camera I think on the market right now that will compete with any of those devices now I get a dedicated camera as a larger sensor and could do better stuff and there's always to trade off I carry around a d750 from Nikon as my professional level camera when I went into vacation though recently I did not take it because I was not going to take a boat anchor around with me now I could take better photos with it but I stuck with the pixel - and that's why I recommend here so maybe keep the 950 around for photos or just using it around but I think it's time to move on to a different type of phone for you mark stop bill 2018 is still not sold out is it a sign of lack of interest at Microsoft so a few weeks back someone asked me about Microsoft build whether we're still on track and I said look for the first two weeks of May in Seattle and guess what it's happening in first two weeks of May in Seattle somehow I knew that in fact it's going to happen May 7th through the 9th and that unfortunately overlaps with Google i/o which happens on the 8th through the 10th and they're not the same towns and I'm going to give Google a little credit here we have to be honest there's going to be a lot of momentum it's gonna be with Google they got a lot more going on with Android right now they had their home stuff going on so I think Ted's that they had to choose or probably go to IO I think Google has also been pretty good at still giving out free hardware which is an enticement where marks up has actually cut back on that in recent years as to what we can expect that build well there's only one keynote instead of two and it seems to be not as big as it's going to be in the past and I'm not really hearing a lot of stuff that's gonna be going on we may even hear of a second event going on that's going to talk about redstone 5 and more consumer stuff including possibly even Andromeda well to wait and see there yeah short answer I think Google has a momentum here and just unfortunate that both of these shows for the first time are going to overlap completely I think Microsoft's going to lose out a little bit here so that does it for this week's episode remember if you have a question use hashtag Asti and windows on Twitter or drop me an email and ask Dan at window central.com if you like this video gives a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe and don't forget we do our podcast every Friday at 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time on mixer comm so I swear no central so join us for more conversation there take care of buddy question use hashtag ask Ian windows on Twitter or drop me an email at asked I don't know what my email is did it to you nasty anawa no central.com okay
