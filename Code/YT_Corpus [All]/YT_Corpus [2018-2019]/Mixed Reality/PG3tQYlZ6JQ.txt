 what if there was a better way to collaborate a better way to build and work together a way that brought us closer as if we were sitting next to each other  face to face what if our creativity could burst to life in the space around us spatial is a collective computing environment that lets teams visualize their thoughts in the room around them so whether you're on a desktop computer or scribbling notes on your phone all your digital devices are seamlessly tied together into an infinite workspace you can manifest your ideas before your eyes  by just saying them and in a click expand them with the power of all the world's information using augmented reality's infinite canvas pixels become tactile letting you manipulate them like clay we believe digital and physical worlds should live in harmony together you can sketch ideas out on paper or have them exist digitally spatial brings people and ideas together into a single shared environment letting us work together in profound new ways so whether your teams are spread around the world or you're exploring new worlds whether you're in a fancy AR headsets or connecting from a regular PC anybody can join the conversation and bring their ideas to the table in 2d or 3d from home or work beyond the confines of space and   traditional computing we can work together in ways we never thought possible and unlock the power of our collective intelligence as we move from personal computing to the world's first collective computer welcome to the future of collaboration
