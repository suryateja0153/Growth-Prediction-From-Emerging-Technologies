 Hey up, Iron Man fans! In this video, we gonna make Real Tony Stark Repulsor. No LED lamp and no computer graphic, Confess, that lamp in a hand doesn`t give us feeling of being Real Iron Man and real plasma shot. And unfortunately, we still haven`t got computer graphic in Russia So I`m gonna make a real plasma repulsor! What is the main idea? I haven`t invented Arc reactor like in iron man movie so far. So I will use my hydrogen reactor to get plasma shot. All I need are small hydrogen tanks on my hand to collect fuel gas. And some tubes and wires to connect tanks with repulsor and operate it. And I suppose it is more similar to Stark Hi-Tech than simple lamps. Tanks, tubes, wires, and repulsor have to be fixed on my hand. And I decided to fix it on metal exoskeleton as Tony did it. The components are known. And we have only place in the city,  where we can get all this stuff. So stay clear of the closing doors. The next station is Leroy Merlin After a few hundred of hydrogen detonations I noticed that you couldn`t see it on video. I mean you see it, but that`s not the same that I see. The speed of hydrogen explosion is so high that my camera doesn`t record it. So I decided to add some gas with lower combustion speed. By the way, Tony Stark uses exactly this gas in Iron Man 3. So let us see what are hydrogen plus MAPP gas shots look like. And the main point of this model is that gives you the FEELING of being real Iron Man. I am Iron man Subscribe to my channel not to miss other videos of hydrogen technologies.
