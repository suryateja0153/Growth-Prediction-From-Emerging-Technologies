 [F1 cars passing] In this video I'm going to try to find out how fast you can go in factorio, vanilla. We begin with regular walking speeds which is a measly 32 km/h (20 mph). Let's add some legs in the following configuration. We have more than doubled the speed to 68 km/h (42 mph). Now a single reactor isn't powerful enough to power all these legs so we put a second reactor in like this. We reach over 90 km/h (56 mph). Legs only use power when running so you can supplement the power with batteries instead of a second reactor. We get a setup like this, now we almost reach a 110 km/h (68 mph). Let's swap out the second reactor as well. We almost reach 130 km/h (80 mph), which is 4 times regular walking speed. You can walk over belts to increase your speed even more. Now we're going 135 km/h (84 mph). if we swap out the yellow belt for blue belt we almost reached 150 km/h (93 mph) 4.5 times as fast as regular walking speed we can add a stone surface and increase our speeds to over 185 km/h (115 mph) If we swap out the stone for concrete we reach 200 (124 mph) km/h, six times as fast as regular walking speed. And if we use refined concrete we get about 215 km/h (133 mph). a regular train can reach speeds of up to 259 km/h (160 mph), but it has very bad acceleration. If we use nuclear fuel the train goes about 300 km/h (186 mph) nine times as fast as regular walking speed. The experienced factor your players will think that we have reached the end of the video but we can go a lot faster, we are still missing a mode of transportation. As you can see we can move by just entering and exiting vehicles. If we use a train network especially laid out for entering and exiting we can reach speeds between 320 (199 mph) and 1030 km/h (640 mph). This speed is a bit inconsistent you can expect an average speed of about 800 km/h (497 mph). I would like to point out that the speed of sound on Earth's and regular conditions is 1234.8 km/h (767 mph), we're getting close to that and were not done yet. Because the speed of this new mode of transportation is dependent on the size of the vehicle, the larger the vehicle the further you can go upon entering. There is another vehicle that is way bigger that can only be entered because of an Easter egg. You can enter the rocket if you add a car as payloads this gives us again inconsistent speeds, speeds between 25 times regular walking speed or about 800 km/h (497 mph) and 60.65 times regular walking speed or about 1944.5 km/h (1208 mph) or mach 1.57. Now you can expect an average speed of about 1,000 km/h (621 mph) or mach 0.8 that's fast enough to travel from the center of a normal map to the very edge in about an hour. I hope you liked these record-breaking speeds, if you did consider subscribing. No really, if you haven't subscribed already... It really helps.
