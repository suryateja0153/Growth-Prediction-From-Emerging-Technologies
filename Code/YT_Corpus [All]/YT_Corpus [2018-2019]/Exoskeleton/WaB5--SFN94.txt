 that's it and Eileen and what yes you do and you can turn yeah you turn okay well I remember that that was a disabled man walking with the help of an exoskeleton suit developed by ReWalk robotics as about four years ago on this program you saw it now they're back the new product it's for stroke survivors who can no longer walk joining us now is ReWalk robotics CEO Larry Kozinski Larry welcome back good morning thanks for having us doing fine work there young man we are we're very excited about what we've had develop here now this this new suit lighter easier to work did you develop it specifically for stroke victims this is designed specifically for stroke but also in the future can help people with MS and Parkinson's it's about one seventh of the weight and about one seventh of the cost of the types of products that were made for the paralyzed community so it's has a lot of economic and physical benefit okay so it's not a huge suit it's an appliance to a specific part of the body I like on the leg throw yeah essentially we've stripped away a lot of the things that held up the entire human body and focus just on what's needed so if you need to move the ankle joint and eventually the hip joint it can it can do just that in a much more miniaturized way and it's reliant on a combination of sensors that tell it how to move and unique fabrics that are very soft but we can transmit force with okay now behind me Kathleen O'Donnell is with us she's one of the project managers here she's up on our little balcony right there and we've got one of these skeletal exoskeleton suits with us now Kathleen welcome to the shows good to see you good to be here can you move it I don't know whether we can pick up the movement but usually so so as Larry mentioned we really stripped away all of the rigid components so it allows the user to walk with their own natural gait and what it does it has these cables that run basically across the ankle joint and when those cables contracts in time with the muscles underneath it helps to move the foot up and down so this is the insole that goes in so if I were to release the cables you can see now the ankle is free to move so I don't think our audience could probably see much of that but would the person who is injured or disabled would they have to do this on the little screen or no absolutely so there there are two sensors in the in the feet and it picks up on the way they're walking and it automatically adjusts as they change their walking well what is it sense I mean sensors on the foot well the sensors muscle contractions it's sensing the movement of their walking and then it synchronizes based on how long their steps are how fast they're walking so if the physical therapists ask them to change something about their gait they can actually respond and the suit will respond to that change in their walking so just by thinking it and trying to get their muscles to move they're helped in that muscle movement and the leg movement exactly and then the the cables will contract in time and it'll physically assist the foot to lift up for ground clearance and then it'll lift the heel up to push them forward during walking Larry have you got full FDA clearance to market suits like that we are working out the big news that we have yet right now yet but we've finished it and we're building commercial design now and we just started a major clinical trial which will be used a basis for it so we see that FDA clearance coming in early 2019 so we're well on the way with a commercial product that's really ready for patients today let me go back to the suit that you demonstrated for us four years ago which was the full suit and we had that paralyzed man literally walking in this studio did you sell a lot of those suits was it a while commercial success it's a success but it's growing gradually we're up to about 500 people using them worldwide the main challenge has next been getting the insurers to cover it and we've had great success recently in both Germany and Italy and somewhat with the VA and our expectations this year we'll continue to work with the u.s. to get the insurers to cover here well good 42 different jurors pay for it the United States saw on a case by case in Macau aggressively now we're gonna make it policies Kathleen thank you very much for the demonstration we appreciate it and Larry thanks for being with us you're doing good work right there thank you very much thank you
