 great story and that's why you graduates stole the show as he accepted his diploma today although amento uses a wheelchair but today he used a special device it's called an exoskeleton to walk across the commencement stage I meant as an international student from Venezuela he was seriously injured back in 2015 in a diving accident at a pool momento says his brief walk took many many hours of practice with that exoskeleton but he says it was well worth it it was an amazing experience I feel really honored and proud being able to walk across the stage everything really happen so a mentor graduated with a bachelor's degree in of course electrical engineering what else he plans to continue his studies though with a master's degree good for him look at that dual accomplishments they're walking on stage and then getting his bachelor's degree
