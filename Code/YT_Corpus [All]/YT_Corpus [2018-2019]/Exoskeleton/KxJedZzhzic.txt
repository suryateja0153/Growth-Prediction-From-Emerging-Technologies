 Miami's latest skyscraper looks like no other designed by a Zaha Hadid Architects the distinctive 62 story residential tower is situated on Biscayne Boulevard and features the architects signature curved forms but these sinuous shapes our farm aesthetic flourishes there are in fact the building structure this tower has an exoskeleton named 1,000 museum the skyscraper is described as an ultra luxury condo development the 700 foot high tower is the epitome of luxury containing just 83 units and with the most expensive apartments on the market at 49 million US dollars the building offers stunning views across Miami and boosts a two-story Aquatic Center Sky Lounge multimedia theater and the city's first private helicopter pad but the project's most impressive feature is arguably that sinuous frame that climbs up all four elevations and usually much of the structural supports for 1000 Museum light outside of the building structure rather like the skirts urn of an insect the exoskeleton was designed to maximize the amount of less able open floor space within the building although several contractors proposed a conventional structure within the curving exterior concrete forms Zaha Hadid Architects was determined these elements be more than just a design flourish the result is an exoskeleton that is a key component of the skyscraper structure taking both gravitational and lateral those its position on the building's exterior also provides a high degree of overall rigidity along with eliminating the need for column lines between the Centers of saw blades and the perimeter walls the exoskeleton also allow the thickness of the building's central service core to be reduced while traditional proposals for achieving the structure includes a three foot thick concrete shear wall core the concrete excess guts embracing along with a post-tensioned floor slab system meant the core wall thickness could be reduced by half exoskeletons are far from typical in skyscraper construction so building this structure presented significant engineering construction and logistical challenges although the team initially considered using conventional cast Institue reinforced concrete for the entire access curtain this proved to be too expensive the permanent formwork system for the exoskeleton was designed using glass fiber reinforced concrete or GF RC a type of concrete containing extremely strong strands of glass gee FRC was first used by the Hardys in her project team to form the cutting at the Heydar Aliev center in azerbaijan for 1000 museum some 4,800 pieces if gia farsi were fabricated in dubai and shipped to Miami these sections of formwork were then assembled on the site before rebar was placed inside them concrete was then poured into the formwork to completely exascale ISM being permanent formwork the GF RC molds remained on the building structure now complete this curved exoskeleton has enabled Miami's most impressive skyscrapers have become a reality whilst giving it that distinctive zaha hadid aesthetic if you enjoyed this video and would like to get more from the definitive video channel for construction subscribe to the b1m [Music]
