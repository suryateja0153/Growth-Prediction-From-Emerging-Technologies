 a device created right here in Massachusetts is helping people who have been paralyzed to walk again step by step an egg's Oh skeleton called the ReWalk is helping them regain strength and this might be only the beginning we take a closer look at the technology in tonight's Boston next the video is short because the woman taking it wants to hug her husband that paralyzed man in the exoskeleton walking again to understand the gravity of this moment you have to know how it started six months earlier in New Mexico that was a police officer I was in pursuit Oh two murder suspects in a stolen vehicle that's the night Jeremy Romero's life changed forever those murder suspects crashed their car at 100 miles an hour with Jeremy right on their tail his patrol unit flipped 12 times and when he came to Jeremy can tell from his partner's expression that the situation was dire Jeremy was paralyzed from the waist down and for the next month he figured his life was effectively over that's where this device the ReWalk comes into play and Jeremy's story it's an exoskeleton built in Marlborough that allows paralyzed people to walk again all six of your joints are mechanically controlled through the motors and gears and software that's inside each leg Larry Jasinski is the CEO and here's how it works the patient presses a button that tells the machine to stand up and when the person tilts forward the ReWalk starts walking so it's a mechanical way of the human body and a machine working together to walk anywhere someone we want to go the psychological benefits were almost immediate for Jeremy his wife and his 13 year old son and there are major physical benefits as well including the reduction in pressure sores and medications they gain lean tissue muscle tissue in their legs they lose weight and ReWalk is now expanding the technology to not just paraplegic patients but people with a disability in just one leg this is the company's new device the restor it's the same concept just boiled down they wear this around their waist just like a belt and this has two motors in it one that lifts the foot and one that propels the leg and because this robot can tell how much force you're disabled leg needs it can gradually reduce aid and help you eventually walk out of the device it's gonna be a game changer for a lot of people who have disabilities in just one leg that restore device by the way is being developed in coordination with Spaulding rehab and for people with Parkinson's or MS or if they just have a serious injury to their leg over time the device sees that you're getting more and more strength in it and it will reduce the extent to which it's helping you and eventually you start walking again and for the rest of your body that is gonna be life extending for so many perhaps we'll do that great story Liam
