 welcome to Decision Analyst's insider series webinar on the future shopper research my name is Christy Allen and I am the marketing director at decision analyst in the moderator today before I introduce our presenters I have a few notes for everyone in the handout section there are some relevant white papers and case studies available for everyone to download also please feel free to ask questions by typing in the chat box we will attempt to answer as many questions as we can at the end of the presentation if we don't answer your question during the webinar someone will respond to your question within a day or two today's presenters are Jerry W Thomas president and CEO of Decision Analyst Jerry has served as a research and analytic consultant to many major companies over the years helping them with their marketing strategy new products creation and shopper shopping research and Mike Humphrey, vice-president from decision analyst is co-presenting Mike has over 20 years experience and research including management of quantitative and qualitative research across an array of categories and research techniques focusing on volumetric forecasting and product line optimization and with that I will hand the presentation over to Jerry thank you very much for attending today's webinar on shopping research before we get started I would like to just touch on a few definitions because these might be becoming blurred because of changes in the environment the term self-service retail stores when we use that term we're referring to the fact that the customer can see the product on the Shelf can touch it can put those products in a basket or cart and take them and check-out so that's what we mean by self-service retail stores a more recent development as been the self-checkout retail store course they're already self-service stores for the most part but in addition to that they're self checkout that is there some type of an electronic check out that the shopper does herself and then when we use the term online sales we don't care whether that product was delivered through a retail store or delivered directly to one's home if the purchase decision and the order was placed online then we're classifying that as an online sale a little history of retailing to set the stage during the second from about 1850 to 1900 there were a number of developments the the beginnings of food processing and food canning developed and along with that came standardized products produced in manufactured manufacturing facilities with standardized packaging of sometime at the same time companies began to develop brands and branding to differentiate those mass-produced products so this was all going on from 1850 to 1900 in the u.s. self-service retail stores began to evolve in the 1900 to 1920 era and it wasn't something that magically happened one time it was a gradual evolution no doubt Piggly Wiggly supermarkets are often cited as the first company but at my advanced stage I don't believe any of those claims anymore I'm sure there was a broad gradual movement towards self-service but but just think of it as something that begins during the 1900 1920 era in self-service retailing continued to grow during the 30s and and the 40s during the Great Depression in World War two but it really took off and really expanded rapidly at the end of World War two as the consumer economy came back and rationing was ended the 1950s in the 1960s were really the golden age of shopping research and retail experimentation when I first came into the marketing research industry in the mid nineteen 1960s a long time ago it's amazing but there were a number of marketing research companies that specialized in in-store testing or retail experimentation and retail testing those companies have long since had gone out of business so there was tremendous amount of experimentation and research conducted in stores related to the shopping experience and then of course the next big major shift in retailing occurred in the late 1990s with the emergence of online shopping so our perspective will be mostly brand centric rather than retailer centric that is we could do a presentation on shopping research purely from the perspective of the retailer or purely from the perspective of the brand so we're gonna be biased toward the brand but we will bring in retailer and retailing issues from time to time so in a broad sense if you think about the marketing of a brand it's all of these things on the screen from targeting and messaging and packaging and promotion and distribution those are the those are the issues that we're going to touch on today with a little mix of retail issues involved so we at decision analyst employee a very broad definition of shopper insights or shopping research because so many problems can't be solved if you have a narrow perspective on what shopping research includes so in our broad view and our definition shopping research includes geographical analysis it includes retailed and retailing analyses website and app analyses that are part of the purchase process the category and sales analysis category analysis the brand itself and all the variables involved in marketing a brand packaging this play in planograms and of course pricing and promotion so we'll touch on all of those subjects Geographic analysis there's a geographic dimension to virtually every marketing problem and when you think about marketing a given brand or even if you're thinking about from a retail perspective geography is an incredibly and important variable you know it begins with what's the market potential by different types of households and what are the optimal markets or targets for a brand and what's the trade area around given stores and what's the optimal site for retailers or the optimal store for a given site or for a given brand so there are a lot of interacting in interactive issues here and a big issue that is almost never included in geographic analysis that we think should be included is the interactions between the density of retail stores and advertising budgets or advertising efficiency if you have high density in of retail stores in a given geographic area you can have dominant advertising so and the more advertising you have the denser you can pack the stores in the given geographic area so this is a really interesting angle or dimension to Geographic analysis that we rarely think about and then from the retailer perspective there are a lot of issues that I we think think of fall within the shopping research arena so what's the optimal number of retail units in a given geographic area this is a huge question with huge implications and and there are methods and techniques that can be used to answer that question a related question but kind of asking the question backwards is if you have a site that you think's relatively good then the question becomes what's the ideal store design for that given location very often we assume the store is fixed and then we're looking for sites to place that unit but you could go at it from the other direction is what's the best unit for each side so these are the kinds of issues that we address in retailer or retailing analyses you know involving things like what's the shopping and traffic patterns within the store and what's the linkage between online marketing and purchases versus and mortar distribution so this is a growing issue how do you optimize how do you optimize the marketing given that we now have to in some ways competing distribution systems an example of how this retail analysis can can intersect with the brand analyses we once had a brand that came to us and they were within distribution in a major retail chain and their turnover rate their escape SKU turnover rate was so low that they were about to be kicked out of this major food retailer so we did some geographical analyses and target market analyses and plotted that against all of the stores in this retail chains chain using GIS techniques and what we discovered is that about 20% of this chains stores were located in geographic areas where this particular product would do well so then they were able to go back to the retailer and say we don't want to be in all of your stores because our average turnover rate is too low we would like to be in these 20% of your stores at these addresses and once they did that they were they had high turnover rate in those stores and they were able to maintain distribution so they could then take that model and apply to other retailers and build effective distribution for their brand so the next level is category analysis and again you can look at categories from the perspective of the retail or where you're trying to optimize the number and type of categories within the store so that's one type of category analysis but our focus is again from the brand perspective and that is what is the optimal way to market and organize the category within a given chain of stores so you know there all of the variables about what are the characteristics of the product category and out of people shop that category and what's the usage cycle look like and then is it a product that people tend to be extremely loyal to or are they brand switching all the time because all of these variables affect how you would do category analyses and how you would try to optimize category analyses yeah and Gerry a great example or a great tool we can use with category analysis of course is brand equity research and modeling it's really a tool to make category analysis much more powerful and actionable for instance we've done a lot of brand equity and brand loyalty modeling in the home services category to better understand a brand's value consumer loyalty to brands what importance they place on that likelihood to churn or switch providers another tool and category analysis of course is just traditional segmentation research which can be very powerful and important when analyzing a category both in targeting key segments and also understand what's driving shopping behaviors both among the key target segments sub segments competitive shoppers key driver analysis is also a tool that's been used for of course many years and quantitative research that is useful in category category analysis we find that key driver analysis is is much more powerful if it's designed as a standalone study rather than an add-on for a segmentation study or a bigger project the goals of key driver really need to be clear and it just comes out a lot cleaner and more actionable when done as a standalone research initiative and of course choice modeling and combined with 3d 3d animation and shelf set simulation is a really powerful category analysis set of tools as well brand analysis as we said the you know all of these variables that affect the brand are important because they they have effects in the store they have effects at retail they have effects in the category and these are just basic fundamental things that every company should know about its brands like what is your brand awareness what's the image of your brand compared to all the other brands in the category and what's the optimal position for your brand and how's your advertising awareness compared to competitive advertising awareness it's all of these basic marketing questions that well-managed companies should know or have answers to for their brand you know how does the product itself compared to competitive products these are questions by the way that all consumer goods companies 30 years ago knew the answers to these same questions in many companies today do not know the answers to because research budgets have been cut so much since the start of the great the great recession but 34 years ago virtually every major company could answer all these marketing questions because they did the basic research to answer all of these kinds of questions but all of these brand analytic questions are important in trying to optimize the shopping experience itself and a great way to to really dive deep on brand analysis is just doing some real thorough and rigorous ethnography for example or shop alongs we've had experience with shop alongs with professional tradesmen following them along in the shopping experience for tools and power our tools at different locations and this way we can see the role interaction between brand and and other aspects and also how brand and specific retailers are affecting each other and under brand impressions brand tracking of course is a necessary tool we feel quantitative brand tracking to help monitor on an ongoing basis the brand's health as well as the competitors it's important in brand tracking to include some questions around where where the consumers shop why they're shopping there that really helps us you know track trends with brands and brand perception of course brand equity modeling can be a part of any brand tracking exercise as well and just tracking the brand metrics can often be combined with advertising tracking there are many companies that do two separate tracking studies but it's generally if you have a really you know a good questionnaire designer can combine those two and save a lot of money the bigger sin is all the companies that don't track their brand or don't track the consumer so they're just running their business blind package analysis is kind of the next level of analysis involving shopping research and ranges everything from what's the optimal type of package for a category in the optimal sizes and shapes as well as package design which involves visibility and the attention value and brand name registration and what images and messages are being cade you know paid being conveyed sorry by the package design itself and then all these elements have to be integrated in harmonized so that they all come together on the shelf yeah of course one of the big challenges nowadays is creating packaging that works both in an online and in-store environment for a you know a large number of categories that's it's true these days you know this is another great fit for from a research perspective for qualitative research and ethnography and shop alongs both doing them virtually in an online environment and also a retail or in-store setting quantitative online package testing has really also progressed a long long way here in the past few years with virtual tools that we have and 3d packaging where survey respondents can pick packages off the shelf and rotate them and read different aspects instead of the traditional static or flat concept test that we've done in the past many years ago this also is a great way to simulate the experience of an online shopping occasion so we've done some research where we'll take people through like a telecom purchase decision process and really try to simulate that that experience for them in an online environment and get it as real as real life as we can the next level of analysis is the display itself and involves questions such as what's optimal shelf placement and what's the optimal number of facings and what you know should you be next to brand a or next to brand B and do you have the same planogram all year long or can you improve your brand's performance by changing its display configuration by year zooming you get retailers to cooperate with you which is a typically a big issue another question that are related to displays you you have the Shelf and you have online and then you have end aisle or non shelf displays within stores and I think mike has an interesting story about the relationship between in aisle displays and and the Shelf itself yeah so we did some research with a national dollar store chain testing different end cap combinations specifically in the snack foods category it was tested in a virtual online shopping exercise so we made it as real life as we could with an online tool this was really designed to help maximize the impact of the endcaps and determine what combination of products there would result in the most consumer purchase frequency number of products they purchased that sort of thing we found interesting ly enough from the study that just one one product one SKU placed appropriately in the end cap had a significant impact on the purchase of other snacks as well as beverages so it was really insightful from that perspective and really powerful in the in their research conclusions pricing is one of the most difficult subjects to do marketing research on because everyone has an incentive to lie and distort the truth but for a given brand and product category we really need to understand the role of pricing what what our optimal pricing differentials that is that what you know if you're raising your price at what point does it begin to trigger brand switching another big issue in and pricing are anchor points or reference points sometimes people will just not buy the most expensive product but sometimes if you put a really expensive price on one product it'll make a a lower level product look much more attractive that's what I mean by anchors or reference points so all of these factors are involved in pricing research it's really important to understand these pricing differentials and price elasticity by category it's important to understand if they're pricing thresholds virtually everyone in marketing believes and pricing thresholds that's why you see so many to 97 and a dollar 99 and 467 type pricing you see very rarely DC whole dollar pricing well does that really make a difference or not well it might in some categories but not in others so pricing is a really important area and and this requires some real sophistication in research to get it the pricing issues yeah we've done a lot of work with pricing optimization specifically in the telecom industry and other industries too you know discrete choice exercises are and designs are a great tool to get it price optimization and developing price curves and testing those thresholds price floors and price caps that Jerry referred to and really the the discrete choice approach of course gives us the advantage of forcing the respondent the survey participant to make trade-offs as they're going through a survey exercise rather than just rating things is too high or too low on a certain scale of course one of the great deliverables of a discrete choice study is a simulation tool which allows for the testing of different price points and their impact on demand for a certain product combination or a combination of a shelf set that allows us to optimize price for different products services also bundles whether it's an telecom or other industries survey respondents see the exercises they would when they're shopping online more than just rating things kind of on a monadic level or individually so pricing analyses also come into play a lot and in volumetric forecasting that is forecasting the sales of new products so we we can apply some of those techniques also in in pricing analyses promotion analysis is another major component of shopping research and in a perfect world the promotion's would reinforce brands positioning so if your for example Bennigan's was an Irish restaurant before it went out of business but they did a wonderful job of using their promotions to reinforce the brand strategic positioning so they really played to their Irish positioning and Irish heritage and on st. Patrick's Day they would put up you know sell green beer and have tents and Irish bands and everyone came and paid a premium price to participate in their promotions which also reinforced their positioning so that's example of how promotions work in a world of perfect worlds an idea that it's very important when you think about promotion is reach versus frequency if you are trying to introduce a new product and your goal is to get new trier then the purpose of your promotion is reach you're trying to bring in as many new people as possible if you have an established brand and you're trying to boost frequency of purchase you're trying to get people to buy one more hamburger a month then it's a you're on a frequency strategy and the promotions are trying to generate frequency so it's really important to think about your promotions and whether your goal is reach or your goal is frequency because that leads you to different types of promotions and a practical application for promotional analysis is another discrete choice approach that we often use max def technique again it's forcing trade offs with these promotions and and forcing a ranking of the promotions rather than on a rating scale it really allows us to optimize the mix of promotions and messages using turf techniques like Jerry referred to you know for instance that the top three ranked promotions or messages may not be the ones that we want to use if they're all reaching the same audience so we want to get a unique combination of promotions and messages that reach the widest variety of our widest group of our target segments of course good qualitative research is always recommended when developing promotions we always recommend some qualitative research to help refine messages and promotions also whittle down the potential promotions this can also of course be a part of a larger discrete choice study and test it in more of a real-life manner if you will which is a really a great rigorous way to test promotions and bundles as part of a larger choice design the volumetric implications of promotion as I mentioned we do a lot of volumetric forecasting that is forecasting the sales volume for new products so those those volumetric forecasting techniques can also be applied to promotion analysis and you can begin to see what's your return on investment for different types of promotions there are a number of research methods used in shopping research we'll go through those just quickly to touch base the first I mentioned earlier or the the geographical dimension we typically use various GIS platforms or geographical information systems and you can think of a geographical information system as layers of data atop each other so that you can see in a three-dimensional space how all of these variables interact and relate to each other so GIS type analyses or you know we use for trade area analyses and modeling and prediction and how to predict the trade area for a given store which is important insight selection modeling and site optimization trying to map market potential for a given brand or given retailer so all of the geographic information can be organized in a concise way and and presented in an understandable way to to marketing executives qualitative research may be the single most important type of research for for shopping insights and shopping research we we love depth interviews because we can talk to someone about a particular shopping experience we can have them take pictures we can even put you know glasses on them so we can see what they're seeing in the store and then we can interview them and depth about what they were looking at and why they were looking at it so qualitative research we do a lot of shopping type depth you think of those as kind of a quasi depth interview while people are shopping and and with the mobile you know with the mobile telephone and the camera we can take pictures now in retail stores or take pictures of websites that we never could have we'd never had visibility in before so so there's a lot of potential to use the camera within smartphones also camera technologies improve so much now that it's possible to use cameras we put cameras in automobiles for example to monitor husband and wife while they're shopping various types of retail especially fast food so qualitative research allows us to really dig deeper to use projective techniques and so forth so conjunct and choice modeling we've talked about these techniques today for a couple of applications and shopper research and of course conjoint and choice modeling is all about optimizing product features and service bundles packaging shelf displays pricing and so on and again the real advantage of this approach is the the trade-offs that you force consumers to do and it you know that really helps us optimize price and other aspects of a product and package and services it's really an efficient way to accomplish a lot in one project or study of course we always recommend as Jerry was just talking about we always recommend doing some some good rigorous qualitative research before we enter into a conjoint or choice choice modeling quantitative survey to help refine the pricing the product combinations and the attributes and levels that we're going to be testing when testing concepts the choice modeling approach can be applied you can test like a thousand concepts all at one time with choice modeling so you get the cost per concept down to fifty dollars yes it's a rarely use but but a powerful approach and you know Survey Research is still an extremely valuable tool here in shopper insights and shopper research we think it's sometimes good gets put on the back burner sometimes with the trends and new techniques we see in marketing research these days and shopper insights but you know good old-fashioned Survey Research is still an extremely valuable tool to understand more about shoppers in a particular category these are just some examples here of different survey tools to help better understand shoppers it's important to select the one or two approaches or designs here that best answers the objectives and just I can't I can't overstate the importance of basic types of research that companies need to be doing on an ongoing basis basis it's kind of like doing your homework when you're in college you know that homework really saves you in the end and awareness trial and usage studies used to be done for every brand for virtually every company they're rarely done now so so many companies don't really know what's going on in the environment where they're trying to market their products so the last topic and we've touched upon this but there are a lot of advanced analytics techniques that can be used as a part of shopping research depending on what you're trying to accomplish we've talked a lot about choice modeling but the whole family of multiple regression techniques and discriminant analyses and their data mining techniques and routines and even artificial intelligence and machine learning can be included predictive analytics certainly in the whole site selection work and trying to optimize the trade area for a given store a lot of application of predictive analytics and so forth so advanced analytics is really important because often we have really large data sets that we can work on and apply some of these really powerful modeling techniques so we've had a question or two come in Mike do you have those yeah yeah we've got one question here Jerry and I think it's best for for you to to answer here but how do you deal with some of the trends these days with the overlap of consumer insights and shopper insights departments it's kind of an interesting history if you go back 50 years marketing research departments and major corporations covered they and they did a lot of consumer research and they did all of the shock being research and all of the syndicated research and all most of the data analytics so all of the marketing research functions were closely integrated today many companies you know have shopper insights and then they have consumer insights departments and where it's possible the goal here is very close integration of these two departments or these two functions they should report to the same boss in a world of perfect worlds they should be copying each other on everything and many of the projects that both groups undertake should be joint projects should be closely integrated because they're both learning things and every project that would help the other group or the other team yeah I think we you know we've seen this movement toward calling departments consumer insights versus marketing research and you can you can argue one way or the other on whether that's a good title for the department or not but really trying to you know address concerns of different organizations in the in the company is important making sure everyone understands the objectives of research that's to take place you know kind of getting the group together to talk through the best way to approach business objectives and challenges for the business I think is a really good plan when you're executing a research program we have one more question here Jerry what do you see is the future of online shopping and how will that impact shopper our different techniques and on shopper research that's a that's a really profound an interesting question and I've thought a lot about this question right now online sales in the consumer world account for about somewhere between 10 and 12 percent of total sails and if you and so you so you try to think about extreme so if we go a hundred years into the future will all retailing be online my doubt that it's you know because if all retailing were online you could attack it with retail stores very effectively because stores have some Vantage's over online and vice versa so the most interesting question is where where is the balancing point where is the tipping point because right now there's so much money being invested in the online distribution system there's so much advertising support being put behind it there's so much investment money in the online that it's inflating the power or the appeal of online versus traditional retail stores which are spending and investing at much lower levels so where it's all gonna shake out is a very complicated issue but I think we're gonna have many retailers in business a hundred years from now doing very well thank you very much but I would say that you know if you departed pins on time to you I I think once we get up around the twenty thirty percent level of online sales I think it's going to be very difficult to go beyond that over a long period of time we might significantly but I would bet you the rate of growth of online sales is even beginning to slow that is the ends instantaneous rate is beginning to diminish even now at the eleven twelve percent level and I think a lot of that will depend on the the rate of these mergers and acquisitions like we see Amazon acquiring Whole Foods in the past few years and business mergers like that and how be interesting to see how that affects the online versus traditional retail world I think that's all the questions we had for today so Christy I'll turn it back over to you now thank you everyone for attending today's insider series webinar if you have any questions please feel free to email Gerry or Mike our next insider series webinar will be on attribution modeling and multi-channel marketing it will be on November 14th thank you again for attending and have a wonderful rest of the day you
