 okay here we go yeah thank you very much for giving me the chance also to introducing our paper which is a completely different context it's about radiology and Diagnostics and I want to motivate my talk by bringing you into a scenario in a healthcare scenario which is actually on our daily plate so imagine you have to go to the doctors and then what happens is you have to do a checkup and what can happen is that you for example are a patient that needs to get an MRI scan and scenario starts which looks like if we simplify it like this so we have a radiologist and he's gathering data usually DICOM data which is medical later of course and then he uses a desktop PC or a 2d screen to analyze this kind of data and then hopefully you get the right treatment you deserve and you need when we look at this process we actually think that it may look like this right so there's a lot of a lot of risk on this plate so we think okay a radiologist is having an ambient room is a very in a very cool situation has some time to do this and of course we want to give them the best possibility to do a ride analysis we looked into that and what we realized is that it looks sometimes more like this so we have a radiologist who has like just very simple yeah accessibility to some desktop or other yeah PC desktop solutions and what happens here of course is that you have a lot of different influences like for example your flight it could be sunlight or artificial light and this of course influences a lot of things like for example contrast when it comes to radiology it's very important since we sometimes they need to see very fine detail to tighten to make a diagnosis and that of course changes when you have a lot of influencing factors as well as what also changes is of course then you have to maybe change the desktop you display and so on and it can also lead to bad posture for the radiologist so that's what current research is actually already looking in and we thought about since okay we have these cool kind of technology so we of course wanna use this also maybe in this context and hope it makes sense right so we looked into this topic and then realized okay whitter reality is already there are some implications of course that are very clear when it comes to this context that for example when we use a headset in virtual reality we can disconnect the radiologist from the real world which in this case is a good thing since you can focus on the actual task we also have a lot of space that we can use for sure and we have a high degree of mobility and last but not least of course we can also not in just show 2d data but 3d data and do this with in terms of stereoscopic vision meaning that we can really visualize it on a high scale for this kind of diagnosis but when we were looking into literature we were also realizing that there is something missing so people just saying okay there's a lot of potential and there are a lot of benefits where we should use virtual reality or any kind of augmented reality but what about the interaction so we need to give radiologists like intuitive devices or systems so they can use it because we know that still even though we want it to be different the awareness and acceptance of this kind of technology is still not as we actually imagine so we defined a research question which is basically about okay how can we change them how can we do that and therefore we want to see what kind of concepts are needed and how can we do that and also evaluate that that it may be applicable for radiologists therefore we designed a virtual environment and tried three different interaction concepts the one is an indirect concept and we have a semi indirect concept and we developed a direct concept which is all based on the control symmetry of devices of the object meaning how we actually can or the radiologists can control such an environment I will come to this in a minute but first how did we derive that so of course we did not do just guess how this works but we methodology wise we did a first free study by asking for radiologists and also 9ux experts which have also a background in medical engineering and we asked them okay what are the issues and how can we basically solve them and what came to conclusion is that functionality-wise it is very important for radiologists to do windowing and scrolling meaning they have these slices of pictures of a specific area of your body and then they want to scroll through it which is very simple so slice by slice and what they also want to do is they want to do win during meaning that they want to change the contrast and also the brightness of the picture since we know that they are not using a lot of Technology in their everyday life or in the current life or in their work life we thought okay we tried an very minimalistic approach and where we use gestures and leave out the controller interaction for itself therefore we had or we use the interaction fidelity model to design our our different kind of interactions and whereas the input veracity and the biomechanical symmetry stayed the same so we used an gestures and hand motions by using the leap motion device we change the control symmetry of how you can change objects from a very direct interaction - what's an indirect direction and evaluated this I think all of you know that so that's how the approach is going so you use the leap motion and put it in front of the car in front of your headset and then you're able by introducing infrared light and using infrared camera to exactly know the position of your hands right ok so first of all here you see the virtual environment we created so we have a working desktop which is placed in the front and then we have two different kind of screens which you used for a first trials of meaning we have what the radiologist needs is they need slices from three different perspectives so meaning the kernel the staggered cell and also the axial plane and then they can use and diagnose and start doing what they want to do so for selecting we did a very simple approach meaning that we just used the center field of view and if somebody is looking towards a picture then it's selected on the desktop as you see here and then in the next step they would they are able to interact with it for really interacting on this we used a direct interaction as we said before where people can really start grabbing and using the desktop to change the individual parameters they want to and then for example as you see here scroll through the data set and do a very intense analysis we also have a semi direct approach where we use an object reference like these bars which is a very classical approach and we also use an indirect approach where we use pinch gestures to give them the possibility to perform the same action yeah as I said before we were very interested in how it is perceived by the radiologists so we use nine Radio heavy that is nine we had nine participant which were nine radiologists they didn't have a lot of experience with virtual reality before as we already knew and they never used gesture interaction or hand interaction for it we let them let them perform three different tasks in virtual reality meaning they had to scroll through a data set and then do a diagnosis towards the kidney the lungs and abdominal aorta and of course meanwhile they were doing a think aloud which gives us the possibility to observe how their experience was and parameter wise we looked into the user experience in the usability of the system and the individual interaction concepts and therefore we could state that yeah I will come to this later but we use the user experience questionnaire which is a validated questionnaire to look into the attractiveness meaning we wanted to see the pragmatic and hedonic quality of the device and therefore figure out what it can be used best and first I want to start with the start with the usability so in the pictures before you've seen that we use this 3d model as a reference to give the radiologists the possibility to see where they are in their slice deck and what they can and where they can go depending on the on the plane they just selected and they let us know that they are not really interested in that so as you can see here on the evaluation or on the result they don't need that they say they are very good with actually using 2d slices of the data so they would not use that anymore what is very pleasing though is that they got the hand interaction seemed to be very intuitive for them and also there weren't a lot of missing so they felt very well in virtual reality when we lose look at the selection task then we see that there are overall very yeah satisfying results but what we see in terms of dependability is that we have still elect there and I think it's because we're using the approach of just using the center field to select specific objects but we will come to that in the discussion and also when we look into the three different interaction concepts like the direct the semi direct and the indirect one we can see that in terms of pragmatic quality meaning perspicuity efficiency and also dependability we have a tendency that the direct interaction with the objects perform best and we also see that the indra direct interaction has a lack when it comes to dependability so in conclusion I want to say that we actually find our approach very promising so which reality should be a part of diagnosis since we have plenty of advantages we explored three different interaction concept for it concepts were that and we figured out that people really or radiologists also are really interested in having a direct interaction for future work as I said before we want to implement not only it select we want to enhance the selection task and therefore we want to implement case tracking to improve well and that we always know where people are looking at we actually want to redesign the 3d model because we think it's still important for the radiologists they just are not used to work with that so we have to give it another thought and of course we also want to enable out of field of view interaction meaning one reason why the dependability when it comes to the interact in direct interaction was so low is that when people are not in the tracking area of the magic leap of course then no interaction could be performed and we want to perform we want to compare our results not by just looking at the user experience and usability but also do some hard measurements meaning we want to do some performance measurements with this I want to close my talk and thank you and I'm welcome to answer questions [Applause] [Music] thanks Marcus microphones are at the front so you you've created some new interaction techniques for diagnostic radiology as you mentioned it's sort of a very sensitive art where they have to have fine contrast yeah do you think or did you notice any differences in their ability to accurately perceive different elements of the the radiology based on their interaction technique do you think that ability to use it accurately so I think that's still a problem because especially when it comes to accuracy it's very hard to go through the data set so we but we were very curious about this as well so we did it in we had some post interview result as results about half about that you can read that in the paper but the radiologists were saying that it's already very good for them to deal with that also using this early stage of prototype so yeah but we want to investigate into that on the other hand would would have brought some more accuracy in this case what it means you use the controller because then we use the HTC bite for that and then we would have known that the accuracy is higher but it's not when we are honest and we go to the application area then we have to say okay that's not an approach because they would not use it in the future I've got one other question another potential use of radiology is to explain to patients what is potentially wrong with them or communicate their health or something like that yeah I thought about the patient experience and the interactions in VR in that case we want to do this as the next step because it's also related with cooperation so a lot of radiologists let us know that they are very interested in just quickly sharing their results and they can do it in 2d but they would really appreciate that's the topic about having a 3d model and working on it together so that's what they haven't experienced before and they've like to have it in the future perfect let's thank mark
