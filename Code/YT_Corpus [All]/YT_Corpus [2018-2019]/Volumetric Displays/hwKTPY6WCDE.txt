 radar is a detection system that uses radio waves to determine the range angle or velocity of objects it can be used to detect aircraft ships spacecraft guided missiles motor vehicles weather formations and terrain a radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain a transmitting antenna receiving antenna often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the objects radio waves pollster continuous from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver giving information about the objects location and speed radar was developed secretly for military use by several nations in the period before and during World War two a key development was the cavity magnetron in the UK which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution the term radar was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for radio detection and ranging or radio direction and ranging the term radar has since entered English and other languages as a common noun losing all capitalization the modern uses of radar are highly diverse including air and terrestrial traffic control radar astronomy air defense systems anti-missile systems marine radars to locate landmarks and other ships aircraft anti-collision systems ocean surveillance systems outer space surveillance and rendezvous systems meteorological precipitation monitoring out imagery and flight control systems guided missile target locating systems ground-penetrating radar for geological observations and range controlled radar for public health surveillance high-tech radar systems are associated with digital signal processing machine learning and are capable of extracting useful information from very high noise levels other systems similar to radar make use of other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum one example is litter which uses predominantly infrared light from lasers rather than radio waves pick history topic first experiments as early as 1886 German physicist Heinrich Hertz showed that radio waves could be reflected from solid objects in 1895 Alexander Popov a physics instructor at the Imperial Russian Navy school in Kronstadt developed an apparatus using a coherer tube for detecting distant lightning strikes the next year he added a spark-gap transmitter in 1897 while testing this equipment for communicating between two ships in the Baltic Sea he took note of an interference beep caused by the passage of a third vessel in his report Popov wrote that this phenomenon might be used for detecting objects but he did nothing more with this observation the German inventor Kristian Hulse Meyer was the first to use radio waves to detect the presence of distant metallic objects in 1904 he demonstrated the feasibility of detecting a ship in dense fog but not it's distance from the transmitter he obtained a patent for his detection device in April 1904 and later a patent for a related amendment for estimating the distance to the ship he also got a British patent on September 23rd 1904 for a full radar system that he called a telomere bulla scope it operated on a 50 centimeters wavelength and the pulsed radar signal was created via a spark gap his system already used the classic antenna setup of horn antenna with parabolic reflector and was presented to German military officials in practical tests in Cologne and Rotterdam Harbor but was rejected in 1915 Robert watson-watt used radio technology to provide advanced warning to Airmen and during the 1920s went on to lead the UK research establishment to make many advances using radio techniques including the probing of the ionosphere and the detection of lightning at long distances through his lightning experiments watson-watt became an expert on the use of radio direction-finding before turning his inquiry to shortwave transmission requiring a suitable receiver for such studies he told the new boy arnold frederick wilkins to conduct an extensive review of available shortwave units Wilkins would select a general post office model after noting its manuals description of a fading effect the common term for interference at the time when aircraft flew overhead across the Atlantic in 1922 after placing a transmitter and receiver on opposite sides of the Potomac River u.s. Navy researchers a Hoyt Taylor and Leo see young discovered that ships passing through the beam path caused the received signal to fade in and out Taylor submitted a report suggesting that this phenomenon might be used to detect the presence of ships in low visibility but the Navy did not immediately continue the work eight years later Lawrence a Highland at the Naval Research Laboratory NRL observed similar fading effects from passing aircraft this revelation led to a patent application as well as a proposal for further intensive research on radio echo signals from moving targets to take place at NRL where Taylor and Young were based at the time topic just before World War two before the Second World War researchers in the United Kingdom France Germany Italy Japan the Netherlands the Soviet Union and the United States independently and in great secrecy developed technologies that led to the modern version of radar Australia Canada New Zealand and South Africa followed pre-war Great Britain's radar development and Hungary generated its radar technology during the war in France in 1934 following systematic studies on the split anode magnetron the research branch of the company general did telegraphy sans fill CSF headed by Maurice Ponte with Unruh guttin Sylvain Berlin and M Hagen began developing an obstacle locating radio apparatus aspects of which were installed on the ocean liner Normandy in 1935 during the same period Soviet military engineer pko Chekov in collaboration with leningrad electro physical institute produced an experimental apparatus rapid capable of detecting an aircraft within three kilometers of a receiver the Soviets produced their first mass production radars Russ one and Russ to read it in 1939 but further development was slowed following the arrest of Oh Shep keV and his subsequent gulag sentence in total only 607 reddit stations were produced during the war the first Russian airborne radar nice - entered into service in June 1943 on PE two fighters more than 230 Niceto stations were produced by the end of 1944 the French and Soviet systems however featured continuous wave operation that did not provide the full performance ultimately synonymous with modern radar systems full radar evolved as a pulsed system and the first such elementary apparatus was demonstrated in December 1934 by the American Robert M Paige working at the Naval Research Laboratory the following year the United States Army successfully tested a primitive surface-to-surface radar to aim coastal battery searchlights at night this design was followed by a pulsed system demonstrated in May 1935 by Rudolph Kuhn hold and the firm Gemma in Germany and then another in June 1935 by an air ministry team led by Robert a watson-watt in Great Britain in 1935 watson-watt was asked to judge recent reports of a German radio based death ray and turned the request over to Wilkins Wilkins returned a set of calculations demonstrating the system was basically impossible when watson-watt then asked what such a system might do wilkins recalled the earlier report about aircraft causing radio interference this revelation led to the Daventry experiment of the 26th of February 1935 using a powerful BBC shortwave transmitter as the source and their GPO receiver set up in a field while a bomber flew around the site when the plane was clearly detected Hugh Dowding the air member for supply and research was very impressed with their systems potential and funds were immediately provided for further operational development Watson Watts team patented the device in G b-59 301 7 development of radar greatly expanded on the first of September 1936 when Watson watt became superintendent of a new establishment under the British Air Ministry Bawdsey research station located in Bawdsey Manor near Felixstowe suffolk work there resulted in the design and installation of aircraft detection and tracking stations called chain home along the east and south coasts of england in time for the outbreak of world war ii in 1939 this system provided the vital advanced information that helped the Royal Air Force win the Battle of Britain without it significant numbers of fighter aircraft would always need to be in the air to respond quickly enough if enemy aircraft detection relied solely on the observations of ground-based individuals also vital was the doubting system of reporting and coordination to make best use of the radar information during tests of early deployment of radar in 1936 and 1937 given all required funding and development support the team produced working radar systems in 1935 and began deployment by 1936 the first five chain home CH systems were operational and by 1940 stretched across the entire UK including Northern Ireland even by standards of the era CH was crude instead of broadcasting and receiving from a named antenna CH broadcast a signal floodlight the entire area in front of it and then used one of watts and watts own radio direction finders to determine the direction of the returned echoes this fact meant CH transmitters had to be much more powerful and have better antennas than competing systems but allowed its rapid introduction using existing technologies topic during World War two a key development was the cavity magnetron in the UK which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution britain shared the technology with the US during the 1940 Tizard mission in april 1940 popular science showed an example of a radar unit using the watson-watt patent in an article on air defense also in late 1941 Popular Mechanics had an article in which a u.s. scientist speculated about the British early warning system on the English East Coast and came close to what it was and how it worked Watson watt was sent to the u.s. in 1941 to advise on air defense after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor Alfred Lee Loomis organized the secret MIT radiation laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge Massachusetts which developed microwave radar technology in the years 1941 to 45 later in 1943 Paige greatly improved radar with the monopulse technique that was used for many years in most radar applications the war precipitated research to find better resolution more Portability and more features for radar including complimentary navigation systems like oboe used by the RAF's Pathfinder topic applications the information provided by radar includes the bearing and range and therefore position of the object from the radar scanner it is thus used in many different fields where the need for such positioning is crucial the first use of radar was for military purposes to locate air ground and sea targets this evolved in the civilian field into applications for aircraft ships and roads in aviation aircraft can be equipped with radar devices that warn of aircraft or other obstacles in or approaching their path display weather information and give accurate altitude readings the first commercial device fitted to aircraft was a 1938 Bell lab unit on some United Airlines aircraft aircraft can land in fog at airports equipped with radar assisted ground controlled approach systems in which the plane's position is observed on radar screens by operators who radio landing instructions to the pilot maintaining the aircraft on a defined approach path to the runway military fighter aircraft are usually fitted with air-to-air targeting radars to detect and target enemy aircraft in addition larger specialized military aircraft carry powerful airborne radars to observe air traffic over a wide region and direct fighter aircraft towards targets marine radars are used to measure the bearing and distance of ships to prevent collision with other ships to navigate and to fix their position at sea when within range of shore or other fixed references such as islands buoys and light ships in port or in harbour vessel traffic service radar systems are used to monitor and regulate ship movements in busy waters meteorologists use radar to monitor precipitation and wind it has become the primary tool for short-term weather forecasting and watching for severe weather such as thunderstorms tornadoes winter storms precipitation types etc geologists use specialized ground-penetrating radar to map the composition of Earth's crust police forces use radar guns to monitor vehicle speeds on the roads smaller radar systems are used to detect human movement examples are breathing pattern detection for sleep monitoring and hand and finger gesture detection for computer interaction automatic door opening light activation and intruder sensing are also in topic principles topic radar signal a radar system has a transmitter that emits radio waves called radar signals in predetermined directions when these come into contact with an object they are usually reflected or scattered in many directions but some of them absorb and penetrate into the target to some degree radar signals are reflected especially well by materials of considerable electrical conductivity especially by most metals by seawater and by wet ground some of these make the use of radar altimeters possible the radar signals that are reflected back towards the transmitter are the desirable ones that make radar work if the object is moving either toward or away from the transmitter there is a slight equivalent change in the frequency of the radio waves caused by the Doppler effect radar receivers are usually but not always in the same location as the transmitter although the reflected radar signals captured by the receiving antenna are usually very weak they can be strengthened by electronic amplifiers more sophisticated methods of signal processing are also used in order to recover useful radar signals the weak absorption of radio waves by the medium through which it passes as what enables radar sets to detect objects at relatively long ranges ranges at which other electromagnetic wavelengths such as visible light infrared light and ultraviolet light are too strongly attenuated such weather phenomena as fog clouds rain falling snow and sleet that block visible light are usually transparent to radio waves certain radio frequencies that are absorbed or scattered by water vapor raindrops or atmospheric gases especially oxygen are avoided in designing radars except when their detection is intended topic illumination radar relies on its own transmissions rather than light from the Sun or the moon or from electromagnetic waves emitted by the objects themselves such as infrared wavelengths heat this process of directing artificial radio waves towards objects is called illumination although radio waves are invisible to the human eye or optical cameras pick reflection if electromagnetic waves traveling through one material meet another material having a different dielectric constant or diamagnetic constant from the first the waves will reflect or scatter from the boundary between the materials this means that a solid object in air or in a vacuum or a significant change in atomic density between the object and what is surrounding it will usually scatter radar radio waves from its surface this is particularly true for electrically conductive materials such as metal in carbon-fiber making radar well-suited to the detection of aircraft and ships radar absorbing material containing resistive and sometimes magnetic substances is used on military vehicles to reduce radar reflection this is the radio equivalent of painting something a dark color so that it cannot be seen by the eye at night radar waves scatter in a variety of ways depending on the size wavelength of the radio wave and the shape of the target if the wavelength is much shorter than the target size the wave will bounce off in a way similar to the way light is reflected by a mirror if the wavelength is much longer than the size of the target the target may not be visible because of poor reflection low-frequency radar technology is dependent on resonances for detection but not identification of targets this is described by Rayleigh scattering an effect that creates Earth's blue sky and red sunsets when the two length scales are comparable there may be resonances early radars used very long wavelengths that were larger than the target and thus received a vague signal whereas many modern systems use shorter wavelengths a few centimeters or less that can image objects as small as a loaf of bread short radio waves reflect from curves and corners in a way similar to glint from a rounded piece of glass the most reflective targets for short wavelengths have ninety degrees angles between the reflective surfaces a corner reflector consists of three flat surfaces meeting like the inside corner of the box the structure will reflect waves entering its opening directly back to the source they are commonly used as radar reflectors to make otherwise difficult to detect objects easier to detect corner reflectors on boats for example make them more detectable to avoid collision or during a rescue for similar reasons objects intended to avoid detection will not have inside corners or surfaces and edges perpendicular to likely detection directions which leads to odd-looking stealth aircraft these precautions do not completely eliminate reflection because of diffraction especially at longer wavelengths half wavelength along wires or strips of conducting material such as chaff are very reflective but do not direct the scattered energy back toward the source the extent to which an object reflects or scatters radio waves is called it's radar cross-section topic radar equation the power P are returning to the receiving antenna is given by the equation P R equals p t g t a R Sigma F for 4 pi to R T to R are to display style P underscore R equals frac P underscore TG underscore ta underscore R Sigma F care at 4 4 PI caret to our underscore t caret to our underscore our carrot 2 where PT equals transmitter power GT equals gain of the transmitting antenna our equals effective aperture area of the receiving antenna this can also be expressed as G R lambda to 4 pi display style G underscore R lambda carat 2 over 4 pi where lambda display style lambda equals transmitted wavelength gr topic gain of receiving antenna Sigma radar cross-section or scattering coefficient of the target F equals pattern propagation factor RT equals distance from the transmitter to the target AR AR topic distance from the target to the receiver in the common case where the transmitter and the receiver are at the same location Artie Arar and the term RT squared R R squared can be replaced by r4 where R is the range this yields P R equals p t g t a R Sigma F for 4 PI to r4 display style P underscore R equals P underscore T G underscore t a underscore R Sigma F caret 4 over 4 PI caret to our carat for this shows that the received power declines as the fourth power of the range which means that the received power from distant targets is relatively very small additional filtering and pulse integration modifies the radar equation slightly for pulse doppler radar performance which can be used to increase detection range and reduce transmit power the equation above with F equals 1 as a simplification for transmission in a vacuum without interference the propagation factor accounts for the effects of multipath and shadowing and depends on the details of the environment in a real-world situation path loss effects should also be considered topic Doppler effect frequency shift is caused by motion that changes the number of wavelengths between the reflector and the radar this can degrade or enhance radar performance depending upon how it affects the detection process as an example moving target indication can interact with Doppler to produce signal cancellation at certain radial velocities which degrades performance C based radar systems semi-active radar homing active radar homing weather radar military aircraft and radar astronomy rely on the Doppler effect to enhance performance this produces information about target velocity during the detection process this also allows small objects to be detected in an environment containing much larger nearby slow-moving objects Doppler shift depends upon whether the radar configuration is active or passive active radar transmits a signal that is reflected back to the receiver passive radar depends upon the object sending a signal to the receiver the Doppler frequency shift for active radar as as follows where f D display style F underscore D his Doppler frequency f-t display style f underscore t his transmit frequency v our display style v underscore our is radial velocity and c display style C is the speed of light F D equals two times F T times V our C display style F underscore D equals two times F underscore T times left frac V underscore our C right passive radar is applicable to electronic countermeasures and radio astronomy as follows F D equals F T times V our C display style F underscore D equals F underscore T times left frac V underscore our C right only the radial component of the velocity is relevant when the reflector is moving at right angle to the radar beam it has no relative velocity vehicles and weather moving parallel to the radar beam produced the maximum Doppler frequency shift when the transmit frequency F T display style F underscore T is pulsed using a pulse repeat frequency of F our display style f underscore are the resulting frequency spectrum will contain harmonic frequencies above and below F T display style F underscore t with a distance of F are displaced I'll f underscore are as a result the Doppler measurement is only non ambiguous if the Doppler frequency shift is less than half of F our display style F underscore are called the Nyquist frequency since the returned frequency otherwise cannot be distinguished from shifting of a harmonic frequency above or below thus requiring F D F R to display style F underscore D or when substituting with F D display style F underscore D V are FR times CF t for display style v underscore r as an example a doppler weather radar with a pulse rate of two kilohertz and transmit frequency of one gigahertz can reliably measure weather speed up to at most 150 meters per second 340 miles per hour thus cannot reliably determine radial velocity of aircraft moving 1,000 meters per second 2200 miles per hour topic polarization in all electromagnetic radiation the electric field is perpendicular to the direction of propagation and the electric field direction as the polarization of the wave for a transmitted radar signal the polarization can be controlled to yield different effects radars use horizontal vertical linear and circular polarization to detect different types of reflections for example circular polarization is used to minimize the interference caused by rain linear polarization returns usually indicate metal surfaces random polarization returns usually indicate a fractal surface such as rocks or soil and are used by navigation radars topic limiting factors topic beampath and range the radar beam would follow a linear path in vacuum but it really follows a somewhat curved path in the atmosphere because of the variation of the refractive index of air that is called the radar horizon even when the beam has emitted parallel to the ground it will rise above it as the earth curvature sinks below the horizon furthermore the signal is attenuated by the medium it crosses and the beam disperses the maximum range of a conventional radar can be limited by a number of factors line of sight which depends on height above ground this means without a direct line of sight the path of the beam is blocked the maximum non-ambiguous range which is determined by the pulse repetition frequency the maximum non-ambiguous range is the distance the pulse could travel and return before the next pulse is emitted radar sensitivity and power of the returned signal is computed in the radar equation this includes factors such as environmental conditions and the size or radar cross-section of the target topic noise signal noise as an internal source of random variations in the signal which is generated by all electronic components reflected signals declined rapidly as distance increases so noise introduces a radar range limitation the noise floor and signal-to-noise ratio are two different measures of performance that affect range performance reflectors that are too far away produced too little signal to exceed the noise floor and cannot be detected detection requires a signal that exceeds the noise floor by at least the signal-to-noise ratio noise typically appears as random variation superimposed on the desired echo signal received in the radar receiver the lower the power of the desired signal the more difficult it is to discern it from the noise noise figure as a measure of the noise produced by a receiver compared to an ideal receiver and this needs to be minimized shot noise is produced by electrons in transit across a discontinuity which occurs in all detectors shot noise is the dominant source in most receivers there will also be flicker noise caused by electron transit through amplification devices which is reduced using heterodyne amplification another reason for heterodyne processing is that for fixed fractional bandwidth the instantaneous bandwidth increases linearly in frequency this allows improved range resolution the one notable exception to heterodyned down-conversion radar systems as ultra wideband radar here a single cycle or transient wave is used similar to UWB communications see list of UWB channels noise is also generated by external sources most importantly the natural thermal radiation of the background surrounding the target of interest in modern radar systems the internal noise is typically about equal to or lower than the external noise an exception as if the radar is aimed upwards at clear sky where the scene is so cold that it generates very little thermal noise the thermal noise is given by KBT B where T is temperature B as bandwidth post matched filter and KB is Boltzmann's constant there is an appealing intuitive interpretation of this relationship in a radar matched filtering allows the entire energy received from a target to be compressed into a single bin be it arranged Doppler elevation or azimuth been on the surface it would appear that then within a fixed interval of time one could obtain perfect error free detection to do this one simply compresses all energy into an infinitesimal time slice what limits this approach in the real world is that while time is arbitrarily divisible current is not the quantum of electrical energy as an electron and so the best one can do is match filter all energy into a single electron since the electron is moving at a certain temperature Planck's spectrum this noise source cannot be further eroded we see then that radar like all macroscale entities is profoundly impacted by quantum theory noises random and target signals are not signal processing can take advantage of this phenomenon to reduce the noise floor using two strategies the kind of signal integration used with moving target indication can improve noise up to two display style sqr t2 for each stage the signal can also be split among multiple filters for pulse-doppler signal processing which reduces the noise floor by the number of filters these improvements depend upon coherence topic interference radar systems must overcome unwanted signals in order to focus on the targets of interest these unwanted signals may originate from internal and external sources both passive and active the ability of the radar system to overcome these unwanted signals defines its signal-to-noise ratio SNR SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power within the desired signal it compares the level of a desired target signal to the level of background noise atmospheric noise and noise generated within the receiver the higher a systems S&R the better it is at discriminating actual targets from noise signals soppec clutter clutter refers to radio frequency RF echoes returned from targets which are an interesting to the radar operators such targets include natural objects such as ground sea and when not being tasked for meteorological purposes precipitation such as rain snow or hail sandstorms animals especially birds atmospheric turbulence and other atmospheric effects such as ionosphere reflections meteor trails and hail spike clutter may also be returned from man-made objects such as buildings and intentionally by radar countermeasures such as chaff some clutter may also be caused by a long radar waveguide between the radar transceiver in the antenna in a typical plan position indicator PPI radar with a rotating antenna this will usually be seen as a son or son burst in the center of the display as the receiver responds to echoes from dust particles and misguided RF in the waveguide adjusting the timing between when the transmitter sends a pulse and when the receiver stage is enabled will generally reduce the Sunburst without affecting the accuracy of the range since most sunburst is caused by a diffused transmitted pulse reflected before it leaves the antenna clutter is considered a passive interference source since it only appears in response to radar signals sent by the radar clutter is detected and neutralized in several ways clutter tends to appear static between radar scans on subsequent scan echoes desirable targets will appear to move and all stationary echoes can be eliminated sea clutter can be reduced by using horizontal polarization while rain is reduced with circular polarization meteorological radars wish for the opposite effect and therefore use linear polarization to detect precipitation other methods attempt to increase the signal to clutter ratio clutter moves with the wind or a stationary two common strategies to improve measure or performance in a clutter environment are moving target indication which integrates successive pulses and Doppler processing which uses filters to separate clutter from desirable signals the most effective clutter reduction technique is pulse doppler radar doppler separates clutter from aircraft and spacecraft using a frequency spectrum so individual signals can be separated from multiple reflectors located in the same volume using velocity differences this requires a coherent transmitter another technique uses a moving target indicator that subtracts the receive signal from two successive pulses using phase to reduce signals from slow-moving objects this can be adapted for systems that lack a coherent transmitter such as time domain pulse amplitude radar constant false alarm rate a form of automatic gain control AGC is a method that relies on clutter returns far outnumbering echoes from targets of interest the receivers gain is automatically adjusted to maintain a constant level of overall visible clutter while this does not help detect targets masked by stronger surrounding clutter it does help to distinguish strong target sources in the past radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver as radars evolved AGC became computer software controlled and affected the gain with greater granularity in specific detection cells clutter may also originate from multipath echoes from valid targets caused by ground reflection atmospheric ducting or ionospheric reflection refraction eg anomalous propagation this clutter type has especially bothersome since it appears to move and behave like other normal point targets of interest in a typical scenario an aircraft echo is reflected from the ground below appearing to the receiver as an identical target below the correct one the radar may try to unify the targets reporting the target at an incorrect height or eliminating it on the basis of jitter or a physical impossibility terrain bounce jamming exploits this response by amplifying the radar signal and directing it downward these problems can be overcome by incorporating a ground map of the radar surroundings and eliminating all echoes which appear to originate below ground or above a certain height monopulse can be improved by altering the elevation algorithm used at low elevation in newer air traffic control radar equipment algorithms are used to identify the false targets by comparing the current pulse returns to those adjacent as well as calculating returning probabilities topic jamming radar jamming refers to radio frequency signals originating from sources outside the radar transmitting in the radars frequency and thereby masking targets of interest jamming may be intentional as with an electronic warfare tactic or unintentional as with friendly forces operating equipment that transmits using the same frequency range jamming is considered an active interference source since it is initiated by elements outside the radar and in general unrelated to the radar signals jamming is problematic to radar since the jamming signal only needs to travel one way from the jammer to the radar receiver whereas the radar echoes traveled two ways radar target radar and are therefore significantly reduced in power by the time they return to the radar receiver jammers therefore can be much less powerful than their jammed radars and still effectively mask targets along the line of sight from the jammer to the radar main lobe jamming jammers have an added effect of affecting radars along other lines of sight through the radar receivers side lobes side lobe jamming main lobe jamming can generally only be reduced by narrowing the main lobe solid angle and cannot fully be eliminated when directly facing a jammer which uses the same frequency and polarization as the radar side lobe jamming can be overcome by reducing receiving side lobes in the radar antenna design and by using an omnidirectional antenna to detect and disregard non main lobe signals other Andy jamming techniques are frequency hopping and polarization topic radar signal processing topic distance measurement topic transit time one way to obtain a distance measurement is based on the time of flight transmit a short pulse of radio signal electromagnetic radiation and measure the time it takes for the reflection to return the distance is one-half the product of the round-trip time because the signal has to travel to the target and then back to the receiver and the speed of the signal since radio waves travel close to the speed of light accurate distance measurement requires high speed electronics in most cases the receiver does not detect the return while the signal is being transmitted through the use of a duplexer the radar switches between transmitting and receiving at a predetermined rate a similar effect imposes a maximum range as well in order to maximize range longer times between pulses should be used referred to as a pulse repetition time or its reciprocal pulse repetition frequency these two effects tend to be at odds with each other and it is not easy to combine both good short-range and good long-range in a single radar this is because the short pulse is needed for a good minimum range broadcast have less total energy making the returns much smaller and the target harder to detect this could be offset by using more pulses but this would shorten the maximum range so each radar uses a particular type of signal long-range radars tend to use long pulses with long delays between them and short range radars use smaller pulses with less time between them as electronics have improved many radars now can change their pulse repetition frequency thereby changing their range the newest radars fired two pulses during one sell one for short range about 10 kilometres 6.2 miles and a separate signal for longer ranges about 100 kilometres 62 miles the distance resolution and the characteristics of the received signal as compared to noise depends on the shape of the pulse the pulse is often modulated to achieve better performance using a technique known as pulse compression distance may also be measured as a function of time the radar mile is the time it takes for a radar pulse to travel one nautical mile reflect off a target and return to the radar antenna since a nautical mile is defined as 1852 meters then dividing this distance by the speed of light 299,792,458 m/s and then multiplying the result by two yields a result of 12.36 microseconds in duration topic frequency modulation another form of distance measuring radar is based on frequency modulation frequency comparison between two signals is considerably more accurate even with older electronics than timing the signal by measuring the frequency of the returned signal and comparing that with the original the difference can be easily measured this technique can be used in continuous wave radar and is often found in aircraft radar altimeters in these systems a carrier radar signal is frequency modulated in a predictable way typically varying up and down with a sine wave or sawtooth pattern at audio frequencies the signal is then sent out from one antenna and received on another typically located on the bottom of the aircraft and the signal can be continuously compared using a simple beat frequency modulator that produces an audio frequency tone from the return signal and a portion of the transmitted signal since the signal frequency is changing by the time the signal returns to the aircraft the transmit frequency has changed the frequency shift is used to measure distance the modulation index riding on the receive signal is proportional to the time delay between the radar and the reflector the frequency shift becomes greater with greater time delay the frequency shift is directly proportional to the distance traveled that distance can be displayed on an instrument and it may also be available via the transponder this signal processing is similar to that used in speed detecting Doppler radar example systems using this approach are azusa M is tr a.m. and you do P a further advantage is that the radar can operate effectively at relatively low frequencies this was important in the early development of this type when high frequency signal generation was difficult or expensive terrestrial radar uses low-power FM signals that cover a larger frequency range the multiple reflections are analyzed mathematically for pattern changes with multiple passes creating a computerized synthetic image Doppler effects are used which allows slow-moving objects to be detected as well as largely eliminating noise from the surfaces of bodies of water topic speed measurement speed is the change in distance to an object with respect to time thus the existing system for measuring distance combined with a memory capacity to see where the target last was is enough to measure speed at one time the memory consisted of a user making grease pencil marks on the radar screen and then calculating the speed using a slide rule modern radar systems perform the equivalent operation faster and more accurately using computers if the transmitters output as coherent phase synchronized there is another effect that can be used to make almost instant speed measurements no memory is required known as the Doppler effect most modern radar systems use this principle into Doppler radar and pulse doppler radar systems weather radar military radar the Doppler effect is only able to determine the relative speed of the target along the line of sight from the radar to the target any component of target velocity perpendicular to the line of sight cannot be determined by using the Doppler effect alone but it can be determined by tracking the targets azimuth over time it is possible to make a Doppler radar without any pulsing known as a continuous wave radar CW radar by sending out a very pure signal of a known frequency CW radar is ideal for determining the radial component of a targets velocity CW radar is typically used by traffic enforcement to measure vehicle speed quickly and accurately where range is not important when using a pulsed radar the variation between the phase of successive returns gives the distance the target has moved between pulses and thus its speed can be calculated other mathematical developments in radar signal processing include time frequency analysis wale Heisenberg or wavelet as well as the chirp tlit transform which makes use of the change of frequency of returns from moving targets chirp you topic pulse-doppler signal processing pulse-doppler signal processing includes frequency filtering in the detection process the space between each transmit pulse is divided into range cells or range gates each cell is filtered independently much like the process used by a spectrum analyzer to produce the display showing different frequencies each different distance produces a different spectrum these spectra are used to perform the detection process this is required to achieve acceptable performance in hostile environments involving weather terrain and electronic countermeasures the primary purpose is to measure both the amplitude and frequency of the aggregate reflected signal from multiple distances this is used with weather radar to measure radial wind velocity and precipitation rate in each different volume of air this is linked with computing systems to produce a real-time electronic weather map aircraft safety depends upon continuous access to accurate weather radar information that is used to prevent injuries and accidents weather radar uses a low PRF coherency requirements are not as strict as those for military systems because individual signals ordinarily do not need to be separated less sophisticated filtering is required and range ambiguity processing is not normally needed with weather radar in comparison with military radar intended to track air vehicles the alternate purposes look down shoot-down capability required to improve military air combat survivability pulse-doppler is also used for ground-based surveillance radar required to defend personnel and vehicles pulse-doppler signal processing increases the maximum detection distance using less radiation in close proximity to aircraft pilots shipboard personnel infantry and artillery reflections from terrain water and weather produced signals much larger than aircraft and missiles which allows fast moving vehicles to hide using map of the earth flying techniques and stealth technology to avoid detection until an attack vehicle is too close to destroy pulse-doppler signal processing incorporates more sophisticated electronic filtering that safely eliminates this kind of weakness this requires the use of medium pulse repetition frequency with phase coherent hardware that has a large dynamic range military applications require medium PRF which prevents range from being determined directly and range ambiguity resolution processing is required to identify the true range of all reflected signals radial movement is usually linked with Doppler frequency to produce a lock signal that cannot be produced by radar jamming signals pulse-doppler signal processing also produces audible signals that can be used for threat identification topic reduction of interference effects signal processing is employed in radar systems to reduce the radar interference effects signal processing techniques include moving target indication pulse-doppler signal processing moving target detection processors correlation with secondary surveillance radar targets space time adaptive processing and track before detect constant false alarm rate and digital terrain model processing are also used in clutter environments topic plottin trek extraction the track algorithm has a radar performance enhancement strategy tracking algorithms provide the ability to predict future position of multiple moving objects based on the history of the individual positions being reported by sensor systems historical information is accumulated and used to predict future position for use with air traffic control threat estimation combat system doctrine gun aiming and missile guidance position data has accumulated radar sensors over the span of a few minutes there are four common track algorithms nearest neighbor algorithm probabilistic data Association multiple hypothesis tracking interactive multiple model IMM radar video returns from aircraft can be subjected to a plot extraction process whereby spurious and interfering signals are discarded a sequence of target returns can be monitored through a device known as a plot extractor the non-relevant real-time returns can be removed from the displayed information and a single plot display in some radar systems or alternatively in the command-and-control system to which the radar is connected a radar tracker is used to associate the sequence of plots belonging to individual targets and estimate the targets headings and speeds topic engineering a radars components are a transmitter that generates the radio signal with an oscillator such as a klystron or a magnetron and controls its duration by a modulator a waveguide that links that transmitter in the antenna a duplexer that serves as a switch between the antenna and the transmitter or the receiver for the signal when the antenna is used in both situations a receiver knowing the shape of the desired received signal a pulse an optimal receiver can be designed using a matched filter a display processor to produce signals for human readable output devices an electronic section that controls all those devices in the antenna to perform the radar scan ordered by software a link to end-user devices and displays topic antenna design radio signals broadcast from a single antenna will spread out in all directions and likewise a single antenna will receive signals equally from all directions this leaves the radar with the problem of deciding where the target object is located early systems tended to use omnidirectional broadcast antennas with directional receiver antennas which were pointed in various directions for instance the first system to be deployed chain home used to straight antennas at right angles for reception each on a different display the maximum return would be detected with an antenna at right angles to the target and a minimum with the antenna pointed directly at it and on the operator could determine the direction to a target by rotating the antenna so one display showed a maximum while the other showed a minimum one serious limitation with this type of solution is that the broadcast is sent out in all directions so the amount of energy in the direction being examined as a small part of that transmitted to get a reasonable amount of power on the target the transmitting aerial should also be directional topic parabolic reflector more modern systems use a steerable parabolic dish to create a tight broadcast beam typically using the same dish as the receiver such systems often combine two radar frequencies in the same antenna in order to allow automatic steering or radar lock parabolic reflectors can be either symmetric parabolas or spoiled parabolas symmetric parabolic antennas produce a narrow pencil beam in both the X and Y dimensions and consequently have a higher gain the NEXRAD pulse doppler weather radar uses a symmetric antenna to perform detailed volumetric scans of the atmosphere spoiled parabolic antennas produce a narrow beam in one dimension and a relatively wide beam in the other this feature is useful if target detection over a wide range of angles is more important than target location in three dimensions most 2d surveillance radars use a spoiled parabolic antenna with an arrow as a muffle beam width and wide vertical beam width this beam configuration allows the radar operator to detect an aircraft at a specific azimuth but at an indeterminate height conversely so-called knotter height finding radars use a dish with a narrow vertical beam width and wide as a methyl beam width to detect an aircraft at a specific height but with low as a methyl precision topic types of scan primary scan a scanning technique where the main antenna aerial is moved to produce a scanning beam examples include circular scan sector scan etc secondary scan a scanning technique where the antenna feed is moved to produce a scanning beam examples include conical scan unidirectional sector scan lobe switching etc Palmer scan a scanning technique that produces a scanning beam by moving the main antenna and it's feed a Palmer scan is a combination of the primary scan and a secondary scan conical scanning the radar beam is rotated in a small circle around the bore site axis which is pointed at the target topic slotted waveguide applied similarly to the parabolic reflector the slotted waveguide has moved mechanically to scan and is particularly suitable for non tracking surface scan systems where the vertical pattern may remain constant owing to its lower cost and less wind exposure shipboard airport surface and harbor surveillance radars now use this approach in preference to a parabolic antenna topic phased-array another method of steering is used in a phased array radar phased array antennas are composed of evenly spaced similar antenna elements such as aerials or rows of slotted waveguide each antenna element or group of antenna elements incorporates a discrete phase shift that produces a phase gradient across the array for example array elements producing a 5 degree phase shift for each wavelength across the array face will produce a beam pointed 5 degrees away from the centre line perpendicular to the array face signals traveling along that beam will be reinforced signals offset from that beam will be canceled the amount of reinforcement as antenna gain the amount of cancellation as side lobe suppression phased array radars have been in use since the earliest years of radar in world war ii Mamet radar but electronic device limitations led to poor performance phased array radars were originally used for missile defense see for example safeguard program they are the heart of the ship born Aegis combat system and the Patriot missile system the massive redundancy associated with having a large number of array elements increases reliability at the expense of gradual performance degradation that occurs as individual phase elements fail to a lesser extent phased array radars have been used in weather surveillance as of 2017 NOAA plans to implement a national network of multifunction phased array radars throughout the United States within 10 years for meteorological studies and flight monitoring phased array antennas can be built to conform to specific shapes like missiles infantry support vehicles ships and aircraft as the price of electronics has fallen phased array radars have become more common almost all modern military radar systems are based on phased arrays where the small additional cost is offset by the improved reliability of a system with no moving parts traditional moving antenna designs are still widely used in rolls where cost is a significant factor such as air traffic surveillance and similar systems phased array radars are valued for use in aircraft since they can track multiple targets the first aircraft to use a phased array radar was the b-1b Lancer the first fighter aircraft to use phased array radar was the Mikoyan mig-31 the mig-31 MSS bi 16s aslan passive electronically scanned array radar was considered to be the world's most powerful fighter radar until the an AP g77 active electronically scanned array was introduced on the Lockheed Martin f-22 Raptor phased array interferometry or aperture synthesis techniques using an array of separate dishes that are phased into a single effective aperture are not typical for radar applications although they are widely used in radio astronomy because of the thinned array curse such multiple aperture erase when used in transmitters result in narrow beams at the expense of reducing the total power transmitted to the target in principle such techniques could increase spatial resolution but the lower power means that this is generally not effective aperture synthesis by post-processing motion data from a single moving source on the other hand is widely used in space and airborne radar systems topic frequency bands the traditional band names originated as code names during World War two and are still in military and aviation use throughout the world they have been adopted in the United States by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and internationally by the International Telecommunication Union most countries have additional regulations to control which parts of each band are available for civilian or military use other users of the radio spectrum such as the broadcasting and electronic countermeasures industries have replaced the traditional military designations with their own systems topic radar modulators modulators act to provide the waveform of the RF pulse there are two different radar modulator designs high voltage switch for noncoherent keyed power oscillators these modulator z' consists of a high voltage pulse generator formed from a high voltage supply a pulse forming network and a high voltage switch such as a thyratron they generate short pulses of power to feed eg the magnetron a special type of vacuum tube that converts DC usually pulsed into microwaves this technology is known as pulsed power in this way the transmitted pulse of RF radiation is kept to a defined and usually very short duration hybrid mixers fed by a waveform generator and an exciter for a complex but coherent waveform this waveform can be generated by low power low voltage input signals in this case the radar transmitter must be a power amplifier eg a klystron or a solid state transmitter in this way the transmitted pulse is inter pulse modulated and the radar receiver must use pulse compression techniques topic radar coolant coherent microwave amplifiers operating above 1,000 watts microwave output like traveling-wave tubes and klystrons require liquid coolant the electron beam must contain five to ten times more power than the microwave output which can produce enough heat to generate plasma this plasma flows from the collector toward the cathode the same magnetic focusing that guides the electron beam forces the plasma into the path of the electron beam but flowing in the opposite direction this introduces FM modulation which degrades Doppler performance to prevent this liquid coolant with minimum pressure and flow rate is required and deionized water is normally used in most high-power surface radar systems that utilize Doppler processing cool '''l silicon ester was used in several military radars in the 1970s however it is hygroscopic leading to hydrolysis and formation of highly flammable alcohol the loss of a u.s. Navy aircraft in 1978 was attributed to a silicate ester fire cooling mill is also expensive and toxic the US Navy has instituted a program named pollution prevention p2 to eliminate or reduce the volume and toxicity of waste air emissions and effluent discharges because of this coolant oil is used less often today pick regulations radar also radar is defined by article 1.100 of the International Telecommunication Union itu itu radio regulations RR as a radio determination system based on the comparison of reference signals with radio signals reflected or retransmitted from the
