 Flattening seismic data to horizons is a useful technique for aiding interpretation and understanding depositional history The Flattener process creates an iso-proportional view of your data based on horizons The resulting “flattened space” is accessible in any of the views, using the same simple approach that Insight uses to view in time or depth Let’s take a look at the Flattener now To create this perspective, we’ll need a flattener process Open the Process tab and click the add button in the top right-hand corner There are a lot of processes here. We can quickly find the flattener by typing, “flat” in the search box Give the new process a name and click okay These two buttons allow different approaches to configuring the flattener The first button adds individual horizons, allowing you to specify and configure them one at a time This is useful when you want more control over which active horizons to use The second button automatically creates a structure using all the visible horizons We’ll use that now Insight sorts the horizons based upon average times or depths and calculates the flat value for us Remember that in flattened space, each horizon has a single time or depth -- this is the “Flat Value” Insight calculates this value by averaging the maximum and minimum for the horizon You can update this value manually if you prefer We can take advantage of the flattened projection in any of the Insight views The domain selector contains two-way time, true vertical depth and also the new flattened perspective Change from TWT to the flattened domain Notice that the horizons selected in the flattener are all perfectly flat The default behaviour is to proportionally stretch and squeeze the data to completely fill each interval, but it is easy to change this As with most processes in Insight, these parameters are interactive If we change the conformability settings here, the display is updated on the fly This stratigraphy might be conformable to the top or base of the mid horizon This is very useful for reconstructing the depositional environment Horizons can be picked and propagated in the flattened domain Note that if the picked horizon is part of the flattener process, the projection will not be updated until after leaving editing mode We can find another useful feature of the flattened projection in the map view Lets move the navigation bar to show a time-slice through our depositional environment, around slice 1141ms and then open the map view By enabling the slice in the flattened domain, we see an amplitude extraction at proportional spacing between the flattened horizons We can then see different extracted slices by scrolling up and down through the flattened volume This is much more powerful than simply viewing amplitude extractions along specific horizons
