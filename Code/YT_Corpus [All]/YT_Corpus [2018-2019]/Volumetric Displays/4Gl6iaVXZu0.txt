 We present Project Zanzibar, a new sensing technology that opens up the possibilities of how people are able to interact with computing. A thin, flexible sensing material that detects objects, a user's touch, and hand gestures in the air. It can detect an object's footprint and identify and track multiple objects tagged with low-cost NFC stickers. It tracks their position, movement, and orientation of objects. Objects can be even stacked above the mat. It can wirelessly power devices without a battery and can detect inputs such as button presses. It works with your existing screens via Bluetooth. So what can you do with Project Zanzibar? You can bring toys to life. Don't shoot! I'm hit! Play games. Play with friends. Tell and share stories. Create physical interfaces or augment reality. Learn using tactile interfaces. Learn to spell. "c" "a" "r, car" Program using tangible blocks. Project Zanzibar is a research project by Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK.
