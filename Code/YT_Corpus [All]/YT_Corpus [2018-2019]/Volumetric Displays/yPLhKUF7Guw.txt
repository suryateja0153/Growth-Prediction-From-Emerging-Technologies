 To import well data into Insight, select import well data Well data can be an Insight recognised format or generic text files For this first example example I will import an owx file otherwise known as an openworks export file Because owx is recognised by Insight multiple components of the well can be imported simultaneously with little user configuration making it the most efficient option to import well data Simply select the owx file and open it Owx can contain well paths checkshots curves and markers choose which objects you want to import Insight will suggest the most likely units Datums and positional information of the incoming data you can change these values if they are not as expected Click on OK to proceed with loading and I am prompted with an opportunity to change the CRS of the incoming data The imported data will be converted to match the CRS of the project I can check the popup for a summary of the imported data objects and look for any warnings or errors from the incoming data The map view shows the well is in the correct location which is always a good start Because a complete set of well data has been loaded I will use the well in Single well view to QC the results Switching between TVDSS and MD shows the well path is correct correct and switching to TWT is a QC for the Time Depth table Increasing the defined projection distance to 1000m makes the well appear on the Seismic section At the same time time I can adjust the thickness and colour of the well bore Different curves can also be selected for for display in the section view using the Control Panel settings Data not formatted for Insight can be imported as separate data types types and requires more configuration In this second example I will select the well header file to get started I can specify well header as the input data type before configuring the import parameters Configuring the parameters is just a case of describing the file format and data positions This file is comma delimited and so I select a comma to identify the different columns of data Insight has already recognised that the first column column is probably a well name and assigned it accordingly The second column can be assigned as an onshore or offshore indicator through the drop down selector The 3rd column can be assigned as a well elevation or kelly bushing If there is data in the file with no matching attribute in Insight I can leave the drop down selector blank to ignore the column The remaining attributes such as X and Y can be assigned along with total depth Notice that Insight has automatically detected and assigned the well status status making it as easy as possible to format these files Click OK to complete the formatting Check the import summary for any problems or warnings Double click on the well to open the configure well dialog dialog and QC the well header just imported Any additional data files that do not contain the well name must be loaded individually to the well using this window Click on the path tab notice that a Straight well path already exists because a total depth and XY coordinates were supplied as part of the well header import Click on the New well path button Select deviated path and give the well path a name Select the File to Import button and configure the import parameters Insight has detected headers and assigned most of the columns correctly but I can change the settings if required I can also change the units and the datum from which the measurements have been made Once again i can select the CRS of the incoming data and convert to the project coordinate system as required Once imported set the new well path to default for it to be used by Insight Click on the T/D Pairs tab and Click on the New Time depth chart button Give the T/D table a name Select the File to Import button select the file and configure the import parameters Insight has again detected headers and assigned most of the columns correctly but I can change the settings if required In this example I am going to load the checkshot using TVD instead of MD I can also change the units and the datum from which the measurements have been made Click on OK to import the data and it now appears on the TWT section because it has the time depth conversion needed to display I can change the display parameters such as the path colour and thickness and also the choice of curve but at this point I only have time-depth and velocity information Click on the Markers tab and Click on the New Marker table button Select the file to import button and select the marker file file name is assigned to the marker table name if you do not directly specify one Configure the import parameters check the datums and columns are assigned correctly and click on OK to import the data QC results in the data views that are open Finally click on the well curves tab and click on the new log curve set button Select the File to Import button and select the curve file LAS file formats are recognised by Insight and need no special configuration The data is loaded close the configure well dialog and QC results using section view and single well view Switch from two way time (TWT) to TVDSS to measured depth to check the time depth tables and well paths have been loaded correctly
