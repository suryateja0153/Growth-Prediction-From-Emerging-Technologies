 [Music] welcome back in the last class we looked at haptic interfaces specifically we focused on the kinesthetic displays in today's class we look at the the tactile displays the other classification of the haptic devices known as the tactile devices okay to remind you we are talking about the human haptics the first half of the course we focused on the human haptics now we are trying to mimic the human haptics in the mission you can consider human haptics as a science part of the haptics where is the machine haptics which is which can be considered as a technology part of the hatrocks so how do we convert our understanding of the human haptics into engineering and missions which will help us to improve the perception of virtual reality or no rehabilitation there are many applications which we are going to see later but right now how do we convert our understanding of the our human haptics information is what our focus in the last class we looked at the different kind of the grasps and specifically the contact grass precision grabs and power grabs and we are supposed to come up with the interface which will help us to how this many different type of the grasps of course it may not be possible to develop one single interface which will help us to do all the grass probably now as many as grabs possible or individually now come up with devices that will provide individual grasp okay and in the last class we also saw the kinesthetic displays and the tactile displays specifically we saw a kinesthetic displays as mostly grounded the kinesthetic display where the device it is a advanced robotic device where the fingertip or you're holding a pen like device is which is the end effector of an advanced Robo and the forces it is resisting your motion of the finger is actually transmitted back to the ground this is called the grounder displays example is the phantom we saw so many other devices in the earlier class so essentially you can see that the device base is grounded it has serial linkages which is connected to the fingertip all the fingers or the palm which will resist your motion that is the usual kinesthetic display in the next two classification of the devices its the exoskeleton where the grounding is at the wrist and again the wrist it has a serial connections to the fingertip the finger movement is again twisted resisted and the resistive motion is transmitted back to the wrist or somewhere over here right there are a couple of gloves we have seen where this could be the forces reactive forces are transmitted to the the palm or somewhere in the body these are all called the no bodily own haptic devices so some devices transmit forces on the shoulder or the hip somewhere it has to transmit the force so what we are feeling is the the force but there is an equal and opposite force which has to be transmitted either back to the desk desktop asari ground or or somewhere on the body okay so in this case it is a wrist or any other places now the other type of device can be the fingertip device at the fingertip we don't have to transmit divided forces to anywhere else and this device is it can give you many tactile feedback so this where there is other the ground based of heartache sorry exoskeleton where kinesthetic is in wall and a fingertip alone if you take it just mostly tactic not kinesthetic at all right I so the technologies needed for kinesthetic devices or fingertip devices is very different from the technology needed for exoskeleton or the grounded displays okay so we will focus on the fingertip displaced today and then a little bit on the body displaced motion displace or our focus is to develop these devices that can be useful in virtual reality you've put on your goggles HMD you want to touch certain objects in the virtual reality and we want to get a force feedback okay a combination of this grounded displays or the exoskeletons under fingertip display is what is going to help and today we will focus on only on the fingertip this place okay the fingertip displays essentially no called the tactile displays is again there are many varieties of displays as a part of this course project some of you can attempt to do know a few of the devices this devices are very very simple devices okay usually tactile device means and it is referred as an array of pins okay in array of pins which will move up and down where you can feel the forces when you keep the finger or the pump over there the pins can go up and down and then you can feel the surfaces and is off now probably about you know 200 by 200 has been and 200 pins and 200 pins have been fabricated using the MEMS technologies but maybe what we need is 400 by 400 depending upon the density of the fingertips we looked at a lot of mechanoreceptors so the finger the density of mechanoreceptors as would require 400 by 400 pins in the palm area alone which is probably another 5 years or 10 years down the line this is pin-based pin tactile array we call it as a tactile array and each one each pin is called the axle just like pixel in the display we can call this as a taxol which either switches on or switches off either on or increases the height or decrease the height other than this artillery a there are many other devices is what we are going to no focus about okay the first device is the contact and pressure display where we are talking contact is the very basic the grasping task we talked about right so in the contact it's a maybe the simplest one we can say this is the simplest one simplest of all the that contact - or the grasping task where the fingertip has to be you know applied with certain normal force that's all yeah that's where we are looking at you know contacted maybe a very simple no solenoid so voice coil or one degree of freedom actuator can be used to give you the contact okay maybe you can give a very small finger Glaus where there is only one degree of freedom movement of this actuator which will either contact or not contact their contact or contact disconnect so that will give you the the sense of contact in a virtual reality if there are menus over there when you contact the menu you want to give a feeling of no very simple contact even though the menus are virtual there are no displays there are no real displace there are all virtual displace but still when you touch it touch the menu button you should give a feeling of you're touching them you know by activating there's one degree of freedom actuated that's a simplest contact pressure display it was very similar to probably know something like this yeah very small devices can be mounted on the finger and can be given a contact feedback okay now the second device could be no curvature display curvature display suppose if you have a object whose curvature radius is bigger than the fingertip itself then what you do is let us say this is your fingertip you are contacting it and you are moving this you are moving this finger over there display there are two things happening one is that you are your your kinesthetic system comes into picture you are feeling that you are moving over here and there is also contact okay contact basically we are talking about the Kootenay as' system tactile system so what is roll of tactile system in the perception of the curvature we want to display the curvature information of a virtual object okay so how is it going to be suppose again it's based on the no psychophysical research the research shows that suppose if we have a very flat surface and if you want to give a perception of curvature and there are two ways of doing it one way is that you have this surface normal and rotate the surface normal so that you have this sense of curvature okay or what do you do is you change the height of the surface normal without rotation I gotta say this is very smooth yeah there's also these are the two ways of doing it what researchers have found out psychophysical again study is that this gives you a much more feeling of perception of curvature than this okay so not just by altering the height of the the pins like just like the tactile arrays do but just by rotating them surface normal it's very important in order to give the the curvature information okay so again you can come up with a very simple way of rotating the surface normals how are you going to rotate the surface normals we will see it okay so a simple finger mount which will rotate us which will rotate the surface normal as you move over the thing or the over the virtual objects that will give you the perception of curvature without the real objects over there okay and then the third one is the the vibration and texture and material of course vibration we all know that's again a very simple form of feedback but in order to feel the texture and materials okay so how are you going to use this vibration vibration can be useful in order to feel the texture okay suppose if we have vibration not just as a vibration you know we have this amplitude as well as the frequency which we can modify it suppose if we modify the vibration frequency according to the position of the according to position let us say the we we move our finger on an surface is a different velocity let us say we have velocities increasing and the vibration frequency vibration frequency let us say is velocity and vibration frequency velocity of finger moments let us say and occurring to the well velocity we are increasing the frequency it is not a constant so by modulating the frequency we can according to the velocity of the moment we can somehow generate the texture filling it is not a constant frequency of the vibration depending upon velocity you change the frequency of the vibration that gives you the filling of texture okay there's one way of looking at it of course texture when you look at it it's a very complex multi-dimensional phenomena if you look at texture what do we mean by texture so at least I can say there are three dimensions to the texture let us find out two dimensions and then let us talk about him other dimensions so texture it can be either rough or smooth right it can be you know soft or hard it can be wet or dry it can be it can be sticky slippy slippery there are many dimensions of talking about some many researchers have come up with many more dimensions but mainly softness or hardness or no roughness or smoothness these are the main so these are the main dimensions to dimension at least okay so this texture generating the person giving the perception of the structure in the virtual reality is a very challenging task okay so one way is to modulate the frequency some way here in one researchers they have modulated the frequency of the vibration tipping upon the velocity it is actually no smooth or rough so there's only one dimension they they have some later there are other dimensions also which we are going to see right okay and we can also talk about yeah so another the next display is the softness or hardness okay so all these ductile devices if you look at it there is no kinetic you know information at all no kinesthetic information it is completely cutaneous or tactile right coach Aeneas how just with cutaneous information how can we give the softness or hardness this should be hardness rate there is a challenge can you imagine how softness can be simulated just with harness just with the no continuous information if you look at the softness or hardness we have this penetration depth penetration depth that so suppose if there is a spring we press it and then we know how much depth we have compressed it but that is a kinesthetic information our challenge is to display the softness without this kinesthetic information is okay so this penetration depth may be related to the the contact area of the finger okay so when you are compressing it more forces you are applying so the more contact area in your fingertip right so or iron that in turn relates to the skin deformation okay so somehow if we can change the contact area of the finger then probably no softness can be no simulated without the kinesthetic information okay that is a challenge so how are we going to change the contact area of the finger again we are going to talk about it fiction display in the fiction display again we know friction is very very complex phenomena simple skin stretch for example may be of 0.25 mm will give me the you know perception of the friction regimes friction perception okay if you look at the finger pad what is its friction coefficient okay there are friction forces we need to simulate it okay so the friction this is very highly nonlinear for example in the dry state the friction coefficient of the all the finger pad is now behaving like an elastic material in the word state the finger pad it behaves like a plastic material okay because the it is neither or the wetness condition of the finger depends upon how much is what you have all right there are sweat glands in your fingertip our throat the the skin so if you are emotional then more sweat glands are now in generating sweat that changes the the frequent coefficient the behavior of the the finger pad itself and that in turn affects your perception of four different objects okay so the suppose if we can measure the friction coefficient coefficient of the finger pad that is not only just a function of dry or wet condition but also the sliding velocity so all the studies have have been done and in the heartaches literature very well but our aim is to how do we make the friction perception in the virtual reality without the kinesthetic information just using the continuous devices tactile devices one way is to do the skin stretch under your fingertip by appropriately changing the screen stretch we can give you a perception of friction so coming up with a device one degree of freedom device which will give you the skin stretch is going to be no very useful the it can give you for example where is your area where you can stretch slightly and under the fingertip that can give you the not only the friction we also talked about the softness and we are also going to talk about the intonation in there and then the next is slide so it has a lot of applications probably some of you can and think about developing a skin stretch display it's not just a vibration so they are talking about the tangential motion tangential motion not all in one direction it is actually now in the radial direction okay those are all very simple simple devices but the applications could be no lot and then we are talking about the the indentation okay in tentation so we have a small bump and we want to find out we want to find out we want to display this in the virtual reality without the real bump we want to give the feeling of real real bump right so when you move your finger tip over a real pump what is happening is there are two things happening Asian which has little force little force as well as the the normal force normal force in a quaternion device we cannot give the normal force without the normal force let us see how to use the later force alone to give the skin indentation there's a challenge okay so this can be easily demonstrated if you know if you have a comb do you have a comb okay when you go back to your hostel you can do this experiment if you hold this one okay and then slightly disturb the teeth here you can feel the bumps in the fingertip okay so this teeth is not moving up and down okay without moving up and down only by literally moving it you get a feeling of bumps in tend asian okay this is an illusion but this illusion can be useful to develop a display which will display so one of you can think about well now how to make this display okay so enough you can try it out and see whether that is true can you try it out yes are you yourself can portrayed yes check whether that is true yes okay yeah okay so the next one is going to be push button oops so push button again is a challenge is that when you are pushing the button there is a movement of the fingertip without the movement of the fingertip can we give the feeling of pushing the button there is a challenge push buttons again push buttons means you can see that the contact area is actually increasing contact area skin stretch is there and the stretch is there and then this is going to be the normal force finger displacement is finger displacement displacement so just by stretching the skin you get an illusion of increasing a contact area and because contact area is related the finger moment we get the feeling of moving the finger and really really pushing the buttons now you can go back and see how Microsoft or Apple has has developed this the latest Apple phone in giving the feeling of pushing the button on the phones okay we thought they know actually giving the pushing yet how did they give you the feeling of the push buttons it'll be a very nice homework I hope you will enjoy it okay the face geometry again and the combination of all the saints as stretching this skin and no modifying the surface normals rotating the surface normals can give you the the surface geometry now this we have already seen it these are the few of the devices which for giving the indentation okay remember the comb experiment illusion we talked about there are already devices which give you the feeling of bump of using their comp illusions and these are the references as you can take a look at it and this other devices that gives you the little stretch very simple devices okay it's all 3d printed only one actuator but only thing is you need to come up with a very simple mechanism to give you the lateral stretches okay again view it's a challenge to give you their kinesthetic perception of kinesthetic stimuli but using the kochenia stimulus alone okay you should feel the kinesthetics dimly but you're using their kitchen is well again little stretch hand and tangential motion can give you the feeling of the kinesthetic stimuli again there are devices over there you know recently I think just six months back there are a lot of startup companies or made product very successful product as far as the virtual reality is concerned that will give you haptic feedback in a virtual reality controller the virtual reality controller you have this controller in your hand it is not just giving the vibration feedback but is much more that and vibration feedback using some of the terminologies or technologies we talked about for example striker VR is one of the successful startup company it gives you the recoil of a gun okay they give you their library offer now designing your gun how much recoil should be there and all the things very simple device such as this one you take it it's all you put it in your one device okay any device and it is wirelessly connected and you design your recoil and you get a perception this is one of the successful so how again what is the technology behind this device you can probe into you a very simple solenoid okay check whether no they're using the skin stretches such as what we talked about okay Maury combination of the skin stretches and solenoid motions can give you a much impressive feedback of this recoil there is another device again this is also very successful virtual reality reactive group from a company called tactile haptics so this is a virtual reality handle you hold it again here when you when you hold it under the finger you have your skin stretching actuators you can see that this little actually it moves up and down here also it moves up and down there are actually four such for eight actually you this is the front side this is a side this is another side and there is similar one at the back side so four here and fold down combination of these things can give you the feeling of movement so these are all simple skin stretches there's a very nice product from reactive grip ok this another again and successful startup it's called tactile VR mask ok you put on this hmd onto your face there are actuators over here there are actuators over here can you see the actuators these actuators will give you a feeling of blowing onto the onto the face suppose if somebody something strikes on the face then they want to give a another feeling of blowing onto the face very simple actuators again these are all without the kinesthetic movements just with the good aeneas how do we generate illusions his water challenges okay recently there is one and research work this is not a product yet but isn't the research work which I thought it's a very nice product probably it'll be a product from the University of Tokyo led by one of the professors in the university there haptics shape illusions since in the last class we all talked about the the illusions I hope you remember the shape and size illusions right yeah small shape looks heavier compared to the larger shape of the same weight similar things can be talked about how shape can be modified just by no rearranging certain things for example he is talking about something called a haptic perception model okay so you know x axis let us say mass is plotted Y axis let's say shape is plotted then they come up with a relation saying that some relation so as you increase the mass the shape also is actually increases whether there's a no perception between the the mass of the object what you hold and the shape of the object that's what the size and weight illusions we talked about the same thing is what is implemented over here in this but the size is same but by adding weight into the holes you are actually changing the the weight of fists in the virtual reality when you put on the HMD the mass because by changing the mass you are changing the shape of the object what you hold in the virtual reality okay that's a happy pig shape illusion this is a very nice project which a I thought may be of interest to a lot of people okay [Music] you
