 Exploring Multimodal Watch-back Tactile Display using Wind and Vibration In this study, we suggest using multimodal tactile display on the back of a smartwatch. We categorized application scenarios into three pattern types. Micro fan, sponge, and LRA are stacked together to form a single point of the display. We implemented a 4 point wind-vibration tactile display. 8 tactors can be activated independently. We conducted pattern recognition experiments to verify the feasibility of multimodal tactile display.
