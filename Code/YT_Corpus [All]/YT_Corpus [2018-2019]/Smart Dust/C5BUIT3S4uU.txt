 With advanced technology spreading into our everyday lives, the idea of a smart home is no longer new. Both private and public enterprises have decided to enter the market to improve housing conditions for young people and newlyweds. Park Se-young has more. When a smart watch unlocks the door, the air shower system starts and blows off the fine dust. The lighting and indoor temperature are automatically adjusted, …and a few touches on a smartphone can switch on the washing machine from outside the house. "It's partly controlled through the smartphone, and each room is controlled by recognizing the owner of a smart watch." The smart home industry has been upbeat over recent years. In fact, the global smart home market is expected to grow by more than 17 percent each year... from 60 billion U.S. dollars in 2015 to over 130 billion by 2020. The public sector has also recently decided to get involved in the new growth industry. "To make smart home models for 'Happy Housing' targeting young people and newlyweds as well as multi-family and permanent lease housing, we will carry out a demonstration project on five-thousand houses set to be built by next year." The government has decided to strengthen policy support by making business agreements with electronics firms, telecom companies and public enterprises. Park Se-young, Arirang News.
