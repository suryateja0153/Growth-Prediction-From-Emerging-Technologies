 I'm Tabitha Jackson I'm the director of the documentary film program at Sundance Institute it's great honor and pleasure to be here amongst you all and we love coming here and you know that the session yesterday the first session on democracy and engagement was unbelievably thrilling the clarity of thought the takeaways for action the depth of expertise I'm not going to promise you any of that today I'm going to invite you to consider with us what is co-creation why is this term so zeitgeist II at the moment why do we need it and to help me do that at this incredible array of friends collaborators people who are thinking deeply about this who are engaged in it and people who perhaps don't necessarily accept that co-creation is the answer to whatever it is that Elvis so there are some things that we believe that that informed why we want to do this session firstly at the Sundance Institute we believe in story we believe in storytelling storytellers most importantly and the importance of the independent voice in culture we know that storytelling is a transmission system for values that it's the most effective delivery system for an idea and so the phrase the power of story which has been used and commodified and its meaning has been lost to some extent the phrase is correct but the power isn't necessarily a benevolent one depending on how you exercise it think about the story we tell of the United States the most popular an enduring form of that story you could argue is the western film in Hollywood its how many of us grew up encountering what were then called Red Indians which we now know as indigenous and Native people the Western form was a transmission of a value system it was about rugged individualism manifest destiny and American exceptionalism that was a story that a nation was telling itself to the exclusion of its founding peoples and without their cooperation but it it has shaped the way that we in the world have seen them for almost a century so story is important the creation of story is important and how those stories are created is important who gets to own them who gets to deploy them who gets to create them so that's why we're talking about this today um I always come armed with quotes I have no original thoughts so I'll be stealing quotes from our panelists as the as the morning goes on but I have a couple I'm gonna sit down so I can so I can find them properly I have a couple that kind of are informing the way I'm thinking about this Gloria Steinem said one of the simplest path to deep change is for the less powerful to speak as much as they listen and for the more powerful to listen as much as they speak Wendell Berry the great writer poet and thinker and this for me is the metaphor about this for this he says that the limits of a camera is that it's always looking in one direction and always looking through a frame to determine where to set the lens where it's going to look from requires imagination so the great photographers are the ones who knew where to look not necessarily what to look at and I think there's a vital part of co-creation where are we looking from that's going to inform precisely what we see so let's get this show on the road I'm going to invite up a couple of people who have been thinking about co-creation in different ways and collaboration and so let's try in this first slice of what will be a four slice quiche we'll be interrogating discussing what is co-creation and why do we need it now so will you welcome Katz Isaac who you just heard and Fred dust hello hello that was a very lovely reading there are two things I love about that one is just starting a starting a panel by being the lights coming down and a an alive collective experience of listening so thank you for that the other thing I love about it is that the mention of actually the Romans graffiti saying I am here it's just so it makes me think of those ancient ancient hand prints on walls of caves that date back tens of thousands of years that seem to be saying the same thing but you never see them singly or even in pairs there are always many of them so it feels like humanity has been saying to itself ever since we could we are here we are here so cap tell me about yourself what brings you to thinking about co-creation I'm a documentarian and I've worked for 20 years in documentary I think pretty much in co-creative models without necessarily calling it that for 20 years and I worked on very large long projects with many different kinds of partners with citizens with organizations government nonprofits architects urban planners and I was really privileged that the National Film Board of Canada to explore those relationships and really profound indie waise and recently i was invited to come to MIT open documentary lab to start a new studio called co-creation studio and there we now have been tasked with doing research on what co-creation means so I've had the distinct honor of interviewing over 50 people now about co-creation and how people co-create not just in documentary but also journalism and other fields like architecture again urban planning industrial design and people call it many different things it's almost like that elephant you know and it's just trying to find what is it this shape that we're all trying to come closer to how do we step closer in how do we lean in too often the discomfort of deep collaboration and it's it's been it's been a really incredible journey we'll be we'll be publishing a report in in the fall with the results of that survey from the MIT co-creation studio yeah what so but what brought you personally why are you interested in co-creation often when we think of the arts we think of the author or the director or the composer why co-creation as you coming from the arts what what personally do you to it do you think um I think because none of those roles really ever fit me very well I don't feel comfortable in the roles that have been created before I'm really interested in moving into spaces where we don't have cookie cutter formula solutions and so I I feel like working with people and not knowing the answers and it's very improvisational it's it's really about finding that space between us where it where we haven't walked before I think one of one thing that really comes to mind is I one of the first people I interviewed is kamau Sinclair who's at Sundance and she she's now working in new frontier so we new technologies but she had a history in theater and performance and dance and she was part of an african-american troupe that went to the Gambia for a month when in 1999 and she was doing workshops with youth a lot of refugees here at from Sierra Leone and she said they kept trying to do workshops and they would have a set and a concept and then they would draw a line in the sand and this was the stage and this was where the audience was supposed to sit she said over and over again as soon as the action started like people the kids would just cross the line and there was just no line in the sand to be had it just it wasn't it wasn't the concept that they agreed with they they just wanted to step into the action and I think that's the impulse I certainly have is just have everybody come in and Fred coming to you just tell us what you do and what and why you are interested in this in this realm no no one at audio likes explain what they do like my mom still hates me she's like she's like it's funny when she has explained me she's like but you know so I would say our work at IDEO is to kind of put design products strategies stories into the world and and to be frank and I'm gonna feel really pragmatic in this context and what we found is that if you just put things into the world that you've made for somebody it's more than likely they don't like it and they don't like you for doing it and so the reality is is that it's really different if you make it with them if you co-create and that's actually the same if we're doing work in the private sector for for clients or in the social sector when we do work with our nonprofit when we work with the people we're making something for it's way better and I think about it this way I mean I would spend this morning which is that if if I told you guys that I like I'm gonna tell you a story about myself I made a movie about myself you'd be like great you know maybe I want to watch it and most likely you wouldn't but it's like but you probably wouldn't be mad at me for like making this story if I told you I just made a story about you and I'm gonna show it to you and and you're like great you know it's like you probably pretty furious so it's like there's like it's just not fair I think to for for us to kind of own the manufacture of story and the last thing and that's why I love the point that the film is that it's like I suspect in the work that I've been doing on designing dialogue is that um we've mostly been co-creating and in dialogue with each other for most of our history not so much in the modern era and so I think the notion that this is actually new I think is is a lot in response to what we've actually been experiencing in the terms of authorial voice or the way we think about things now I think that's a really key point so you made the point about equity which i think is is vital and the sense that this isn't new there is a reason why we've presumably come back to it and i think perhaps you know in our work at sundance working it particularly in documentary there is a sense and a danger and plenty of examples where our well-intentioned endeavors to tell stories about the world and make sense of the world has actually turned into an extractive industry and so storytellers are going in to communities from the outside you know even the phrase taking pictures they're taking pictures they're extracting the stories again all with the best intent usually and then bringing the stories out not leaving anything in the community and failing to understand certain vital things about what they're looking at not unlike i think yes it was a 70s when anthropology went through this phase of being kind of extractive there is what there are worries that we are doing the same thing now i think and so we're trying to find a different way of a different way of working absolutely this is very much about decolonization about stripping away the colonial aspects of storytelling i think it's very much about narrative sovereignty about honoring the people who own the stories and not just handing over a mic but really creating new systems and new ways of lifting up that sovereignty and I honestly think really this has been here for a long time so I'll just give you two historical examples so I've recently because we do in-person research I've been doing a lot of work going to Quaker Meeting houses and which are fascinating processes because basically Quakers sort of like believe that decisions will come out of the silence of listening and and it's it's a collective process it's basically so it's not exactly storytelling but it is an act of co-creation and we're talking about yesterday about being in New Zealand and looking at this is my favorite story like the Smithsonian there is called de Papa which comes from the Maori phrase and what it means is our place and I think I like what happens when you take a museum you know and took the Smithsonian suddenly and said oh no this is our place what kinds of things can happen in that space it's just it's around us and I think it's just we're rediscovering it in a sense and I think by having these alluding to these other examples or learning from these other examples is absolutely vital and it's it's not it's not lost on me that this that this conversation about are we working with or are we working for is precisely the conversation that you as a social entrepreneur community are having and there are people I mean all of you are thinking about it I assume but people like Partners in Health working with the government of Rwanda proximity designs and morale farmers cellco congratulations SELCO working with the rural poor you know crisis action with a different model and slum-dwellers international who we will hear about and from a bit later but what can we what can we learn what are the most interesting models of of co-creation and have we actually defined our terms yet what do you mean by it you've got a studio that's called it what do you mean cat what is co-creation it's a set of models and and it can be again with participants the way organizations work with each other and increasingly I think artists and documentarians journalists are thinking about artificial intelligence how do we co-create with these large systems that are much bigger than ourselves even journalists like journalists five years ago would not want to use the term collaboration now we're seeing these incredible collaborations across new newsrooms taking massive sets of data WikiLeaks and and breaking them down together there's no way that one journalist one newsroom could do that we've got it we've got to start expanding our our roles and I think just one example of you can co-create just down the hall here there's a great example of a project called new dimensions in testimony and you can sit down in a couch and there's a light there's a big screen and there's a life-size person sitting there looking at you wherever you are in the room they they sort of stare at you and you can interact with hundreds of hours of pre-recorded interview with this person cost survivor and it is it's fascinating to think about how I asked the executive producer yesterday I did a little interview with him is did he co-create did this survivor co-create this project with you he said absolutely from the beginning we designed this together he was on our advisory board he helped figure out the ethics of this he helped figure out what questions to ask one of the questions that I asked him was how do you feel about being in this project there was an answer and he gave such a beautiful answer and the executive producer said nobody's ever asked that before but it's in the system ready to go so there's these new ways and that's not just with him it's also with AI there's artificial intelligence being used in natural language processing all sorts of systems that are in place to allow future generations to have a conversation with with this survivor so what do you think what do you think co-creation is right so you know it's funny I was saying to earlier that like when we brought this up I was like there's a mediate visceral reaction it's like I don't co-create you know it's like it's like you know you'd want to have the label of it in the last two days I've been like oh we co-create I'm fine with it you know that's that's what it is and just just oppose you that why do you why do you think that is a resistance I think because we're really stuck on the idea as a designer coming and I was an artist and architect like you start by being like I want to make things this is me it's me expressing and so I think it's actually something kind of innate and you know that handprint is like I am here and I and I think what your point is that we have to get to that we are here and we are here together and I guess I would say that I just wanted like I think there are principles and rules for co-creation and to that I'll just hit like we have a idea we've got like 15 you know whatever but it's like but um two one is that that if anyone went to the creative tension sessions I can't see you so I'm like if anyone's out there but it's like it's like the great attention sessions that we did yesterday I'm gonna do today one of the things we believe in co-creation is that you live in tension that you actually don't live with the notion that there's a single right answer that we have to live with the idea that there are multiple and as long as we talk about that that's okay that it's like tensions are important and then the other one that's really basic is am I always say this to our designers which is like learn to talk normal which seems easy but it's not like we as a designers we as filmmakers we as other other kinds of practitioners we learn special language and that's actually can be highly exclusive language and so learning that just talk normal um is really foundational to actually being a co creative kind of body and an actor so those are two things that we think about did you at I do create those rules or did someone write them down well yeah that's not an exhibit yeah I mean I would say I would say they're emergent I mean you know we talked our estate as an emerging organization okay we think it bubbles up right and then they say oh that's important and we and we grab that and so I think these things are kind of we as a collective and I mean I will say that when it starts to sight when we start to say oh these things feel natural to us it actually it's almost like no one's expressing it it just kind of happens across the system because this is I'm being facetious but not because I think that particularly as we think about artistic creation or when you think about the work that you do as social entrepreneurs you've got to get stuff done and so this this process of collective thinking is it is it a process of collective deciding I mean the bubbling up sounds really lovely but against a clock on whether deliverable how do you what is the process to get to that and presumably that's some of the stuff that you're looking at not just wouldn't it be lovely if this thing came to be but like how does it practically work yeah it's definitely a living process so a lot of people will talk about being more co-creative at the beginning of a project and then as things a narrow down it becomes you know in some ways people fall into roles and and and the team maybe get smaller and things get done so it's not it's not like static like we are co-creating all the time but it's tools and ways in which we can just bring more voices and more decision-making into into the process the way and then now where do you see you know where does that process stop what are the ethics around it so so creation is one thing let's create this together if there is money that's either going into it or coming out of it how does how do those resources flow are there other ethical issues and practical logistical issues you see around co-creation that we should be considering Oh huge amounts huge amounts of decision that you said the decision-making the money the time who even just asking people to come into a process like that can be really hard for people that for example have two jobs live in a high-rise I worked with in a high-rise with high-rise residence for a long time and people have to you know working two shifts how do you get them to work in a co-creative process that can take a long time and those are the kinds of things that need to be discussed upfront so it's a lot more about negotiating and figuring those things out together and there isn't one formula but I think what we're hoping to do at the co-creation studio is to create more models to create space for sharing these these ways in which people do things it's a lot of the stuff that happens in the margins yeah you know that's what I hear a lot that people say this is not the stuff that we ever document or that we ever even have time to to share with our audiences sometimes you can look at work and not know what's co-created but it's it's it's for us it's it's time to to shed a light on that can I can I build on that because I actually would say that and I don't think we have to think of co-creation as being always the entire thing I think the notion is that there should be moments as we're making things that are co-creative and and I really go back to I mean you were saying you work in work with high-rise you know dwellers and it's a classic example like you'll pull a town hall together to talk about something and it's it's a if you've ever been to the town hall to talk about a new building or no one's listening everyone's waiting to talk right so it's like and and and the best signal that someone's waiting to talk is that their hands up because they're like the moment your hand goes up you're like Adrenaline's going through a system so you're basically like I'm not listening to anything else in the room and so it's like so the reality is like you need new tools to be able to have that dialogue and those those are those and that allows for co-creation it allows for a gathering listening and engagement in a different way and so I wouldn't say it's always all the process but it has from a design perspective it has to be built into the process at multiple points and you thinking of this I mean you you are investigating it you're not prescribing it but is it a model that you would like to see replacing some of the existing sole authorship sole authorship models or is it something that can go alongside them I think there's many different ways to make work as new technologies emerge they don't knock out with the old ones I mean I think we see resurgence of radio for example you know radio is an older media forum but somehow the internet and our new technologies our cell phones our podcasts allow for the radio form the audio art to come rise back up so it's it's really just adding to the toolkit I think that's a great means I'm a little obsessed with radio and audio in general and I think the the notion that that is a form of co-creation because it actually relies on imagination from the listener to actually kind of add in to the story and so I think it's interesting that we've seen the kind of resurgence of that medium at a moment where there's a lot of other mediums that actually leave very little to be mad like we wish we had more to imagine you know so I think I think we're seeing interesting reactive moments on mediums I still think it's it's it's the lines are very blurry still for me between co-creation collaboration participation and I think as we go through this session be interesting to see what what comes out and then I want to bring you both back up with everybody to have a discussion and I know you have begun to draft some principles around some of your thinking around co-creation Jamie I don't know if you can pull up the slide the 10 draft principles oh look at that Jamie your planet so are there any of those that you want to pull out for us I'm 48 so I can actually read that font okay no I I will just add because maybe we haven't talked for much about what happens when work goes out into the world and and for us I think we're very interested in projects that relate to the word world in terms of trying to be part of a larger strategy to change the world and one thing I just want to talk about in terms of the me2 movement which i think is a really interesting harnessing of of social media in a really cool creative way and we live in an unprecedented time of disclosure of trauma we've never had a time where we we've had so many people talk about their trauma and yet I think we have not figured out how to think about trauma in a collective way we still think of it as an individualized like you just deal with the psychology of one person and and for me very much storytelling especially collective storytelling is about thinking about trauma and healing in in much larger collective ways well this is this is the beginning of the conversation I'm going to take your first point make media with people and within communities rather than for or about them and your second principle focus on process rather than just product as a beautiful segue into our second chapter of conversation so thank you very much and then I'll see you in a minute
