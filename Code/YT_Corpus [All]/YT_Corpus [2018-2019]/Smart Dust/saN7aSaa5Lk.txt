 tonight significant updates on a story we've been following for months people in Harahan River Ridge in wagaman have been blaming the Jefferson Parish landfill for an awful odor they say hurt their eyes and caused breathing problems but an engineering firm checked more than 150 complaints and said about 80% of those reports were caused by sources other than the Parrish landfill good evening I'm Karen Swenson and I'm Natalie Shepherd now that report does need to be taken with a grain of salt because it was conducted by a firm hired by the landfill which is currently defending itself against breach of contract accusations by the parish still the report isn't the only thing pointing to other sources for the odor people in one River Ridge neighborhood are concerned about large light-colored dust particles raining down on them in the middle of the night they're not sure what it is but claimed it has a pungent smell and is making people sick Paul Murphy joins us from Rex Drive in River Ridge where one man has chronicled the problem on video Paul Karen Natalie this is Rex Drive just off of Jefferson Highway in River Ridge were about a block from the Mississippi and neighbors here point to a barge loading operation on the river as a possible source for mysterious particles in the air it may look like snow but it's not the video shows large particles in the air blanketing Rex drive-in River Ridge Kellie Knowles shot the video from his driveway Monday night October 29th was for by worse the worst amount of dust particles I ever seen in my life I actually physically like got sick that morning and the next day I had congestion my nose was running eyes burning Noel's has been shooting videos like this since May he points to a mid stream barge operation on the Mississippi River not far from his house as a possible source of the flying particulate you can see cranes on the river at the end of his street there used to load and unload barges in the middle of the night we don't know what type of cargo they load we can't get any answers from anybody about what type of cargo loading River Ridge neighbor Anna Scully called the mystery dust very scary my husband is not well I don't need this aggravation in danger in my backyard we're very very concerned concern over the barge activity comes at a time when Jefferson Parish is already under fire for foul-smelling fumes escaping from the parish landfill in wagaman JP councilman Paul Johnston is pushing state and federal authorities to investigate neighbors concerns on the river when you got snow like objects coming in the air coming from some ways on the river I'm not sure if it's coming from the barges or open the boats or whatever but something's going on in the area as we speak and as we stand right now we're breathing in these dust particles and neighbors tell us that the dust particles appear to be worse when the wind is out of the West and they say there are many mornings when they have to come out and dust the stuff off their vehicles we're live in River Ridge Paul Murphy eyewitness news really powerful video thank you very much Paul for sharing it
