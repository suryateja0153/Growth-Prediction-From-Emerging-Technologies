 a couple of weeks ago I told you all about my April air healthy home system that includes things like the smart thermostat the humidifier and the air purifier as I mentioned last time I've teamed up with April air to be part of their healthy home campaign and today I'm going to explain why you should pay attention to your indoor air quality what's going on tech squad andru edwards here editor-in-chief of gearlive.com if this is your first time here this channel is all about tech gadgets and gaming experiences that kind of stuff feel free to hit the subscribe button down below a lot with the Bell notifications icon so you don't miss any future videos as I mentioned I've teamed up with April air for the healthy home campaign and today I want to tell you all about indoor air quality why it matters and how you can optimize it in your home let's get started with humidity your indoor humidity should remain somewhere between 30 and 50 percent bumping it up a little more in dry climates or winter weather in order to maintain comfort proper humidity prevents the spread of bacteria and viruses in fact studies show that places with 23% of humidity or less allow seventy to seventy seven percent of viral influenza particles to remain infectious once humidity was increased to 43 percent in those same places only 14 percent of those particles remains now that didn't involve spraying any chemicals or disinfectants or anything like that the difference came purely from adjusting the humidity now let's talk about air purity indoor air pollution causes roughly 4.3 million premature deaths each year now if you're like me your indoor air quality is not really something you've really paid all that much attention to but there's a big difference between the air inside of a home and the air outside that's why people like to go outside to get fresh air proper air filters reduce things like dust dust mites pet dander mold spores and more basically removing things from the air that can be toxic to your body the one thing you do need to keep in mind is that you need to change your air filter at the regularly scheduled intervals and again if you're like me I'm admitting it right now I'm not the best at that either in fact I had someone come and clean the air ducts in my home and he asked me when was the last time that I changed my air filters and I said to him never now my air filters supposed to be switched out roughly every six months and I had been living in this home at that time for roughly three years so I should have been on my sixth air filter but I was still on my first the one that came with the home so don't do that keep your family's respiratory wellness on point and avoid allergy and asthma triggers with proper management of your air filter now let's talk about temperature in the home she's probably the one that the most of us will at least pay some sort of attention to since it's much easier to control right from a thermostat I've been using the April Air 89 20 W thermostat that is a full color panel with touch controls and smart home integration as well so I can set everything and forget it the thermostat is basically the brain behind your entire indoor air quality system it makes sure all the other parts work together to make your indoor air quality the healthiest it can be now the April air thermostat that I've been using does support Amazon's Alexa as well as Google assistant it's great to be able to use a voice assistant to alter air quality on the fly or use the smart phone app to control the temperature in my home no matter where I am and speaking of temperature and thermostats here's a tip to get a better night's sleep which we all obviously know contributes to our health lower the temperature in your home by five degrees each night that will blow your body into a more comfortable and deeper sleep each and every night if you want more tips on indoor air quality and want more

April air video so you can find out all about the entire system that April air sent over here that I've been using over the past month differences I've noticed I've never been a big allergy guy myself luckily I don't suffer from that however my wife suffers from allergies and what she told me is at least this allergy season so far he only had one really annoying allergy attack then I'd be thinking okay so you have all this stuff and the allergies are still happening however usually she has one at least every day or every other day so now going into the summer months she's only had an issue one time so she told me she's seen a tremendous difference here in our home any question you have drop them down in the comments below I will meet you there for further discussion to drop a like on this
