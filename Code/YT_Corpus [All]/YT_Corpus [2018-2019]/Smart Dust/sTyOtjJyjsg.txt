 happy home hot day is that a thing okay so here's the deal we it's Saturday we were not planning on filming a video today and then we've been hit up by everybody we just published our what's inside dinosaur poop which i think was a really fun video and everybody's like could open the whole pod what's inside of it so Lincoln and I just went I bought these three right here so we're gonna destroy one take it apart see what's inside this thing is supposed to have seven microphones and eight speakers in it along with the giant subwoofers so it will be interesting to see what's the side of it I know there's been a ton of videos that are about the home pod but I don't think any of them yet show like really what's inside of it so the other thing I think we need to do is one of these we should give away to you guys so if you want one of these home pods look at the description we're gonna make this a short giveaway just like five days so yeah whole pod day this is that you're getting it oh look at it all right now yeah yeah so this is your home pod here see that the bottom of it has the Apple logo on it all around the different the speaker it's just one giant comfortable speaker type feeling squishy squishy let's see how the music sounds [Music] music yeah I can still hear me what do I think about this speaker it's louder than a lot of the smaller speakers that we've tested out before hey Siri should we cut open this Google home pod Google humbug haha should we cut open this Apple home pod I'm not sure what to say hey Siri does this act scare you can you hear me you're coming through loud and clear let's go ahead hey Siri are you scared of this pickaxe whenever you ask her if she's scared of something she doesn't respond hey Siri what are you scared of I'm afraid I can't answer that well I'm not sure how you're supposed to get into this thing because if you look at it there's no screws there's no like way to open it right okay so here is the plan I think the first thing that we need to do is skin this pod skin it let's just cut all this stuff off okay oh no cuts in it pretty easily woah oh ha ha ha let's cut around the edges all right we've made it all the way around the circle let's see if I cut it all the way though I may have missed some spot all right so we got the outer layer of this mesh it's this mesh that's pretty pretty thick feel that yeah it feels like a sock yeah this black material right here we have home pod that is just plastic pod currently with this part on the outside whoa it just comes right out yeah it's just underneath there there's just this little seal that goes around question is does this sit still work without this mesh and this sock what this still works and we can see a speaker underneath here like when we draw on the music you can see what looks like a subwoofers just bouncing like a bigger speaker I thought that because it's heavier on the bottom feels heavier in the bottom that maybe the magnet would be on the bottom but the end the speaker would be down that way maybe push them down but it looks like the biggest speaker has got to be on the top so I don't sorry I'm unable to do that pause the music this thing is pretty tough built I have this hatchet here and that could help us just kind of crack it open a little bit you know when they put these things together there's got to be a way to get in yeah don't see where that way would be normal girl uh-huh do you like dremel --zz I can't get the answer to that on home pad we're in the home pod there's a giant speaker there's one side over here that has the ribbon that goes down for the to be able to talk to it so the thing that I like about this is the top of it is really the subwoofer the main speaker it takes up the entire space all the treble and the other noises come out of the bottom now this is supposed to be an adapted speaker so it listens to your room and sends out whether you're sitting over on that side of the room or that side of the room you should hear it the same it listens to the wall and changes based off of it but for that for being such a small compact thing the subwoofer is a pretty good size check it out when it moves to the base [Applause] [Music] poor Siri I'm sorry I'm not really that sorry very impressive brains up here at the top where it shows everything that's inside of that case and then it also has some sort of sensor that when you tap it it starts playing the music so what I think what I want to do now is just take the Dremel and cut clear across the middle see if we can open it up it's about a half-inch thick of plastic so but I'm still gonna try to cut around here and see how see if we can actually get in with the dremel we finally kill it are you Seri hey Siri hey Siri play music yeah hey Siri are you alive nope apparently Siri cannot handle a dremel across her belly my hands are dirty my hands are black right now we did it holy smokes that is cool that is so cool my wires right there then there's speaker I bet that the speaker well that's the bottom of the speaker so you got the speaker up top now that it's series not working let's just finish the job up here I'll just unplug ten we've effectively cut this in half I mean check that out this entire top half is just the speaker and then of course on top the chip that's our accessory fire top hat that probably makes it one of the main reasons why it's so heavy feel it yeah that's light sit this is super light supposed to have seven sensors and eight speakers but down here you have these little batteries and nothing fell out okay so we open this up this is the power line that comes in it comes in to the front it grabs this and it up to this metal middle part oh whoa those are a little speak so these must be the speakers one two three four five six seven so you've got yeah that's that's either the speakers are the sensors I just want to see the tweeters you call it I want it leaders and I think that they're inside of there okay the power cable actually comes out quite easily I didn't break it I just pulled it out and you can see it just has two little notches on it get out of the way [Music] yeah ha I smashed it open we got a hole in it and now I've got another one of these guys it's just like these little pods there's pods within the home pods I don't know why they make these little what do they call treble pods trouble speakers so hard to get into there's just these these little guys right here but I did break one of them you can see the little speaker it is small wow that is a really small speaker some oil honey from it ok so here's another one that we broke open and if you just look inside of there is the little speaker and then it just has the tiniest hole at the bottom where all the treble can come out of seven of these little speakers one of these giant speakers the top where Siri talks to you and you can tap and do all that stuff and all of this cool technology right whew that I don't know how it works somewhere in here and I'm guessing it's on this board they did say that there are seven sound sensors that where they're listening to the sound and then changing how much noise goes out and where the sound goes out of I think that's probably something for more of a technical person like jerry-rigged everything when he takes it apart maybe he can explain where the sensors are is it this giant thing with the batteries in there with this because what in the world is this is this speaker actually a magnet there are some screws that we took out I think we can find any of them oh here's one there they all are stuck on there all those met all those screws oh they're my weakened state you know from this aha this was awesome thank you for all of your suggestions but you could open a home pod if you would like to have this home pod the instructions down below how to win this we're not gonna give you this broken one we'll keep this one well give you a full-functioning one you'll have to have an Apple phone so don't enter if you don't have an Apple phone okay just don't do it unless you just want to resell on eBay then go ahead and enter and you we won't open this go if you sell it where you can have an Apple phone don't be like Zac
