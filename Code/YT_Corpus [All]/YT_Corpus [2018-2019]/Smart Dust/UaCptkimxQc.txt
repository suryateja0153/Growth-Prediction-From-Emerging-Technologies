 it might be a little hard to tell but that's not la it's downtown Austin covered in haze winds have carried Saharan dust over 5,000 miles to Central Texas and it's making it pretty hard for anyone with respiratory issues to breathe doctors say it's because our bodies aren't familiar with the dust from Africa experts say if you're having trouble breathing keep your inhaler close stay inside and drink plenty of water and that dust is definitely taking a toll on us here in Austin and across Central Texas and Albert how long is it going to be before that stuff makes its way out of town well it's gonna be with us all week long although today was the thickest plume of that Saharan dust to be sticking around made for spectacular sunset here's look at the time-lapse sunset between about 7:30 and 8:30 from the Oasis overlooking Lake Travis that reduced visibility that haze and distance made for a pretty stunning sunset at this hour our air quality remains unhealthy for sensitive groups in the orange category we'll be in the moderate category as we head towards tomorrow
