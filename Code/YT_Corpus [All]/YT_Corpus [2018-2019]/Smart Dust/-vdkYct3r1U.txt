 In this video were to talk a page builder that just bit the dust it stopped development work and talk about why a lot of those reports like GT metrics and other types of reports that might be run within your website I think you're kind of meaningless open up the discussion on that pleasant to give you a few updates here on the channel hi my name is Adam from WPCrafter.com where make WordPress tutorial videos for non-techies if you knew your consider clicking on the subscribe button you can join as of me recording this over 50,000 almost 50,000 51,000 other people that are subscribed here on the channel and if you want notifications when new videos go up there's gonna be a little bell next that subscribe button click on that you to let you know when a new video is uploaded so first I'm going to just give you little news on the channel just to spend a brief couple moments on it if there is any questions and kind of update you on some things is kind of like a weekly wrap up video right now first of all the big thing is this channel hit 50,000 subscribers about five days ago it's already almost a 51,000 but five days ago it had 50,000 I wanted to thank you for all your support on this channel for those you that are subscribed and have kept coming back I couldn't do this without you I mean if if I was uploading videos and no one was watching it or engaging there is no community being built I wonder how fast or how soon it would take for me to get burnt out and I probably would get burned out pretty quick and so I want to thank you for supporting this channel and if you're not a subscriber clutter consider clicking on that subscribe button you might not know this also have a second YouTube channel right here you can visit it by going to YouTube.com/my my full name Adam Preiser lot less subscribers and lot less action there but I'm starting to upload videos there that are different from WordPress but it's a lot a bit a lot about how I the with the what went on behind the scenes to build the WB graph your YouTube channel I talked about equipment techniques stuff like that for grown an audience online and getting your personality what is you to come out on lines you could check out that channel is that interests you and I wanted to about the video quality I know my video quality was getting good and now it's back to this I'm stuck in the bubble again and that's because I don't know if you saw a video from about a week or two ago where the camera I had bought was $1000 by this camera it was having focus issues in that camera actually was known to have focus issues so I had to return that and I am in between cameras right now so I'm back to a WebCam as you can see and I'm kind of in a transition because I've got you know I'm stuck in this black background it's not like any of my videos before however I'm working towards getting that all resolved and I'm sure the next week or two I'll be back in business with a better camera the next camera I'm buying is about 2000 authors it just gets more and more expensive but that's all right so that's what I'm working on and that's why the videos are like this but I decide you know it I'm just gonna roll with it as long as the audios good as long as the content can help someone I'm just gonna push ahead and do it one upbeat update those you that knew that I got a YouTube strike that is when someone when YouTube's automated systems things one of my videos is violated some community guideline these strikes go in place and because of that you lose fourth there for 90 days you lose the ability to stream live to YouTube and this as a victim of this and getting my the process as you file an appeal and then someone has to manually YouTube look through that appeal and they have been lousy with this whole entire process the of the appeal is still sitting there and it's been five weeks and I've talked to YouTube on live chat us live chat support I've hit them up on twitter I think what ended up happening is they created a disaster for themselves by just automatically taking down so many videos on so many channels there probably just buried in appeals so I'm just going to I'm just going to have to roll with it and keep positive if I have to wait out the 90 days oh well also Facebook is been making some changes as well making it harder for people to live stream there so I'm just gonna have to wait until June so that I can start live streaming here on the channel again I just accepted him to keep up the fight but I'm just going to accept it I want to let you know some of things that I'm working on and some of the things to expect so next week I'm going to be releasing probably daily videos and this can be pretty much a week dedicated to learning management systems tutorials with it helping people choose the right theme for it to be talking about the different plug-ins to be talking about learn \'96 something I haven't talked about much on the channel and some of the options there as well so it's pretty much get to be a week dedicated to that however if Elementor Pro version 2 is released next week I'll probably be doing double video so I'll have Elementor related contents and I'll also have this learning management content someone in the comment section asked the other day I think was it might've been on my website left the comment why I you know I'm not making much videos about Beaver Builder and I'll just be transparent answer that question here in the video I don't make many videos on Beaver Builder because no one watches him you know I'll put up a video about Beaver Builder in a video about Elementor the Beaver Builder will get maybe 600 views on it in the Elementor one will get 6000 views in a short period of time so you know I I want to not have this be all about Elementor but that's why if you're a Beaver Builder user you're probably not seeing a ton of content on Beaver Builder but I think Beaver Builder is great and I do have a video coming out on some of the mobile responsiveness improvements that Beaver Builder has made recently and I want to deftly do that are let's get onto some of the news one of things I wanted to tell you about is if you haven't been to a word camp these are two day events that are going on in cities all around the world and it's a two-day event it's extremely affordable here in the USA notes $40 a ticket I think it's like dirt cheap all like that everywhere in the actually the event is that $40 doesn't even cover the cost of the event because it includes lunch and there's different speakers and there's different people in the WordPress community work camps for me are not something that you should for me that I don't see that I'm going to go to regularly however I did go to the Orange County word camp last year in 2017 a probably get to go this year as well if you're planning on going though you better go and buy a ticket like ASAP the tickets have been on cell for one hour and they've already sold maybe 1/3 of the tickets is only 226 remaining no guarantee that I'm in a go I might go so will will see for sure if I go or not but I did buy tickets and when this attendee pages live you will see a picture of me that I am going I might change my mind depending on certain factors okay second thing I wanted to show you something really cool Thrive Architect okay Thrive Architect was a the second version of Thrive Content Builder they came out with an upgrade in the changed name to Thrive Architect which was smart I would talk about it too much on this channel I've had a few videos about it but I know some of you guys are using it I want to show you these really cool landing page templates that they released today and I've been expanding the course on my website that I have on Thrive Architect and so I've been really digging into it pretty deep I might have a few videos in the future on it so they have all these built-in landing pages there's a pun of them and here's some that they have for local businesses but they released these three variations today and there really interesting I've installed this one the health food shop now one of the neat things that they have that I don't see in other page builders and because of it and allows you to do unique things that they're really highlighting on this page they have this element called a content box and it's a little tough to wrap your head around it when you're first using it but then this is a perfect template that they put out that shows you what this thing is and what makes it special so on this page are to see lots of interesting shapes so you've got this image and it has this shape well it's actually their terminology as a decoration and this is essentially a content box and it allows you to it's kind of like a column in a page builder but it allows you to apply these decorations to it so this is a declaration right here so if I expand decorations you can see it's it's applying actually is it a deck actually that's not a decoration II think I got it back this all up by you probably do some of this stuff in your page builder what it's actually doing this is actually just a rounded border you don't actually think most builders will let you get a rounded border on particular corners so that's actually what this is that if I click on borders and corners you can see it's putting a 270\'b0 pixel whatever how that would be the terminology for that on these corners actually thought that was pretty interesting here's another example of the content box so here's the box they made it round and green and you put a gradient and then they just put an icon in there like that is a very creative use of their elements here's another one we have this content box creating this shape again and then you have an image in its and I don't think I think the image probably has that drop shadow it's not being actually applied by the builder or maybe it is thought that was pretty interesting and then when you scroll down here here's another creative use of it there's a layers here so here's a content box and then here's a content box and then here's a content box since you have these ways of layering in a better way than you would get with other page builders and then it has this really neat breadcrumbs thought that was very interesting and last thing I thought was interesting you probably do this with your page builder is here's a two column row or section and I like how they put these like features here in then they had a divider line pointing to the image I just thought that that looked really neat and I like how in this content box right here you have the image and it has the border and then it's also giving you these rounded shapes I found out this landing page very impressive be interesting if someone here tries to do some of these things may be me on one of the page builders we talk about news a lot on this channel which is Elementor and Beaver Builder or even Divi here's another actually interesting use you can see a divider being here used here rounding out the edge of this column right here let's see if what is that maybe that's the content box as well so you have this layering and dynamic nest going on okay another page builder but the test I actually made a video last year about a page builder that bit the dust and they just basically said you know Gutenberg's coming outs and they just saw the the deck the cards were stacked against them and here's another one that did the same thing you might not of heard events I don't talk about this on this channel that much when when were to go there it is up front builder a WP and you dev it's kind of a membership type deal where you pay them a fee and you get access to all these plug-ins I don't talk about it because I don't really find any of the plug-ins that great however if you are using something called WordPress multi site I would say definitely this is where you want to go but they may have like a security plug in a caching plug-in a pop up plug and they have all these various plug-ins although I find that other people in my opinion make them but better so anyways they made a page older they started making a 2015 I was actually keeping an eye on it at the time because I thought it was pretty neat what they were doing but if you go to their blog you'll see this blog post right here and this is dated the 12th which is just yesterday says saying goodbye to upfront to focusing on what members want and embracing the Gutenberg Divi beaver W bakery I'm surprised they don't put Elementor in there which has 700,000 active installations basically I think because their business model that outfront was kind of a flop and I think the reason why Elementor has grown the weight has as they they have a better business model then some of the other page builders and their business model is simple let's put a free page builder out that is better than some of the paid page builders out there but let's sell a version that can be added to it that will give developers what they want and developers are usually ones that open up their pocketbook and make purchases and because that magic formula you seen Elementor just take off and I think what working to see is a lot of page building plug-ins kind of throw in the towel because I mean if it doesn't make sense if you're not making money and you're spending more time on it and there is no end in sight there's no light at the end of the tunnel it might be time to tell your users this is a hard decision but this is the decision that were making I take no happiness in seeing anyone or any kind of product failure or anything like that but I tend to be very pragmatic and look at look at it from an analytical's perspective and say you know a lot of these don't even have a chance that's why on this channel people so check out this page builder this page builder this builder this that and the other and you know what I like I keep an eye on things I definitely keep an eye on things like I monitor things but I can usually tell when someone is knocking to make it and you know it's not a big deal with some plug-ins right so say you need a contact form and see your choosing which contact form builder there's no login to a contact form builder you can change your contact form at any time so is not that big of a decision but what you are using as the cornerstone to build your website that is a big decision and so that's why I'm ultra-careful with what's products that I'll even talk about here because if I had made a bunch of videos on upfront and I really believed in it but but then this happened and now all those people that were on the channel and they thought it was great to and then it ended up flopped flopping I would feel so responsible for that I would feel so horrible that I'm now giving I gave bad advice even though I went to bed and control so that's why have to be a little bit more careful with some of the products that I recommend so even though some other tool might come out tomorrow and it offers some things that some of these page builders don't have that really doesn't mean anything it is probably not really that worthy of attention until they show that they are getting attraction and that they're going to be able to be in it for the long haul so really what you see happening I think is with Gutenberg coming out it's going to be the nail on the coffin for a lot of these tools so that's the deal with upfront and I don't think they got much traction with it at all I just think it was wasn't the greatest page builder and they had in this locked ecosystem of people that probably weren't even willing to give it a try lastly I want to talk about reports are meaningless so two days ago iThemes Security have talked about in the past the release of version 5 of their plug-in and I guess the main new feature of it I did look at the change log is all they really talked about was this a security report so now there's a tab you click on it and it will show you a security report on your website and so here's the security report for my website and you can see that I'm getting an F for the security of my website and then there's some stuff explaining it but when I look here at the security settings these are just settings that really are not standard meaning people are using this as a standard a lot of them how do these 1234 of the contributing factors to me getting an F is that I don't like to factor authentication I don't like to vent factor authentication I find it very inconvenient there is no way on God's green earth that I would force the users of my website to use two factor authentication and because of that I get an F on this report and there's also something here were you know it only knows what it knows I did it says I don't have database backups while the reality is I'm not using their tool for database backups because who on earth would use a tool just for database backups you have to have a more comprehensive backup solution so if if I wanted a better grade from this report I now would have to enable the income you two factor authentication have dual backups solutions running and taken away from the resources on my hosting account at the same time I just want to make the point that these reports if your web developer and you're making websites your client I I feel for you these reports there really nonsense their complete and utter nonsense because you know it says F and so if you have a client and they login they say oh my gosh I getting an F and then now they're banging down your door this is with this is an example that you probably one run into as much an example that you do run into his GT metrics or Google page speed insights were you your client goes there you've given them a website and they take the URL and they plug it in there and says you know what your website is getting an F and so then they come sending you an email making the phone call to you sing wise my website getting enough this this is ridiculous but then you have the uphill battle of explaining to them that GT metrics what it's basing that off of its complete nonsense okay I will give them that they are some guidelines in there that would be good if you could implement but in a WordPress environment you cannot you cannot always in every scenario meet all of those requirements to get N/A it's just not feasible it's just not even practical but they're coming in there only looking at that letter grade I'll tell you I have seen and I was been running some tests for a video that I'm going to make on how to choose a WordPress theme and my thinking that goes into it and it's just to enlighten people to help them make a better decision on the theme that they choose and the tools that they choose to use and one of the themes that I was using and it just so happens to be one of the most selling themes like I tested it on GT metrics on one of its demos but on my hosting and it took 15 seconds to load the website yet GT metrics gave it an a and all those categories and that's when I realize through talking to some other developers that those GT metric scores are actually easy to manipulate if your theme developer there's ways of manipulating it to get those A's outside the theme developers problem are over there there's no like ill will with them or there's no bad intentions by making these little tweaks just to get that good score yet other aspects the aspects that matter the most they're not really paid attention to is much because what they're doing is the air buyers are saying there they're doing the same things so there their buyers are taking the demos putting them in GT metrics and running the scores so they have to have those a letter grades and do whatever it takes to make it saying a even if the low times not good and there's actually a more important metric and that's when a website is actually usable a lot of people don't realize this you can go to one of those page speed is speed testing sites and it might say the website loads and one and 1/2 seconds that's not taken into consideration is the parts of that website that need to load in order for you for the visitor to actually begin using the website and what that is called is TTI and it's something that is only a newer term maybe in the last year and 1/2 and there aren't even any E tools out there that will measure TTI TTI stands for time to interaction and that's when the enough of the website is loaded so that the visitor can actually start interacting with the website I got a video coming that out on that as well so what one of the things I'm trying to accomplish is to create some cornerstone content that people can send to their clients when they get challenged with these questions so if you have a client coming to you saying all you delivered this site is has an F on this tool will you could send a link to this video that I make and it will explain to them how what it's using to derive that F is not necessarily important at all and what really matters is the load time the time to first bite in the time to interaction that's all that really matters if some little thing is not loading the way that that reporting tool wants it to it's really meaningless if those other three things are in order and also the video about choosing a theme this is going to be perfect for you if you are a website developer and you have client, to say and I want you to build a website but I want you to use this this particular theme because it's like the number one theme instead of you having to sit there and explain to them why it's a bad idea to use that theme you'll be able to reference the particular video on it got a lot of good analogies that I've been working on to really drive the point home why how how what should be guiding your decision on which tools to actually use irrefutable this video be absolutely irrefutable so anyways I got all of those things coming up so anyways this is just like kind of a weekly wrap it up I wanted to update you on some things talk about some of these new events you have any questions for me go ahead and ask down below I know I open up a lot of cans of worms for discussion but if you have anything to add I'd love to hear from you you down below in the comment section last let me say thank you for all the support on the channel I really appreciate it couldn't do it without you thanks for watching Hope you have a great day and I'll see in the next video
