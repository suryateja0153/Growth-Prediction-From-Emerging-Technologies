 hey friends , so in this ear of technology everything is becoming smart and advance whether its car or a vacuum cleaner or anything so in this world of smart things xiaomi has invented and launched a new smart trash bin (dustbin) , yes you heard it right a new smart trash bin (dustbin ) which has got some unique and great features so , keep watching this video , in this video , i will discuss , the features , specs , price and some more details so this a unique smart trash bin  which will require a small amount of electricity , and after that its a great smart gadget (or device or whatever you will say ) so they have provided a storage of 15.5 liters , so the moment this dustbin gets a trash of 15.5 liters and so this dustbin senses that there is no room so it notifies the user that there is no more room either by alarm or any smart means , this weight of this dustbin is around 3.5 kgs and they even provided some proximity sensors and some more sensors which makes it a great and wonderful product So now lets talk about some features of it so the first one is so they have a provided a proximity sensor which senses , as it has got a range of 30cm to 50 cm and so it senses if someone wants to throw trash in it ( as you take your hand close to it ) and so it opens the cap automatically so , that's how proximity sensors helps it as it senses that if anyone wants to throw trash in it and so it opens on it own and then closes on its own and this makes it really a smart trash bin and so designing and implementation is also great you people must be thinking that if there is any option to put the plastic bag in it so that its easy to throw the trash and the bin is cleaned but they have implemented a new feature, that you don;t need to do it as in inside there a mechanism which does it all on its own you just need to a plastic bag inside it and which makes it easy to replace plastic so when the trash is around 15.5 liters this 15.5 liters this so this thing on its own pack that plastic ( with the help of some sealing technology , which uses heat so that all human is need to do is take out the plastic bag and dump it and they have provided an air tight lid which doesn't allows any smell to pass it and not only this there is even a system through which you can clean it if there is any oduor inside and i hope its washable cause the cleaner the bin the healthy the environment so now talikng about the dimensions that is 240mm x 240 mm x 310 mm x 420mm which i think is pretty good for a normal family and the power output it needs is 12.2v which is okay i guess so they have launched it in some more colour options talking about when it will launched as you know xiaomi they don't launch many things in India (outside china ) so maybe they will not release in INDIA (outside china ) but i hope that they should release it in INDIA as the demand for these awesome innovative things are quite high they didn't launched the mi robot or that vacuum cleaner that thing also had a great performance and even a lot of people imported that robot to their countries (also IN INDIA) so at last the people who like it , somehow orders it from chinese website (but that's quite expensive ) so talking about the price , so in chinese market its 199 yuan , which if i will convert in inr that will be in round figure 2000 INR (29 dollars ) and in exact 1999 INR (28.96 $) so , that's it for this video i hope this video was helpful and good , if you liked it don't forget to like and share PLZ, PLZ PLZ and do comment your views are you willing to buy a smart trash bin like that and PLZ PLZ PLZ DON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE AS I KEEP ON MAKING VIDEOS LIKE THIS.!!
