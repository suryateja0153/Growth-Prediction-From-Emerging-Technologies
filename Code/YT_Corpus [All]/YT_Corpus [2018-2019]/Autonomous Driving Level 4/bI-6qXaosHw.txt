 automobiles in one form or another have been around since the 1800s this single invention has revolutionized transportation and left a traditional horse and carriage in the past over a hundred years later the staple of the 20th century is ready for a revolution of its own autonomous or driverless cars promised a brighter future for mobility City planning and accessibility which has people feeling both excited and apprehensive about this emerging technology with autonomous vehicles it would give me that independence to be honest it kind of scares me freedom I'm Alex might and after I was diagnosed with Usher syndrome I had to end my journey of getting my driver's license as a result I've always been a passenger but thanks to advances in autonomous vehicle research technology and innovation I myself may soon be able to step behind the wheel and experience life in the driver's seat so join me as we explore the future of automotive transportation and shifting gears autonomous vehicles while exploring autonomous vehicles I wanted to find out what other people from the blind and low-vision community felt about this technology i sat down with kari anton stephanie leech and hamid safety and asked what an autonomous vehicle would mean for them as a person who's legally blind i really wish that i could get behind a wheel or just have that independence to go where I want when I want for an affordable price and that I think is what autonomous cars will do for me for me it's the the safety is for me the my biggest concern and how it can be insured because I don't know if I would want to like trust my life in the hands of technology so definitely it's a passion to want to drive I think I thought it was vehicle to something which would give you that ability for someone like myself I own a house I own you know cottages and land and things but the one freedom that I don't have is to get where I want when I want and an affordable cost so it would really be a dream come true for me before we go any further we need to answer the basic question what is an autonomous vehicle for that I meet up with Paul God's mark CTO and co-founder of cab Co the Canadian automated vehicle center of excellence in Edmonton an autonomous vehicle is basically a vehicle that can drive itself and it can drive itself safely on public roads in most in most weather conditions a connected vehicle is a vehicle that talks to other vehicles and talks to the infrastructure the connected vehicle technology is aimed at improving the efficiency of the road network and providing safety benefits because the vehicles talk to each other and most autonomous vehicles are connected any way that there's so the key thing when discussing connected vehicle technology is what technology is being used to provide the connection because that determines the functionality that gets added on through the connection when gauging the autonomy of a vehicle there are five levels of classification so level zero the vehicle has no no automated features whatsoever level one is is the sort of vehicle that most people drive and one or more of braking acceleration and steering have assistance from an automated feature so cruise control if your vehicle has cruise control its 11 one vehicle level two is where it gets more interesting that's where you get a multiple combination of those features and the car gives the impression that it's driving itself but it has to have oversight constant oversight from the driver otherwise it's not it's not safe level three is when real automation comes in because level three is when the vehicle will do some of the journey all on its own and it doesn't need the driver to pay attention so for instance highway on ramp to off-ramp the vehicle will drive itself during that period and you don't have to pay attention but when you get to the off-ramp it will tell you right you take back control driver and level four is when the vehicle can do journeys entire journeys without any input but it's constrained in some way on that journey so it might be constrained by can only operate in a certain area or it can't operate outside of specific weather patterns and then level five is basically the vehicle will drive anywhere at any time demonstration vehicles have shown level four capability with no one in the driver's seat and the leading autonomous vehicle developer is a comfortable way mode and they have come out of Google self-driving car project and there they have said several times that they will be starting commercial operations this year it probably in Phoenix Arizona and they will hope to have a second city this year as well a number of companies have started testing in piloting their autonomous vehicles on public roads Phoenix Arizona as Paul mention is a hotbed of activity with California and Michigan also serving as major testing centers but what about Canada definitely within five years we will have mass deployment in a Canadian city that's my prediction the the autonomous vehicle is is one of the biggest tools in the smart city toolkit in a way this the autonomous vehicle is the making of the Internet of Things the Internet of Things is really about putting sensors all over a city or autonomous vehicles our sensors or wheels that can go wherever you want within a city and the best thing we can do is to put the infrastructure in place for the connectivity the communications lay lots of fiber putting lots of high quality wireless networking and then take advantage of all of that sensor data that these autonomous vehicle fleets will be bringing in even with that information there are a lot of questions people have surrounding autonomous and connected vehicles so members of the blind and low-vision community got an opportunity to ask the experts their biggest questions about an autonomous driving future hi my name is Hamid safee and I was wondering what kind of technologies would be implemented into autonomous vehicles in order to allow people with accessibility requirements to offer 8000 independently after the break we will find out the answer to Hammad's question when shifting gears autonomous vehicles returns welcome back to shifting gears autonomous vehicles Hamid safety has a question for kab goes Paul God's mark what kind of technologies would be implemented in two autonomous vehicles in order to allow people with accessible requirements to operate them independently way moe have made a point of working with the gentleman called Steve man who is legally blind and their system they have deliberately been developing a system that is accessible to certainly blind users and so my expectation and hope is is that they will come up with system a system or systems that are very user-friendly for the disabled community whatever their limitation Edmonton is one city that is interested in exploring the realm of autonomous vehicles they recently announced a pilot project that will bring an autonomous shuttle to the city the City of Edmonton Stephanie McCabe explains more one of the big challenges for cities is autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles come into play is that we want to continue to build a city for people a city where people feel connected to one another where people are healthy where they love where they live we need to ensure that the cities still built for people to connect and we can see that there's a change a major change in technology in four areas and automated vehicles connected vehicles shared mobility and electrification of our transportation system and as a result we want to make sure that we're prepared as we set that next vision for the next thirty years so this year our City Council motioned us to understand what the impact of autonomous vehicles would be on our city plan as we enter that next major planning stage of our city and as part of that motion they asked us to do a pilot project by the end of this year the state of Edmonton is very excited to be introducing Emmett onehans to Ella she's an electric autonomous shuttle in October and we're testing that as part of developing our next city plan so the vehicles produced by easy mile and it's operated in a number of other country it's cruising speed will be up to 20 kilometers an hour it seats six people and can also have six people standing on it at the same time and it operates on a fixed route the vehicle is wheelchair accessible stroller accessible and they'll also be an attendant on-site to ensure that people can easily enter and exit the vehicle because Edmonton can experience some extreme weather patterns in October the city conducts daily safety checks as part of the pilot to ensure the weather and road conditions are suitable for testing so every single day prior to the vehicle operating we will get sign-off that it is a safe day to be running the vehicle and anything that happens in terms of the weather changing well that's happened while the vehicle is running we will make sure to adjust accordingly and keep people safe well the vehicle is set there are still some hurdles before the pilot is launched we're still working with the province through their legislative framework to test autonomous vehicles you can't test autonomous vehicles on public roadways in alberta yet so we'll work through the provinces framework to ensure that we're testing in an area that's safe and that meets their legislative framework Edmonton offers some unique situations in terms of our climates and in terms of our infrastructure so it allows us to test the vehicle in an area that hasn't necessarily been tested before what's also really unique about our pilot is we're encouraging citizens to come and ride on the vehicle on the autonomous electric vehicle and for them to experience that technology and my understanding is that hasn't happened before in Canada so allow for citizens to come down take a ride on Ella and tell us what their perception is of it this pilot project is another example of Edmonton's push to become a leader in smart city design the City of Edmonton has been recognized as a smart city we've got a number of areas that we work on as a smart city we've won a number of awards in this area and in fact right now we are one finalist in the federal government Smart City challenge our role right now is to ensure that we continue to build the city that meets the needs of antonius the city is also involved in a project exploring connected vehicle in smart city technology organized by the University of Berta and utilizing partnerships with the city province and tech companies the active Aurora project is an example what a connected future might look like dr. Toni Q is a director for the Center for smart transportation at the University of Alberta so Vico is getting smart honest matter so now we talk about automatic vehicle from common point of view you want to know how in the future how we can prepare our infrastructure to make it a compatible with smart of eco and for the short term of Atlanta I hopped into the pilot vehicle to get a first-hand look at what a connected vehicle could do Alisa Atlee communications coordinator for active Aurora along with other members of the project demonstrate how it works so the actor of our project started in 2014 officially and what that means is that was when we began starting the plans for installing roadside sensors and equipping vehicles with the ability to be able to communicate with other vehicles and what we've done is we have a unique test by the first of its kind in Canada and it includes three different roadways in Edmonton where are the different locations that these sensors are in place so in Edmonton as part of the first phase of the project getting these sensors in place we have three different roadways so the first is Anthony handy white my drive and then we have 23rd a part of it as well with the three different zones that you're testing are you getting different information what why did you choose those three areas so we chose those areas because there are different types of road so 23rd ave is arterial road and wait months a freeway and Anthony the highway so allows us to get the different speeds different Road geometrics being able to look at safety and color different kinds of data that way using an app on her smartphone Alisa demonstrates a type of notifications drivers would received so we're showing you a little bit of white blood drive and 23rd ave so some of the things that you can see here the number of seconds counting down the lights giving you an advisory driving speed which we would use in scenarios for example if it was icy on the white web so you might want to go 60 km/h instead of 80 km/h advisory speed warning ahead advisory speed is 60 kilometers per hour that's one of the applications that shows an advisory driving speed warning which could be potentially used to let drivers know what the appropriate speed is based on traffic conditions or if there's poor weather and you need to slow down yeah and even laying the driver know about things like when they're entering a school zone for example so that they're more aware of the environment around them in who is behind the alerts or the communication from the the sensors so the city traffic management center would be playing a major role in relaying some of those informations the entire traffic network of course we also want the vehicles to be able to communicate with each other as well so for example if the vehicle in front is braking suddenly then we want the other vehicle behind it to be able to respond immediately this app has notifications that include speed suggestions turn warnings and a stoplight countdown feature not all intersections have an automatic counter so this formation gave me eight drivers let them know when the light is about to change now is the connected vehicle can be able to solve the construction issues that is the big question well you'll be you'll be able to know where there's construction and when that will definitely be helpful for planning your own so again I would probably go back to the city being able to let us know exactly where these work zones are and so that we can plan our route accordingly and in real time so we won't have the kind of technology platform and then make sure all the we code will be connected to the kind infrastructure including pedestrian including particle including motorcycle and potentially it has a huge benefit to our society and that's including the disabled persons and planned persons for example and we can improve safety in intersection the active auroral project completed its phase 1 in 2017 and is currently working on phase 2 which will focus on safety and security and expand the sensor network to 200 sites covering 20% of Edmonton and the highway between Edmonton and Red Deer because the free stage was really about getting the infrastructure which our test button is the first of its kind in Canada and it's also unique from other similar test beds in the States because we have our extreme climate here extreme cold winters and we can test whether this equipment is going to work in those temperatures high collision location ahead watch out so a high collision area warning is actually based on historical data so what that means is based on knowing where there's a lot of collisions happening you can make a warning for that particular area to make people more aware when they're entering that area to pay more attention and drive market aflame that's interesting because that's the thing especially if let's say you're not a local to the area here they're coming around a mint or whatever that could be notorious for a lot of accidents good information to help yeah it's to make people more aware and improve safety Kaneesha have an everyday fatality happen every day so we wanna make sure the current technology can assist driver and improve safety if we do today we can reduce congestion today if we do today we can save lives today what's different about active Aurora's it's connected vehicles so that's the vehicle speaking to the infrastructure and what we're testing in October is an autonomous vehicle so when you bring autonomous and connected vehicles together that's the ultimate power of the technology is when you can have vehicle to vehicle communication and vehicle to infrastructure communication I'm grant Hardy and when it comes to autonomous vehicles I'm so fascinated by all the research and development that's happening right now but I want to know when I'm gonna be able to buy one and sit behind the wheel and drive it we will get the answer to Grant's question when shifting gears autonomous vehicles returns we return to shifting gears autonomous vehicles an AM eyes grant Hardy has an important question for catco's Paul God's mark I want to know when I'm gonna be able to buy one and sit behind the wheel and drive it well the first thing I want to do is challenge the assumption that we'll be able to buy an autonomous vehicle it doesn't actually make that much sense for the people developing autonomous vehicles to sell them because when they sell them they're also basically selling a lot of access to the data that their vehicles produce and all of the early leaders are saying we're going to provide the service the business models mean that people will make more money and get more efficiencies if they provide this big fleet for us so we can basically subscribe to it and get the rice that we need while companies are exploring the possibility of offering autonomous ride share programs as Paul mentioned there is a lot of work to be done before they are the norm in Canada you cannot currently test autonomous vehicles on public roads which keeps progress in this space relatively limited the Canadian Senate released a report on the current state of readiness for autonomous vehicles in Canada with major questions and concerns raised about how prepared Canada is for driverless vehicles senator Dennis Dawson spoke at the Ottawa autonomous vehicle summit about the report change is coming we were talking about the change in the Senate changes coming these automated vehicles are coming towards us there's a lot of resistance on on this issue but we have to face the fact that it's not it's not the question of of if it's a question of when so now we're telling them with this report start getting prepared because this issue is coming down the road and you are not prepared that's not tomorrow that's today it's happening now and it's gonna be happening more and more despite these setbacks I'm still optimistic there's a bright future ahead here in Alberta when it comes to autonomous technology but I want to find out what's happening elsewhere in the country for that I'm off to my home province of Ontario first stop I'm with rod Katri director of automotive technology and mobility innovation at the Ontario centres of excellence who tells me about some of the work being done in the province the Ontario centres of excellence is an organization that supports technology development industry academic collaborations and delivers programs on behalf of the Ontario government the autonomous vehicle innovation network is a project that the Ontario government has funded and has asked us to deliver on their behalf to grow Ontario's strengths in the space of connected and autonomous vehicles the autonomous vehicle innovation network has a number of programs and the the project in Stratford is very important because in order to commercialize a technology and in order to go global and bring back those economic benefits in that job creation into our province we need to show customers a company to show a customer how their technology works in a controlled real-life scenario and that's what Strafford's doing to the providing vehicle platforms is providing the enabling infrastructure is providing the environment the controlled environment so that once you've done your development work or once you've developed your new product or once you've you know taken your idea to the next level you can integrate it onto a vehicle and bring a customer and say look at what I can do it's a hot and sunny day here in the town of Stratford and with the population of less than 35,000 people this small southwestern Ontario town may be quaint and unassuming but quietly it has become a leader and model in smart city planning and innovation I'm Dan Matheson the mayor of Stratford Ontario Stratford is a predominantly agricultural area we're in Perth County the largest farm gate receipts of any County in the country we also are home with the Stratford Shakespeare Festival founded in 1953 we're an hour and a half from downtown Toronto two and a half from downtown Detroit well I think Stratford is a small urban community that understands that in the future we're seeing mobility disability transportation and government services all come together so I'm Joni Gerber the CEO of investor out the city's Economic Development Corporation so we look after all of the traditional economic development activities if you will a number of years ago Stratford thought about innovation and technology in a bit of a different way created a business case around the infrastructure that was required to support the electric utility and from there we ended up with 30 kilometers of fiber in the ground and a completely wired city if you will why that's been incredibly important is fast-forward you know 10 years and here we are able to offer an autonomous vehicle and regular vehicle companies connectivity that they wouldn't otherwise get in a municipality the other interesting approach we've taken is it's not just a enclosed track it's not just a piece of street somewhere we're thinking about this project as municipal wide so there are 24 stop lit intersections in the city of Stratford and all of those will be available to companies looking to test their autonomous technology and the car companies who are hoping to deploy these technologies in the very near future my name is Warren Ali I am the vice president of innovation that the automotive parts Manufacturers Association the APM a our role is actually as the go-between between the technology companies that manufacture the parts technology software etc that we go on to the vehicle and the work that we are doing specifically related to Aven and the work that we will be doing here in Stratford is to demonstrate those technologies products and services that will be incorporated into those vehicles of the future so the APM a we've been around for 66 years and for the past seven or eight years a subset of our members that are focused on new technologies that are going to be coming up to adjust opportunities in connectivity in safety and autonomous vehicles they needed a different environment to be able to demonstrate their production and their materials and their services and products Stratford has a unique mix it has an urban environment that's close to rural with agriculture initiative so it's all of the various scenarios in which connected of an autonomous technologies products and services would like to be demonstrated all in one area and then of course the fact that Stratford has already gone ahead and made those invest in that connected infrastructure that vehicles will need to interact with we are 12 to 14 square kilometers we have really strong weather patterns here we have four seasons we have a million tourists a year autonomous and connected cars are going to need to be able to move in different weather the patterns with a lot of pedestrians minimal pedestrians so what we found is we're kind of that living lab the perfect size the petri dish companies are actually really intrigued and excited about what's happening here there are a lot of really great opportunities in a municipality of our size we're nimble so we move quickly and our municipality can respond and not quickly and I think that's really what sets us apart there's some gravitas if you will to being a leader in this industry stepping forward and being the test facility does three things for us first of all it allows us to actually try out the technology and to be in the front end of government as they work through this problem with manufacturers and researchers - it allows us to get the infrastructure that's going to be needed a decreased rates because companies are going to need to proof of concept and make sure that their systems work and three the marketing that comes with this the differentiating that's saying our community's a little bit different than the others is a brand that helps build on what we have so when you put it all together it's a perfect recipe for success this is really about working on mobility as a whole and ensuring that all people of all types regardless of capabilities and capacity have that ability now to be connected to one another in a vehicular way the University of Waterloo is a hub of innovation and research and that innovation extends to autonomous vehicle technology currently a student team is participating in the three-year long SAE Auto Drive challenge with the goal of producing a level four autonomous vehicle ross mckenzie managing director for the Waterloo Center for Automotive Research or what car tells me more the University of Waterloo is one of eight teams across North America that participates in the auto drive challenge it's organized by the Society for Automotive Engineers and General Motors is the primary sponsor the University was one of the schools selected from a number across both Canada in the u.s. that applied and were one of two schools in Canada that were fortunate enough to be accepted into the competition in kiel Patel is a member of the aptly-named what Donna mist team I got involved because I was really interested in smart cities one of the things about autonomous vehicles or I guess the Thomas devices in general so drones planes and etc all these play really well into smart cities and for a variety where I see smart city playing a major role is in is in mitigating accidents making commutes faster more efficient and in general making sure that we're all more connected so this is a three year competition and we've only finished the first year next year we expect to see dynamic objects so being able to avoid these objects being able to avoid construction zones as well as being able to park so the vehicle has two camera sensors on top that that are front-facing and they're able to give us about 120 degrees field of vision in the front of the car then we have a lighter which is also on top of the car and the lier gives us a 3d point cloud of our surroundings so the way the lidar works you can imagine it as a 16 paintball gun stacked on top of each other and instead of paintballs they shoot rubber balls and so they wait for the rubber balls to come back and the time it takes for it to come back this is how it's how far apart or how far away objects are from the car the lighters enclosed in a cylindrical box it has a special filter around it in order to these filters certain frequencies of light this has a go through our software pipeline it didn't it didn't turns it into a decision that the car can make and a decision is funneled back to the car into steering angles and acceleration profiles for the car and in our drives itself Steven Lee is one of the team leads on the autonomous project a lot of a lot of industry news have been coming out a lot of just an innovation investment and development in this space in this tech space and I think with all these forces that are driving it it's it's becoming more and more inevitable so I wanted to be a part of that people should note that we have the we are developing the tools to actually make this work and they're just gonna be a lot more productivity and and it's certainly gonna be disruptive because you know the moment that you turn the the chairs for the two front chairs inwards you know who knows what that's gonna look like that's that's a new office space that's a new you know better interactions hopefully the car the car space itself it's gonna be more fun because I think autonomous vehicles are rather just autonomy in general is the future I think it can help a lot of people and helping someone across the street new or more complex things like driving cars it's so definitely a ton of autonomous vehicles appeals to me because of this because of this ability to make wise easier for anyone else one of the mantras I use right now is that the decisions I make are only as good as the data I get and so the more data we have the more efficient more safer our community my name is Kerry Anton and my question is what is the affordability of these kinds of vehicles for people like myself and the average person shifting gears autonomous vehicles will return with the answer to Kerry's question after the break shifting gears autonomous vehicles is back with a question from Carrie Anton for what cars Ross Mackenzie what is the affordability of these kinds of vehicles for people like myself and the average person I foresee the day when you will be able to buy an autonomous vehicle it's not on the short term horizon that those will be publicly available the first deployment will probably be vehicles that perform an autonomous shuttle but there's definitely an ability to buy an autonomous vehicle on the horizon they'll be a little more expensive than a standard vehicle but as with everything else when technology hits a mass production scale costs come down accessible transportation is a major issue for members of the disability community one company that is tackling this issue is the UK company Arrigo at the Ottawa autonomous vehicle summit Arrigo CEO David keen explained how their vehicle can help the lives of people with disabilities by the way he uses the term supercomputer to describe people because of our ability to process countless amounts of information simultaneously and subconsciously we have a number of our supercomputers who actually need our help they might have a disability they might have a a brain or neurological issue they might be blind they might have a medical term condition like epilepsy for instance which doesn't allow them to drive they might be just too old that they now can't drive and what this does is it means that the effective mobility of these people in our society is limited and I'm not talking about hundreds of miles I'm just talking about a mile or two miles from their homes to the shops or to their friends or to where they need to go and we really need to do something about that my company or ego set about trying to find a solution for those people and we created a pod zero and it's called pod zero because it's zero emissions because it's an Eevee it's zero driver and it's zero collisions because it is a completely autonomous vehicle the pod zero comes in the variety of models with passenger sizes ranging from 2 up to 15 with cameras sensors and screens lining the vehicle it is able to scan the environment to avoid collisions it is also equipped with lights over the wheel covers that change color to indicate if the vehicle is driving or stopping it doesn't go very big distances it only goes 50 miles it has a top speed of only 15 miles per hour and in fact actually when its operating it only averages out about 6 miles per hour but if you're disabled and you want to get around 6 miles an hour is pretty good and if you can get into this vehicle and this vehicle knows where you want to go it can take you straight there because of the part zeros low speed it enables the vehicle to drive in non-conventional spaces we're operating in primarily pedestrianised areas and we can also confine the environment and make the environment a lot easy for us to solve the problem of running autonomous vehicles in those areas since there is no driver or controls the interior space is designed with full accessibility in mind and we've spent a lot of time in the UK working with institutions like the Guide Dogs for the Blind to develop the pod to make it so super friendly for anyone who's got a disability and I'm very pleased to say that our third international headquarters we're announcing today and that will be in Ottawa and although it's a small beginning I think it's going to be a really big thing to develop collaborations and really bring the Arrigo pods to locations within Ottawa and wider into Canada tech companies and auto manufacturers aren't the only ones developing autonomous vehicles at the region of Waterloo's emergency services training and research complex University of Waterloo staff and researchers are testing their autonomous vehicle called the autonomous dance and Garcia Hardware lead for the project describes the vehicle while the autonomous is first and foremost is a research platform based out of the University of Waterloo and what we're researching on is how we can drive vehicles autonomously and so there's a lot involved in this particular project right of course there's the hardware devices that come into play to drive the car autonomously some of the hardware includes a lidar sensor attached to the group of the car that is surrounded by eight cameras there's three in front there's two on each side and there's one at the back and why are they position like that well because we want to make sure that when we go around and collect data we can research all those photos and images and create this image that basically surrounds the entire car at the back of the eight cameras there's two GPS antennas that gathers GPS satellite signals onto the car the reason why there's two is so that we can actually better predict where the car is and in the trunk basically what we have is a CPU that has two graphics cards and the reason why we have those two because we're trying to do detection not only for vehicles right but also for pedestrians and cyclists and what we try to do in this object detection is not only detect these objects but also predict where their movements are gonna be next that way we can see them as obstacles and we can avoid them in terms of where their path is well the next step for us actually well in the near term we're planning to drive publicly on local roads and we're pretty close hopefully we will do that in the next couple of months we're planning to do hundred kilometers of public road driving grass Mackenzie explains how the autonomous is able to handle the unique Canadian weather one of the big advantages we have here is the ability to do full four season testing for all of our automotive research and in the autonomous space there's not a lot has been undertaken for winter driving conditions and we've had some significant advances in that space able to process images that are partially clouded over from a camera because there's raindrops on them or ice is formed from snowflakes landing on the camera lens but still able to use those images off the camera it's one element where we did some custom work to enhance our software to be able to handle those partial images I had heard enough about the autonomous so it was time for me to hop in and go for a ride first as a passenger Carlos Wang a member of the autonomous team explains how to get things started Carlos were in the vehicle this is the moment to shine so what now we start to vehicle by using this joystick so this joystick directly communicates with the computer at the back and our computer does all the autonomous driving and whatnot last thing before we get started I notice there's a big red button that says emergency stop what is that for that is to cut all actuation signals to the car in a scenario where do you think it's too dangerous for the car to drive itself you want it just like boom you hit it and then you take over the wheel the computer will say ok the driver took over the car I'm just gonna let it let driver to take full control yeah ok great let's get going Carlos pressed the green button on the controller to get the car in motion you're gonna see its switching gears and it's gonna start driving this is ridiculous like the steering wheel is going on its own the car is moving your feet aren't on the brakes or the gas your hands aren't on the wheel and it's driving yes I I'm speechless honestly like I I you hear about this you you read about this but being in the vehicle and it's driving on its own I don't know whether I'm I'm super excited or nervous like wow just wow yeah this is this is awesome this is truly the future I hear part of the future is the real-time 3d lidar map which shows the car and its surroundings green lines projecting from the front of the car displays possible paths the car might take with green dots marking the cars route it's kind of like you put cheese or you line up some cheese and then you got the most kind of eating each piece of cheese but it's kind of going towards the cheese by itself but Carlos this isn't the autonomous this is the autonomous so I I think let's chase the green dots let's go around the track I don't know what is weird whether it's the the car that just gauging and changing the speed on its own or when you just see the subtle adjustments of the steering wheel it's I'm torn between the two because both of them are just radical to me but I mean the whole overall experience is really really unique I've been tortured how cool this is yet I feel like I need to reiterate out cold business I think is cool too after a few laughs as a passenger it was my turn to get behind the wheel for the first time since I was diagnosed with Usher syndrome I'm so excited I'm finally behind the wheel this is my time to shine I've been dreaming about this for a while three two one engaged and we're off oh this is so weird it's such a strange feeling being behind the wheel and not touching it and it is just turning on its own I don't have to do any braking in a gas or anything I started to enjoy myself pretty quickly in the driver's seat this is so cool look mom no hands I never knew driving could be this easy we currently are still like into baby steps or we're in the infancy of autonomous driving I guess it's kind of like if you're a dad and you teach you're your son or your daughter how to ride a bicycle of course there's the aspect where you actually are kind of scared that they're gonna fall right by the same time you gotta let them grow [Music] i'm laura bane and what i want to know is whether i as someone with vision loss am actually going to be able to drive one of these autonomous vehicles by myself i think that's the main goal the main goal is to actually allow people with all needs right basically be able to drive the car when a technology shift as seismic as this one takes place there is always challenges that must be faced i've witnessed some of the newest innovations and met the people working to make autonomous vehicles possible and frankly I couldn't be more excited I can't wait for the day that I can hop into a car drive where I need to go without having to worry about my disability and thanks to vehicles like the autonomous I feel that day is just around the corner thanks for riding along with me on shifting gears autonomous vehicles now time to take the autonomous for one last spin [Music] host Alex might videographer and editor Patrick Kelly
