 the federal government releasing new regulations today to ensure the development and testing of autonomous vehicles is done safely these robot cars good of course theoretically reduce crashes reduce highway deaths but there's been growing anxiety that the road to their development could be paved with a lot of danger well let's bring in guy Gordon he joins us now live with the effort to find a balance guy and it's that's all what it's about Carmon finding the balance making sure that we accelerates ourselves into a future where we reduce those traffic deaths but also make sure that the bugs are out of these vehicles before we hit the road now we're in the Ann Arbor area home to the two of the big testing facilities for this from the get-go both researchers and automakers have been saying to the uncles to Uncle Sam give us the rules give us the standards that we need to meet well today they took a first major step in that direction but some still have major reservations and this is why a private citizen dies while beta testing the Tesla autopilot system the new guidance seeks to ensure bugs are discovered before these vehicles hit the road the new guidance sets a 15 point safety assessment system with automakers providing information on validation and testing technical specs and methods to prevent hacking it proposes mandatory certification from Nitsa before automakers can introduce driverless vehicles it is a first of its kind taking us from the horseless carriage to the driverless car Nitsa will also immediately assess vehicles available now with semi autonomous features like this Mercedes we're not all that confident while encouraged many safety advocates worried about federal oversight concert' average motorists will be quote human guinea pigs if automakers fail to voluntarily share information with Uncle Sam the manufacturers of autonomous vehicles as systems have to be transparent about what's going on what they're testing is doing and what their experience is our concern is that in the past that hasn't happened and Consumer Reports went even further today saying this is all bark no bite that we don't need guidelines we need strict standards but supporters of this process say this is the beginning of the process that the rulemaking will come along with the stricter standards once they begin to write these things they also were very encouraged by the fact that there is a lot of collaboration built in to this system as well and that's good for places like the University of Michigan that is very deeply into the research for the autonomous future from Ann Arbor I'm guy Gordon local four back to you
