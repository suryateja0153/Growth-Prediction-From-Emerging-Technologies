 calcium is a chemical element with symbol CA and atomic number 20 as an alkaline earth metal calcium is a reactive metal that forms a dark oxide nitride layer when exposed to air it's physical and chemical properties are most similar to its heavier homologs strontium and barium it is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal after iron and aluminium the most common calcium compound on earth is calcium carbonate found in limestone and the fossilized remnants of early sea life gypsum in hydrate fluorite and apatite are also sources of calcium the name derives from Latin calyx lime which was obtained from heating limestone some calcium compounds were known to the ancients though their chemistry was unknown until the 17th century pure calcium was isolated in 1808 via electrolysis of its oxide by Humphrey Davy who named the element calcium compounds are widely used in many industries in foods and pharmaceuticals for calcium supplementation in the paper industry as bleaches as components in cement and electrical insulators and in the manufacture of soaps on the other hand the metal in pure form has few applications due to its high reactivity still in small quantities it is often used as an alloying component in steelmaking and sometimes as a calcium lead alloy in making automotive batteries calcium is the most abundant metal in the fifth most abundant element in the human body has electrolytes calcium ions play a vital role in the physiological and biochemical processes of organisms and cells in signal transduction pathways where they act as a second messenger in neurotransmitter released from neurons in contraction of all muscle cell types as cofactors in many enzymes and in fertilization calcium ions outside cells are important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes as well as proper bone formation topic characteristics you topic classification calcium is a very ductile silvery metal sometimes described as pale yellow whose properties are very similar to the heavier elements in its group strontium barium and radium a calcium atom has 20 electrons arranged in the electron configuration are forced to like the other elements placed in Group two of the periodic table calcium has two valence electrons in the outermost S orbital which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a de positive ion with the stable electron configuration of a noble gas in this case argon hence calcium is almost always divalent in its compounds which are usually ionic hypothetical univalent salts of calcium would be stable with respect to their elements but not to disproportion a Shinto the de Valence salts in calcium metal because the enthalpy of formation of mx2 is much higher than those of the hypothetical M X this occurs because of the much greater lattice energy afforded by the more highly charged CA 2 plus cation compared to the hypothetical CA plus cation calcium strontium barium and radium are always considered to be alkaline earth metals the lighter beryllium and magnesium also in group 2 of the periodic table are often included as well nevertheless beryllium and magnesium are significantly different from the other members of the group in their physical and chemical behavior they behave more like aluminium and zinc respectively and have some of the weaker metallic character of the post transition metals which is why the traditional definition of the term alkaline earth metal excludes them this classification is mostly obsolete in english-language sources but is still used in other countries such as Japan as a result comparisons with strontium and barium are more germane to calcium chemistry than comparisons with magnesium topic physical calcium metal melts at 842 degrees Celsius and boils at 1400 94 degrees Celsius these values are higher than those for magnesium and strontium the neighboring group two metals it crystallizes in the face centered cubic arrangement like strontium above 450 degrees Celsius it changes to an anisotropic hexagonal close-packed arrangement like magnesium it's density of 1.5 5 grams per cc as the lowest in its group calcium is harder than lead but can be cut with a knife with effort while calcium is a poor conductor of electricity than copper or aluminium by volume it is a better conductor by mass than both due to its very low density while calcium is infeasible as a conductor for most terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with atmospheric oxygen its use as such in space has been considered topic chemical the chemistry of calcium is that of a typical heavy alkaline earth metal for example calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas it also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride when finely divided it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride in bulk calcium is less reactive it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air but below 30 percent relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature besides the simple oxide South the peroxide calcium oxide can be made by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen and there are some evidence for a yellow super oxide calcium peroxide calcium hydroxide calcium hydroxide is a strong base though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium barium or the alkali metals all for the holidays of calcium are known calcium carbonate calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate calcium sulfate are particularly abundant minerals like strontium and barium as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium in ytterbium calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark-blue solution due to the large size of the CA 2 plus ion high coordination numbers are common up to 24 in some inter metallic compounds such as CA Zn 13 calcium is readily complexed by oxygen chelate such as EDTA and polyphosphates which are useful in analytic chemistry and removing calcium ions from hard water in the absence of steric hindrance smaller group 2 cations tend to form stronger complexes but when large polydentate macro cycles are involved the trend is reversed although calcium is in the same group as magnesium and organo magnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry organic calcium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive although they have recently been investigated as possible catalysts organo calcium compounds tend to be more similar to organoid erbium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of YB 2 + 102 PM ca2 plus 100 p.m. most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures bulky ligands tend to favor stability for example calcium dye cyclopentadienyl CA c 5 h 5 2 must be made by directly reacting calcium metal with mercury seen or cyclopentadiene itself replacing the C 5 H 5 ligand with the bulkier C 5 CH 3 5 ligand on the other hand increases the compound solubility volatility and kinetic stability topic isotopes natural calcium is a mixture of five stable isotopes 40ca 42 CA 43 CA forty-four CA and 46 CA and one isotope with a half-life so long that it can be considered stable for all practical purposes 48 CA with a half-life of about four point three times 1019 years calcium is the first lightest element to have six naturally occurring isotopes by far the most common isotope of calcium in nature as for TCA which makes up 96.9 for one percent of all natural calcium it is produced in the silicon burning process from fusion of alpha particles and as the heaviest stable nuclide with equal proton and neutron numbers its occurrence is also supplemented slowly by the decay of primordial 40k adding another alpha particle would lead to unstable 4040 which quickly decays via two successive electron captures to stable 44 CA this makes up two point eight zero six percent of all natural calcium and as the second most common isotope the other for natural isotopes 42 CA 43 CA 46 CA and 48 CA are significantly rarer each comprising less than 1% of all natural calcium the four lighter isotopes are mainly products of the oxygen burning and silicon burning processes leaving the two heavier ones to be produced to be a neutron capturing processes 46 CA is mostly produced in a hot s process as its formation requires a rather high Neutron flux to allow short-lived 45 CA to capture a neutron 48 CA is produced by electron capture in the art process in type II supernova where high Neutron excess and low enough entropy ensures its survival 0.46 CA and 48 CA are the first classically stable nuclides with a 6 Neutron or 8 Neutron excess respectively although extremely Neutron rich for such a light element 48 CA is very stable because it is a doubly Magic nucleus having 20 protons and 28 neutrons arranged in closed shells its beta decay to 48 SC is very hindered because of the gross mismatch of nuclear spin thca has zero nuclear spin being even even while 48 SC has spent six plus so the decay is forbidden by the conservation of angular momentum while two excited states of 48 SC are available for decay as well they are also forbidden due to their high spins as a result when 48 CA does decay it does so by double beta decay to 48 T instead being the lightest nuclide known to undergo double beta decay the heavy isotope 46 CA can also theoretically undergo double beta decay to 46 T as well but this has never been observed the lightest and most common isotope for TCA is also doubly magic and could undergo double electron capture 240 R but this has likewise never been observed calcium is the only element to have two primordial doubly magic isotopes the experimental lower limits for the half-lives of four TCA and 46 CA are 5.9 times 1000 21 years in 2.8 times 1015 years respectively apart from the practically stable 48 CA the longest lived radioisotope of calcium as 41 CA it decays by electron captured to stable 41 k with a half-life of about a hundred thousand years its existence in the early solar system as an extinct radionuclide has been inferred from excesses of 41 K traces of 41 CA also still exists today as it is a cosmogenic nuclides until reformed through neutron activation of natural 40 CA many other calcium Radio isotopes are known ranging from 34 CA to 57 CA they're all much shorter lib than 41 CA the most stable among them being 45 CA half-life 163 days and 47 CA half-life 4.5 4 days the isotopes lighter than 42 CA usually undergo beta plus decay two isotopes of potassium and those heavier than 44 CA usually undergo beta minus decay two isotopes of scandium although near the nuclear drip lines proton emission and neutron emission begin to be significant decay modes as well like other elements a variety of processes alter the relative abundance of calcium the best studied of these processes is the mass dependent fractionation of calcium isotopes that accompanies the precipitation of calcium minerals such as calcium I tan apatite from solution lighter isotopes are preferentially incorporated into these minerals leaving the surrounding solution enriched in heavier isotopes at a magnitude of roughly 0.025 percent per atomic mass unit AMU at room temperature mass dependent differences in calcium isotope composition are conventionally expressed by the ratio of two isotopes usually 44 CA 40 CA in a sample compared to the same ratio in a standard reference material 44 CA 40 CA varies by about one percent among common earth materials topic history calcium compounds were known for millennia although their chemical makeup was not understood until the 17th century lime is a building material and his plaster for statues was used as far back as around 7,000 BC the first dated lime kiln dates back to 2500 BC and was found in kafaja Mesopotamia at about the same time dehydrated gypsum calcium sulfate - h2o was being used in the Great Pyramid of Giza this material would later be used for the plaster in the tomb of Tutankhamun the climate of present-day Italy being warmer than that of Egypt the ancient Romans instead used lime mortars made by heating limestone calcium carbonate the name calcium itself derives from the Latin word calyx lime Vitruvius noted that the lime that resulted was lighter than the original limestone attributing this to the boiling of the water in 1755 Joseph black proved that this was due to the loss of carbon dioxide which is a gas had not been recognized by the ancient Romans in 1787 Antoine Lavoisier suspected that lime might be an oxide of a fundamental chemical element in his table of the elements Lavoisier listed five Salafi Obul Earth's ie ores that could be made to react with acids to produce salts solace equals salt in Latin show calcium oxide magnesium acne Jie magnesium oxide Barry Tay barium sulphate al-amin alumina aluminium oxide and sillas silica silicon dioxide about these elements Lavoisier speculated we are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses are incapable hitherto a being reduced to a metallic state and consequently being only presented to our observation under the form of oxides are confounded with Earth's it is extremely probable that bar writes which we have just now arranged with Earth's is in this situation for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies it is even possible that all the substances we call Earth's maybe only metallic oxides irreducible by any hitherto known process calcium along with its congeners magnesium strontium and barium was first isolated by Humphrey Davy in 1808 following the work of jöns jakob berzelius and magnus martin af pondan on electrolysis davy isolated calcium and magnesium by putting a mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury to oxide on a platinum plate which was used as the anode the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury electrolysis then gave calcium mercury and magnesium mercury amalgams and distilling off the mercury gave the metal however pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later topic occurrence in production at 3% calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal behind aluminium and iron it is also the fourth most abundant element in the lunar Highlands sedimentary calcium carbonate deposits pervade the Earth's surface as fossilized remains of past marine life they occur in two forms the rhombohedral calcite more common and the orthorhombic aragonite forming in more temperate seas minerals of the first type include limestone dolomite marble chalk and Iceland star aragonite beds make up the Bahamas the Florida Keys and the red sea basins corals sea shells and pearls are mostly made up of calcium carbonate among the other important minerals of calcium are gypsum calcium sulfate 2 h2o in hydric calcium sulfate fluorite calcium fluoride and apatite calcium phosphate F the major producers of calcium are China about 10,000 to 12,000 tons per year Russia about 6,000 to 8,000 tonnes per year in the United States about 2,000 to 4,000 tons per year canada and france are also among the minor producers in 2005 about 24,000 tons of calcium were produced about half of the world's extracted calcium is used by the United States with about 80 percent of the output used each year in Russia and China Davies method of electrolysis is still used but as instead applied to molten calcium chloride since calcium is less reactive than strontium or barium the oxide nitride coating that results in air as stable and llave machining and other standard metallurgical techniques are suitable for calcium in the United States in Canada calcium is instead produced by reducing lime with aluminium at high temperatures topic geochemical cycling calcium provides a link between tectonics climate and the carbon cycle in the simplest terms uplift of mountains exposes calcium bearing rocks to chemical weathering and releases CA 2 plus into surface water these ions are transported to the ocean where they react with dissolved co2 to form limestone calcium carbonate which in turn settles to the seafloor where it is incorporated into new rocks dissolved co2 along with carbonate and bicarbonate ions are turned dissolved inorganic carbon DIC the actual reaction is more complicated and involves the bicarbonate ion h co -3 that forms when co2 reacts with water at sea water pH CA 2 + + 2 h co -3 calcium carbonate s + co2 + h2o 2 C water pH most of the co2 is immediately converted back into H Co - 3 the reaction results in a net transport of one molecule of co2 from the ocean atmosphere into the lithosphere the result is that each CA 2 plus ion released by chemical weathering ultimately removes one co2 molecule from the surficial system atmosphere ocean soils and living organisms storing it in carbonate rocks where it is likely to stay for hundreds of millions of years the weathering of calcium from rocks the scrubbed co2 from the ocean and atmosphere exerting a strong long-term effect on climate topic uses the largest use of calcium is in steelmaking due to its strong chemical affinity for oxygen and sulfur it's oxides and sulfides once formed give liquid lime illuminate and sulphide inclusions in steel which flowed out on treatment these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical improving cast ability cleanliness and general mechanical properties calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries in which the use of 0.1 percent calcium lead alloys instead of the usual antimony lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self discharging due to the risk of expansion and cracking aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys these lead calcium alloys are also used in casting replacing lead antimony alloys calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron and to remove bismuth impurities from lead calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins for example those in hair that block drains besides metallurgy the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen it is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium zirconium thorium and uranium it can also be used to store hydrogen gas as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride from which the hydrogen can easily be reacts tracted calcium isotope fractionation during mineral formation has led to several applications of calcium isotopes in particular the 1997 observation by schoolin and Apollo that calcium minerals are isotopically lighter than the solutions from which the minerals precipitate is the basis of analogous applications in medicine and in paleo oceanography in animals with skeletons mineralized with calcium the calcium isotopic composition of soft tissues reflects the relative rate of formation and dissolution of skeletal mineral in humans changes in the calcium isotopic composition of urine have been shown to be related to changes in bone mineral balance when the rate of bone formation exceeds the rate of bone resorption the 44 CA 40 CA ratio in soft tissue Rises and vice versa because of this relationship calcium isotopic measurements of urine or blood may be useful in the early detection of metabolic bone diseases like osteoporosis a similar system exists in seawater where 44 CA 40 CA tends to rise when the rate of removal of CA 2 plus by mineral precipitation exceeds the input of new calcium into the ocean in 1997 schoolin and de Paulo presented the first evidence of change in seawater 44 CA 40 CA over geologic time along with a theoretical explanation of these changes more recent papers have confirmed this observation demonstrating that seawater CA 2 plus concentration is not constant and that the ocean is never enough steady state with respect to calcium input and output this has important climatological implications as the marine calcium cycle is closely tied to the carbon cycle many calcium compounds are used in food as pharmaceuticals and in medicine among others for example calcium and phosphorus are supplemented in foods through the addition of calcium lactate calcium diphosphate and tri calcium phosphate the last is also used as a polishing agent in toothpaste and in antacids calcium lacto by 1/8 is a white powder that is used as a suspending agent for pharmaceuticals in baking calcium mono phosphate is used as a leavening agent calcium sulfite is used as a bleach in paper making and as a disinfectant calcium silicate is used as a reinforcing agent in rubber in calcium acetate as a component of liming rosin and is used to make metallic soaps and synthetic resins topic biological and pathological role calcium is an essential element needed in large quantities the CA 2 plus ion acts as an electrolyte and is vital to the health of the muscular circulatory and digestive systems is indispensable to the building of bone and supports synthesis and function of blood cells for example it regulates the contraction of muscles nerve conduction and the clotting of blood as a result intra and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body calcium can play this role because the CA 2 plus ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds especially proteins it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubilities enabling the formation of skeletons calcium ions may be complexed by proteins through binding the carboxyl groups of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues through interacting with phosphorylated serine tyrosine or threonine residues or by being chelated by gamma carboxylated amino acid residues trypsin a digestive enzyme uses the first method osteocalcin a bone matrix protein uses the third some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone CLO protein used both the first in the second direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common some other enzymes are activated by non covalent association with direct calcium binding enzymes calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface as an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water eighty-five percent of extracellular calcium as as dye calcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0 m and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix as tri calcium phosphate at 100 micro M about three-quarters of dietary calcium is from dairy products and grains the rest being accounted for by vegetables protein rich foods fruits sugar fats and oil calcium supplementation is controversial as the bioavailability of calcium is strongly dependent on the solubility of the salt involved calcium citrate malate and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so the intestine of orbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions they're allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content when plasma calcium levels fall cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney gut and bone cells with the bone forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonized by calcitonin whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcemia however because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone PTH or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin d both which facilitate calcium absorption it may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumors metastasize within bone all these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart blood vessels or kidneys symptoms include anorexia nausea vomiting memory loss confusion muscle weakness increased urination dehydration and metabolic bone disease chronic hypercalcemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and it's serious consequences for example calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis conversely inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcemia often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells symptoms include neuromuscular excitability which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue as calcium is heavily involved in bone manufacture many bone diseases can be traced to problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite and molecular structure or organization for example osteoporosis is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume and can be treated by supplementation of calcium vitamin D and by phosphates calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men in postmenopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease inadequate amounts of calcium vitamin D or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones known as osteomalacia topic safety you topic metallic calcium because calcium reacts exothermically with water and acids calcium metal coming into contact with bodily moisture results in severe corrosive irritation when swallowed calcium metal has the same effect on the mouth esophagus and stomach and can be fatal however long-term exposure is not known to have distinct adverse effects topic calcium in food because of concerns for long-term adverse side effects including calcification of arteries and kidney stones both the u.s. Institute of Medicine IOM and the European Food Safety Authority EFSA said tolerable upper intake levels you else for combined dietary and supplemental calcium from the IOM people of ages 9 to 18 years are not to exceed 3,000 milligrams per day combined intake for ages 19 to 50 not to exceed two thousand five hundred milligrams per day for ages 51 and older not to exceed two thousand milligrams per day the EFSA set the all for all adults at 2500 milligrams per day but decided the information for children and adolescents was not sufficient to determine you ELLs equals equals see also
