 a timeline of United States inventions after 1991 encompasses the ingenuity and innovative advancements of the United States within a historical context dating from the contemporary era to the present day which have been achieved by inventors who are either native born or naturalized citizens of the United States patent protection secures a person's right to his or her first-to-invent claim of the original invention in question highlighted in article 1 section 8 Clause 8 of the United States Constitution which gives the following enumerated power to the United States Congress in 1641 the first patent in North America was issued to Samuel Winslow by the General Court of Massachusetts for a new method of making salt on April 10 1790 President George Washington signed the Patent Act of 1791 stat 109 into law which proclaimed that patents were to be authorized for any useful art manufacture engine machine or device or any improvement therein not before known or used on July 31st 1790 Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford Vermont became the first person in the United States to file and to be granted a patent for an improved method of making pot and pearl ashes the Patent Act of 1836 ch 357 v stat 117 further clarified United States patent law to the extent of establishing a patent office where patent applications are filed processed and granted contingent upon the language and scope of the claimants invention for a patent term of 14 years with an extension of up to an additional seven years however the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994 ura a changed the patent term in the United States to a total of 20 years effective for patent applications filed on or after June 8 1995 thus bringing United States patent law further into conformity with international patent law the modern-day provisions of the law applied to inventions are laid out in title 35 of the United States Code Ch 950 SEC 166 stat 792 from 1836 to 2011 the United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO has grant a total of 7 million 860 1317 patents relating to several well-known inventions appearing throughout the timeline below topic contemporary era 1992 present topic post-cold-war in the mid to late 1990s 1992 to 1999 1992 spinner wheel a spinner is a type of hubcap that spins independently inside of the wheel itself when a vehicle is in motion and continues to spin once the vehicle has come to a stop as an attachment to the car's wheel the spinner operates by using one or more roller bearings to isolate the spinner from the wheel allowing it to turn while the wheel is at rest the

wire battery is a lithium ion battery consisting of a stainless steel anode covered in silicon nanowires silicon which stores ten times more lithium than graphite allows a far greater energy density on a steel anode thus reducing the mass of the battery the high surface area further allows for fast charging and discharging the practicality of nano wire batteries as reasoned that a laptop computer that runs on a regular lithium ion battery for two hours could potentially operate up to 20 hours using a nano wire battery without recharging which would be a considerable advantage for many people resulting in energy conservation and cost savings the nanowire battery was Co invented in 2007 by Chinese American doctor yi cui an assistant professor of materials science and engineering along with his colleagues at Stanford University point two zero zero eight Bionic contact lens a bionic contact lens as a digital contact lens worn directly on the human eye which in the future scientists
