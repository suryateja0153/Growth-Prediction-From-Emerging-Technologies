 We have oceans of water on earth but unfortunately less than one person of that water is drinkable. At the moment 700 million people have water scarcity problem, by 2050 our demand for fresh water is going to double. Desalination is one of the options to provide fresh water but it's very costly and the main cost is coming from energy intensity which accounts to around 50% of the produced desal water. Our research is around how to optimise desalination system to reduce the produced water cost to make it affordable for wide range of users. We are looking at designing a desalination system which during high electricity price can overproduce water and during expensive time, high demand electricity times, can reduce the production. We see the future in flexible manufacturing systems and with the same mentality we look at desalination system, how to design flexible desalination systems which follows renewable energy availability in order to reduce the production costs.
