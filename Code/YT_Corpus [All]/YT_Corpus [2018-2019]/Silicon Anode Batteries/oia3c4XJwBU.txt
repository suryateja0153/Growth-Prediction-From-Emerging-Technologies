 LED is a chemical element with symbol PB from the Latin plumbum and atomic number 82 it is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials LED is soft and malleable and also has a relatively low melting point when freshly cut LED is silvery with a hint of blue it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and three of its isotopes each conclude a major decay chain of heavier elements lead is a relatively unreactive post transition metal it's weak metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature lead and lead oxide react with acids and bases and it tends to form covalent bonds compounds of lead are usually found in the plus 2 oxidation state rather than the +4 State common with lighter members of the Carbon group exceptions are mostly limited to organelle lead compounds like the lighter members of the group lead tends to bond with itself it can form chains rings and polyhedral structures lead is easily extracted from its ores prehistoric people in Western Asia knew event Galena a principal or of lead often bears silver interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in ancient Rome LED production declined after the fall of Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution in 2014 the annual global production of lead was about 10 million tonnes over half of which was from recycling leads high density low melting point ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful these properties combined with its relative abundance and low cost resulted in its extensive use in construction plumbing batteries bullets and shot weights solders pewters fusible alloys white paints leaded gasoline and radiation shielding in the late 19th century leads toxicity was recognized and its use has since been phased out of many applications LED as a toxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones it acts as a neurotoxin damaging the nervous system and interfering with the function of biological enzymes it is particularly problematic in children even if blood levels are promptly normalized with treatment neural disorders such as brain damage and behavioral problems may result topic physical properties you topic atomic a lead atom has 82 electrons arranged in an electron configuration of Z for F 145 D 106 is 26 P to the sum of leads first and second ionization energies the total energy required to remove the two 6p electrons is close to that of ten leaves upper neighbor in the Carbon group this is unusual ionization energies generally fall going down a group as an elements outer electrons become more distant from the nucleus and more shielded by smaller orbitals the similarity of ionization energies is caused by the lanthanide contraction the decrease in element radii from lanthanum atomic number 57 to lutetium 71 and the relatively small radii of the elements from hafnium 72 onwards this is due to poor shielding of the nucleus by the lanthanide for F electrons the sum of the first four ionization energies of lead exceeds that of tin contrary to what periodic trends would predict relativistic effects which become significant in heavier atoms contribute to this behavior one such effect as the inert pair effect the 6s electrons of lead become reluctant to participate in bonding making the distance between nearest atoms in crystalline lead unusually long leads lighter Carbon group congeners form stable or metastable allotropes with the tetrahedrally coordinated and covalently bonded diamond cubic structure the energy levels of their outer s and P orbitals are close enough to allow mixing into four hybrid sp3 orbitals in led the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s and P orbitals and the gap cannot be overcome by the energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization rather than having a diamond cubic structure lead forms metallic bonds in which only the P electrons are delocalized and shared between the PB two plus ions lead consequently has a phase centered cubic structure like the similarly sized divalent metals calcium and strontium topic bulk pure LED has a bright silvery appearance with a hint of blue it tarnishes on contact with moist air and takes on a dull appearance the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions characteristic properties of lead include high-density malleability ductility and high resistance to corrosion due to passivation leads close-packed face centered cubic structure and high atomic weight result in a density of eleven point three four grams per CC which is greater than that of common metals such as iron seven point eight seven grams per cc copper eight point nine three grams per CC and zinc seven point one four grams per cc this density is the origin of the idiom to go over like a lead balloon some rare metals are denser tungsten and gold are both at nineteen point three grams per CC and osmium the densest metal known has a density of twenty-two point five nine grams per cc almost twice that of lead led is a very soft metal with a MAS hardness of 1.5 it can be scratched with a fingernail it is quite malleable and somewhat ductile the bulk modulus of lead a measure of its ease of compressibility is forty five point eight Giga Pascal's in comparison that of aluminium is seventy five point two giga pascals copper one hundred thirty seven point eight giga pascals and mild steel 162 169 giga pascals leads tensile strength at twelve to seventeen mega Pascal's is low that of aluminium is six times higher copper ten times and mild steel 15 times higher it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony the melting point of lead at 327 point five degrees Celsius 621 point five degrees Fahrenheit is very low compared to most metals its boiling point of one thousand seven hundred forty nine degrees Celsius three thousand one hundred eighty degrees Fahrenheit is the lowest among the carbon group elements the electrical resistivity of lead at twenty degrees Celsius as one hundred ninety two nanometers almost an order of magnitude higher than those of other industrial metals copper at fifteen point four three nano ohms M gold twenty point five one nomes M an aluminium at twenty four point one five nano ohms M led is a superconductor at temperatures lower than seven point one nine K this is the highest critical temperature of all type one superconductors in the third-highest of the elemental superconductors topic isotopes natural lead consists of four stable isotopes with mass numbers of 204 206 207 and 208 and traces of five short-lived Radio isotopes the high number of isotopes is consistent with leads atomic number being even lead has a magic number of protons 82 for which the nuclear shell model accurately predicts an especially stable nucleus lead 208 has 126 neutrons another magic number which may explain why lead 208 is extraordinarily stable with its high atomic number led as the heaviest element whose natural isotopes are regarded as stable lead 208 is the heaviest stable nucleus this distinction formerly fell to bismuth with an atomic number of 83 until it's only primordial isotope bismuth-209 was found in 2003 to decay very slowly the four stable isotopes of lead could theoretically undergo alpha decay two isotopes of Mercury with a release of energy but this has not been observed for any of them their predicted half-lives range from ten thirty five to ten thousand 189 years at least 10 25 times the current age of the universe three of the stable isotopes are found in three of the four major decay chains lead-206 led 207 and led 208 are the final decay products of uranium 238 uranium 235 and thorium 232 respectively these decay chains are called the uranium chain the actinium chain and the thorium chain their isotopic concentrations in a natural rock sample depends greatly on the presence of these three parent uranium and thorium isotopes for example the relative abundance of lead 208 can range from 52% in normal samples to 90% in thorium ores for this reason the standard atomic weight of lead is given to only one decimal place as time passes the ratio of lead-206 and lead 207 to lead 204 increases since the former to are supplemented by radioactive decay of heavier elements while the latter is not this allows for lead lead dating as uranium decays into lead the relative amounts changed this is the basis for uranium-lead dating led 207 exhibits nuclear magnetic resonance a property that has been used to study its compounds in solution and solid state including in human body apart from the stable isotopes which make up almost all lead that exists naturally there are trace quantities of a few radioactive isotopes one of them has lead 210 although it has a half-life of only twenty two point three years small quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long decay series that starts with uranium 238 which has been present for billions of years on earth led 211 - 212 and - 214 are present in the decay chains of uranium 235 thorium 232 and uranium 238 respectively so traces of all three of these lead isotopes are found naturally minute traces of lead 209 arise from the very rare cluster decay of radium 223 one of the daughter products of natural uranium 235 and the decay chain of neptunium 237 traces of which are produced by neutron capture in uranium ores lead-210 is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead 206 both isotopes are present in a single decay chain in total forty-three lead isotopes have been synthesized with mass numbers 178 to 220 lead 205 is the most stable radioisotope with a half-life of around 1.5 times 107 years the second most stable is lead 202 which has a half-life of about 53,000 years longer than any of the natural trace Radio isotopes topic chemistry bulk LED exposed to moist air forms a protective layer of varying composition led to carbonate as a common constituent the sulfate or chloride may also be present in urban or maritime settings this layer makes bulk led effectively chemically inert in the air finely powdered lead as with many metals is pyrophoric and burns with a bluish white flame fluorine reacts with lead at room temperature forming lead to fluoride the reaction with chlorine is similar but requires heating as the resulting chloride layer diminishes the reactivity of the elements molten lead reacts with the calcium to give lead to chalcogenides lead metal resists sulfuric and phosphoric acid but not hydrochloric or nitric acid the outcome depends on in solubility and subsequent passivation of the product salt organic acids such as acetic acid dissolve lead in the presence of oxygen concentrated alkalis will dissolve lead and form plum bites topic in organic compounds led shows two main oxidation states plus four and plus two the tetravalent state is common for the carbon group the divalent state is rare for carbon and silicon minor for germanium important but not prevailing 410 and is the more important of the two oxidation states for lead this is attributable to relativistic effects specifically the invert pair effect which manifests itself when there is a large difference in electronegativity between lead and oxide halide or nitride anions leading to a significant partial positive charge on LED the result is a stronger contraction of the lead 6s orbital than as the case for the six p orbital making it rather inert in ionic compounds the inert pair effect is less applicable to compounds in which lead forms covalent bonds with elements of similar electronegativity such as carbon in organo lead compounds in these the 6s and 6 P orbitals remain similarly sized and sp3 hybridization is still energetically favorable lead like carbon is predominantly tetravalent in such compounds there is a relatively large difference in the electronegativity of lead to at 1.87 and lead IV at 2.33 this difference marks the reversal in the trend of increasing stability of the plus 4 oxidation state going down the carbon group tin by comparison has values of 1.8 0 in the plus 2 oxidation state and 1.96 in the plus 4 state topic led to led to compounds are characteristic of the inorganic chemistry of lead even strong oxidizing agents like fluorine and chlorine react with lead to give only lead to fluoride and led to chloride lead to ions are usually colorless in solution and partially hydrolyzed to form lead 1 hydroxide plus and finally 4 plus in which the hydroxyl ions act as bridging ligands but are not reducing agents as 10 to Lyons our techniques for identifying the presence of the PB 2 plus ion in water generally rely on the precipitation of lead two chloride using dilute hydrochloric acid as the chloride salt is sparingly soluble in water in very dilute solutions the precipitation of lead to sulfide is achieved by bubbling hydrogen sulfide through the solution lead monoxide exists in two polymorphs litharge alpha PB o red and Massicotte beta PB o yellow the latter being stable only above around 488 degrees Celsius litharge is the most commonly used inorganic compound of lead there is no lead to hydroxide increasing the pH of solutions of lead to salts leads to hydrolysis and condensation lead commonly reacts with heavier calso jhin's lead sulfide as a semiconductor a photo conductor and an extremely sensitive infrared radiation detector the other two chalcogenides lead selenide and lead Telluride are likewise photo conducting they are unusual in that their color becomes lighter going down the group led to holidays are well characterized this includes the dye estate I'd and mixed halides such as PB f CL the relative in solubility of the latter forms a useful basis for the gravimetric determination of fluorine the difluoride was the first solid ionic Li conducting compound to be discovered in 1834 by Michael Faraday the other D holidays decompose on exposure to ultraviolet or visible light especially the died you died many led to sudha halides are known such as the cyanide cyanate and thiocyanate lead to forms an extensive variety of halide coordination complexes such as lead for chloride - - led six chloride four - in the n5 and - chain anion led - sulfate is insoluble in water like the sulfates of other heavy divalent cations led to nitrate and led to acetate are very soluble and this is exploited in the synthesis of other lead compounds topic lead IV few inorganic led IV compounds are known they are only formed in highly oxidizing solutions and do not normally exist under standard conditions lead to oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation it is described as leap2 IV oxide or structurally to PBO lead for oxide and is the best-known mixed valence lead compound lead dioxide as a strong oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas this is because the expected lead for chloride that would be produced as unstable and spontaneously decomposes to lead two chloride and cl2 analogously to lead monoxide lead dioxide is capable of forming plum bait and ions lead disulfide and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures lead tetrafluoride a yellow crystalline powder is stable but less so than the difluoride lead tetrachloride a yellow oil decomposes at room temperature led tetra bromide is less stable still and the existence of lead tetra died is questionable topic other oxidation states you some lead compounds exist in formal oxidation states other than plus 4 or plus 2 lead 3 may be obtained as an intermediate between lead two and lead IV in larger organization state is not stable as both the lead 3 ion and the larger complexes containing it are radicals the same applies for lead I which can be found in such radical species numerous mixed lead to IV oxides are known when lead 4 oxide is heated in air it becomes at 293 degrees Celsius at 351 degrees Celsius at 374 degrees Celsius and finally PB o at 605 degrees Celsius a further sesqui oxide led3 oxide can be obtained at high pressure along with several non stoichiometric phases many of them show defective fluorite structures in which some oxygen atoms are replaced by vacancies PBO can be considered as having such a structure with every alternate layer of oxygen atoms absent negative oxidation states can occur as simple phases as either free lead and ions as in batu pita bits with lead formerly being lead - IV or an oxygen sensitive ring shaped or polyhedral cluster ions such as the trigonal bipyramidal PB 52 - ion where two lead atoms are led - i and three are lead 0 in such anions each atom is at a polyhedral vertex and contributes two electrons to each covalent bond along an edge from their sp3 hybrid orbitals the other two being an external lone pair they may be made in liquid ammonia via the reduction of lead by sodium topic organo late LED conform multiplied bonded chains a property it shares with its lighter homologues in the carbon group its capacity to do so as much less because the Pb Pb bond energy is over three and a half times lower than that of the CC bond with itself lead can build metal metal bonds of an order up to three with carbon lead forms Organa lead compounds similar to but generally less stable than typical organic compounds due to the PBC bond being rather weak this makes the organometallic chemistry of lead far less wide-ranging than that of ten lead predominantly forms organo lead IV compounds even when starting with inorganic led to reactants very few organelle each two compounds are known the most well characterized exceptions are PB ch Sime 3 - 2 + PB a 2 5 C 5 H 5 - the lead analog of the simplest organic compound methane is plumb bein plumb bein may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and atomic hydrogen two simple derivatives tetramethyl eaten tetraethyllead are the best-known Organa lead compounds these compounds are relatively stable tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated or if exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light tetra phenyl decomposing at 270 degrees celsius with sodium metal lead readily forms an equimolar alloy that reacts with alkyl halides to form organometallic compounds such as tetra ethyl eat the oxidizing nature of many organic compounds is usefully exploited led tetra acetate as an important laboratory reagent for oxidation in organic synthesis and tetraethyllead was once produced in larger quantities than any other organometallic compound other organ elite compounds are less chemically stable for many organic compounds a lead analog does not exist topic origin and occurrence you topic in space leads per particle abundance in the solar system as 0.1 to 1 ppb parts per billion this figure is two and a half times higher than that of platinum eight times more than mercury and 17 times more than gold the amount of lead in the universe is slowly increasing as most heavier atoms all of which are unstable gradually decay to lead the abundance of lead in the solar system since its formation 4.5 billion years ago has increased by about 0.75 percent the solar system abundances table shows that lead despite its relatively high atomic number is more prevalent than most other elements with atomic numbers greater than 40 primordial led which comprises the isotopes lead 200 for lead 206 lead 207 and lead 208 was mostly created as a result of repetitive neutron capture processes occurring in stars the two main modes of capture are the s and r processes in the S process S is for slow captures are separated by years or decades allowing less stable nuclei to undergo beta decay a stable thallium 203 nucleus can capture a neutron and become thallium 204 this undergoes beta decay to give stable lead 204 on capturing another neutron it becomes LEED 205 which has a half-life of around 15 million years further captures result in lead 206 lead 207 and lead 208 on capturing another neutron lead 208 becomes lead 209 which quickly decays into bismuth-209 on capturing another neutron bismuth-209 becomes bismuth 210 and this beta decays to polonium 210 which alpha decays to lead 206 the cycle hence ends at lead 206 LED 207 led 208 and bismuth-209 in the art process RS for rapid captures happen faster than nuclei can decay this occurs in environments with a high Neutron density such as a supernova or the merger of two neutron stars the neutron flux involved may be on the order of 1022 neutrons square centimeter per second the art process does not form as much lead as the s process it tends to stop once neutron-rich nuclei reach 126 neutrons at this point the neutrons are arranged in complete shells in the atomic nucleus and it becomes harder to energetically accommodate more of them when the neutron flux subsides these nuclei beta decay into stable isotopes of osmium iridium and platinum topic on earth LED is classified as a Chalco file under the Goldschmidt classification meaning it is generally found combined with sulfur it rarely occurs in its native metallic form many lead minerals are relatively light and over the course of the Earth's history have remained in the crust instead of sinking deeper into the Earth's interior this accounts for leads relatively high crustal abundance of 14 ppm it is the thirty eighth most abundant element in the crust the main lead bearing mineral is Galena PBS which is mostly found with zinc ores most other lead minerals are related to Galena in some way Luanne's right s11 is a mixed sulfide derived from Galena angle site led to sulfate is a product of Galena oxidation and Saru site or white lead or led to carbonate is a decomposition product of Galena arsenic tin antimony silver gold copper and bismuth are common impurities in lead minerals world lead resources exceed two billion tonnes significant deposits are located in Australia China Ireland Mexico Peru Portugal Russia and the United States global reserves resources that are economically feasible to extract totalled 88 million tonnes in 2016 of which Australia had 35 million China 17 million and Russia 6.4 million typical background concentrations of lead do not exceed 0.1 micrograms per cubic metre in the atmosphere 100 milligrams per kilogram in soil and 5 micrograms per liter in freshwater and seawater topic etymology the modern English word lead is of Germanic origin it comes from the Middle English lead an old English lead with the macron above the e signifying that the vowel sound of that letter is long the old English word is derived from the hypothetical reconstructed proto-germanic asterisk lauda lead according to linguistic theory this word bore descendants in multiple Germanic languages of exactly the same meaning the origin of the proto-germanic asterisk Lauda has not agreed in the linguistic community one hypothesis suggests it is derived from proto-indo-european asterisk la udh lead capitalization of the vowel is equivalent to the macron another hypothesis suggests it is borrowed from protocol tech asterisk loud IO lead this word is related to the Latin plumbum which gave the element its chemical symbol PB the word asterisk loud IO is thought to be the origin of proto-germanic asterisk live--i which also means lead from which stem the german bleh the name of the chemical element is not related to the verb of the same spelling which is derived from proto-germanic asterisk Lady Jane to lead topic history you topic prehistory and early history metallic LED beads dating back to 7000 6500 BCE have been found in Asia Minor modern-day Turkey and may represent the first example of metal smelting at that time lead had few if any applications due to its softness and dull appearance the major reason for the spread of lead production was its association with silver which may be obtained by burning Galena a common lead mineral the ancient Egyptians were the first to use lead minerals in cosmetics an application that spread to ancient Greece and beyond the Egyptians may have used lead for sinkers in fishing nets glazes glasses enamels and for ornaments various civilizations of the Fertile Crescent used lead as a writing material as currency and as construction material lead was used in the ancient Chinese royal court as a stimulant as currency and as a contraceptive the Indus Valley Civilisation and the Mesoamericans used it for making amulets and the eastern and southern african peoples used lead in wire drying topic classical era because silver was extensively used as a decorative material in an exchange medium lead deposits came to be worked in Asia Minor since 3,000 BCE later lead deposits were developed in the Aegean in Lorien these three regions collectively dominated production of mine bleed until C 1200 BCE since 2,000 BCE the Phoenicians worked deposits in the Iberian Peninsula by 1600 BCE lead mining existed in Cyprus Greece and Sardinia Rome's territorial expansion in Europe and across the Mediterranean and its development of mining led to it becoming the greatest producer of lead during the Classical era with an estimated annual output peaking at 80,000 tonnes like their predecessors the Romans obtained lead mostly as a by-product of silver smelting lead mining occurred in Central Europe Britain the Balkans Greece Anatolia and hispania the latter accounting for 40% of world production led tablets were commonly used as a material for letters LED coffins cast in flats and forms with interchangeable motifs to suit the faith of the deceased were used in ancient Judea lead was used for making water pipes in the Roman Empire the Latin word for the metal plumbum is the origin of the English word plumbing its ease of working and resistance to corrosion ensured its widespread use in other applications including pharmaceuticals roofing currency and warfare writers of the time such as Cato the Elder columella and Pliny the Elder recommended LED or LED coated vessels for the preparation of sweeteners and preservatives added to wine and food the lead conferred an agreeable taste due to the formation of sugar of lead led to acetate whereas copper or bronze vessels could impart a bitter flavor through verdigris formation the Roman author Vitruvius reported the health dangers of lead and modern writers have suggested that lead poisoning played a major role in the decline of the Roman Empire other researchers have criticised such claims pointing out for instance that not all abdominal pain is caused by lead poisoning according to archaeological research Roman lead pipes increased lead levels in tap water but such an effect was unlikely to have been truly harmful when lead poisoning did occur victims were called saturnine dark and cynical after the ghoulish father of the gods Saturn by association lead was considered the father of all metals its status in Roman society was low as it was readily available in cheap topic confusion with tin and antimony during the Classical era and even up to the 17th century tin was often not distinguished from lead Romans called lead plumbum nigrum black LED and tint plumbum candidum bright LED the association of lead and tin can be seen in other languages the word ole ovo in czech translates to lead but in Russian the cognate Olav oo Laveau means tin to add to the confusion led bore a close relation to antimony both elements commonly occur as sulfides Galena and stibnite often together Pliny incorrectly wrote that stibnite would give lead on heating instead of antimony in countries such as Turkey and India the originally Persian name Surma came to refer to either antimony sulfide or lead sulfide and in some languages such as Russian gave its name to antimony topic Middle Ages and the Renaissance led mining in Western Europe declined after the fall of the Western Roman Empire with Arabian Iberia being the only region having a significant output the largest production of lead occurred in South and East Asia especially China and India where lead mining grew rapidly in Europe lead production began to increase in the 11th and 12th centuries when it was again used for roofing and piping starting in the 13th century lead was used to create stained glass in the European and Arabian traditions of alchemy led symbol in the European tradition was considered an impure base metal which by the separation purification and balancing of its constituent essences could be transformed to pure an incorruptible gold during the period lead was used increasingly for adulterating wine the use of such wine was forbidden for use in Christian rites by a papal bull in 1498 but it continued to be imbibed and resulted in mass poisonings up to the late 18th century lead was a key material in parts of the printing press which was invented around 1440 LED dust was commonly inhaled by print workers causing lead poisoning firearms were invented at around the same time and led despite being more expensive than iron became the chief material for making bullets it was less damaging to iron gun barrels had a higher density which allowed for better retention of velocity and its lower melting point made the production of bullets easier as they could be made using a wood fire led in the form of venetian ceruse was extensively used in cosmetics by Western European aristocracy as whitened faces were regarded as a sign of modesty this practice later expanded to white wigs and eyeliners and only faded out with the French Revolution in the late 18th century a similar fashion appeared in Japan in the 18th century with the emergence of the geishas a practice that continued long into the 20th century the white faces of women came to represent their feminine virtue as Japanese women with lead commonly used in the whitener in Africa led mining and smelting were known in the be nude trough and the lower Congo Basin where lead was used for with Europeans and as a currency by the 17th century well before the Scramble for Africa topic European Age of Discovery in the New World lead was produced soon after the arrival of European settlers the earliest recorded lead production by European settlers dates to 1621 in the English colony of Virginia fourteen years after its foundation in Australia the first mine opened by colonists on the continent was a lead mine in 1841 topic industrial revolution in the second half of the 18th century Britain and later continental Europe in the United States experienced the Industrial Revolution this was the first time during which lead production rates exceeded those of Rome Britain was the leading producer losing this status by the mid 19th century with the depletion of its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany Spain and the United States by 1900 the United States was the leader in global lead production and other non European nations Canada Mexico and Australia had begun significant production production outside Europe exceeded that within a great share of the demand for lead came from plumbing and painting led paints were in regular use at this time more working-class people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases escalated this led to research into the effects of lead in take lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal lead poisoning and gout were linked British physician Alfred Bering Garrett noted a third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters the effects of chronic ingestion of lead including mental disorders were also studied in the 19th century the first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning in factories were enacted during the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom topic modern era further evidence of the threat that lead posed to humans was discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries mechanisms of harm were better understood lead blindness was documented and the element was phased out of public use in the United States in Europe the United Kingdom introduced mandatory factory inspections in 1878 and appointed the first medical inspector of factories in 1898 as a result a 25 fold decrease in lead poisoning incidents from 1900 to 1944 was reported most European countries banned lead paint commonly used because of its opacity and water resistance for interiors by 1930 the last major human exposure to lead was the addition of tetraethyllead to gasoline as an anti-knock agent a practice that originated in the United States in 1921 it was phased out in the United States and the European Union by 2000 in the 1970s the United States and Western European countries introduced legislation to reduce lead air pollution the impact was significant while a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States in 1976 to 1980 showed that 77 point eight percent of the population had elevated blood lead levels in 1991 to 1994 a study by the same Institute showed the share of people with such high levels dropped to 2.2 percent the main product made of lead by the end of the 20th century was the lead acid battery which posed no direct threat to humans from 1960 to 1990 lett output in the Western bloc grew by about 31 percent the share of the world's lead production by the Eastern Bloc increased from 10% to 30% from 1950 to 1990 with the Soviet Union being the world's largest producer during the mid-1970s in the 1980s and China's starting major lead production in the late 20th century unlike the European communist countries China was largely unand us tree alized by the mid 20th century in 2004 China surpassed Australia as the largest producer of lead as was the case during European industrialization led has had a negative effect on health in China you topic production as of 2014 production of lead is increasing worldwide due to its use in lead acid batteries there are two major categories of production primary from mine doors and secondary from scrap in 2014 4.5 eight million metric tons came from primary production and 5.6 four million from secondary production the top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China Australia and the United States the top three producers of refined lead were China the United States and South Korea according to the international resource panels metal stocks in society report of 2010 the total amount of lead in use stockpiled discarded or dissipated into the environment on a global basis is 8 kilograms per capita much of this is in more developed countries 20 to 150 kilograms per capita rather than less developed ones 1 to 4 kilograms per capita the primary and secondary lead production processes are similar some primary production plants now supplement their operations with scrap lead and this trend is likely to increase in the future given adequate techniques led obtained via secondary processes is indistinguishable from lead obtained via primary processes scrap led from the building trade is usually fairly clean and as remelted without the need for smelting though refining is sometimes needed secondary lead production is therefore cheaper in terms of energy requirements than is primary production often by 50% or more topic primary mostly doors contain a low percentage of lead rich ores have a typical content of three to eight percent which must be concentrated for extraction during initial processing or is typically undergo crushing dense medium separation grinding froth flotation and drying the resulting concentrate which has a lead content of 30 to 80 percent by mass regularly 50 to 60 percent is then turned into impure lead metal there are two main ways of doing this a two-stage process involving roasting followed by blast furnace extraction carried out in separate vessels or a direct process in which the extraction of the concentrate occurs in a single vessel the latter has become the most common route though the former is still significant topic two stage process first the sulphide concentrate is roasted in air to oxidize the lead sulphide to PBS is plus 302 G to PB OS plus two s o to G as the original concentrate was not pure lead sulphide roasting yields not only the desired lead to oxide but a mixture of oxides sulfates and silicates of lead and of the other metals contained in the ore this impure lead oxide has reduced in a Coke fired blast furnace to the again impure metal to PB o s plus C's to P B's plus CO 2 G impurities are mostly arsenic antimony bismuth zinc copper silver and gold typically they are removed in a series of pyro metallurgical processes the melt is treated in a reverberatory furnace with air steam and sulfur which oxidizes the impurities except for silver gold and bismuth oxidized contaminants float to the top of the melt and are skimmed off metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the Parkes process in which zinc is added to lead zinc which is immiscible in lead dissolves the silver and gold the zinc solution can be separated from the lead and the silver and gold retrieved DaSilva lead is freed of bismuth by the Betterton Kroll process treating it with metallic calcium and magnesium the resulting bismuth dross can be skimmed off alternatively to the pyrometallurgical processes very pure lead can be obtained by processing smelted lead electrolytically using the BET's process anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead are placed in an electrolyte of lead flora silicon PBS if' 6 once electrical potential is applied impure led at the anode dissolves and plates unto the cathode leaving the majority of the impurities in solution this is a high-cost process and thus mostly reserved for refining bullion containing high percentages of impurities topic direct process in this process lead bullion and slag is obtained directly from lead concentrates the lead sulphide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized forming lead monoxide carbon as coke or coal gas is added to the molten charge along with flexing agents the lead monoxide is thereby reduced to metallic lad in the midst of a slag rich in lead monoxide if the input is rich in lead as much as 80 percent of the original lead can be obtained as bullion the remaining 20 percent forms a slag rich in lead monoxide for a low-grade feed all of the lead can be oxidized to a high lead slag metallic led is further obtained from the high lead 25 to 40% slags via submerged fuel combustion or injection reduction assisted by an electric furnace or a combination of both topic alternatives research on a cleaner less energy-intensive lead extraction process continues a major drawback is that either too much lead has lost his waste or the alternatives result in a high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal hydrometallurgical extraction in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into an electrolyte and pure led is deposited onto a cathode is a technique that may have potential but is not currently economical except in cases where electricity is very cheap topic secondary smelting which as an essential part of the primary production is often skipped during secondary production it is only performed when metallic LED has undergone significant oxidation the process is similar to that of primary production in either a blast furnace or a rotary furnace with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields blast furnaces produce hardly 10% antimony while reverberatory and rotary kiln furnaces produced semi-soft leave three to four percent antimony the assessment process is a more recent smelting method that may act as an extension to primary production battery paste from spent lead acid batteries containing lead sulfate and lead oxides has its sulphate removed by treating it with alkali and is then treated in a coal fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen which yields impure lead with antimony the most common impurity refining of secondary lead is similar to that of primary lead some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled in its potential contamination of the sources of lead for recycling lead acid batteries are the most important lead pipe sheet and cable sheathing are also significant topic applications contrary to popular belief pencil leads in wooden pencils have never been made from lead when the pencil originated as a rapt graphite writing tool the particular type of graphite used was named plumbago literally act for leader lead mock-up topic elemental form LEED medal has several useful mechanical properties including high density low melting point ductility and relative inertness many metals are superior to lead in some of these aspects but are generally less common and more difficult to extract from parent doors leads toxicity has led to its phasing out for some uses lead has been used for bullets since their invention in the Middle Ages it is inexpensive its low melting point means small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment and it is denser than other common metals which allows for better retention of velocity concerns have been raised that lead bullets used for hunting can damage the environment Leeds high density and resistance to corrosion have been exploited in a number of related applications it is used as ballast in sail boat keels its density allows it to take up a small volume and minimize water resistance thus counter balancing the healing effect of wind on the sails it is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the divers buoyancy in 1993 the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead because of its corrosion resistance led is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables lead has many uses in the construction industry lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material cladding flashing gutters and gutter joints and on roof parapets detailed lead mouldings are used as decorative motifs to fix lead sheet lead is still used in statues and sculptures including for armatures in the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars for environmental reasons this use is being phased out in favour of other materials LED is added to copper alloys such as brass and bronze to improve machine ability and for its lubricating qualities being practically insoluble in copper the lead form solid globules and imperfections throughout the alloy such as grain boundaries in low concentrations as well as acting as a lubricant the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloys worked thereby improving machinability copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings the lead provides lubrication and the copper provides the load-bearing port leads high-density atomic number inform ability formed the basis for use of lead as a barrier that absorbs sound vibration and radiation lead has no natural resonance frequencies as a result she led is used as a sound deadening layer in the walls floors and ceilings of sound studios organ pipes are often made from a lead alloy mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe lead as an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in x-ray rooms due to its denseness and high attenuation coefficient molten lead has been used as a coolant for lead cooled fast reactors the largest use of lead in the early 21st century is in lead acid batteries the reactions in the battery between lead lead dioxide and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage the lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans so there are fewer toxicity concerns super capacitors incorporating lead acid batteries have been installed in kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in Australia Japan and the United States in frequency regulation solar smoothing and shifting wind smoothing and other applications these batteries have lower energy density and charge discharge efficiency than lithium ion batteries but are significantly cheaper lead is used in high-voltage power cables as sheathing material to prevent water diffusion into insulation this use is decreasing as lead as being phased out its use in solder for electronics is also being phased out by some countries to reduce the amount of environmentally hazardous waste lead is one of three metals used in the ADI test for museum materials helping detect organic acids aldehydes and acidic gases topic compounds in addition to being the main application for lead metal lead acid batteries are also the main consumer of lead compounds the energy storage release reaction used in these devices involves lead sulfate and lead dioxide pb's plus lead for oxide s plus 2 h2 so4 AQ to lead to sulphate s plus 2 h2o L other applications of lead compounds are very specialized and often fading lead-based coloring agents are used in ceramic glazes and glass especially for red and yellow shades while lead paints are phased out in Europe and North America they remain in use in less developed countries such as China or India lead tetra acetate and lead dioxide are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry LED is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of electrical cords it can be used to treat candle wicks to ensure a longer more even burn because of its toxicity European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc lead glass is composed of 12 to 28 percent lead oxide changing its optical characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation lead based semiconductors such as lead Telluride and lead selenide are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors topic biological effects LED has no confirmed biological role its prevalence in the human body at an adult average of 120 milligrams is nevertheless exceeded only by zinc 2500 milligrams and I earned four thousand milligrams among the heavy metals lead salts are very efficiently absorbed by the body a small amount of lead 1% is stored in bones the rest is excreted in urine and feces within a few weeks of exposure only about a third of lead is excreted by a child continual exposure may result in the bio accumulation of lead topic toxicity you LED is a highly poisonous metal whether inhaled or swallowed affecting almost every organ and system in the human body at airborne levels of 100 milligrams per cubic metre it is immediately dangerous to life and health most ingested lead is absorbed into the bloodstream the primary cause of its toxicity is its predilection for interfering with the proper functioning of enzymes it does so by binding to the sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes or mimicking and displacing other metals which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions among the essential metals that lead interacts with our calcium iron and zinc high levels of calcium and iron tend to provide some protection from lead poisoning low levels caused increased susceptibility topic effects lead can cause severe damage to the brain and kidneys and ultimately death by mimicking calcium lead can cross the blood-brain barrier it degrades the myelin sheaths of neurons reduces their numbers interferes with neuro transmission routes and decreases neuronal growth in the human body lead inhibits poor fobel anagen synthase and Farish allottees preventing both poor fobel antigen formation and the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin dicks the final step in heme synthesis this causes ineffective heme synthesis and microcytic anemia symptoms of lead poisoning include nephropathy colic like abdominal pains and possibly weakness in the fingers wrists or ankles small blood pressure increases particularly in middle-aged and older people maybe a parent and can cause anemia several studies mostly cross-sectional found an association between increased lead exposure and decreased heart rate variability in pregnant women high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage chronic high level exposure has been shown to reduce fertility in males in a child's developing brain lead interferes with synapse formation in the cerebral cortex neurochemical development including that of neurotransmitters and the organization of ion channels early childhood exposure has been linked with an increased risk of sleep disturbances and excessive daytime drowsiness in later childhood high blood levels are associated with delayed puberty in girls the rise and fall in exposure to airborne lead from the combustion of tetraethyl lead in gasoline during the 20th century has been linked with historical increases and decreases in crime levels a hypothesis which is not universally accepted topic exposure sources LED exposure is a global issue since lead mining and smelting and battery manufacturing disposal recycling are common in many countries lead enters the body via inhalation ingestion or skin absorption almost all inhaled lead is absorbed into the body for ingestion the rate is 20 to 70 percent with children absorbing a higher percentage than adults poisoning typically results from ingestion of food or water contaminated with lead and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil dust or lead-based paint sea water products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes lead paint and residual emissions from leaded gasoline the use of lead for water pipes is problematic in areas with soft or acidic water hard water forms insoluble layers in the pipes whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes dissolved carbon dioxide in the carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead bicarbonate oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead to hydroxide drinking such water over time can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead the harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate ingestion of applied lead-based paint is the major source of exposure for children a direct source is chewing on old painted window sills alternatively as the applied dry paint deteriorates it peels is pulverized into dust and then enters the body through hand to mouth contact or contaminated food water or alcohol ingesting certain home remedies may result in exposure to lead or its compounds inhalation as the second major exposure pathway affecting smokers and especially workers in lead related occupations cigarette smoke contains among other toxic substances radioactive lead-210 skin exposure may be significant for people working with organic LED compounds the rate of skin absorption is lower for inorganic lead topic treatment treatment for lead poisoning normally involves the administration of dimercaprol and suck summer acute cases may require the use of dye sodium calcium edit 8 the calcium chelate and the disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA it has a greater affinity for lead than calcium with the result that lead chelate is formed by exchange and excreted in the urine leaving behind harmless calcium topic environmental effects the extraction production use and disposal of lead in its products have caused significant contamination of the Earth's soils and waters atmospheric emissions of lead were at their peak during the industrial revolution and the leaded gasoline period in the second half of the 20th century lead releases originate from natural sources ie concentration of the naturally occurring lead industrial production incineration and recycling and mobilization of previously buried lead elevated concentrations of lead persist in soils and sediments in post industrial and urban areas industrial emissions including those arising from coal burning continue in many parts of the world particularly in the developing countries lead can accumulate in soils especially those with a high organic content where it remains for hundreds to thousands of years environmental lead can compete with other metals found in a non plant surfaces potentially inhibiting photosynthesis and at high enough concentrations negatively affecting plant growth and survival contamination of soils and plants can allow lead to ascend the food chain affecting microorganisms and animals in animals led exhibits toxicity in many organs damaging the nervous renal reproductive hematopoiesis killer systems after ingestion inhalation or skin absorption fish uptake lead from both water and sediment bioaccumulation in the food chain poses a hazard to fish birds and sea mammals anthropogenic led includes lead from shot and sinkers these are among the most potent sources of lead contamination along with lead production sites lead was banned for shot and sinkers in the United States in 2017 although that ban was only effective for a month and a similar ban is being considered in the European Union analytical methods for the determination of lead in the environment include spectrophotometry x-ray fluorescence atomic spectroscopy and electrochemical methods a specific ion selective electrode has been developed based on the ionophore s s methylene by Zen and dye isobutyl de Theo carbamate an important biomarker assay for lead poisoning is Delta amino level Inuk acid levels in plasma serum and urine you topic restriction and remediation by the mid-1980s there was significant decline in the use of lead in industry in the United States environmental regulations reduced or eliminated the use of lead in non battery products including gasoline paints solders and water systems particulate control devices were installed in coal-fired power plants to capture lead emissions in 1992 US Congress required the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce the blood lead levels of the country's children led use was further curtailed by the European Union's 2003 restriction of hazardous substances directive a large drop in lead deposition occurred in the Netherlands after the 1993 national ban on use of lead shot for hunting and sport shooting from 230 tonnes in 1990 to forty seven point five tonnes in 1995 in the United States the permissible exposure limit for lead in the workplace comprising metallic lag in organic lead compounds and lead soaps was set at 50 micrograms per cubic meter over an eight-hour workday and the blood lead level limit at 5 micrograms per 100 grams of blood in 2012 lead may still be found in harmful quantities in stoneware vinyl such as that used for tubing and the insulation of electrical cords and Chinese brass old houses may still contain lead paint white lead paint has been withdrawn from sale in industrialized countries but specialized uses of other pigments such as yellow lead chromate remain stripping old paint by sanding produces dust which can be inhaled LED abatement programs have been mandated by some authorities in properties where young children live led waste depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the waste may be treated as household waste in order to facilitate lead abatement activities or potentially hazardous waste requiring specialized treatment or storage led is released to the wildlife in shooting places and a number of lead management practices such as stewardship of the environment and reduced public scrutiny have been developed to counter the lead contamination led migration can be enhanced in acidic soils to counter that it has advised soils be treated with lime to neutralize the soils and prevent leaching of lead research has been conducted on how to remove lead from bio systems by by logical means fishbones are being researched for their ability to buy or immediatly din contaminated soil the fungus Aspergillus versicolor is effective at removing lead ions several bacteria have been researched for their ability to remove lead from the environment including the sulfate reducing bacteria diesel fo vibe REO and diesel photo macula both of which are highly effective in aqueous solutions topic see also Thomas Midgley jr. discovered that the addition of tetraethyllead to gasoline prevented knocking in internal combustion engines equals equals notes
