  (Music Playing)  [Dr. Ngalula Mubenga]: "Whenever you have big battery banks, the cells are connected in series so you can picture the cells as glasses of water and the charge is the water within the cell. And some cells are  not balanced. So that means that the level of water is different in the glass. So you need an equalizer to put water in those cells that are not full. A bi-level  equalizer, this is the equalizer we developed here. It's the first type of  equalizer that equalizes the cells at 2 levels, 2 different voltage levels. As a  result of this arrangement, we have an equalizer that has very high performance, like an active equalizer but has a very low cost." . [Dr. Mubenga]: "I got very sick and the doctor told me I had to go under surgery. Unfortunately in Kikwit, it was a town  where there was no water, no electricity. So basically you needed to have your own  power generator if you wanted to have power. There was no fuel at the General Hospital, so they could not do the surgery on me. So for about 3 days, my life  depended on electricity, really. And I could have died any day and that's  when I decided that you know, in this 21st century, it's unacceptable for people to die because of the lack of electricity so if I made it, then I would work to find a solution so that people could have electricity in places like Kiwit. So  that's when I decided to become an electrical engineer."  (Music Playing)
