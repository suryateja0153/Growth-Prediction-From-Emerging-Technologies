 manganese is a chemical element with symbol Minnesota and atomic number 25 it is not found as a free element in nature it is often found in minerals in combination with iron manganese is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses particularly in stainless steels historically manganese is named for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of magnesia in Greece which also gave its name to magnesium in the iron ore magnetite by the mid 18th century Swedish German chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine she'll and others were aware that pyrolusite now known to be manganese dioxide contained a new element but they were unable to isolate it Johan Gottlieb began was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774 which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon manganese phosphating is used for rust and corrosion prevention on steel ionized manganese is used industrially as pigments of various colors which depend on the oxidation state of the ions the permanganate of alkali and alkaline earth metals are powerful oxidizers manganese dioxide is used as the cathode electron acceptor material in zinc carbon and alkaline batteries in biology manganese 2 ions function as cofactors for a large variety of enzymes with many functions manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen manganese also functions in the oxygen evolving complex of photosynthetic plants while the element as a required trace mineral for all known living organisms it also acts as a neurotoxin in larger amounts especially through inhalation it can cause Mangan ism a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible topic characteristics you topic physical properties manganese is a silvery gray metal that resembles iron it is hard and very brittle difficult to fuse but easy to oxidize manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic manganese tarnish is slowly in air and oxidizes rusts like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen topic isotopes naturally-occurring manganese is composed of one stable isotope 55 Minnesota 18 radioisotopes have been isolated and described ranging an atomic weight from 46 u46 Minnesota to 65 you 65 Minnesota the most stable are 53 Minnesota with a half-life of 3.7 million years 54 Minnesota with a half-life of three hundred twelve point three days and 52 Minnesota with a half-life of five point five nine one days all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than three hours and the majority of less than one minute the primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope 55 Minnesota is electron capture in the primary mode after as beta decay manganese also has three meta States manganese as part of the iron group of elements which are thought to be synthesized in large stars shortly before the supernova explosion 53 Minnesota decays to 53 CR with a half-life of 3.7 million years because of its relatively short half-life 53 Minnesota is relatively rare produced by cosmic rays impact on iron manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology and radiometric dating Minnesota CR isotopic ratios reinforced the evidence from 26 Allen 107 P D for the early history of the solar system variations in 53 CR 52 CR and Minnesota C are ratios from several meteorites suggest an initial 53 Minnesota 55 Minnesota ratio which indicates that Minnesota CR isotopic composition must result from in situ decay of 53 Minnesota in differentiated planetary bodies hence 53 Minnesota provides additional evidence for nucleosynthesis immediately before coalescence of the solar system topic chemical properties the most common oxidation states of manganese are plus two plus three plus four plus six and plus seven though all oxidation states from minus 3 to plus seven have been observed Minnesota 2 plus often competes with mg 2 plus in biological systems manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state plus 7 which are mostly restricted to the unstable oxide compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion manganese 8 oxide - and a few oxy halides manganese 6 oxide f and manganese 6 oxide CL are powerful oxidizing agents compounds with oxidation states plus 5 blue and plus 6 green are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to disproportion a ssin the most stable oxidation state for manganese as plus 2 which has a pale pink color and many manganese 2 compounds are known such as manganese 2 sulfate manganese 2 sulfate and manganese 2 chloride manganese 2 chloride this oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite manganese 2 carbonate manganese - most commonly exists with a high spin s topic five-halves ground state because of the high pairing energy for manganese too however there are a few examples of low spin s you 1/2 manganese - there are no spin allowed DD transitions in manganese - explaining why manganese - compounds are typically paled to colorless the +3 oxidation state is known in compounds like manganese 3 acetate but these are quite powerful oxidizing agents and also prone to disproportion a ssin in solution forming manganese 2 and manganese IV solid compounds of manganese 3 are characterized by its strong purple red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the jan teller effect the oxidation state +5 can be produced by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten sodium nitrite manganate V salts can be produced by dissolving Minnesota compounds such as manganese dioxide in molten alkali while exposed to air permanganate plus seven oxidation state compounds are purple and can give glass of violet color potassium permanganate sodium permanganate and barium permanganate are all potent oxidizers potassium permanganate also called con DS crystals is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties it is used as a topical medicine for example in the treatment of fish diseases solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives to be used in the preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy topic history the origin of the name manganese is complex in ancient times two black minerals from magnesia located within modern Greece were both called Magnus from their place of origin but were thought to differ in gender the male Magnus attracted iron and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or magnetite and which probably gave us the term magnet the female Magnus or did not attract iron but was used to decolorize glass this feminine Magnus was later called magnesia known now in modern times as pyrolusite or manganese dioxide neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic in the 16th century manganese dioxide was called manga nessam note that two ends instead of one by glassmakers possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words since alchemists and glass makers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia negra the black or from magnesia Alba a white or also from magnesia also useful in glass making michelle Mercanti called magnesia negra manga Nessa and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese german Mangan the name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia Alba magnesium oxide which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later several colorful oxides of manganese for example manganese dioxide are abundant in nature and have been used as pigments since the Stone Age the cave paintings in Gardez that are 30,000 to 24,000 years old contain manganese pigments manganese compounds were used by Egyptian and Roman glass makers either to add to or remove color from glass uses glass makers soap continued through the Middle Ages until modern times and is evident in 14th century glass from Venice because it was used in glass making manganese dioxide was available for experiments by alchemists the first chemists Ignatius Gottfried came 1770 in Johann Glauber 17th century discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to permanganate a useful laboratory reagent by the mid 18th century the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine first hydrochloric acid or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese dioxide later hydrochloric acid from the LeBlanc process was used in the manganese dioxide was recycled by the welding process the production of chlorine and hypochlorite bleaching agents was a large consumer of manganese ores sheíll and other chemists were aware that manganese dioxide contained a new element but they were not able to isolate it johann gottlieb began was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774 by reducing the dioxide with carbon the manganese content of some iron ores used in Greece led to speculations that steel produced from that ore contains additional manganese making the Spartan steel exceptionally hard around the beginning of the 19th century manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted in 1816 it was documented that iron alloyed with manganese was harder but not more brittle in 1837 British academic James Kuurne noted an association between miners heavy exposure to manganese with a form of Parkinson's disease in 1912 United States patents were granted for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion with manganese phosphate electrochemical conversion coatings and the process has seen widespread use ever since the invention of the leclanche a cell in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic D polariser increased the demand for manganese dioxide until the development of batteries with nickel cadmium and lithium most batteries contain manganese the zinc-carbon battery in the alkaline battery normally used industrially produced manganese dioxide because naturally-occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities in the 20th century manganese dioxide was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard zinc carbon and alkaline types topic occurrence and production manganese comprises about 1,000 ppm 0.1% of the Earth's crust the twelfth most abundant of the crusts elements soil contains seven - nine thousand ppm of manganese with an average of four hundred 40 ppm seawater has only 10 ppm manganese in the atmosphere contains 0.01 micrograms per cubic meter manganese occurs principally as pyrolusite manganese for oxide brah night Minnesota 2 + MN 3 + 6 silicon oxide sila melon ba h2o - and to a lesser extent as rhodochrosite manganese - carbonate the most important manganese ore is pyrolusite manganese 4 oxide other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial relation to the iron ores land-based resources are large but irregularly distributed about 80% of the known world manganese resources are in South Africa other important manganese deposits are in Ukraine Australia India China Gabon and Brazil according to 1978 estimate the ocean floor has 500 billion tonnes of manganese modules attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese modules were abandoned in the 1970s the CIA once used mining manganese modules on the ocean floor as a cover story for recovering a sunken Soviet submarine in South Africa most identified deposits are located near ho tassel in the northern cape province with a 2011 estimate of 15 billion tonnes in 2011 South Africa produced 3.4 million tonnes topping all other nations manganese is mainly mined in South Africa Australia China Gabon Brazil India Kazakhstan Ghana Ukraine and Malaysia u.s. import sources 1998 to 2001 manganese ore Gabon 70% South Africa 10% Australia 9% Mexico 5% and other 6% ferromanganese South Africa 47% France 22% Mexico 8% Australia 8% and other 15% manganese contained in all manganese impe South Africa 31% Gabon 21% Australia 13% Mexico 8% and other 27% for the production of ferromanganese the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace the resulting ferro manganese has a manganese content of 30 to 80 percent pure manganese used for the production of iron free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process a more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore in a heap leach this is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap the natural gas provides the heat needs to be at least 850 degrees Celsius and the reducing agent carbon monoxide this reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide M&O which is a leachable form the ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150 to 250 micrometers increasing the surface area to 8 leaching the ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron fade to plus in a 1.6 1 ratio the iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese this process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese for further purification the manganese can then be sent to an Electra winning facility in 1972 the cia's project Azorian through billionaire Howard Hughes commissioned the ship Hughes Glomar Explorer with the cover story of harvesting manganese nodules from the seafloor that triggered a rush of activity to collect manganese nodules which was not actually practical the real mission of Hughes Glomar Explorer was to raise a sunken Soviet submarine the k-129 with the goal of retrieving Soviet code books topic applications manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications in metallurgy in minor applications eg manganese phosphating zinc and sometimes vanadium are viable substitutes topic steal manganese is essential to iron and steel production by virtue of its sulfur fixing D oxidizing and alloying properties as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester machette 1811 to 1891 who in 1856 introduced the element in the form of Spiegel Eisen into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen sulfur and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability steelmaking including its iron making component has accounted for most manganese demand presently in the range of 85 percent to 90 percent of the total demand manganese is a key component of low-cost stainless steel often Ferro manganese usually about 80 percent manganese is the intermediate in modern processes small amounts of manganese improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high melting sulphide and preventing the formation of a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries if the manganese content reaches four percent the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature the embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8 percent steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high tensile strength of up to 863 mega Pascal's steel with 12% manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel mangle Oi it was used for British military steel helmets and later by the US military topic aluminium alloys the second-largest application for manganese is in aluminium alloys aluminium with roughly 1.5 percent manganese has increased resistance to corrosion through grains that absorb impurities which would lead to galvanic corrosion the corrosion resistant aluminium alloys 3000 4 and 3100 40.82 1.5% manganese are used for most beverage cans before 2000 more than 1.6 million tons of those alloys were used at 1 percent manganese this consumed 16 thousand tons of manganese topic other uses methyl cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl is used as an additive in unleaded gasoline to boost octane rating and reduce engine knocking the manganese in this unusual organometallic compound as in the plus 1 oxidation state manganese IV oxide manganese dioxide manganese 4 oxide is used as a reagent in organic chemistry for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols where the hydroxyl group is adjacent to an aromatic ring manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidize and neutralize the greenish tinge in glass from trace amounts of iron contamination manganese 4 oxide is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine and in drying black paints in some preparations it is a brown pigment for paint and as a constituent of natural umber manganese IV oxide was used in the original type of dry cell battery as an electron acceptor from zinc and as the blackish material in carbon zinc type flashlight sells the manganese dioxide is reduced to the manganese oxide hydroxide M&O o during discharging preventing the formation of hydrogen at the anode of the battery manganese 4 oxide plus h2o plus e minus m and o o plus o minus the same material also functions in newer alkaline batteries usually battery cells which used the same basic reaction but a different electrolyte mixture in 2002 more than 230,000 tons of manganese dioxide was used for this purpose the metal is occasionally used in coins until 2000 the only United States coin to use manganese was that wartime nickel from 1942 to 1945 an alloy of 75% copper and 25% nickel was traditionally used for the production of nickel coins however because of shortage of nickel metal during the war it was substituted by more available silver and manganese thus resulting in an alloy of 56 percent copper 35 percent silver and 9 percent manganese since 2000 dollar coins for example the Sacagawea dollar and the presidential $1 coins are made from a brass containing 7% of manganese with a pure copper core in both cases of nickel and dollar use of manganese in the coin was to duplicate the electromagnetic properties of a previous identically sized and valued coin in the mechanisms of vending machines in the case of the later US dollar coins the manganese alloy was intended to duplicate the properties of the copper nickel alloy used in the previous susan b anthony dollar manganese compounds have been used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass the brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds in the glass industry manganese compounds are used for two effects manganese 3 reacts with iron 2 to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less colored iron 3 and slightly pink manganese 2 compensating for the residual color of the iron 3 larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass tetravalent manganese is used as an activator in red emitting phosphorus while many compounds are known which show luminescence the majority is not used in commercial application due to low efficiency or deep red emission however several Minnesota fourplus activated fluorides were reported as potential red emitting foreshores for warm white LEDs but to this day only k2 silicon fluoride Minnesota fourplus is commercially available for use in warm white LEDs the manganese oxide is also used in Portland cement mixtures topic biological role manganese is an important element for human health essential for development metabolism and the antioxidant system nevertheless excessive exposure or intake may lead to a condition known as Mangan ism a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuron 'old death and symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease the classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors as large and includes oxidoreductases transferases hydrolases Liza's isomerases ligases lectins and integrins the reverse transcriptase is of many retroviruses though not land of irises such as HIV contain manganese the best-known manganese containing polypeptides may be arginase the diphtheria toxin in Minnesota containing superoxide dismutase Minnesota sod Minnesota sod as the type of sod present in eukaryotic mitochondria and also in most bacteria this fact is in keeping with the bacterial origin theory of mitochondria the Minnesota sod enzyme is probably one of the most ancient for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of superoxide Oh - - formed from the one electron reduction of dioxygen the exceptions which are all bacterial include lactobacillus plantarum and related lactobacilli which use a different non enzymatic mechanism with manganese Minnesota 2 plus ions complexed with polyphosphate suggesting a path of evolution for this function in aerobic life the human body contains about 12 milligrams of manganese mostly in the bones the soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys in the human brain the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes manganese is also important in photosynthetic oxygen evolution in chloroplasts in plants the oxygen-evolving complex ofc is a part of photosystem ii contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts it is responsible for the terminal photo oxidation of water during the light reactions of photosynthesis and has a metalloenzymes core containing four atoms of manganese to fulfill this requirement most broad-spectrum plant fertilizers contain manganese topic dietary recommendations the u.s. Institute of Medicine IOM updated estimated average requirements ears and recommended dietary allowances our das for minerals in 2001 for manganese there was not sufficient information to set years and RDA s so needs are described as estimates for adequate intakes a is as for safety the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels you else for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient in the case of manganese the adult all is set at 11 milligrams per day collectively the ears are da's a eyes and you ELLs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes dris manganese deficiency is rare the European Food Safety Authority EFSA refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference values with population Reference intake pri instead of RDA an average requirement instead of year AI and all defined the same as in United States for people ages 15 and older the AI is set at 3.0 milligrams per day a is for pregnancy and lactation is 3.0 milligrams per day for children ages 1 to 14 years the AI is increased with age from 0.5 to 2.0 milligrams per day the adult AIS are higher than the u.s. RDA s the EFSA reviewed the same safety question and decided that there was insufficient information to set alone for us food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value percent DV for manganese labeling purposes 100 percent of the daily value was 2.0 milligrams but as of May 27 2016 it was revised to 2.3 milligrams to bring it into agreement with the RDA a table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake food and supplement companies have until January 1st 2020 to comply with the change topic precautions manganese compounds are less toxic than those of other widespread metals such as nickel and copper however exposure to manganese dusts and fumes should not exceed the ceiling value of five milligrams per cubic meter even for short periods because of its toxicity level manganese poisoning has been linked to impaired motor skills and cognitive disorders the permanganate exhibits a higher toxicity than the manganese two compounds the fatal dose is about 10 grams and several fatal intoxications have occurred the strong oxidative effect leads to necrosis of the mucous membrane for example the esophagus is affected if the permanganate is swallowed only a limited amount is absorbed by the intestines but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver manganese exposure in United States is regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA people can be exposed to manganese in the workplace by breathing it in or swallowing it OSHA has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for manganese exposure in the workplaces 5 milligrams per cubic metre over an eight-hour workday the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a recommended exposure limit Rell of one milligram per cubic meter over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 3 milligrams per cubic meter at levels of 500 milligrams per cubic meter manganese is immediately dangerous to life and health generally exposure to ambient Minnesota air concentrations in excess of five micrograms Minnesota per cubic meter can lead to Minnesota induced symptoms increased ferroportin protein expression in human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells is associated with decreased intracellular Minnesota concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity characterized by the reversal of Minnesota reduced glutamate uptake and diminished lactate dehydrogenase leakage topic environmental health concerns you topic manganese in drinking water water-borne manganese has a greater bioavailability than dietary manganese according to results from a 2010 study higher levels of exposure to manganese in drinking water are associated with increased intellectual impairment and reduced intelligence quotients in school-aged children it is hypothesized that long-term exposure due to inhaling the naturally occurring manganese in shower water puts up to 8.7 million Americans at risk however data indicates that the human body can recover from certain adverse effects of overexposure to manganese if the exposure is stopped and the body can clear the excess topic manganese in gasoline methyl cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl mmt is a gasoline additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasoline to improve the octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates it reduces engine knock agent through the action of the carbonyl groups fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides which damage exhaust valves compared to 1953 levels of manganese in air have dropped many racing competitions specifically Bend manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minna bikes mmt contains twenty four point four to twenty five point two percent manganese elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density the level of manganese emitted by mmt fuels has been found to be safe for the general population and vulnerable groups such as infants in the elderly by the EPA and European and Canadian environmental agencies topic manganese in tobacco smoke the tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals such as manganese from the surrounding soil into its leaves these are subsequently inhaled during tobacco smoking while manganese is a constituent of tobacco smoke studies have largely concluded that concentrations are not hazardous for human health topic role in neurological disorders you topic Mangan ism manganese overexposure is most frequently associated with Mangan ism a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation historically persons employed in the production or processing of manganese alloys have been at risk for developing Mangan ism however current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations the disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Kerr who studied two patients who were manganese grinders Mangan ISM as a biphasic disorder in its early stages an intoxicated person may experience depression mood swings compulsive behaviors and psychosis early neurological symptoms give way to late stage Mangan ISM which resembles Parkinson's disease symptoms include weakness monotone and slowed speech an expressionless face tremor forward-leaning gait inability to walk backwards without falling rigidity and general problems with dexterity gait and balance unlike Parkinson's disease Mangan ism is not associated with loss of the sense of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with l-dopa symptoms of late-stage Mangan ism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels returned to normal chronic manganese exposure has been shown to produce a parkinsonism like illness characterized by movement abnormalities this condition is not responsive to typical therapies used in the treatment of PD suggesting an alternative pathway than the typical dopaminergic loss within the substantia manganese may accumulate in the basal ganglia leading to the abnormal movements a mutation of the SLC 3o a 100 gene a manganese efflux transporter necessary for decreasing intracellular Minnesota has been linked with the development of this parkinsonism like disease the Lewy bodies typical to PD are not seen in Minnesota induced parkinsonism animal experiments have given the opportunity to examine the consequences of manganese overexposure under controlled conditions in non-aggressive rats manganese induces mouse killing behavior topic childhood developmental disorders you several recent studies attempt to examine the effects of chronic low-dose manganese overexposure on child development the earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240 to 350 microgrammes Minnesota L although Minnesota concentrations at or below 300 micrograms Minnesota L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400 micrograms Minnesota L by the World Health Organization the ninety two children sampled between 11 and 13 years of age from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity short-term memory and visual identification compared to children from an uncontaminated area more recently a study of ten-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Minnesota concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores a third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of six and fifteen living in homes that received water from the well containing six hundred ten micrograms Minnesota L controls lived in homes that received water from a 160 micrograms Minnesota L well children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior the current maximum safe concentration under EPA rules is 50 micrograms Minnesota L topic neurodegenerative diseases a protein called DMT one as the major transporter in manganese absorption from the intestine and maybe the major transporter of manganese across the blood-brain barrier DMT one also transports inhaled manganese across the nasal epithelium the proposed mechanism for manganese
