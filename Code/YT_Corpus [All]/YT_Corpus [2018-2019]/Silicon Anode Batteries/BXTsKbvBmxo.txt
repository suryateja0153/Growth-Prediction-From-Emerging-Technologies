 The DriTek C blade is a proprietary coated, 100% carbon blade with a high temperature, thermoplastic resin resulting in the removal of stickies in the paper machine dryer section. Additionally, the machine direction stiffness and cross machine direction flexibility help to ensure it can conform to any roll surface. Since the base blade is 100% carbon, it minimizes sparking which can be evident with traditional metal blades in the dryer section.
