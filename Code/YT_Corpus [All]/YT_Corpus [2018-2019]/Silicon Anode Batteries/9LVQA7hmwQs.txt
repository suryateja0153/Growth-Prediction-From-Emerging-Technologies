 ozone or try oxygen is an inorganic molecule with the chemical formula o 3 it is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell it is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic allotrope o2 breaking down in the lower atmosphere to o2 or dye oxygen ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet light UV and electrical discharges within the Earth's atmosphere it is present in very low concentrations throughout the ladder with its highest concentration high in the ozone layer of the stratosphere which absorbs most of the sun's ultraviolet UV radiation ozone joder is reminiscent of chlorine and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as 0.1 ppm in air ozone o3 structure was determined in 1865 the molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be diamagnetic in standard conditions ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at progressively cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue liquid and finally a violet black solid Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen as such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures are fast warming to the boiling point it is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations ozone as a powerful oxidant far more so than dioxygen and has many industrial and consumer applications related to oxidation this same high oxidizing potential however causes ozone to damage mucus and respiratory tissues in animals and also tissues in plants above concentrations of about 0.1 ppm while this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level a higher concentration in the ozone layer from 2 to 8 ppm is beneficial preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface topic nomenclature the trivial name ozone is the most commonly used in preferred IUPAC name the systematic names - lambda for trioxide I mean and Catina try oxygen valid IUPAC names are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures respectively the name ozone derives from Ozan OHS in the greek verb for smell referring to Ozone's distinctive smell in appropriate contexts ozone can be viewed as trioxane with two hydrogen atoms removed and as such trioxide a melody may be used as a context specific systematic name according to substitute of nomenclature by default these names pay no regard to the radicality of the ozone molecule in even more specific context this can also name the non radical singlet ground state whereas the diradical state is named trioxide and yell try oxy Danielle or ozonide is used non systematically to refer to the substituent group who care should be taken to avoid confusing the name of the group for the context specific name for ozone given above topic history in 1785 the Dutch chemist Martinus van mahram was conducting experiments involving electrical sparking above water when he noticed an unusual smell which he attributed to the electrical reactions failing to realize that he had in fact created ozone a half-century later Christian Friedrich shown by noticed the same pungent odor and recognized it as the smell often following a bolt of lightning in 1839 he succeeded in isolating the gaseous chemical and named it ozone from the Greek word ozan ozon meaning to smell for this reason Sean Bean is generally credited with the discovery of ozone the formula for ozone o3 was not determined until 1865 by Jacques Lewis Soren and confirmed by shown by nin 1867 for much of the second half of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth Osen was considered a healthy component of the environment by natural ists and health seekers Beaumont California had as its official slogan Beaumont zone of ozone as evidenced on postcards and Chamber of Commerce letterhead natural ists working outdoors often considered the higher elevations beneficial because of their ozone content there is quite a different atmosphere at higher elevation with enough ozone to sustain the necessary energy to work wrote naturalist Henry Henshaw working in Hawaii seaside air was considered to be healthy because of its believed ozone content but the smell giving rise to this belief has in fact that of halogenated seaweed metabolites much of Ozone's appeal seems to have resulted from its fresh smell which evoked associations with purifying properties scientists however noted its harmful effects in 1873 James Dewar and John Gray Mackendrick documented that frogs grew sluggish birds gasped for breath and rabbit's blood showed decreased levels of oxygen after exposure to ozone eyes Dare which exercised a destructive action shown vine himself reported that chest pains irritation of the mucous membranes and difficulty breathing occurred as a result of inhaling ozone and small mammals died in 1911 Leonard Hill and Martin flack stated in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B that Ozone's healthful health by mere iteration become part and parcel of common belief and yet exact physiological evidence in favor of it's good effects has been hitherto almost entirely wanting the only thoroughly well ascertained knowledge concerning the physiological effect of ozone so far attained is that it causes irritation and edema of the lungs and death if inhaled in relatively strong concentration for any time during World War one ozone was tested at Queen Alexandra's military hospital in London as a possible disinfectant for wounds the gas was applied directly to wounds for as long as 15 minutes this resulted in damage to both bacterial cells in human tissue other sanitizing techniques such as irrigation with antiseptics were found preferable topic physical properties ozone is colorless or pale blue gas blue and liquefied slightly soluble in water and much more soluble in inert nonpolar solvents such as carbon tetrachloride or fluorocarbons in which it forms a blue solution at 161 K - 112 degrees Celsius - 170 degrees Fahrenheit it condenses to form a dark blue liquid it is dangerous to allow this liquid to warm to its boiling point because both concentrated gaseous ozone and liquid ozone can detonate at temperatures below 80 K minus one hundred ninety three point two degrees Celsius - three hundred fifteen point seven degrees Fahrenheit it forms a violet black solid most people can detect about 0.01 mew mole per mole of ozone in air where it has a very specific sharp odor somewhat resembling chlorine bleach exposure of 0.12 one new mole per mole produces headaches burning eyes and irritation to the respiratory passages even low concentrations of ozone in air are very destructive to organic materials such as latex plastics and animal lung tissue ozone is diamagnetic with all its electrons paired in contrast Oh - is paramagnetic containing two unpaired electrons topic structure according to experimental evidence from microwave spectroscopy ozone is a bent molecule with c2v symmetry similar to the water molecule the oo distances are 127 point 2 p-m 1.27 to the ooo angle is 116 point seven eight degrees the central atom is SP squared hybridized with one lone pair ozone is a polar molecule with a dipole moment of 0.5 3d the molecule can be represented as a resonance hybrid with two contributing structures each with a single bond on one side and double bond on the other the arrangement possesses an overall bond order of 1.5 for both sides it is isoelectronic with the nitrite anion topic reactions Ozona is among the most powerful oxidizing agents known far stronger than o2 it is also unstable at high concentrations decaying into ordinary oxygen its half-life varies with atmospheric conditions such as temperature humidity and air movement in a sealed chamber with a fan that moves the gas ozone has a half-life of approximately one day at room temperature some unverified claims assert that ozone can have a half-life of as short as 30 minutes under atmospheric conditions 203 302 this reaction proceeds more rapidly with increasing temperature deflagration of ozone can be triggered by a spark and can occur in ozone concentrations of 10 WT % or higher ozone can also be produced from oxygen at the anode of an electrochemical cell this reaction can create smaller quantities of ozone for research purposes oh three g plus 2h + + - e - o - G + h2o e degree

acid h2so4 o3 3 h2 so4 topic with alkenes and alkynes alkenes can be oxidatively cleaved by ozone in a process called ozonolysis giving alcohols aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids depending on the second step of the workup ozone can also cleave alkynes to form an acid anhydride or diketone product if the reaction is performed in the presence of water the anhydride hydrolyzes to give two carboxylic acids usually ozonolysis is carried out in a solution of dichloromethane at a temperature of minus 78 degrees Celsius after a sequence of cleavage and rearrangement an organic ozonide is formed with reductive workup eg zinc and acetic acid or dimethyl sulfide ketones and aldehydes will be formed with oxidative workup eg aqueous or alcoholic hydrogen peroxide carboxylic acids will be formed topic other substrates all three atoms of ozone may also react as in the reaction of tin to chloride with hydrochloric acid and ozone three tin two chloride plus 6 H CL + o3 3 tin 4 chloride

2 + co2 + 2 h2o topic spectroscopic properties ozone is a bent triatomic molecule with three vibrational modes the symmetric stretch 1,100 3.15 seven centimeters minus one Bend 700 1.42 centimeters minus one an anti-symmetric stretch 1042 point zero nine six centimeters minus one the symmetric stretch and Bend are weak absorbers but the anti-symmetric stretch is strong and responsible for ozone being an important minor greenhouse gas this IR band is also used to detect ambient and atmospheric ozone although UV based measurements are more common the electronic spectrum of ozone is quite complex an overview can be seen at the MPI Mines UV this spectral atlas of gaseous molecules of atmospheric interest all of the bands are dissociative meaning that the molecule falls apart 2o + o2 after absorbing a photon the most important absorption is the Hartley band extending from slightly above 300 nanometers down to slightly above 200 nanometers it is this band that is responsible for absorbing UVC in the stratosphere on the high wavelength side the Hartley band transitions to the so called Huggins band which falls off rapidly until disappearing by approximately 360 nanometers above 400 nanometers extending well out into the NIR are the champion and wolf bands their unstructured absorption bands are useful for detecting high ambient concentrations of ozone but are so weak that they do not have much practical effect there are additional absorption bands in the far UV which increased slowly from 200 nanometers down to reaching a maximum at approximately 120 nanometers topic ozone in Earth's atmosphere the standard way to express total ozone levels the amount of ozone in a given vertical column in the atmosphere as by using Dobson units point measurements are reported as mole fractions in NM o l per mole parts per billion ppb or as concentrations in microgram per cubic meter the study of ozone concentration in the atmosphere started in the 1920s topic ozone layer topic location and production the highest levels of ozone in the atmosphere are in the stratosphere in a region also known as the ozone layer between about 10 kilometers and 50 kilometers above the surface or between about 6 and 31 miles however even in this layer the ozone concentrations are only 2 to 8 parts per million so most of the oxygen there is die oxygen o2 at about 200 10,000 parts per million by volume ozone in the stratosphere is mostly produced from shortwave ultraviolet rays between 240 and 160 nanometers oxygen starts to absorb weekly at 240 nanometers in the Herzberg bands but most of the oxygen is dissociated by absorption in the strong Schumann runge bands between 200 and 160 nanometers where ozone does not absorb while shorter wavelength light extending to even the x-ray limit is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen there is relatively little of it and the strong solar emission at lyman-alpha 121 nanometers falls at a point where molecular oxygen absorption as a minimum the process of ozone creation and destruction is called the Chapman cycle and starts with the photolysis of molecular oxygen o2 plus photon radiation lambda o plus o2 plus M O 3 plus M where m denotes the third body that carries off the excess energy of the reaction the ozone molecule can then absorb a UVC photon and dissociate o3o plus o2 plus kinetic energy the excess kinetic energy heats the stratosphere when the O atoms and the molecular oxygen fly apart and collide with other molecules this conversion of UV light into kinetic energy warms the stratosphere the oxygen atoms produced in the photolysis of ozone then react back with other oxygen molecule is in the previous step to form more ozone in the clear atmosphere with only nitrogen and oxygen ozone can react with the atomic oxygen to form two molecules of o2 o3 plus O 2 o2 an estimate of the rate of this termination step 2 the cycling of atomic oxygen back to ozone can be found simply by taking the ratios of the concentration of o2 2 o3 the termination reaction is catalyzed by the presence of certain free radicals of which the most important or hydroxyl Oh nitric oxide no an atomic chlorine CL and bromine bridge in the second half of the 20th century the amount of ozone in the stratosphere was discovered to be declining mostly because of increasing concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons CFCs and similar chlorinated and brominated organic molecules the concern over the health effects of the decline led to the 1987 Montreal Protocol the ban on the production of many ozone-depleting chemicals and in the first and second decade of the 21st century the beginning of the recovery of stratospheric ozone concentrations topic importance to surface-dwelling life on earth ozone in the ozone layer filters out sunlight wavelengths from about 200 nanometers UV rays to 315 nanometers with ozone peak absorption at about 250 nanometers this ozone UV absorption is important to life since it extends the absorption of UV by ordinary oxygen and nitrogen in air which absorb all wavelengths the ozone layer has little effect on the longer UV wavelengths called UVA 315 to 400 nanometers but this radiation does not cause sunburn or direct DNA damage and while it probably does cause long-term skin damage in certain humans it is not as dangerous to plants into the health of surface-dwelling organisms on earth in general see ultraviolet for more information on near ultraviolet topic low level ozone low level ozone or tropospheric ozone is an atmospheric pollutant it is not emitted directly by car engines or by industrial operations but formed by the reaction of sunlight on air containing hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides that react to form ozone directly at the source of the pollution or many kilometers downwind ozone reacts directly with some hydrocarbons such as aldehydes and thus begins their removal from the air but the products are themselves key components of smog ozone photolysis by UV light leads to production of the hydroxyl radical ho and this plays a part in the removal of hydrocarbons from the air but is also the first step in the creation of components of smog such as paraxial nitrates which can be powerful eye irritants the atmospheric lifetime of tropospheric ozone is about 22 days its main removal mechanisms are being deposited to the ground the above-mentioned reaction giving ho and bi reactions with oh and the peroxy radical ho2 there is evidence of significant reduction in agricultural yields because of increased ground-level ozone and pollution which interferes with photosynthesis and stunts overall growth of some plant species the United States Environmental Protection Agency is proposing a secondary regulation to reduce crop damage in addition to the primary regulation designed for the protection of human health certain examples of cities with elevated ozone readings are Houston Texas in Mexico City Mexico Houston has a reading of around 41 and mo L per mole while Mexico City is far more hazardous with a reading of about 125 and mo L per mole topic ozone cracking ozone gas attacks any polymer possessing olefin each or double bonds within its chain structure such as natural rubber nitrile rubber and styrene butadiene rubber products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time the rate of crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere such materials can be protected by adding anti ozone ins such as waxes which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long-term protection ozone cracking used to be a serious problem in car tires for example but it is not an issue with modern tires on the other hand many critical products like gaskets and o-rings may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack especially within the engine compartment where some ozone is produced by electrical components storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking the commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone topic ozone as a greenhouse gas although ozone was present at ground level before the Industrial Revolution peak concentrations are now far higher than the pre-industrial levels and even background concentrations well away from sources of pollution are substantially higher ozone acts as a greenhouse gas absorbing some of the infrared energy emitted by the earth quantifying the greenhouse gas potency of ozone is difficult because it is not present in uniform concentrations across the globe however the most widely accepted scientific assessments relating to climate change eg the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change third assessment report suggests that the radiative forcing of tropospheric ozone is about 25 percent that of carbon dioxide the annual global warming potential of tropospheric ozone is between 918 to 1022 tons carbon dioxide equivalent tonnes tropospheric ozone this means on a per molecule basis ozone in the troposphere has a radiative forcing effect roughly 1,000 times as strong as carbon dioxide however tropospheric ozone as a short-lived greenhouse gas which decays in the atmosphere much more quickly than carbon dioxide this means that over a 20-year span the global warming potential of tropospheric ozone is much less roughly 60 to 269 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent tonne tropospheric ozone because of its short-lived nature tropospheric ozone does not have strong global effects but has very strong radiative forcing effects on regional scales in fact there are regions of the world where tropospheric ozone has a radiative forcing up to 150% of carbon dioxide topic health effects you topic ozone air pollution ozone precursors are a group of pollutants predominantly those emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels ground-level ozone pollution tropospheric ozone is created near the Earth's surface by the action of daylight UV rays on these precursors the ozone at ground level is primarily from fossil fuel precursors but methane is a natural precursor and the very low natural background level of ozone at ground level is considered safe this section examines the health impacts of fossil fuel-burning which raises ground-level ozone far above background levels there is a great deal of evidence to show that ground-level ozone can harm lung function and irritate the respiratory system exposure to ozone and the pollutants that produce it is linked to premature death asthma bronchitis heart attack and other cardiopulmonary problems long-term exposure to ozone has been shown to increase risk of death from respiratory illness a study of 450,000 people living in United States cities saw a significant correlation between ozone levels and respiratory illness over the 18-year follow-up period the study revealed that people living in cities with high ozone levels such as Houston or Los Angeles had an over 30% increased risk of dying from lung disease air quality guidelines such as those from the World Health Organization the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the European Union are based on detailed studies designed to identify the levels that can cause measurable ill health effects according to scientists with the US EPA susceptible people can be adversely affected by ozone levels as low as 40 and mo L per mole in the EU the current target value for ozone concentrations as 120 micrograms per cubic meter which is about 60 and mo l per mole this target applies to all member states in accordance with directive 2008 50th CC ozone concentration is measured as a maximum daily mean of 8-hour averages and the target should not be exceeded on more than 25 calendar days per year starting from January 2010 whilst the directive requires in the future a strict compliance with 120 micrograms per cubic meter limit ie mean ozone concentration not to be a seated on any day of the year there is no date set for this requirement and this is treated as a long-term objective in the USA the Clean Air Act directs the EPA to set national ambient air quality standards for several pollutants including ground-level ozone and counties out of compliance with these standards are required to take steps to reduce their levels in May 2008 under a court order the EPA lowered its ozone standard from 80 and mo l per mol to 75 and mo L per mol the move proved controversial since the agency's own scientists and Advisory Board had recommended lowering the standard to 60 and mo L per mol many public health and environmental groups also supported the 60 and mo L per mol standard and the World Health Organization recommends 51 and mo L per mol on January 7 2010 the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA announced proposed revisions to the National ambient air quality standard NAAQS for the pollutant ozone the principle component of smog EPA proposes that the level of the eight-hour primary standard which was set at 0.075 meu mole per mole in the 2008 final rule should instead be set at a lower level within the range of zero point zero six zero two zero oh seven o meu mole per mole to provide increased protection for children and other at-risk populations against an array of oh three related adverse health effects that range from decreased lung function and increased respiratory symptoms to serious indicators of respiratory morbidity including emergency department visits and hospital admissions for respiratory causes and possibly cardiovascular related morbidity as well as total non accidental and cardiopulmonary mortality on October 26 2015 the EPA published a final rule with an effective date of December 28 2015 that revised the eight our primary NAAQS from 0.075 ppm to zero point zero seven zero ppm the epa has developed an air quality index AQI to help explain air pollution levels to the general public under the current standards eight-hour average ozone mole fractions of 85 to 104 and mo L per mole are described as unhealthy for sensitive groups 105 NM o L per mole to 124 and mo L per mole s unhealthy and 125 NM o L per mole to 404 and mo L per mole s very unhealthy ozone can also be present in indoor air pollution partly as a result of electronic equipment such as photo copiers a connection has also been known to exist between the increased pollen fungal spores and ozone caused by thunderstorms and hospital admissions of asthma sufferers in the Victorian era one British folk myth held that the smell of the sea was caused by ozone in fact the characteristic smell of the sea is caused by dimethyl sulfide a chemical generated by phytoplankton Victorian British folk considered the resulting smell bracing topic heatwaves ozone production rises during heat waves because plants absorb less ozone it is estimated that curtailed ozone absorption by plants was responsible for the loss of 460 lives in the UK in the hot summer of 2006 a similar investigation to assess the joint effects of ozone and heat during the European heat waves in 2003 concluded that these appear to be additive topic physiology ozone along with reactive forms of oxygen such as superoxide singlet oxygen hydrogen peroxide and hypo chloride ions is produced by white blood cells and other biological systems such as the roots of marigolds as a means of destroying foreign bodies ozone reacts directly with organic double bonds also when ozone breaks down to dioxygen it gives rise to oxygen free radicals which are highly reactive and capable of damaging many organic molecules moreover it is believed that the powerful oxidizing properties of ozone may be a contributing factor of inflammation the cause and effect relationship of how the ozone is created in the body and what it does is still under consideration and still subject to various interpretations since other body chemical processes can trigger some of the same reactions a team headed by Paul Wentworth jr. of the department of chemistry at the Scripps Research Institute has shown evidence linking the antibody catalyzed water oxidation pathway of the human immune response to the production of ozone in this system ozone is produced by antibody catalyzed production of trioxane from water and neutrophil produced singlet oxygen when inhaled ozone reacts with compounds lining the lungs to form specific cholesterol derived metabolites that are thought to facilitate the build-up and pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaques a form of heart disease these metabolites have been confirmed as naturally occurring in human atherosclerotic arteries and are categorized into a class of psycho sterols termed a thorough NAL's generated by ozonolysis of cholesterol double bond to form a 5 6 accost role as well as a secondary condensation product via authorization ozone has been implicated to have an adverse effect on plant growth ozone reduced total chlorophyll z' carotenoid and carbohydrate concentration and increased 1 a.m. i and o cy clo PR opa and e1 carboxylic acid acc content and ethylene production in treated plants the ascorbate leaf pool was decreased while lipid peroxidation and solute leakage were significantly higher than in ozone free controls the data indicated that ozone triggered protective mechanisms against oxidative stress and citrus you topic safety regulations because of the strongly oxidizing properties of ozone ozone as a primary irritant affecting especially the eyes and respiratory systems and can be hazardous at even low concentrations the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health reports that even very low concentrations of ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract in the lungs the severity of injury depends on both by the concentration of ozone and the duration of exposure severe and permanent lung injury or death could result from even a very short-term exposure to relatively low concentrations to protect workers potentially exposed to ozone u.s. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a permissible exposure limit pel of 0.1 mu mole per mole 29 CFR 1900 10.1000 table z1 calculated as an 8-hour time-weighted average higher concentrations are especially hazardous and NIOSH has established an immediately dangerous to life and health limit idlh of 5 mu mole per mole work environments where ozone is used or where it is likely to be produced should have adequate ventilation and it is prudent to have a monitor for ozone that will alarm if the concentration exceeds the OSHA pel continuous monitors for ozone are available from several suppliers elevated ozone exposure can occur on passenger aircraft with levels depending on altitude and atmospheric turbulence United States Federal Aviation Authority regulations set a limit of 250 and mo L per mole with a maximum four hour average of 100 and mo L per mol some planes are equipped with ozone converters in the ventilation system to reduce passenger exposure topic production ozone generators are used to produce ozone for cleaning air or removing smoke odors in unoccupied rooms these ozone generators can produce over three grams of ozone per hour ozone often forms in nature under conditions where owed to will not react ozone used in industry is measured in mew mole per mole ppm parts per million and mo l per mole ppb parts per billion microgram per cubic meter milligram per hour milligrams per hour or weight percent the regime of applied concentrations ranges from 1% to 5% in air and from 6% to 14% in oxygen for older generation methods new electrolytic methods can achieve up 20% to 30% dissolved ozone concentrations in output water temperature and humidity play a large role in how much ozone is being produced using traditional generation methods such as Corona discharge in ultraviolet light old generation methods will produce less than 50 percent of nominal capacity if operated with humid ambient air as opposed to very dry air new generators using electrolytic methods can achieve higher purity and dissolution through using water molecules as the source of ozone production topic Corona discharge method this is the most common type of ozone generator for most industrial and personal uses while variations of the hot spark coronal discharge method of ozone production exist including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators these units usually work by means of a Corona discharge tube they are typically cost-effective and do not require an oxygen source other than the ambient air to produce ozone concentrations of three to six percent fluctuations in ambient air due to weather or other environmental conditions caused variability in ozone production however they also produce nitrogen oxides as a by-product use of an air dryer can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapour and increase ozone production use of an oxygen concentrator can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor but also the bulk of the nitrogen topic ultraviolet light UV ozone generators or vacuum ultraviolet vuv ozone generators employ a light source that generates a narrowband ultraviolet light a subset of that produced by the Sun the sun's UV sustains the ozone layer in the stratosphere of earth UV ozone generators use ambient air for ozone production no air prep systems are used air dryer or oxygen concentrator therefore these generators tend to be less expensive however UV ozone generators usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5 percent or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air oxygen to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated this makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams in duct air sterilization for example production of ozone is one of the potential dangers of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation vuv ozone generators are used in swimming pool and spa applications ranging to millions of gallons of water vuv ozone generators unlike Corona discharge generators do not produce harmful nitrogen byproducts and also unlike corona discharge systems vuv ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments there is also not normally a need for expensive off gas mechanisms and no need for air dryers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance topic cold plasma in the cold plasma method pure oxygen gas is exposed to a plasma created by dielectric barrier discharge the diatomic oxygen has split into single atoms which then recombine in triplets to form ozone cold plasma machines utilized pure oxygen as the input source and produce a maximum concentration of about five percent ozone they produce far greater quantities of ozone in a given space of time compared to ultraviolet production however because cold plasma ozone generators are very expensive they are found less frequently than the previous two types the discharges manifest as filamentary transfer of electrons micro discharges in a gap between two electrodes in order to evenly distribute the micro discharges a dielectric insulator must be used to separate the metallic electrodes and to prevent arcing some cold plasma units also have the capability of producing short-lived allotropes of oxygen which include oh four oh five oh six oh seven etc these species are even more reactive than ordinary o3 topic electrolytic electrolytic ozone generation EOG splits water molecules into h2 o2 and o3 in most Yoji methods the hydrogen gas will be removed to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products therefore Yoji can achieve higher dissolution in water without other competing gases found in Corona discharge method such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air this method of generation can achieve concentrations of twenty to thirty percent and as independent of air quality because water is used as the source material production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable because of the high over potential required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen this is why ozone does not produced during typical water electrolysis however it is possible to increase the over potential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis catalysts typically chosen for this approach are lead dioxide or boron doped diamond Topic special considerations ozone cannot be stored and transported like other industrial gases because it quickly decays into diatomic oxygen and must therefore be produced on site available ozone generators vary in the arrangement and design of the high-voltage electrodes at production capacities higher than 20 kilograms per hour a gas water tube heat exchanger may be utilized as ground electrode and assembled with tubular high voltage electrodes on the gas side the regime of typical gas pressures is around two bars 200 kilo Pascal's absolute in oxygen and three bars 300 kilo Pascal's absolute in air several megawatts of electrical power may be installed in large facilities applied is one phase AC current at 50 to 8000 Hertz and peak voltages between 3,000 and 20,000 volts applied voltage is usually inversely related to the applied frequency the dominating parameter influencing ozone generation efficiency as the gas temperature which is controlled by cooling water temperature and/or gas velocity the cooler the water the better the ozone synthesis the lower the gas velocity the higher the concentration but the lower the net ozone produced at typical industrial conditions almost 90 percent of the effective power is dissipated as heat and needs to be removed by a sufficient cooling water flow because of the high reactivity of ozone only a few materials may be used like stainless steel quality 316l titanium aluminium as long as no moisture is present glass polytetrafluoroethylene or poly vinylidene fluoride Viton may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation hypalon may be used with the restriction that no water come in contact with it except for normal atmospheric levels embrittlement or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like o rings silicone rubbers are usually adequate for use as gaskets in ozone concentrations below 1 WT % such as in equipment for accelerated aging of rubber samples you topic incidental production ozone may be formed from o2 by electrical discharges and by action of high-energy electromagnetic radiation unsuppressed arcing in electrical contacts motor brushes or mechanical switches breaks down the chemical bonds of the atmospheric oxygen surrounding the contacts Oh - - Oh free radicals of oxygen in and around the arc recombined to create ozone o3 certain electrical equipment generates significant levels of ozone this is especially true of devices using high voltages such as ionic air purifiers laser printers photocopiers tasers and arc welders electric motors using brushes can generate ozone from repeated sparking inside the unit large motors that use brushes such as those used by elevators or hydraulic pumps will generate more ozone than smaller motors ozone is similarly formed in the Catatumbo lightning storms phenomenon on the Catatumbo River in Venezuela though Ozone's instability makes it dubious that it has any effect on those on a sphere it is the world's largest single natural generator of ozone lending calls for it to be designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site topic laboratory production in the laboratory ozone can be produced by electrolysis using a 9-volt battery a pencil graphite rod cathode a platinum wire anode and a three molar sulfuric acid electrolyte the half-cell reactions taking place are 3 H 2 O 3 plus 6h plus plus 6 e minus Delta e o equals minus 1.5 3 volts 6h plus plus 6 e minus 3 h2 Delta e o equals 0 volts 2 h2o o 2 plus 4 h plus plus 4 e minus Delta e o equals 1 point 2 3 volts in the net reaction three equivalents of water are converted into one equivalent of ozone and three equivalents of hydrogen oxygen formation is a competing reaction it can also be generated by a high voltage arc in its simplest form high-voltage AC such as the output of a neon sign transformer as connected to two metal rods with the ends placed sufficiently close to each other to allow an arc the resulting arc will convert atmospheric oxygen to ozone it is often desirable to contain the ozone this can be done with an apparatus consisting of two concentric glass tubes sealed together at the top with gas ports at the top and bottom of the outer tube the inner core should have a length of metal foil inserted into it connected to one side of the power source the other side of the power source should be connected to another piece of foil wrapped around the outer tube a source of dry o2 is applied to the bottom port when high voltage is applied to the foil leads electricity will discharge between the dry dioxygen in the middle and form o 3 + o 2 which will flow out the top port the reaction can be summarized as follows 302 electricity to o3 topic applications you topic industry the largest use of ozone is in the preparation of pharmaceuticals synthetic lubricants and many other commercially useful organic compounds where it is used to sever carbon-carbon bonds it can also be used for bleaching substances and for killing microorganisms in air and water sources many municipal drinking water systems kill bacteria with ozone instead of the more common chlorine ozone has a very high oxidation potential ozone does not form organochlorine compounds nor does it remain in the water after treatment ozone can form the suspected carcinogen bromate in source water with high bromide concentrations the u.s. Safe Drinking Water Act mandates that these systems introduce an amount of chlorine to maintain a minimum of 0.2 mew mol per mol residual free chlorine in the pipes based on results of regular testing where electrical power is abundant ozone is a cost-effective method of treating water since it is produced on demand and does not require transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals once it has decayed it leaves no taste or odor in drinking water although low levels of ozone have been advertised to be of some disinfectant use in residential homes the concentration of ozone in dry air required to have a rapid substantial effect on airborne pathogens exceeds safe levels recommended by the u.s. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Environmental Protection Agency humidity control can vastly improve both the killing power of the ozone and the rate at which it decays back to oxygen more humidity allows more effectiveness spore forms of most pathogens are very tolerant of atmospheric ozone in concentrations at which asthma patients start to have issues industrially ozone is used to disinfect laundry in hospitals food factories care homes etc disinfect water in place of chlorine deodorize air and objects such as after a fire this process is extensively used in fabric restoration kill bacteria on food or on contact surfaces water intense industries such as breweries and dairy plants can make effective use of dissolved ozone as a replacement to chemical sanitizers such as peracetic acid hypochlorite or heat disinfect cooling towers in control ijen Ella with reduced chemical consumption water bleed off an increased performance sanitize swimming pools and spas kill insects in stored grain scrub yeast and mold spores from the air in food processing plants wash fresh fruits and vegetables to kill yeast mold and bacteria chemically attacked contaminants in water iron arsenic hydrogen sulfide nitrites and complex organics lumped together as color provide an aid to flocculation agglomeration of molecules which aids in filtration where the iron and arsenic are removed manufacture chemical compounds via chemical synthesis clean and bleach fabrics the former use is utilized in fabric restoration the latter uses patented act as an anti chlorine chlorine based bleaching assist in processing plastics to allow adhesion of inks aged rubber samples to determine the useful life of a batch of rubber eradicate waterborne parasites such as Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium in surface water treatment plants ozone is a reagent in many organic reactions in the laboratory and in industry ozonolysis is the cleavage of an alkene to carbonyl compounds many hospitals around the world use large ozone generators to decontaminate operating rooms between surgeries the rooms are cleaned and then sealed airtight before being filled with ozone which effectively kills or neutralizes all remaining bacteria ozone is used as an alternative to chlorine or chlorine dioxide in the bleaching of wood pulp it is often used in conjunction with oxygen and hydrogen peroxide to eliminate the need for chlorine containing compounds in the manufacture of high-quality white paper ozone can be used to detoxify cyanide wastes for example from gold and silver mining by oxidizing cyanide to cyanate and eventually to carbon dioxide you topic consumers devices generating high levels of ozone some of which use ionization are used to sanitize & deodorize uninhabited buildings rooms ductwork wood sheds boats and other vehicles in the US air purifiers emitting low levels of ozone have been sold this kind of air purifier is sometimes claimed to imitate nature's way of purifying the air without filters and de sanitized both it and household surfaces the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA has declared that their US evidence to show that at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards ozone is not effective at removing many odor causing chemicals or viruses bacteria mold or other biological pollutants furthermore its report states that results of some controlled studies showed that concentrations of ozone considerably higher than these human safety standards are possible even when a user follows the manufacturers operating instructions ozonated water is used to launder clothes and to sanitize food drinking water and surfaces in the home according to the US Food and Drug Administration FDA it is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of ozone in gaseous and aqueous phases as an antimicrobial agent on food including meat and poultry studies at California Polytechnic University demonstrated that 0.3 mu mole per mole levels of ozone dissolved in filtered tap water can produce a reduction of more than 99.99% in such food borne microorganisms as Salmonella e.coli o157 h7 and Campylobacter this quantity is 20,000 times the w-h-o recommended limits stated above ozone can be used to remove pesticide residues from fruits and vegetables ozone is used in homes and hot tubs to kill bacteria in the water and to reduce the amount of chlorine or bromine required by reactivating them to their free state since ozone does not remain in the water long enough ozone by itself is ineffective at preventing cross contamination among bathers and must be used in conjunction with halogens gaseous ozone created by violet light or by Corona discharge is injected into the water ozone is also widely used in treatment of water in aquariums and fish ponds its use can minimize bacterial growth control parasites eliminate transmission of some diseases and reduce or eliminate yellowing of the water ozone must not come in contact with fish's gills structures natural salt water with life forms provides enough instantaneous demand that controlled amounts of ozone activate bromide ion to hypo bromas acid and the ozone entirely decays in a few seconds to minutes if oxygen fed ozone is used the water will be higher in dissolved oxygen fish's gills structures will atrophy and they will become dependent on higher dissolved oxygen levels topic aquaculture ozone ation a process of infusing water with ozone can be used in aquaculture to facilitate organic breakdown ozone is also added to recirculating systems to reduce nitrite levels through conversion into nitrate if nitrite levels in the water are high nitrites will also accumulate in the blood and tissues of fish where it interferes with oxygen transport it causes oxidation of the heme group of hemoglobin from ferrous fate 2 plus to ferric they three plus making hemoglobin unable to bind o2 despite these apparent positive effects ozone use in recirculation systems has been linked to reducing the level of bioavailable iodine in salt water systems resulting in iodine deficiency symptoms such as goiter and decreased growth in Senegalese soul soleus Senegal and sis larvae ozonate seawater is used for surface disinfection of haddock and Atlantic halibut eggs against nota virus nota virus is a lethal and vertically transmitted virus which causes severe mortality in fish paddock eggs should not be treated with high ozone level as eggs so treated did not hatch and died after three to four days topic agriculture ozone application on freshly cut pineapple and banana shows increase in flavonoids and total phenyl contents when exposure is up to 20 minutes decrease in ascorbic acid one form of vitamin C content is observed but the positive effect on total phenol content and flavonoids can overcome the negative effect Tomatoes upon treatment with ozone shows an increase in beta-carotene lutein and lycopene however ozone application on strawberries in pre harvest period shows decrease in ascorbic acid content ozone facilitates the extraction of some heavy metals from soil using EDTA EDTA forms strong water-soluble coordination compounds with some heavy metals PB Zn thereby making it possible to dissolve them out from contaminated soil if contaminated soil is pre treated with ozone the extraction efficacy of PB AM and pou increases by 11 point O to twenty eight point nine percent forty three point five percent and fifty point seven percent respectively topic medical various therapeutic uses for ozone have been proposed but are not supported by high quality evidence and generally considered alternative medicine topic see also cyclic ozone global ozone monitoring by
