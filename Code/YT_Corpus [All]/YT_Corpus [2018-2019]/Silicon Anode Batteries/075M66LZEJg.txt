by jöns jakob berzelius and johann gottlieb began both chemists owned a chemistry plant near Gripsholm sweden producing sulfuric acid by the lead chamber process the pyrite from the fallen mine created a red precipitate in the lead chambers which was presumed to be an arsenic compound so the pyrites used to make acid was discontinued Berzelius again wanted to use the pyrite and they also observed that the red precipitate gave off a smell like horseradish when burned this smell was not typical of arsenic but a similar odour was known from tellurium compounds hence brasilia's first letter to Alexander marcet stated that this was a tellurium compound however the lack of tellurium compounds in the fallen mine minerals eventually led Berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate and in 1818 he wrote a second letter to marcet describing a newly found element similar to sulfur and tellurium because of its similarity to tellurium named for the earth Bros Elias named the new element after the moon in 1873 Willoughby Smith found that the electrical resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the ambient light this led to its use as a cell for sensing light the first commercial products using selenium were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid 1870s the selenium cell was used in the photo phone developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879 selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface this phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices selenium semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics the development of selenium rectifiers began during the early 1930s and these replaced copper oxide rectifiers because they were more efficient these lasted in commercial applications until the 1970s following which they were replaced with less expensive and even more efficient silicon rectifiers selenium came to medical notice later because of its toxicity to human beings working in industries selenium was also recognized as an important veterinary toxin which is seen in animals that have eaten high selenium plan in 1954 the first hints of specific biological functions of selenium were discovered in microorganisms by biochemist Jane Vincent it was discovered to be essential for mammalian life in 1957 in the 1970s it was shown to be present in two independent sets of enzymes this was followed by the discovery of silina cysteine in proteins during the 1980s salinas cysteine was shown to be encoded by the codon UGA the recoating mechanism was worked out first in bacteria and then in mammals CSEC is element topic occurrence native ie elemental selenium as a rare mineral which does not usually form good crystals but when it does they are steep rhombohedral are tiny acicular hair like crystals isolation of selenium is often complicated by the presence of other compounds and elements selenium occurs naturally in a number of inorganic forms including selenide cell innate and selenite but these minerals are rare the common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral and contains no selenite ion but is rather a type of gypsum calcium sulfate hydrate named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium selenium is most commonly found as an impurity replacing a small part of the sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals in living systems selenium is found in the amino acid selenomethionine Selena cysteine and methyl selena cysteine in these compounds selenium plays a role analogous to that of sulfur another naturally occurring organosilicon compounds as dimethyl selenide certain solids are selenium rich and selenium can be bio concentrated by some plants in soils selenium most often occurs in soluble forms such as Selin 8 analogous to sulfate which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff ocean water contains significant amounts of selenium anthropogenic sources of selenium include coal burning and the mining and smelting of sulfide ores topic production selenium is most commonly produced from selenide in many sulphide ores such as those of copper nickel or LED electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants a process that is no longer used selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods however most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper ore producing sulfuric acid since its invention solvent extraction and electrowinning SX EU production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply this changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper industrial production of selenium usually involves the extraction of selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium dioxide which is mixed with water and acidified to form cell in its acid oxidation step selling this acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide reduction step to give elemental selenium about 2000 tons of selenium were produced in 2011 worldwide mostly in Germany 650 T Japan 630 T Belgium 200 T and Russia 140 T and the total reserves were estimated at 93 thousand tonnes these data exclude two major producers the United States and China a previous sharp increase was observed in 2004 from four to five to $27 per lb the price was relatively stable during 2004 to 2010 at about $30 per pound in 100-pound Lots but increased to $65 per pound in 2011 the consumption in 2010 was divided as follows

consumption is for the production of glass say compounds confer a red color to glass this color cancels out the green or yellow tints that arise from iron impurities typical for most glass for this purpose various selenite and cell innate salts are added for other applications a red color may be desired produced by mixtures of cadmium selenide and CDs topic alloys you selenium is used with bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead the regulation of lead in drinking water applications with the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 made a reduction of lead in brass necessary the new brass

1980s the photo conductor application declined although it was still a large end use as more and more copiers switched to organic photo conductors the once widely used selenium rectifiers have mostly been replaced or are being replaced by silicon based devices the most notable exception is in power DC surge protection where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more

dismutase enzymes activities ie selenium vanadium magnesium copper and zinc may have been lacking in some terrestrial mineral deficient areas marine organisms retained and sometimes expanded their Salina proteomes whereas the Salina proteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost these findings suggest that with the exception of vertebrates aquatic life supports selenium use whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentration of selenium and iodine from about 500 million years ago freshwater and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of new endogenous antioxidants such as ascorbic acid vitamin C polyphenols including flavonoids tocopherols etc a few of these appeared more recently in the last 50 to 200 million years in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants in fact the angiosperms the dominant type of plant today and most of their antioxidant

hormone biosynthesis about 200 million years ago new Salina proteins were developed as mammalian gsh px enzymes topic nutritional sources of selenium dietary selenium comes from nuts cereals and mushrooms Brazil nuts are the richest dietary source though this is soil dependent since the Brazil nut does not require high levels of the element for its own needs the u.s. recommended dietary allowance RDA for teenagers and adults as 55 micrograms per day selenium as a dietary supplement is available in many forms including multivitamins mineral supplements which typically contain 55 or 70 micrograms serving selenium specific supplements typically contain either 100 or 200 micrograms serving in June 2015 the US Food and Drug Administration FDA published its final rule establishing the requirement of minimum and maximum levels of selenium in infant formula the selenium content in the human body is believed to be in the 13 to 20 milligram range topic indicator plant species certain species of plants are considered indicators of high selenium content of the soil because they require high levels of selenium to thrive the main selenium indicator plants are a straggler species including some loco weeds Princes plume Stanley ASP woody asters Xylo raisa SP and false golden weed une abscess SP topic detection in biological fluids selenium may be measured in blood plasma serum or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or investigate a suspected case of fatal overdose some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharides conjugates Celino sugars in the body prior elimination in the urine cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of saline o thiamine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations topic toxicity although selenium is an essential trace element it is toxic if taken in excess exceeding the tolerable upper intake level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to cell enosis this 400 micrograms tolerable upper intake level is based primarily on the 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of cell enosis and a follow-up study on the same five people in 1992 the 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day 15 micrograms per kilogram body weight but suggested 400 micrograms per day to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to accord with data from other countries in China people who ingested corn grown an extremely selenium rich stony coal carbonaceous shale have suffered from selenium toxicity this coal was shown to have selenium content as high as nine point one percent the highest concentration in coal ever recorded signs and symptoms of cell enosis include a garlic odor on the breath gastrointestinal disorders hair loss sloughing of males fatigue irritability and neurological damage extreme cases of cell enosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver pulmonary edema or death elemental selenium and most metallic Selenites have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability by contrast cell in eights and Selenites have an oxidant mode of action similar to that of arsenic trioxide and are very toxic the chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about two thousand four hundred to three thousand micrograms of selenium per day hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic corrosive gas

dose of one of the ingredients used in a vitamin mineral supplement compound that had been incorrect prepared by a compounding pharmacy analysis of blood levels of inorganic compounds in the supplement indicated the selenium concentrations were 10 to 15 times higher than normal in the blood samples and 15 to 20 times higher than normal in the liver samples selenium was later confirmed to be the toxic factor selenium poisoning of water systems may result whenever new agricultural runoff courses through normally dry undeveloped lands this process leeches natural soluble selenium compounds such as sellin eighths into the water which may then be concentrated in new wetlands as the water evaporates selenium pollution of waterways also occurs when selenium is leached from coal flew ash mining and metal smelting crude oil processing and landfill the resultant high selenium levels in waterways were found to cause congenital disorders in oviparous species including wetland birds and fish elevated dietary methyl mercury levels can amplify the harm of selenium toxicity in oviparous species in fish and other wildlife selenium is necessary for life but toxic and high doses for salmon the optimal concentration of selenium is about one microgram selenium per gram of whole body weight much below that level young salmon die from deficiency much above they died from toxic excess the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for selenium in the workplace at 0.2 milligrams per cubic meter over an eight-hour workday the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a recommended exposure limit realm of 0.2 milligrams per cubic meter over an eight-hour workday at levels of one milligram per cubic meter selenium is immediately dangerous to life and health topic deficiency selenium deficiency can occur in patients with severely compromised intestinal function those undergoing
