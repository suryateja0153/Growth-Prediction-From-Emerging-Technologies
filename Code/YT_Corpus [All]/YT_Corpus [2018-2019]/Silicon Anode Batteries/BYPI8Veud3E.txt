 Delivering the GAS-TESS to the SA Water wastewater treatment plant is yet another milestone after what's been an incredible year having only just listed on the ASX. We've been very excited with how the unit has run at our test facility and we are equally excited to be relocating it now onto the SA Water Glenelg site on the first commercial application of our technology. SA Water are innovative leaders in their field, hosting our pilot project as they work towards a zero net cost energy future. The key issue with dealing with methane on a site like this is it's very difficult to store the gas. You need to burn it as you use it so what we can do is burn the methane and store that energy as thermal energy in the silicon which allows us to then reclaim out of the silicon the heat at a time when it's required and use that heat to generate electricity and or heat the digesters. This wastewater management facility so this is two hundred thousand people in South Australia alone with a global population of 7.2 billion the market for our GAS-TESS is significant. This is a world first technology, global innovation right here in South Australia. We are delivering the thermal energy storage device now and we'll be commissioning it in early 2019. We're all ready to go we have completed factory acceptance testing of the burners and the unit itself is all ready to go to site so we're really looking forward to getting it fired up.
