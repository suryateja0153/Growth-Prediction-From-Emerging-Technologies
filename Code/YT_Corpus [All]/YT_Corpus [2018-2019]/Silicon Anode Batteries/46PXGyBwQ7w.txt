 copper is a chemical element with symbol Cu from Latin cuprum and atomic number 29 it is a soft malleable and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity a freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish orange color copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity as a building material and is a constituent of various metal alloys such as sterling silver used in jewelry cupro-nickel used to make marine hardware and coins and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form native metals this led to very early human use in several regions from C 8,000 BC thousands of years later it was the first metal to be smelted from sulphide ores C 5000 BC the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold C 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal tin to create bronze C 3500 BC in the Roman era copper was principally mined on Cyprus the origin of the name of the metal from a esse priam metal of Cyprus later corrupted to s up from Latin from which the words derived koper Old English and copper first used around 1530 the commonly encountered compounds are copper 2 salts which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite malachite and turquoise and have been used widely and historically as pigments copper used in buildings usually for roofing oxidizes to form a green verdigris or patina copper is sometimes used in decorative art both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents fungicides and wood preservatives copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome C oxidase in mollusks and crustaceans copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin replaced by the iron complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates in humans copper is found mainly in the liver muscle and bone the adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1 milligrams of copper per kilogram of body weight topic characteristics you topic physical copper silver and gold are in group 11 of the periodic table these three metals have one s orbital electron on top of a filled D electron shell and are characterized by high ductility and electrical and thermal conductivity the filled D shells in these elements contribute little to inter atomic interactions which are dominated by the s electrons through metallic bonds unlike metals with incomplete D shells metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak this observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper at the macroscopic scale introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice such as grain boundaries hinders flow of the material under applied stress thereby increasing its hardness for this reason copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form which has greater strength than mono crystalline forms the softness of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity 59 point six times 106 s per meter and high thermal conductivity second-highest second only to silver among pure metals at room temperature this is because the resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice which are relatively weak in a soft metal the maximum permissible current density of copper in open air as approximately 3.1 times 106 a per square meter of cross-sectional area above which it begins to heat excessively copper is one of a few metallic elements with a natural color other than gray or silver pure copper is orange red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air the characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty four's atomic shells the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light as with other metals if copper is put in contact with another metal galvanic corrosion will occur topic chemical copper does not react with water but it does slowly react with atmospheric oxygen to form a layer of brown black copper oxides which unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air protects the underlying metal from further corrosion passivation a green layer of verdigris copper carbonate can often be seen on old copper structures such as the roofing of many older buildings in the Statue of Liberty copper tarnish is when exposed to some sulfur compounds with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides topic isotopes there are 29 isotopes of copper 63 cu and 65 Cu are stable with 63 Cu comprising approximately 69 percent of naturally occurring copper both have a spin of three-halves the other isotopes are radioactive with the most stable being 67 Cu with a half-life of 61 point eight three hours 7 meta stable isotopes have been characterized 68 MCU as the longest lived with a half-life of 3.8 minutes isotopes with a mass number above 64 decay by beta - whereas those with a mass number below 64 decay by beta plus 64 CU which has a half-life of 12 point 7 hours decays both ways 0.62 CU and 64 C you have significant applications 62 Cu is used in 62 Cu PT sm as a radioactive tracer for positron emission tomography topic occurrence copper is produced in massive stars and is present in the Earth's crust in a proportion of about 50 parts per million ppm in nature copper occurs in a variety of minerals including native copper copper sulfides such as Chao copyright bor night didja night kava light and chalcocite copper sylth assaults such as tetra he died 10 indict and an argent copper carbonates such as azurite and malachite and his copper eye or copper 2 oxides such as cuprite antenna right respectively the largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed 420 tons and was found in 1857 on the Kuna Peninsula in Michigan US native copper is a poly crystal with the largest single crystal ever described measuring four point four times three point two times three point two centimeters topic production most copper is mined are extracted as copper sulfides from large open pit mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain 0.42 1.0 percent copper sites include chuquicamata in Chile Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah United States and El Chino mine in New Mexico United States according to the British Geological Survey in 2005 Chile was the top producer of copper with at least one third of the world share followed by the United States Indonesia and Peru copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process several sites in the state of Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method the amount of copper in use is increasing in the quantity available as barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage topic reserves copper has been in use at least 10,000 years but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted since 1900 and more than half was extracted the last 24 years as with many natural resources the total amount of copper on earth is vast with around 1014 tonnes in the top kilometer of Earth's crust which is about 5 million years worth at the current rate of extraction however only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 to 60 years depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world because of these and other factors the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate including the concept of peak copper analogous to peak oil the price of copper has historically been unstable and its price increased from the 60-year low of 60 cents per pound one dollar and 32 cents per kilogram in June 1999 to $3.75 per pound eight dollars and 27 cents per kilogram in May 2006 it dropped to two dollars and 40 cents per pound five dollars and twenty-nine cents per kilogram in February 2007 then rebounded to three dollars and 50 cents per pound seven dollars and 71 cents per kilogram in April 2007 in February 2009 weakening global demand and a steep fall in commodity prices since the previous year's highs left copper prices at one dollar and 51 cents per pound three dollars and 32 cents per kilogram topic methods the concentration of copper in ores average is only 0.6 percent and most commercial ores are sulfides especially child copywrite toughest to bore night Cu five iron eight sulfide and to a lesser extent cover like us and chalcocite these minerals are concentrated from crushed ores to the level of ten to fifteen percent copper by froth flotation or bio leaching heating this material with silica in flash smelting removes much of the iron is slag the process exploits the greater ease of converting iron sulphides into oxides which in turn react with the silica to form the silicate slag that floats on top of the heated mass the resulting copper mat consisting of is roasted to convert all sulfides into oxides 2 + 3 o 2 2 + 2 so2 the cuprous oxide is converted to blister copper upon heating to 4 CU + o - the Sudbury matte process converted only half the sulphide to oxide and then used this oxide to remove the rest of the sulfur as oxide it was then electrolytically refined in the anode mud exploited for the Platinum and Gold it contained this step exploits the relatively easy reduction of copper oxides to copper metal natural gas is blown across the blister to remove most of the remaining oxygen and electro refining is performed on the resulting material to produce pure copper Cu 2 plus plus 2 e - see you topic recycling like aluminium copper is recyclable without any loss of quality both from raw state and from manufactured products in volume copper is the third most recycled metal after iron and aluminium an estimated 80% of all copper ever mined is still in use today according to the international resource panels metal stocks in society report the global per capita stock of copper in use in society as 35 to 55 kilogram much of this is in more developed countries 140 to 300 kilograms per capita rather than less developed countries 30 to 40 kilograms per capita the process of recycling copper is roughly the same as is used to extract copper but requires fewer steps high purity scrap copper is melted in a furnace and then reduced and cast into billets in ingots lower purity scrap is refined by electroplating in a bath of sulfuric acid topic alloys numerous copper alloys have been formulated many with important uses brass is an alloy of copper and zinc bronze usually refers to copper tin alloys but can refer to any alloy of coppers such as aluminium bronze copper is one of the most important constituents of silver and karat gold and karat soldiers used in the jewelry industry modifying the color hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys some lead-free solders consist of ten deloitte with a small proportion of copper and other metals the alloy of copper and nickel called cupro-nickel is used in low denomination coins often for the outer cladding the u.s. 5 cent coin currently called a nickel consists of 75% copper and 25% nickel in homogeneous composition the alloy of 90% copper and 10% nickel remarkable for its resistance to corrosion is used for various objects exposed to seawater though it is vulnerable to the sulfide sometimes found in polluted harbours and estuaries alloys of copper with aluminium about 7% of a golden color and are used in decorations shokudo is a Japanese decorative alloy of copper containing a low percentage of gold typically 4 to 10 percent that can be patinated to a dark blue or black color topic compounds copper forms a rich variety of compounds usually with oxidation states plus 1 and plus 2 which are often called cuprous and cupric respectively topic binary compounds as with other elements the simplest compounds of copper are binary compounds ie those containing only two elements the principle examples being oxides sulfides and halides both cuprous and cupric oxide Tsar known among the numerous copper sulfides important examples include copper I sulphide and copper to sulfide cuprous halides with chlorine bromine and iodine are known as our cupric halides with fluorine chlorine and bromine attempts to prepare copper 2 iodide yield only cuprous iodide and iodine to Cu 2 plus plus 4 I minus 2 cui plus I 2 topic coordination chemistry

o - many other oxyanions form complexes these include copper 2 acetate copper - nitrate and copper 2 carbonate copper ii sulfate forms a blue crystal and pentahydrate the most familiar copper compound in the laboratory it is used in a fungicide called the Bordeaux mixture polyols compounds containing more than one alcohol functional group generally interact with cupric salts for example copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars specifically using Benedict's reagent and Fehlings solution the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change from blue CU 2 to reddish copper I oxide schweiz reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper to many wet chemical tests for copper ions exist one involving potassium ferrocyanide which gives a brown precipitate with copper 2 salts topic organocopper chemistry compounds that contain a carbon copper bond are known as organic copper compounds they are very reactive towards oxygen to form copper I oxide and have many uses in chemistry they are synthesized by treating copper i compounds with grignard reagents terminal alkynes or organolithium reagents in particular the last reaction described produces a gilman reagent these can undergo substitution with alkyl halides to form coupling products as such they are important in the field of organic synthesis copper i acetylide is highly shock sensitive but as an intermediate in reaction such as the kadhi ochika vich coupling and the Sunna gashira coupling conjugate addition to II knowns and carbecue pression of alkynes can also be achieved with organic copper compounds copper I forms a variety of weak complexes with alkenes and carbon monoxide especially in the presence of amine ligands topic copper 3 and copper IV copper 3 is most often found in oxides a simple example is potassium cuprate k CU o - a blue-black solid the most extensively studied copper 3 compounds are the cuprate superconductors yttrium barium copper oxide yb8 - consists of both cu2 and Cu 3 centers like oxide fluoride as a highly basic anion and is known to stabilize metal ions in high oxidation states both copper 3 and even copper IV fluorides are known K 3 copper 6 fluoride and sees two copper 6 fluoride respectively some copper proteins form oXXO complexes which also feature copper 3 with tetra peptides purple colored copper 3 complexes are stabilized by the deprotonated amide ligands complexes of copper 3 are also found as intermediates in reactions of organic copper compounds for example in the karush sosnovske reaction topic history a timeline of copper illustrates how the metal has advanced human civilization for the past eleven thousand years topic prehistoric history you topic Copper Age copper occurs naturally as native metallic copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record the history of copper use dates to 9000 BC in the Middle East a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC evidence suggests that gold and meteoric iron but not smelted iron were the only metals used by humans before copper the history of copper metallurgy is thought to follow this sequence first cold working of native copper then annealing smelting and finally lost wax casting in southeastern Anatolia all four of these techniques appear more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic sea 7500 BC copper smelting was independently invented in different places it was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC in Central America around 600 AD and in West Africa about the ninth or 10th century AD investment casting was invented in for 500 4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire UK at 2282 1890 BC Otzi the Iceman a male dated from 3 300 3 200 BC was found with an axe with a copperhead 99.7% pure high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals in particular copper smelting led to the discovery of iron smelting production in the old copper complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC natural bronze a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon arsenic and rarely tin came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC topic bronze-age alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years after the discovery of copper smelting and about 2,000 years after natural bronze had come into general use bronze artifacts from the vinca culture date to 4500 BC Sumerian and Egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 BC the Bronze Age began in southeastern Europe around 3 700 3 300 BC in northwestern Europe about 2,500 BC it ended with the beginning of the Iron Age 2,000 to 1000 BC in the near East and 600 BC in Northern Europe the transition between the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the Chalcolithic period copper stone when copper tools were used with stone tools the term has gradually fallen out of favour because in some parts of the world the Chalcolithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends brass an alloy of copper and zinc is of much more recent origin it was known to the Greeks but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire topic ancient and post classical history in Greece copper was known by the name chako's chuckle it was an important resource for the Romans Greeks and other ancient peoples in Roman times it was known as AES Cyprian AES being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and Ciprian from Cyprus where much copper was mine the phrase was simplified to cuprum hence the english copper Aphrodite Venus in Rome represented copper in mythology and alchemy because of its lustrous beauty and its ancient use in producing mirrors Cyprus was sacred to the goddess the seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity and Venus was assigned to copper copper was first used in ancient Britain in about the third or second century BC in North America copper mining began with marginal workings by Native Americans native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600 copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America particularly in Peru around 1000 AD copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered but the metals commercial production did not start until the early 20th century the cultural role of copper has been important particularly in currency Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money at first the copper itself was valued but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass while Octavian Augustus Caesars coins were made from cu PBS n alloys with an estimated annual output of around 15,000 T Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the Industrial Revolution the provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania Cyprus and in Central Europe the gates of the Temple of Jerusalem used Corinthian bronze treated with depletion gilding the process was most prevalent in Alexandria where alchemy is thought to have begun in ancient India copper was used in the holistic medical science I of ADA for surgical instruments and other medical equipment ancient Egyptians tilled at 2400 BC used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water later to treat headaches burns and itching topic modern history the great Copper Mountain was a mine in Fraulein Sweden that operated from the 10th century to 1992 it satisfied 2/3 of Europe's copper consumption in the 17th century and helped fund many of Sweden's Wars during that time it was referred to as the nation's Treasury Sweden had a copper backed currency copper is used in roofing currency and for photographic technology known as the daguerreotype copper was used in Renaissance sculpture and was used to construct the Statue of Liberty copper continues to be used in construction of various types copper plating and copper sheeting were widely used to protect the underwater hulls of ships a technique pioneered by the British Admiralty in the 18th century the Nordica finery in hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant starting its production in 1876 the German scientist Gottfried osan invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metals atomic mass around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element eg tin to copper would affect Bell tones flash smelting was developed by utakome who in Finland and first applied at Harjo Volta in 1949 the energy efficient process accounts for 50% of the world's primary copper production the Intergovernmental Council of copper exporting countries formed in 1967 by Chile Peru Zaire and Zambia operated in the copper market as OPEC does in oil though it never achieved the same influence particularly because the second largest producer the United States was never a member it was dissolved in 1988 topic applications the major applications of copper are electrical wire 60% roofing and plumbing 20% an industrial machinery 15% copper is used mostly as a pure metal but when greater hardness is required it is put into such alloys as brass and bronze five percent of total use for more than two centuries copper paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and shellfish a small part of the copper supply is used for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture machining of copper is possible although alloys are preferred for good machinability in creating intricate parts topic wire and cable despite competition from other materials copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred copper wire is used in power generation power transmission power distribution telecommunications electronic circuitry and countless types of electrical equipment electrical wiring is the most important market for the copper industry this includes structural power wiring power distribution cable appliance wire communications cable automotive wire and cable and magnet wire roughly half of all copper mind is used for electrical wire and cable conductors many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties such as its high electrical conductivity tensile strength ductility creep deformation resistance corrosion resistance low thermal expansion high thermal conductivity ease of soldering malleability and ease of installation for a short period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s copper wiring was replaced by aluminium wiring in many housing construction projects in America the new wiring was implicated in a number of house fires in the industry returned to copper topic electronics and related devices integrated circuits and printed circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties electromagnets vacuum tubes cathode ray tubes and magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper as do wave guides for microwave radiation topic electric motors copper's superior conductivity enhances the efficiency of electrical motors this is important because motors and motor driven systems account for 43% to 46% of all global electricity consumption and 69 percent of all electricity used by industry increasing the mass and cross section of copper in a coil increases the efficiency of the motor copper motor rotors a new technology designed for motor applications where energy savings are prime design objectives are enabling general purpose induction motors to meet and exceed National Electrical Manufacturers Association NEMA premium efficiency standards topic architecture copper has been used since ancient times as a durable corrosion-resistant and weatherproof architectural material roofs flashings rain gutters downspouts domes spires vaults and doors have been made from copper for hundreds or thousands of years copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding building expansion joints radiofrequency shielding and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails bathroom fixtures and countertops some of coppers other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement lightweight lightning protection and recyclable 'ti the metals distinctive natural green patina has long been coveted by architects and designers the final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering it can be a mixture of carbonate and sulphate compounds in various amounts depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur containing acid rain architectural copper and it's alloys can also be finished to take on a particular look feel or color finishes include mechanical surface treatments chemical colouring and coatings copper has excellent brazing and soldering properties and can be welded the best results are obtained with gas metal arc welding topic anti biofouling applications copter is bio static meaning bacteria and many other forms of life will not grow on it for this reason it has long been used to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels it was originally used pure but has since been superseded by months metal and copper based paint similarly as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion resistant properties in marine environments topic antimicrobial applications copper alloy touch surfaces have natural properties that destroy a wide range of microorganisms eg e coli o157 h7 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA Staphylococcus Clostridium difficile influenza A virus adenovirus and fungi some 355 copper alloys were proven to kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA has approved the registrations of these copper alloys s antimicrobial materials with public health benefits that approval allows manufacturers to make legal claims to the public health benefits of products made of registered alloys in addition the EPA has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys such as bed rails handrails / bed tables sinks faucets door knobs toilet hardware computer keyboards health club equipment and shopping cart handles for a comprehensive list see antimicrobial copper alloy touch surfaces hashtag approved products copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease and Legionnaires disease is suppressed by copper tubing and plumbing systems antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the UK Ireland Japan Korea France Denmark and Brazil and in the subway transit system in Santiago Chile where copper zinc alloy handrails will be installed in some 30 stations between 2011 and 2014 topic folk medicine copper is commonly used in jewelry and according to some folklore copper bracelets relieve arthritis symptoms in one trial for osteoarthritis and one trial for rheumatoid arthritis no differences is found between copper bracelet and control non copper bracelet no evidence shows that copper can be absorbed through the skin if it were it might led to copper poisoning topic compression clothing recently some compression clothing with interwoven copper has been marketed with health claims similar to the folk medicine claims because compression clothing is a valid treatment for some ailments the clothing may have that benefit but the added copper may have no benefit beyond a placebo effect topic other uses textile fibers are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics topic degradation chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas fluorescens can both mobilize solid copper as a cyanide compound the era coid mycorrhizal fungi associated with calluna Erica and vaccinium can grow in metal if her soils containing copper the ekta mycorrhizal fungus we loose luteus protects young pine trees from copper toxicity a sample of the fungus Aspergillus Niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold silver copper iron and zinc the fungus also plays a role in the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides topic biological role copper proteins have diverse roles in biological electron transport and oxygen transportation processes that exploit the easy inter conversion of copper 1 iodide and see you too copper is essential in the aerobic respiration of all eukaryotes in mitochondria it is found in cytochrome C oxidase which is the last protein in oxidative phosphorylation cytochrome C oxidase is the protein that binds the o2 between a copper and an iron the protein transfers 8 electrons to the o2 molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water copper is also found in many superoxide dismutase ins proteins that catalyze the decomposition of super oxides by converting it by disproportionation to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide Cu 2 plus sod plus O 2 minus c u plus sod plus O 2 reduction of copper oxidation of superoxide Cu plus sod plus O 2 minus plus 2 h plus Cu 2 plus sod plus H 2 O 2 oxidation of copper reduction of superoxide the protein hemocyanin is the oxygen carrier in most mollusks and some arthropods such as the horseshoe crab Limulus Polyphemus because hemocyanin is blue these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood of iron based hemoglobin structurally related to hemocyanin are the Lac cases and tyrosinase s instead of reversibly binding oxygen these proteins hydroxylate substrates illustrated by their role in the formation of lacquers the biological role for copper commenced with the appearance of oxygen in earth's atmosphere several copper proteins such as the blue copper proteins do not interact directly with substrates hence they are not enzymes these proteins relay electrons by the process called electron transfer a unique tetranuclear copper Center has been found in nitrous oxide reductase chemical compounds which were developed for treatment of Wilson's disease have been investigated for use in cancer therapy topic dietary needs copter is an essential trace element in plants and animals but not all microorganisms the human body contains copper at a level of about 1.4 to 2.1 milligrams per kilogram of body mass copper is absorbed in the gut then transported to the liver bound to albumin after processing in the liver copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase which involves the protein ceruloplasmin carrying the majority of copper and blood ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted in milk and is particularly well absorbed as a copper source copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation about five milligrams a day versus about one milligram per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body and the body is able to excrete some excess copper if needed via bio which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine topic dietary recommendations the u.s. Institute of Medicine IOM updated the estimated average requirements ears and recommended dietary allowances RDAs for copper in 2001 if there is not sufficient information to establish ears and our das an estimate designated adequate intake ai is used instead the a is for copper our 200 micrograms of copper for 0 to 6 month old males and females and 220 micrograms of copper for 7 to 12 month old males and females the RDAs for copper are 340 micrograms of copper for 1 to 3 year old males 440 micrograms of copper for 4 to 8 year old males 700 micrograms of copper for 9 to 13 year old males 890 micrograms of copper for 14 to 18 year old males and 900 micrograms of copper for males that are 19 years old and older the RDAs for copper are 340 micrograms of copper for 1 to 3 year old females 440 micrograms of copper for 4 to 8 year old females 700 micrograms of copper for 9 to 13 year old females 890 micrograms of copper for 14 to 18 year old females and 900 micrograms of copper for females that are 19 years old and older the RDAs for copper are 1000 micrograms of copper for 14 to 50 year old pregnant females furthermore 1,300 micrograms of copper for 14 to 50 year old lactating females as for safety the IOM also sets tolerable upper intake levels you ELLs for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient in the case of copper the all is set at 10 milligrams per day collectively the ears RDAs a eyes and you ELLs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes the European Food Safety Authority EFSA refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference values with population Reference intake pri instead of RDA an average requirement instead of year AI and old defined the same as in United States for women and men ages 18 and older the AIS are set at one point three and one point six milligrams per day respectively a is for pregnancy and tation is one point five milligrams per day for children ages 1 to 17 years the AI is increased with age from 0.7 to 1.3 milligrams per day these AIS are higher than the u.s. rdas the European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and said it's all at five milligrams per day which is half the US value for us food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value percent DV for copper labeling purposes 100 percent of the daily value was 2.0 milligrams but as of May 27 2016 it was revised to zero point nine milligrams to bring it into agreement with the RDA a table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at reference daily intake the original deadline to be in compliance was July 28 2018 but on September 29 2017 the FDA released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1st 2020 for large companies in January 1st 2021 for small companies topic deficiency because of its role in facilitating iron uptake copper deficiency can produce anemia like symptoms neutropenia bone abnormalities hypo pigmentation impaired growth increased incidents of infections osteoporosis hyperthyroidism and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism conversely Wilson's disease causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues severe deficiency can be found by testing for low plasma or serum copper levels low ceruloplasmin and low red blood cells superoxide dismutase levels these are not sensitive to marginal copper status the cytochrome C oxidase activity of leukocytes and platelets has been stated as another factor in deficiency but the results have not been confirmed by replication topic toxicity gram quantities of various copper salts have been taken in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans possibly due to redox cycling and the generation of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA corresponding amounts of copper salts 30 milligrams per kilogram are toxic and animals a minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits has been reported to be at least 3 ppm in the diet however higher concentrations of copper 100 ppm 200 ppm or 500 ppm in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed conversion efficiency growth rates and carcass dressing percentages chronic copper toxicity does not normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems leading to Wilson's disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis of the liver in persons who have inherited 2 defective genes elevated copper levels have also been linked to worsening symptoms of Alzheimer's disease topic human exposure in the US the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has designated a permissible exposure limit pel for copper dust and fumes in the workplace as a time-weighted average TWA of one milligram per cubic meter the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a recommended exposure limit rel of one milligram per cubic meter time weighted average the idlh immediately dangerous to life and health value as one hundred milligrams per cubic meter copper is a constituent of tobacco smoke the tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals such as copper from the surrounding soil into its leaves these are readily absorbed into the user's body following smoke inhalation the health
