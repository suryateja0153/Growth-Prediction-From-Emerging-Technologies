 The batteries that power our lives haven’t evolved much in nearly 50 years. Julia Greer and her team are changing that. Working at the nanoscale, they give new properties to old-school materials… making it possible to ditch the way we build batteries. Instead of forcing electrons to jump from particle to particle... Greer’s team is assembling micro-beams to form a highly conductive 3D highway... for power-carrying electrons. The result is a greener, safer, lighter energy pack... that charges a device in minutes and holds the juice twice as long. And that’s The Caltech Effect on Batteries.
