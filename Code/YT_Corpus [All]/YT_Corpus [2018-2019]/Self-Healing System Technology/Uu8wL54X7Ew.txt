 thank you all for coming, thank you for those of you participating via webinar this is the DIR next-generation data center services market engagement thank you for taking the time to come and hear about us today and we'll get going I'm Amy Pfluger and I am the procurement and purchasing lead at DIR that being said we're not in the procurement yet I keep saying yet any day now we'll begin writing requirements so we haven't started writing requirements yet but we want to take the time to help inform our Marketplace on some of the items that we have heard vendors say can sometimes present a barrier to doing business with the state of Texas so that's one of our goals today is to share a little bit with you today about the MSI environment that's the multi-sourcing services integrator we just awarded that contract a couple months ago and so it's new and we want to ensure information about that with you all today we will be asking some questions throughout the presentation today and giving you an opportunity to provide us feedback so hopefully you've had a chance to login I'm gonna go to the next slide where we are going to just practice Menti just a little bit here and I wanted to ask the question if you are here thinking about bidding on any of the data center services are you planning on bidding as a prime or a subcontractor we won't hold you to this this is kind of just a practice part of it too is to get to know our audience want to know who's here part of the market engagement is to help the vendors team as well we understand this is a very big undertaking and you know sometimes you might not have a portion of the services that a subcontractor might have as well and this is a chance for you to network and engage that way so we have actually it's almost even between prime, subs and not sure so maybe that's good pairing right there okay I want to introduce you to our procurement director Colleen  Berkley who will be sharing more about DIR for you okay i am Colleen Berkley i am the director of procurement services at DIR so as you can see on this mission statement slide DIR is here to provide technology leadership and solutions to all of our eligible customers we have a lot of eligible customers so i am not going to read them out to you right now but if you want more information on who can use DIR contracts you can check our website DIR.Texas.gov and under contracts and services you can click on eligibility this will take you to a page that has all of the different types of contracts DIR holds as well as information on the customers that are eligible to use those contracts and if you haven't played around with DIR's website yet there is some really great information out there that will help you as you are getting ready to prepare a bid I recommend that you bookmark the current contracting initiatives page and check there frequently to keep up with what we are doing on procurements at DIR so our philosophy DIR fosters and promotes technology leadership by providing quality service to our customers and by encouraging strategic partnerships between the public and private sectors we foster and promote technology solutions by ensuring that business needs drive technology solutions and by securing technology assets and maintaining privacy of sensitive data and information thus ensuring the public trust in our agency and finally DIR fosters and promotes value to customers by encouraging the use of managed technology infrastructure and shared services as well as delivering value to Texas citizens through the official state internet portal here we have a visual representation of the different contracts and services that DIR offers our customers you can see we have cooperative contracts which are the self-service option for agencies and other eligible customers to procure technology commodities and services that they will then manage there are also shared services technology shared technology services we've just rebranded so I apologize I'm probably going to get it wrong a few times it used to be shared services we are now shared technology services which are the contracts that DIR manages that eligible customers can opt in to use DIR establishes the contract directly with the customer and manages the vendor engagement service component providers or SCPs also contract with DIR directly working with DIR staff and the multi-sourcing services integrator or the MSI to provide contracted services Sally Ward will be up here shortly to discuss more on that one of our newest SCPs is Texas.gov this is the official website of the state of Texas and offers constituents or that is the citizens of Texas the ability to renew their vehicle registration or driver's license or order birth certificates or other records with a secured payment portal I don't want to steal too much of Sally's thunder so I'll just leave it there we also offer technology planning and policy to the state of Texas and you will see  DIR staff called over to the pink building behind us in order to to offer expert opinions on technology resources and future planning that may lead to legislative changes DIR also offers communication technology services voice data PBX etc we manage the telecommunications for the entire Capitol Complex as an example and finally we offer information security services with our chief information security officer Nancy Rainosek and her staff providing security training and conferences to other agencies' security staff as well as performing certain mandated security testing for agencies every year as you can see we have a wide variety of offerings and responsibilities in the information technology space that this question is for information purposes only and aimed at helping interaction with the audience so would you please indicate whether you currently have a DIR contract and if you don't I will let you know there's lots of opportunities please go out to the website we do update our planning phases and all the way through a procurement process so if you see something that your company is interested in you can have multiple contracts with DIR so please bear that in mind and it looks like I have a lot of opportunities to meet you all for the procurement process we have about half the audience has contracts and a little more than half does not have a contract yet so I look forward to working with you all in the future okay so here's the stuff that I know you guys are most interested in we're going to talk about the procurement schedule for the DCS or the data center services procurement right now we are in the process of wrapping up the market research phase we've already conducted several art of the possible sessions and are beginning the planning stages for the procurement we expect to begin drafting requirements in June which is a couple of days from now this will trigger the start of a blackout period between DIR and vendors this doesn't mean that we will stop hosting these market engagement sessions but once requirements drafting begins we will not be able to meet with individual vendors for example we have to follow what the Comptroller says and this is one of their definitive no individual vendor meetings during open requirements drafting so given that if you have any questions starting in June about this please don't reach out to anyone at DIR that you know or may have a relationship with all communications needs to go through Amy Pfluger her information is at the end of this slide deck she is the single point of contact and failing to follow the single point of contact rule could cause us to preclude your company from receiving a DIR contract under this DCS procurement so we do have to be very mindful of that I am reminding you now we will remind you every time we talk to you from now on so please be cognizant of that but during that timeframe we may be posting a draft RFO for comment that is your opportunity to tell us what you think of the requirements that we have put together at that point please watch the electronic state Business Daily and the DIR website for information on this we're not necessarily going to do a blast announcement but we will be using those vehicles for communicating with you all next we anticipate posting the RFO's and it might be more than one RFO  sometime this fall most likely in November to January if that changes we will be communicating to you all so don't stress if it doesn't look like something is posted on December 31st and you're starting to get anxious oh it's going to be there January 1st it may take us a little bit longer we understand how complex this is we want to make sure we're getting the requirements right finally we intend to award the contract no later than September or October of 2019 again those dates could be subject to change that's what we're aiming for we'll see what happens throughout the procurement process we will keep the timelines updated for you as we post additional information to the ESBD and DIR website and we will definitely be posting a new schedule once we post the RFO you can type in your answers in Mentimeter what barriers do you encounter when bidding on DIR procurements and this is a great opportunity for me to point out to you that this is completely anonymous I won't know who said what I can't hold it against you so let us know what barriers exist and I will use this to go back and look at our processes in order to streamline them and make it an easier process if I can so we will go back and look at what you've given us and hopefully we can address some of these in the upcoming procurements for you I can't make promises on some of these things we are mandated by the state of Texas to do some of this so market engagement that's what we're doing right now we are trying to work with you all as the market to get you more engaged in our procurement process this is one of the ways that we are hoping to remove some of the barriers that you all are experiencing in contracting with the state of Texas as part of the market the DCS market engagement DIR will conduct briefings to share non requirement related information to the vendor marketplace as appropriate these briefings will help remove barriers which the vendor community has indicated reduce their desire to take the risk of bidding on an open procurement and they are also intended to establish a common base of understanding and to promote competition in the marketplace all information disclosed during these briefings will be made available to the open marketplace via the ESBD and I'm not kidding when I tell you ESBD is going to be your best friend throughout this procurement once we start posting there you need to check regularly it is your responsibility to check regularly and catch any of the amendments that we post or addendums so that you are not behind the 8-ball when it's time to turn this in and you have seen all of the requirements change as they go through the process and finally when we enter into a contract with one or more vendors I want you to know that DIR is looking for partners we want partners that are going to work with us through the future the data center contracts will be a multi-year contract and we want to make sure that our partner will help us envision the future and also guide us there walking with us every step of the way this is a collaborative arrangement you will have requirements that you have to meet we will have requirements that we have to meet in order to make sure that we are achieving the goals of the project and as we prepare for the upcoming DCS procurement we are considering a variety of business needs our customers are ultimately any agency or entity that is eligible to use our contracts so as you can see we have limited budgets that we have to be concerned with as well as the need to do some legacy modernization there are persistent security threats we need to keep all data secure and maintain currency of all software and hardware in order to facilitate this finally as always the state is facing workforce constraints you all may not know this but all state agencies have FTE or full-time equivalent caps we cannot just keep hiring and hiring to fill those positions we really do rely on our vendor partners to help us where we cannot hire anymore because of legislation that has limited how many workers we can have per agency and we are looking to you all our partners to help us fulfill these business needs and others as we identify them okay and this is my last poll of the day before I turn it over to Sally she's going to walk us through the DCS procurement overall so could you please tell us what part of the RFO response takes the most time to prepare and again this question is for information purposes only and as a way of interacting with the audience no one's going to be held to anything oh I'm losing I bet it was going to be technical solution so you can see all parts of a solicitation are fairly complex and just from the audience poll everybody is worried about the pricing pricing pricing we do care about that as well do look in the RFO when we post we will give you an indication of where the order of priorities trying to say it right for the criteria that we establish so we will tell you where we think technical solution ranks for example in relation to pricing so bear that in mind as you're putting your presentations together as well all right I'm going to turn this over to Sally Ward she is the director of business and planning I'm sorry planning and governance with DIR alright so data center services was created as a way for the state to consolidate similar IT services among state agencies and provide a more cost-effective solution for taxpayers our data center services includes mainframe, server, network, data center facility, and bulk print mail not the printer printers just for one piece at a time but large quantity bulk mail we do deliver services in a multiple areas we have legacy data centers about 25 percent of our server compute resides in an agency's legacy data center about 74 percent well 76/75 percent roughly reside either in a public cloud or the vast majority do reside in one of our two consolidated data centers one here in Austin Texas one in San Angelo we do support most of the largest agencies in the state but we also have quite a number of small agencies where those agencies would not on their own be able to get the same types of services and technologies with their small volumes so coming on to the DCS program really is a benefit to the small agencies as well so the program is designed so that IT is taken away from a customer's worry point that a customer is then able to focus on the business needs of that agency and they're not focused on the IP that's our mission and our goal we want to provide our customers with the latest IT infrastructure technology and certainly the latest and most robust security while at the same time providing a proven tested disaster recovery strategy for server and mainframe and print mail you may have seen this slide before the circle with the little pies in them and it kind of talks about the four main areas that DIR provides services I'm just going to talk about two the top one is the cooperative contracts program and the bottom one is the shared technology services and I want to really want to talk about the difference in these two programs the cooperative contracts are more of a do-it-yourself model for customers these are pre-negotiated contracts that DIR holds with vendors for either IT goods or IT services but allows a customer to come in and design the service the SLA the pricing whatever that customer needs or wants and the customer works directly with the vendor that's on the cooperative contract to do that work Shared Technology Services is really more of a managed outsourced service and in other words it's not a do-it-yourself model this model we've already designed the pricing and the prices we've designed the service level agreement we've designed the scope of work and coming into this environment a customer chooses to share the same managed services that all the other customers are sharing within that model so they are two very different models the data center services RFP will be in the shared technology services so let's talk about what we currently have in shared services on the left are the two boxes that we will be putting out an RFO for the first is the state data center services this includes hybrid cloud so that's our on prem model as well as our public cloud models that are also integrated through our network to our data center it includes server and mainframe services our CJIS compliant community clouds that's our private cloud that's on prem for the two data centers we have self provisioning on our marketplace for all of those areas the public and the private cloud we have fully managed services as well as semi managed services so a customer can choose to what level of support they may need based on either their budget or the capabilities or constraints of their own staffing we do have a dual data center disaster recovery model where we can we are a balanced model where if one data center was to be lost the other data center will come up with the production from the lost data center and vice versa we also follow strictly an ITIL service management model so all of our language and our terms and our processes are all based on the latest version of ITIL and we do offer disaster recovery as a service for agencies that may not have compute inside of the data center but need a disaster recovery either process or backups or the actual disaster recovery itself bulk print and mail services these are going to be the secure document printing the composition laying out of compositions of documents it's going to be the service of cleansing addresses and making sure that as many addresses as possible are deliverable it is going to be the mailing of many documents in a enterprise-wide sorting facility so that all customers can get the benefit of lower postage by merging mail from other customers together there is no capital investment in hardware or software for our customers to use our print mail and we also have in our print mail is CJIS  security compliant we do have quite a number of customers who need that level of security for physically printed and physically mailed information so that's pretty much the data center services program and I'm going to go into talking about the multi-sourcing services integrator model it would be really helpful for me if I could get a sense from those of you on skype let me start and explain our shared Technology Services program model how we are structured you can see at the top is our our customer the next layer is DIR and DIR serves in the role of a sourcing and vendor management and governance over the shared technology services program the green boxes are our multi-sourcing services integrator and this integrator is the one that brings together all of the various services that we're trying to provide in a consolidated way to our customers so we want to provide the types of managed services that are jointly integrated from a customer's perspective so we want to be able to integrate all the service providers and the services that they provide while doing that in a means that provides the customer a single point of entry a single phone number to call a single website to go to so if you think of that general model then MSI is going to be the one that's integrating I'm going to go into a lot of detail about the green boxes and what those mean and what the MSI does but I want to finish off this slide by showing you the various service components that are integrated within this model so you can see data center services is first and Atos is our current service provider for server, mainframe, network and the data center facility itself and for print mail our current provider is Xerox another service component is Texas.gov which is effective in September of 2018 we have Deloitte who will be doing our Texas.gov services for the portal and the website and we have NIC Texas NIC is providing the payment services next is MAS or managed application services this is currently held by two vendors Enterprise Services holds the application development and application maintenance contract and those are to provide services application development and application maintenance solely for customers that are participating in the data center services programs that have infrastructure in the data center services program we also have a rate card option this is more of a do-it-yourself option for data center services customers to use staff resources or augment staff resources to projects that they may have and next is managed security services MSS and this is held by AT&T this is a new contract we stood up in March to provide security services for data center services customers as well as other customers all other customers in the state all right so let's break down the multi-sourcing services integrator and the reason I'm going do this is I'm trying to answer the question why would you care about an MSI if you do intend to bid on the data center services RFO what does that mean to you so our MSI provides a marketplace for our customers it is the place where the service catalog is so if you are a service provider with data center services your service catalog would be managed by the MSI it would be on the MSI Service Catalog portal it would hold those services that you would be supplying to the customer so that's something you wouldn't provide that is provided by the MSI the MSI provides in this marketplace a shopping cart experience for the customers that allows them to purchase and then track an order it allows this marketplace allows the public and private infrastructure pricing to be compared where a customer can come into the marketplace and say I want a Windows operating system and I want it this big and so forth and the marketplace tells that customer if you build it in the consolidated data centers it will cost you this if you build it in this public cloud it will cost you this and if you want to build it in this public cloud it will cost you this so a customer can make an informed choice the marketplace also automates the workflows with the customers and the service component providers if you think about how do you respond to a customer's request for a new application well the MSI provides that tool and that workflow that's automatically routed to each service component provider so the data center services provider will get a ticket that says a customer needs a certain application and certain requirements and the perhaps the managed application services provider will get a ticket that says and here's what the customer needs with the application those two are put together into one request and one solution for that customer and it's all through the tools that the MSI provides the MSI also provides a single service desk for all of our customers one number to call and that service desk then routes to the right service component provider as necessary and ensures that multiple service component providers if involved are informed and brought into an incident or a request the MSI provides a portal that allows you to collaborate with your customers so the sharing of reports the sharing of works in progress the sharing of service management manuals or processes and procedures there is a portal that the MSI provides and the service component providers them simply upload this data to that portal and the MSI also provides a public facing portal so that customers that are not current data center customers but might be interested in knowing more or becoming a data center services customer can get additional information about our services about the various service component providers and what they have to offer and then can put in a request for additional services or to be contacted and again the MSI supports that portal and routes those requests as appropriate to the service component providers and lastly the MSI provides the shared services systems and the training and the process documentation those things that give our customers confidence that our vendors are all executing to the same process to the same level of expertise and to the same quality so we've instilled that in our MSI to ensure that those processes are documented clear and available to all our customers all right the next one is service management and service management is the place where the MSI provides a digital consolidated reporting for all service level agreements so your services are picked up by the MSI's tools and the MSI will then calculate and report on service levels so that's not a task that needs to be in your scope of work or your price it also the service management allows for automated ITIL functions so anything that can be automated with the tools that the MSI has we have directed the MSI to do that so less phone calls or emails we want everything documented we want as much automation in that workflow as possible and that tool that the MSI owns is what you will use to create that automation we we want all communication to be centralized for our customer one source of record one place that it's documented and if it's not documented there it didn't happen and this is where we all benefit from change management problem management customer satisfaction all the things that need that level of detail is all in this one tool we we have digitally enabled change management we will be implementing that in September  and this is another process improvement for our service component providers and our customers to spend less time in change management review and change management meetings and work on doing the change we provide service analytic dashboards again another tool that so a component provider does not need to provide but that our MSI does provide and allows you to see the status of your services your workflows your customers view your view the enterprise view we do all of our security operations management through the MSI and through this tool and we also then task the MSI with ensuring problem management is coordinated among all of our service component providers all right IT business management this is the area where we provide program management through the MSI for a lot of the programs that we do in shared services such as technology planning or our ongoing refresh programs and these types of things we provide performance analytics through the MSI to see are we meeting our business objectives as a shared service are we meeting our business objectives as a service component provider all financial invoicing is done through the MSI so invoices from service component providers are sent to the MSI the MSI is responsible for having the tools and technology to charge that back to the many customers that we have and those customers then pay their bill to DIR and DIR then pays each of the service component providers I want to make sure that nobody missed that because this one comes up a lot your invoice you are not required to invoice customers directly either you don't have to worry about which cost customer bought which things the MSI does all of the charge back if there's any financial analytic reporting that's all done out of the MSI tools and any operational intelligence dashboards can be created out of these tools also and available to you and your staff all right operations management one of the most important things that our MSI does is to provide data quality management as you can imagine we have a lot of data data center services, application, security, print mail, we have a lot of data from a lot of tools in the environment and how do we make sure then that we have the right data the right customer assigned the right billing flag the right billing time period how do we make sure we have all the right information so our MSI provides data quality management tools and oversight and process to make sure that we can automate as much of that data collection as possible we can identify conflicting data and resolve it without human intervention and we can validate the data that we have so it this is a big function of the MSI and it resolves a lot of manual work on our service component providers' part to not have to document and key in numerous things every time you do something the configuration management database is obviously the heartbeat of data center services this is our largest database of information it feeds not only our day-to-day operations but it feeds all of our reporting and most importantly it feeds all of our charge backs and financial billing the MSI also provides a role in major incident management they do not provide staffing in regular routine incident management but for those incidents that are major as defined by ITIL which is defined by us the MSI makes sure that all the right players are engaged and that incidents are escalated if they're not resolved and that communication to the customers at all levels business technical and so forth are going on and so they provide that additional help in a major incident management they also will provide event  aggregation event data and correlation of events and they are also provides you workflow orchestration where a server can be automated and it doesn't require a manual touch from a staff member of the data center services service component provider we want to be able to do that so we connect with Enterprise Service buses we do all sorts of self provisioning and self changing self-healing as well the MSI provides all the cloud resources the public cloud resource utilization as well as billing in a real-time mode so that customers can see what they spun up what's billing to their account and keep track of that and as I've said before the MSI is really our means for ensuring that we get operations process maturity we are looking constantly beyond just repeatable we want to move up in the CMM model and the capabilities and maturity of our process and to ensure that our customers are consistently getting that quality service and that that's why the MSI provides the consistent process documentation and oversight to ensure that those things are consistently happening I didn't mention here and I probably should that the MSI is also responsible for seaking customer satisfaction and customer feedback and that's all automated as well one through a monthly customer scorecard where customers provide a scorecard of the vendors performance any vendor all vendors and the MSI is responsible for getting that data together and sending it to each service component provider so you can act on it and the MSI also provides an annual third-party customer satisfaction survey and the results of that are also provided back to you to each service component provider so that you can act on that data as well alright so in general what is a digital MSI it's basically doing all of the things that I just talked about in as digitally and automated way as possible it's the primary way that our operations interface between DIR and the SCPs occurs and it's our prime primary interface in the management of the programs that we have so integration is important for us to delivering that one view of the program that one voice from our vendors to our customers and that one phone number to call for customers all right that was your quick overview what questions might you have if you type them in I could probably answer most of them here if I couldn't or I can't then we'll take it offline and we'll answer it at another venue but is there something that I didn't address that you might have a question about who pays the MSI fee DIR pays the MSI and that those charges are allocated to all of our customers so it's a self funding model customers pay the MSI an uplift to all of their other services is this similar to a GSA buy I don't think I can answer that yeah ITSAC is part of that cooperative contracts pie piece that I talked about and we're here today all from the shared technology services side so ITSAC won't be posted as part of a shared service now I want to move on and talk a little bit about governance governance is incredibly important to the success of this program governance is what we develop in order to have shared services among multiple customers and all speak with the same voice to our vendors so when you do business with the state of Texas in the shared services model you are not doing business with 30-40 agencies you are doing business with one entity that is buying services the same way we do not customize by agency we are one service for all of those agencies so the way that we do that is we created a governance program that guides the interaction of our customer and our vendors and DIR and sets expectations for when an account decisions and roles and processes will be done our governance involves DIR and our customers of course but it also includes all service component providers and the MSI as fully participating members of governance it facilitates effective resolution of problems our governance model is not an advisory model it is not an advisory model we do not seek customer's advice on how DIR should solve a problem we seek our customers to be involved with our service component providers to solve problems so our governance meetings are all about solving problems we have some guiding principles that are pretty important we established the DIR customer business executives as the guiding leaders in setting our program strategy we've implemented a decision-making process that it's a model that aligns DIR's customer authority and accountability with consensus building we we resolve issues at the lowest level possible and we establish representative groups to solve issues and problems that could not be resolved at a lower level so we form we have formal roles and responsibilities for the strategy and issue management around DIR our customers and our service service providers and I'm going to show you the model so this is the structure and at the top you'll see the business executive Leadership Council this is the group of business executives they own the strategy of the program reporting up to the business executives is the IT Leadership Committee this is a committee of primarily IT directors some CIOs not not day-to-day operations level but more on the IT IRM levels that have both operational and financial responsibilities within their own agency and then underneath the ITLC and under the governance of the ITLC are what we call solution groups each one of these groups is created to solve problems within that area of responsibility so we have a technology group that's setting technology strategy solving technology problems service delivery a general service delivery contracts and finance GIS is a separate group which we have a separate GIS offering security and then Texas.gov DIR is a co-chair on each of these groups but it is a customer that shares each of these groups they meet monthly at least and they do form separate subcommittees if necessary if there's a topic that warrants additional and deeper information or dive or solution all of these groups use this consensus based model in a representational form to come to decision so agencies are grouped into what we call partners or partner groups and each partner group has one seat one membership on each of these groups then using consensus based decision making we all try to gain gain consensus for what is the best solution for the program and remember the service provider is a member here and is a part of this solution so what this means is we don't have a complaint desk where a customer isn't willing to also then solve the problem once a complaint has been aired it's to solve it and that's what we focus our time on is solving it if a solution group cannot reach consensus they have the option to bump it up to the ITLC the ITLC then can hear that issue and they try to come to consensus as well if the ITLC cannot come to consensus then the ITLC can bump that up to the BELC the business executive Leadership Council at that point the BELC becomes a voting membership and a decision will be made by majority of the vote what we're trying to  create here with the model that we have and then the governance structure is we're trying to enable agencies in Texas to modernize their IT that is one of our primary goals we do not want to retain the risk of legacy technology with central security risk we don't want the agencies to be unable to purchase or have access to the types of skills and capabilities and technology they need to remain current so our program is designed primarily to ensure that agencies can modernize their IT and they can keep it modern we want to be able to develop and deploy new services to our customers it is very important in the data center services program as in any technology area that we stay current with technology I'm sure you're aware that many times we've had to cut budgets and so we we've remained with technologies that have long been out of date we can't find the people to maintain them we can't find the patches to patch them we are here to provide new services continually to ensure that our customers can take the benefit of those services regardless how long of a duration contract we may go for it is our goal to ensure that we continue to get new services we want to be able to extend the reach of our shared services to all of our customers in particular those that the smaller agencies that wouldn't be able to navigate some of the new technologies or the public cloud on their own would be able to get that guidance through our shared services and we want to be able to optimize and integrate all of our IT services so that as we share our services and we share technology we lower the cost for everyone so we're optimizing but we're also integrating it to a service because our ultimate goal is that we are no longer buying a server we're not buying technology we're buying a service and we're trying we're buying technology as a service so those are our goals for the shared services program as a whole all right question this is the end of my presentation so if you have questions from anything from anything you've heard today now's the time that's a great question so what constitutes an SCP or service component provider is it by vendor is it what is it so we create service components and we may have multiple providers or one provider for multiple components so in the current model we have four service components that are contracted to Atos one service component provider to provide Atos happens to have won all four of those service components when we put them so they are the current SCP right so we we group them by service components we will put out RFOs by service component we may award one one provider multiple components or we may award only only one component per provider we don't know right now what that will look like we will not be awarding more than one provider per service component so there won't be two wait no maybe not maybe not oh that's right we might have one nevermind one service component may have multiple providers yes I don't think we'd have two vendors managing the facility okay most of this is for service and automation solutions and such how about the hardware such installing cabling CCTV IT technology upgrades and such all of that is so cabling would be within a function would be within a service component whoever would be managing the networking it may be in the networking or it may be in the data center facility or that that level is baked into the the scope of work for a larger service component upgrades is going to be the responsibility of the service component provider that will all be a part of the ongoing services that you provide so I think we've said it before we have server, mainframes, Network, bulk print mail, and data center facility are the five service components that we have today that we are going to be outsourcing again through a new procurement and they may be grouped a little differently we don't quite know yet but it'll be some form some grouping of that such but we don't expect to be putting out an RFO just for hardware installation or just for cabling that might be something that that's your expertise you might want to subcontract with someone else okay you mentioned that the MSI tools are used for automation would the DCS providers need to use the MSI tools for automation yes where you can not all of the tools will automate everything in your shop but for those things that that type of tool can automate yes we use one ITSM and we expect all the service component providers to use that same IT  service management tool we're using ServiceNow or will be as of September how do you intend to increase usage of public cloud yes we are looking for a partner to help us yeah well we'll have further requirements I think it's sufficient to say that our agencies need more than just the access to the public cloud our agencies need the expertise to help them either reconfigure to get to the cloud or to create new applications that are work well in a cloud or deciding what could or could not be in a cloud I think it's fair to say our agencies are struggling with the capability of being able to use the public cloud so we will be solving that problem in the next RFO okay what are semi managed services in the infrastructure space IT as a service kind of infrastructure server management we not mainframe but server we allow customers to choose how much management and support they need or want for their infrastructure so in a fully managed arrangement the service component provider is providing all patching and does all database management and does all of the middleware management and you know those all of the you know code deployment and so on and so on and so on in a semi managed environment some agencies have more database expertise and are working in more of a DevOps environment and so they'll hold the database management themselves rather than ask the service component provider to do so and so on and so forth and so semi managed is a reduction is services it allows the customers to actually do more hands-on work for those workloads that they need that kind of access to that workload where are the security services within DCS security will be baked into every single service component there will be security requirements for every single service component that we put out in the RFO so does that make sense as IT moves to the cloud many customers spin up and down servers regularly this cloud usage  approach does not align well to the CMDB approach to managing cloud spend do you see this changing yes the CMDB is not the source of record for billing  public cloud usage the CMDB for public cloud is for operational intelligence it is for incident management it's for a host of variety of other needs and services but it is not the source of billing for public cloud I hope that answered that question will DIR expect not to own any equipment that would be great how can we find out about subcontracting for hardware and installation from those companies who will be needing to installation services if they need it as part of their IT services so this is a generic HUB answer and it applies to all subcontracting when any vendor any prime is submitting a bid they are required to do some good-faith effort and do outreach to the community in order to make them aware of subcontracting opportunities that is really your best opportunity during that period where they are doing their teaming arrangement to find out about those opportunities DIR does not stand in the middle of those relationships it is strictly between the prime vendor and the subcontractors that they choose to use on the solicitation so watch chambers of commerce organizations there's like Hispanic business organization there's different HUB organizations that you can talk to establish yourself as a HUB or a historically underutilized business you have some time to get that done but that's really your best opportunity and know that this is coming in the marketplace now we had a HUB prime forum already market engagement so you can review those materials and see who has indicated themselves as being interested in becoming a prime and reach out to them as well it's on ESBD as one of the addendums that we have posted to the market engagement and you can go to the DIR current contracting initiatives website to see the link that will take you right to the posting and I will tell you ESBD is very finicky if you are not using the right browser you will see that DIR has nothing out there it has to be Internet Explorer like 11.0 or greater if you're using something else it may look like we have nothing out there and I will tell you we have multiple opportunities out there right now so try Chrome I think that's what they recommend but that is a comptroller issue again it's not a DIR issue I'm just giving you a little hint to help you get through it alright are  requirements gathered this is not an easy question to answer because there's a variety of ways to gather requirements if you would like a procurement 101 session I have cards and I'm happy to walk you through a generic procurement process for  DCS we have not started requirements gathering or drafting yet so I don't have an answer for this question yet there will be a variety of methods used  there will be meeting with customers there will be procurement assistance support that will be happening throughout this process there will be current requirements that we are going to use it is a variety of ways but we are really just looking to solve business needs and we will follow whatever path we need to go down to identify the business needs and find the right requirements for them I think it's fair to say we are going to be using a variety of sources and including our customers in how we develop those requirements okay just to clarify earlier it was mentioned that 25% of DCS are in legacy data centers did I get that and if so can you describe if those services are any different than the 2 DIR data centers yes 25 percent of the compute that's not in the public cloud is in a legacy data center they are remotely managed for the vast majority of those services they are remotely managed by our service component provider from one of the two consolidated data center or the service providers own facilities inside the services are not any different other than obviously the limitations of having compute that's in a remote area or in a business office that's not readily accessible to touch that would require break fix services that go out to those locations that is provided by the service component provider but they get the same fully managed semi managed services the same security the same DR the same everything it may be different pricing because it's different equipment and so forth may be different SLAs as well we have a variety of service level agreements depending on the level of support it needs the customer chooses will integration requirements with the MSI be defined in the RFO yes very much so we do have integration requirements for all our service component providers and it's in each service component provider RFO and we we will continue to do that you mentioned data centers in Austin and San Angelo are there other sites that are in scope of the MSI and DCS yes the agency's legacy data centers are in scope and agencies do have some business remote offices where there are some file servers and file systems and services provided and of course our we have two public cloud providers so their sites as well okay so we have no more questions in the queue right now so I'm going to turn it over to Amy and she is going to close us out but you can continue to submit questions and if we get them through Amy the single point of contact we will try to send answers out as well I do want to remind you though that anything we said here can be trumped will be trumped may be in the RFO so nothing real until it's written in the RFOs okay so those will overrule anything that you hear us say here today or at other events as well there's nothing to bid on right now wanted to clear that in the air as well the RFOs are expected to be out late fall I think Colleen had the timeline on the somewhere around November through January time frame so that gives you all plenty of time to start teaming with the primes and the subs so do go check the ESBD for those attendants and they'll have their indicator marked however prime oh there we go thank you for advancing my slide so the marketing engagement notice is me on the ESBD there you see the link on the screen we do ask that you check it regularly one thing to note when you want to see what we've added for attachments and the addendums you have to scroll all the way down to the bottom of the screen to see those attachments when we're done here we will put out today's slides and the attendance sheets and it takes us a little while to get to the webinar recording out because we have to add the closed captioning so do look for that that'll probably be posted in a week or so but we will try to get the slides and attendance out as soon as as practically possible for this one so you can start looking for that it's actually going to be posted on the ESBD and on on the DIR website we have a link that will take you to the ESBD so you don't have to search it that way we will also be announcing our next market engagement event using that method as well I believe we've tried to keep an email list kind of going from people who have been at the this forum and then register on the webinar or attended the last market engagement as well so we will try to you know send an email out but please do check it regularly in case it goes to your spam box there's a lot of information for vendors on the website in general if you want to know more about the DIR there's a DIR basic series webinar or slides out there that you can look at to learn more that way okay and I am the point of contact so you can email me and I will answer every question I can.
