 Andrea's the question from my side would be during the heart folk what do we do with our bitcoins where and how to store it ok during the heart for what do you do with your bitcoins where how do you store it how many people here are familiar with what the concept of a heart for kids have listen on a basic level all right ok quite a few so there is a process in Bitcoin when there is a disagreement or changing the rules whereby Bitcoin can split into two systems that operates in parallel this is unprecedented it doesn't happen on a Mayan basis anyway very often and in fact there's a lot of effort to avoid it because it could have severe monetary consequences for those who have to do it but there is always the possibility that it might happen if it does happen the ledger is replicated on both sides meaning that if you have a key that controls certain value that key will control that value on both sides because both sides will have the same ancestry right now that you may at first think well does that mean I have twice as many coins yeah it does mean you have twice as many coins but one thing I can almost guarantee you is that they're now worth half as much or less than what the single coin was before we've actually seen some of the currencies that do ponzi schemes in this space make massive announcements to rooms full of people you now have double the amount of coins look what I told you people don't understand funny what they should do is scream back you crooks inflation is terrible double the amount of coins means they're worth less than half because you've now broken your promises it's then they go yeah I have double the amounts of coins because when they were six mummy couldn't answer the question why can't we all have more money double the amounts of coins is not a good thing and it will damage the price of Bitcoin pereira lee however i think in the long run we will see that bitcoin also survives these kinds of attacks it will survive these kinds of activities and the reason it will survive is because it's designed to be a resilient self-healing anti fragile system who which does not work only when things are going ok it's a system that's designed to work when it is being attacked anyways being attacked the assumption is that it is being attacked all the time and the reason bitcoin survives this day is not because it hasn't been attacked but because it has been attacked every single day for eight years survived and improved because of these attacks and grown stronger it has a reactive immune system and this is nothing more than the network based attack and if it happens it will be resisted by the immune system and bitcoin will survive it or some mutated evolutionary outcome of bitcoin that is now resistant to that particular attack will evolve out of it either way even in this destroyed the fundamental technology of bitcoin it would give us the most valuable lesson of all which was how to build the next version to resist exactly that attack and improve on it right where to store in counter story yeah what happens to your Bitcoin if it's your Bitcoin nothing the question is is it your Bitcoin and that's how answered best by whether you control the keys right if you control the keys directly then after you could decide what to do with it I would expect a cooling-off period where people don't do too many transactions because they're waiting to see how this plays out so sit still hold tight and wait until things clarify themselves your points aren't going anywhere they're not being invalidated in any way if you have coins on an exchange and you are significantly worried about the event of a fork and you have an invest that it scares you one you've invested too much and two it would probably be a good idea to remove your money before the fork to an address that you control so that you can have that ability to decide what to do with it right now all the changes we'll be able to support both sides of the forum [Music] you
