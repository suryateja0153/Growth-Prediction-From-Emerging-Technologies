 [Music] one Explorer pushes the limits of creativity [Music] and makes the ordinary extraordinary [Music] everyday we're trying to build more and more complex things complex buildings and cars and clothing and that's harder and harder to build as time goes on [Music] Skylar Tibbits invents new ways to build things forget the factory it's time for the future we recently developed a new printing process called rapid liquid printing typically 3d printers are fairly slow you know you print objects about this size so we came up with the new process where we actually print into a tank of gel by printing in that we eliminate gravity we can just draw in 3d space with our rapid liquid printing process we can print 50 times faster than typical 3d printing we can print a beach bag in 45 minutes or we can print a lamp in tens of minutes the whole range of different materials from flexible materials to rigid materials even to concrete's [Music] Schuyler can even create ingredients that do the work on their own [Music] this piece is a lamination it's created with two rolls of material that then are combined into one single material when we shine light on it the material will then transform so you'll see that the elements open and close just by shining light onto this textile [Music] this could be used to make smarter buildings imagine a wall knowing to open itself and let in morning light we can make these materials sense their environment essentially making everyday materials into robots that includes the stuff we wear you can think about all the different types of clothing that we have like rain jackets or down jackets to make us warmer when it's cold outside we're imagining like one garment or one piece of apparel that can transform [Music] our vision is to make every material smart material we want to make textiles wood metal we want all of these traditional materials that we work with to have this programmable capability we're trying to rethink the way we design a really simple elegant way without lots of robots and electromechanical systems just simple materials that are smarter and smarter [Music]
