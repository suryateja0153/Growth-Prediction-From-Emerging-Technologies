 My name is Franklin Woods and with my today is Alexander Bryant and this past Spring 2018 semester under the direction of Dr. Tekes and the assistance of Dr. Kevin McFall Alex and I worked on this compliant mechanism test bench and so there are two different test benches that we designed test bench one was a modified piece of lab equipment and test bench two Alex and I devised of a new design and so in the first design is a slider on this side here and a fixed connection here on the right and the other set up is a slider slider configuration and so we have here is the ECP rectilinear plant model 210 this was modified in order to test both straight and U-shape beans for compliant members want to talk a little bit about the calculations thank you and so as he stated before we have a fixed side and a forced side right here and we are going to be measuring is the deflection of the actual beam itself we have two different types beams that we are going to be testing one of them is a straight beam where we are measuring the buckling and the other one is a U-shape beam and we measured it in this fashion so right here this is a plot of the deflection of the buckling beam and you can see the deflection of it versus time and this is the deflection of the U-shape beam you can tell that they are very different we where able to used image processing to measure the deflection of the beam itself and by plotting the force versus the deflection we were able to come up with some of these plots now you can see that the plots are nonlinear this is a special property of compliant members themselves this is the reason why we are doing this study to start with to really determine how these plots are graphed and so this plot right here you can see is very different from the first one and this is the actual U-shape beam itself same plot force versus displacement this research that we have done with Dr. Tekes has been entered into two different symposiums and it's also the abstract has been accepted by IMCA and so we hope to be joining that conference in the Fall next this year 2018 and so we would like to talk a little more about compliant members compliant members offered innovative solutions to engineering problems they don't have frictional components they are one uniform piece of material so they can be used in aerospace, they can be used in medical devices and so what we have here is a member that deforms a nonlinearly as Alex mentioned earlier and that can be utilized in many different fashions a pair of scissors can be designed as this type of connection and what we will do next is talk more about design two the slider slider configuration
