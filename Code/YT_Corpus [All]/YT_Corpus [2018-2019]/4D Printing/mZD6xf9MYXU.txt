 all right now we're going to be talking about design to design two features a slider slider configuration unlike the first one which was a fixed slider condition what will happen is a actuator will be applied here in order to induce motion I mean both of the sliders from both directions at the same time now these clamps they are designed to where you can test multiple in different configurations of different geometries of compliant mechanisms themselves now I'm gonna pass it over to Franklin he's gonna talk about the advantage of the line mechanism so the reasons why this research is important is because compliant mechanisms offer innovative solutions to engineering problems they reduced the amount of parts that are required for a particular device they are frictionless in theory so they don't have to be lubricated and that could be in areas or in environments that don't require much maintenance and so this project here tests the material properties and in regard to the deflection and that's the important part of compliant members that's why they're challenging to analyze because it's a direct correlation to how the data is captured and so this device and the design one device have both been accepted to the NCUR 2018 conference and then the KSU Symposium and a IMICA the abstract for this project was approved and we're hoping to join the conference in 2018 in the fall to actually present on a research
