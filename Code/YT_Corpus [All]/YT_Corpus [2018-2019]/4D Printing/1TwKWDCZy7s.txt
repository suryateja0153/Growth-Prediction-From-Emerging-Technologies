 In today's industrial world,  things are always moving faster and faster. If you could adapt your business model as rapidly as your customers' needs are changing... Wouldn't it be valuable to you? At Latécoère, we decided to embrace the future. We built 2 new factories: a real one...and its Delmia digital twin. Thank you! Experiencing the virtual model of my plant and all of its equipments, I now fully understand what my new factory will look like so I can reshape it on purpose. You know, I think I'll need some more space here  for my next generation production line. Perfect! Sometimes, it's good to take a step back... ...and get the big picture to better orchestrate  and balance production flow. I was just thinking, wouldn't it be better  if I put this machine... there? Yes it is! Powerful isn't it? But all of this would be useless if not applied to the real world of production. My factory functions exactly the way I modeled  and simulated it in virtual. The point is all customers are the same: highly demanding and fast-changing. The beauty of the 3D experience digital twin lies in its ability to explore possible future arises. Whether I am introducing a new product, or looking for greater efficiencies, leveraging the 3D experience platform and Delmia, we have created a foundation to prepare for the factories of tomorrow. We're ready for the future... for you.
