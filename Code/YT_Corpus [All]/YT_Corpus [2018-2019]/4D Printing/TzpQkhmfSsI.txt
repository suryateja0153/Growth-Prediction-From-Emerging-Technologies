 [Music] ESCA toid Zahra geometrical shape that we have discover that actually is useful if you want because we found that selfs apathy Leah sells sparked together following this particular shape codex has been there forever is like number pi if you want so pi was there before even math was cemented my humankind everything began with with Liz melisma is the the other corresponding author of the paper and he was interested in understanding these 3d packing of cells and then they saw that something is we are here because in the computer models that we have the saves or the packing that we were reading were not the kind of shapes and packing that most people described before and the kind of topologies that we were seen were not compatible with that so we that began a very interesting problem because mathematicians were involved in trying to define what we were seeing because the prediction of the computer were not providing at the beginning the whole set but just some properties about it so am I in that you have a prism where you have from the top six Isis and on the bottom you have another six and you have all these sages that are connecting the vertices so if you imagine done in one of those edges you have a zipper and you pull up the zipper up to the middle say and you four fold the flaps and you're actually going to create an a small triangle when like if you are actually opening a again or something like an sq toy this is not really a shape by the family of sex it is actually the way they are built by decreasing one by one one of the polygons that is actually forming the same all of those will give you an honest good rate we never ever thought that this could have this rapper Christina ladies and gentlemen may I present the school toy the toy scooter we knew that it was something important and we believed that this could be relevance and cooperation in via our colleagues but what we didn't expect was actually having this repercussion in in in popular culture besides that fundamental discovery the implications we believed are going to be huge we have so many ideas so many things that we can do at this point we are working in trying to understand better all these concepts about forces and energies trying to understand if we are seeing differences in the way cells are actually packing why does that actually happen
