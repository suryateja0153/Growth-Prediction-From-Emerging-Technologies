 second presentation this morning I would like to introduce you an amazing extraordinary story idea from the Philippines made a big leap some 10 plus years ago into new technologies and ever since they've experienced an extraordinary growth trajectory let me invite on stage the owner and CEO of the company tolentino jr. Jojo so Jojo please stun us with your amazing story thank you thank you after good morning everyone and before I start I just want to do a quick survey how many in the group are architects or consultants could you please raise your hand so it looks like we have more than I would say 70% Architects and I guess the rest are contractors engineers and other related industry so my name is Joe Joe talentino I my presentation today is really our journey on BIM I hope you can find some things that we've done interesting especially for architects I've know I know that transition to BM is not easy and we had their own share of difficulties and also successes in BIM so first of all I come from the Philippines our company name is idea we started as an architectural practice more than 23 years ago and we've always seen ourselves as an integrated firm when we started the way we thought about integration it's really about integrating our design disciplines we initially had architecture and interior design that we had planning and branding and we said that as a firm we will always try to integrate our four disciplines but later on when we came across BIM we realized that integration should not only happen in design but integration should also happen with technology and then we realized that bhim or on the bigger scale virtual design and construction could be our platform for integrated design a bit of a story about our company we started in 1995 and we our company was caught in the 1997 Asian crisis and we started really small 14 people small dumped somewhere in Manila and in 2001 because we were very aggressively marketing the company and doing good design we were able to create a sizable client base because of you know the design work we did and in 2003 we change ownership of the company you had the opportunity to purchase and rename the company's idea and from then on we started to grow the company but what we realized is that as we were growing we were incurred encountering many issues the issues on productivity issues on quality issues on how can we become more competitive and how can we create competitive advantage for our firm and then in 2005 we said one of the things we should do is invest in new technologies and after talking with people I came across BIM for the first time it was really having a coffee break with a friend in Singapore and he said you know before you do anything can you look at this technology because I came across this in in Europe and this might be something that idea could you know could capitalize and could become a competitive advantage and of course I was very young then so envious foolish I said yes why don't we do that and we said ok let's do the big shift and we did our shift in four stages of course which I'll chose a software which was between the two leading BIM software and went with ArchiCAD we thought archicad had the best solution for our service and on our phase 2 we said ok let's prepare our difficulty then is we were preparing in an environment where there was no expert in our market so we thought archicad or beam was like AutoCAD for as long as you can hand draft you can you can draw you know I can transition to BIM what what we realized is the biggest challenge of BIM is not the hardware it's not the software but it's really people and people's mindset our biggest attractors are people who are very good in AutoCAD because they were finding the functionality of AutoCAD in BIM which was as you know very difficult and half of our office was against a transition half were bold enough to say let's try it and to solve the problem what we decided is we will choose a day on this day we will take out all of our AutoCAD licenses or for better for worse we'll move the bin and that they came and of course as expected it was chaos I was conveniently in Hong Kong when the transition not by choice it I just happened to have a business there and I've been getting text messages phone call saying this is difficult I'm going to miss a deadline you you know you have to allow us to go back to you know to 2d because you know it's not going to work but what we said this we will commit to BIM if you need to remodel everything go and stay to overnights remodel so that we can deliver in BIM and our reason for that is if we give people exemptions to go back to AutoCAD everybody will ask for an exemption and before we know it the transition program will not be successful and so for about six months our productivity productivity was really low at the slowest forty percent and we had to bear all of that and what we realize is on before the six-month we were as productive as AutoCAD and after the six months were slowly gaining productivity because of BIM and then the phase four we need to share knowledge but the way we knowledge is we just use word-of-mouth which wasn't the right way of doing it and we've made all the mistakes every mistake you can imagine from as simple as how to print we have print manager during the time with a separate from the mall delaying the settings were wrong we almost miss deadlines so we've learned from our mistakes and what we realize is learning modeling is not enough we need to restructure the firm so that our BIM program will be more effective so I'm not going to go into the details we after one year came up with what we call level of strategies and what did we do first of all the question of B manager we had one big manager servicing a hundred plus people it's not working we have seven design studios and we said okay let's assign one B manager per studio and that worked because that gave immediate response and it also allow us to identify real day issues within all of our studios second believe it or not we started without a B manual and again we thought it was like AutoCAD you know we were naive enough to thought think that way and through a research through trial and error to learning from mistakes we wrote our own B manual and that's a beam that's a document that evolved through time and that's still a growing document we populate it we benchmark so there so that it is in line with the current thinking then we we did the difficult task of removing anything that is not BIM including the architects favorite software called Sketchup Sketchup was a big struggle for us because many of our architects are so used to it and so they're saying beam is not Sketchup and we asked ourselves how do we solve an issue of changing Sketchup and offering than something better and what you realize is just a matter of settings that we can come up with settings that are better or at least equal than Sketchup and that solve the problem our learning system became digital we have a digital library so what we made sure is that the knowledge is not retained in a person but it's retained in a system so every time we hire new people we train them for two weeks and one the first thing they do is go to the our setup in our digital library and that's all our learning problem it was institutionalize then our HR system also got involved we made sure that all year round with the trainings we brought experts from Hungary from Singapore from all the leading BIM experts so that we have we acquired the current thinking we have a partnership with Graphisoft we're one of the beta testers in some of the updates and so that worked for us and the investment wise what did we invest for being transition manpower training hardware upgrade software and also the acceptance that during the transition we will be less efficient now what did we in the next two years what are the competencies we developed of course from the basic means of application of making the asite analysis digital we use BIM for energy analysis when we start BIM at a project we use a software called affinity for our design programming and we're still using it now and we also because BIM is not known in the Philippines we offer them the opportunity of modeling engineering drawings integrating in our system so that it becomes a full BIM model we talk about sustainability we also explored software's and applied so first that that is analyzed of sustainability and we went as far as doing structural modeling we use Tecla for this and we use mep the beams mep modeler for our a in the integration and then we also came across a library in that two years so so Libra became a very big help for us in our quality assurance system up to now our QA system is heavily embedded in Sallee Bri when it comes to clash attraction to code checking we wrote codes for not only our country but even for our code for other countries and we were being asked to analyze code compliance for projects overseas now the result of that in two years you know we realized that we saved a lot especially on production time concepts schematic we spent more because we had to setup the design and the beam so that it's correct but as we go to the production stage there were significant savings then when we benchmark a typical high res project this is what we normally do we were saving at least 40% of our manpower because of the efficiency of BIM and when we look at their growth directory as a firm we've been doing more work but the trajectory of our staff buildup is significantly less if you look at the curb so for from any point of view a technology helped us grow the company and what we really wanted is to spend more time designing do the fun stuff and I'm not saying that production work is not fun but you know making the production work more efficient because you know I'm sure for architects you realize at least 60% of our fees are burned in production work so normally what happens is you save enough money for production which means that you have to allocate less time for design and what we want to do is reverse it and so by 2007 we achieve our efficiency goals and we went on and what we said this this time we want to integrate we are looking at other technologies which will allow us not only to create the fourth discipline that we initially offered but to also offer technology and technology development as a part of our offering so whenever we do projects first thing we asked is how can we apply technology to make this a better design and to make it more efficient the other thing we realize is because of technology we now have the opportunity to service clients that only in mainstream design but also on the front end the pre design and the post end which is the you know the post construction process in service ie facilities management and building evaluation and that created another big income stream for us and became an opportunity for us to the expanded services so what were those things a lot of design new contractors called us and said we'd like you to do LOD 400 modeling for us all our details are quantifiable 3d based we got rid of our 2d library converted it to 3d to make sure that everything is quantifiable design-build companies like that because they want to have a handle of cost and procurement early in the in the project stage which is what we did for them and facilities manager also asked us to do update BIM has built being as they call it we do five hundred so that they can better manage their facilities and with we also we we also had the opportunity of providing any integration not only for our projects but for very complex projects overseas or other consultants and contractors AE integration probably represents 15% additional income for the company and just to benchmark how our competencies compare with the rest of the world we also participated in BIM competitions in in two years so from Build Qatar live and in Singapore bimba's and also build London LIBOR we won the Pat price for this beam competition and also for local competitions this is the Qatar embassy headquarters that we presented the Qatar embassy that one asked the and then from there we we also looked at new technologies we said this is the time for us to collaborate globally since we now have the infrastructure and so most of our overseas project now are hosted through our servers but open to our partners overseas through the BIM server problem collab and recently bimcloud our mobile collaboration also extended was also established to be Mac's many for clients appreciate the use of BIM X because they can have their projects on-demand anywhere from concept all the way to construction phase so we created a system where the model is updated regularly so everyone gets the latest version of the project every time BMX is a great tool beam for none BIM people this is great and they appreciate that also for many of our projects it went far as digital fabrication where our beam models are given to fabricators they take and manufacture out of the BIM model and cost estimation which is a reality in any commercial project became very important we always said the fourth dimension of the project is something that has to be started up front so working with qsr firms we work on cost estimation application so that when we design we know how much it costs and the client makes informed decisions every time they authorize the project okay so asset management is another area that we have ventured and also point-cloud uses utilization we're now doing a lot of this in Scandinavia together with our partner where a lot of these old buildings are being remote remodeled are being documented in 3d through point cloud and we're now developing a an add-on where the point cloud modeling becomes automated I will show you some of those applications later then in 2014 we said ok let's go again to the next stage of development which is what we call strategic and and this is the face where we said we asked ourselves how can we make the process or the workflow more efficient and we realized that we shouldn't stop with architecture we should venture into programming so we created an in-house software development team the objective is to ask ourselves which of our process can we automate so that we can spend less time producing and more time designing and also make projects profitable so one of the things we created here architects will appreciate this is whenever we design we created an add-on that automatically gives you planning data from things like areas efficiency ratios these are important because developers always look at these numbers so this is done as we design as we do the blocking then we said let's do much bigger why don't we automate the whole construction documentation process so in 3 years we developed this add-on where it creates this construction documentation automatically from a very detailed model and what used to be a six month job became a one month job for us including keyway so this is just a faster version and actually takes a day to generate this from a detailed model but it creates the whole documentation package automatically including dimensions tags so architects can do what we love to do most which is the creative part okay so so we will release our final version this year of this and part of that is we said let's automate anything that has to do with scheduling so finishing schedule which no one wants to do it's all automated again using the very detailed beam software and that's why to us modeling is very important we are very very strict in terms of modeling compliance we cannot accept even one percent wrong modeling because everything all data comes from the model door schedule is the same it all comes from a detailed model so from there you click the view selection selection and it will automatically format update and set the door schedule in on your sheet then windows and curtain wall another big opportunity to automate so what what we like about this is we know this is correct because it's all coordinated and it's all updated income from the model our biggest challenge when we did this is how to create a program that will follow the right dimensioning in the right tagging in a labeling convention and this took us a year but we went you know we there and also there are our latest programming is really a linking specification to the model so now when you put a material in the model it automatically triggers the system to look for the specification section and when the model is completed you do it click this application and it automatically it automatically binds all the related specification closest into one document which is coordinated with the model so again that's why models have to be very correct otherwise the specifications will be wrong but you know the output is something like this which is something that you just bind print and submit as part of the contract documents and of course as I said quantities are important in every stage of the project the quantity surveyor has a set different template on how they may cost we followed that template set it up in your system so that at every stage of the project they get quantities as needed they can get it by the hour if they want you know using this software ok so what was the reason why we did that if you look at the top part in conventional design we spent months documenting currently with their automation we took out the design development part and we shortened the construction drawings but still you see it's about two months work by the end of the year our objective is to have very little time spent on construction drawings practically it's just generating a drawings and doing the quality assurance and spend more time doing the fun stuff ok user experience is also important for us because we have to sell the design and I have to say despite having digital technology clients still want to feel touch the space want to make sure that they really understand what the space is and so we are very happy now on 3d printing 3d modeling we use a lot of drone technology to get put context and put it in digital form and four years ago we also please establish a company that ventured into virtual reality so we have a VR facility in our office in Manila that's the first in Asia where we bring clients and let them experience the project from an ArchiCAD model we render it put it in this technology and they experience that one-to-one scale in our office the other nice thing about this is it allows us to collaborate virtually because this technology also can be linked to any VR facility similar vir facility in the world and so when we talk design we don't have to be there physically we can collaborate digitally we can even use out an app in the cell phone hoping the Google lens so that you can co-create anywhere in the world and one of the cool things and what client really liked is the idea of gamifying the project so one of the things we do with some of our clients is to put the project in a game environment fully controlled downloadable in their smartphone or their computers we they can earn points so they a tidy logo or points but it really allows them to explore the project in human scale and you know we're thinking of putting two avatars competing against each other or avatars driving a car if it's a big project or using the bike and they like this because first of all it's fun and second it's fully user controlled and it can be used anywhere so these are some of the early applications of gamification which i think is a big opportunity for design we're doing a couple of casino projects our client is asking us to gamify their casino and link it to the actual gaming hall so that people can virtually play anywhere and using what is really happening on the Play table so we're looking at that application as well but this is quite quite interesting tells you how deep the pool is so you won't drown okay so what is the impact of integration interval in our business because of technology and integration we were able to invite other partners to join our global design group which we call a plus and because of technology were able to collaborate so from one firm base in Manila we now have a network of designers from 60 locations involved in 4700 professionals collectively the firm's one 400 Awards and this created a big spread in a big network for the group we're still looking for partners if there ain't something interested especially in Europe and in Africa we'd like to create a truly global network but we'd like to invite firms that are like-minded and also firms who accept the fact that we're going to work virtually financial growth is the same because of the efficiency and because of the spread that we were able to create we're able to create more business for the firm exponentially and even our world rankings increased when we started in onine we were number 86 in the world now we're currently number 47 in the world architecture rankings because of the amount of work and the amount of people that we were able to involve in the revenues that we created out of our practice so looking ahead what are the things we'd like to venture into we'd like to do more automation we'd like to collaborate not only with designers but with stakeholders in the building industry and we'd like to ask them how can we help them make their work better through automation using our models our design as the platform we'd like to virtually co-create this is the this is the objective of the A+ group we'd like virtual we'd like to do virtual co-creation it's like crowdsourcing we don't need to be physically they're face-to-face for us to collaborate and with technology we have the ability to do that through VR through beam collab through through bimcloud and then what we also did is I just mentioned the yesterday which some of the group we also want to do programming computational design and for us to move faster we adapted a school north of Manila that offers both architecture and computer science and the ideas for us to merge programming with architecture develop into a big capability that can not only service us but service other members of the construction industry globally now all this application people ask me where's the fun stuff the fun stuff is design and what we what I always tell them is we'd like to do more design but for us to be able to design more we have to take care of the backend first the part that burns our fees because if we work an optimized you can spend more time designing and with digital technology with BIM we're able to do three things in the office first of all we're able to create a design process that is truly aligned to design thinking we do a lot of research a lot of empathy mapping talk to people we also did not get rid of our low-tech processes we still cut foam boards we still do models we still work with play but after that we were able to merge it with technology with VR so that we can come up with a product that we believe is superior and the rest is that we were able to integrate everything that the A+ group has to offer from the branding side to the storytelling to the design interiors and through costing and everything that is there really that in the end-to-end process of a building like cycle so what I'm going to show you is an example of how we applied it on the front end this is a project this is the our competition entry to the new Senate Philippine Senate building recently completed and this is a short film clip on how we were able to merge low tech high tech into something the project is an interesting project where we're designing something that would possibly be the hold of the seller for the next 100 years since this is an institution that represents us as a nation it should also embody the uniqueness of the Filipino we ran a survey nationwide to engage the people to co-create the new home of the Senate we were surprised with the responses we got the Senate is supposed to be a chamber imbued with gravitas and the national perspective we would like to have a making security in the design it should be capable of embracing the people my mother was a DA I know the building transparency they want a new home of the Senate to be welcoming to represent honor and dignity that will leave a better environment for future generations the next step for us is to think for metaphor what will best represent welcoming honor and dignity and sustainability in a form that is uniquely Filipino if you look at the seal of the Senate the bridge there the flower will represent somebody time and that represents honor and dignity the most elegant where you're translating sampaguita to art is through the week I have my favorite but of embroiderer I realized that they could be micro creators so what we did is we invited them from Laguna they stayed and work closely with our designers and the develop patterns and symbolism that best represent in the braided sampaguita we mapped that in our basic building mass and projected it in virtual reality we were able to create both the formal and informal side the form of the building which you can see is a bundle - sampaguita our design has considered a very smart way of facing the project so that we saved more than a one and a half billion pesos in capital expense the mechanical systems that we are introducing considers not only the capital expense side but also how we will operate the building in the next 100 years because that has a bigger impact in sustainability there is a message that we'd like the architecture to convene like the Brayton buy Sampaguita we have to work as a nation each one the senators the people working hand by hand being bound by one string and that string is our aspiration for a better country [Music] thank you thank you Thank You Georgia Thank You Jojo thank you you managed to stun us I guess
