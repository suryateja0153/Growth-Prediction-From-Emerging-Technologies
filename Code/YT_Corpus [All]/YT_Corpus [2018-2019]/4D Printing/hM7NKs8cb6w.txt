 Hello everyone I'm a research assistant here at Kennesaw State University working with Dr. Ayse Tekes and this is our 2 degree of freedom vibrational system. So, we have two fixed points here and those are connected by two compliant mechanism springs, connected to a primary mass, and then two more connect our secondary mass. So, you can see that they move independently of each other and for our experiment here we're gonna use a linear actuator to force a frequency. And we're gonna use these two displacement sensors to measure the displacements of these and look at the data and see what happens. So, this is what it looks like when it's running. So, as you can see we're at pretty low frequencies right now and they're moving together. So, then as we start to increase the frequency you can see that this one is starting to vibrate a little more than the primary mass. And then now, you can see that the primary mass is barely moving and the secondary mass is moving even more. So, we're in the range of displacement amplification here. So, as we increase the frequency even more you can see that the amplification dies down and it starts to isolate. And even though the primary mass is moving there is little to no movement for the secondary mass. So, now we're in the range of vibration isolation. This is our system and this is what we're working on right now, thank you.
