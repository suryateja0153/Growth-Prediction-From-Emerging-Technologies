 hello everybody Bonjour - mom said video but at home ugly dog seems everyone that had to be omelette hopefully only text to see this this time I created a pattern inspired by the skills of the bush Viper I still do not master very well the sculpt function with fusion 360 so I design my scale in the model workspace instead of the skull workspace which means that I have not managed to round some area with the philip mode but since the print is really small the straight line do not seems to be so straight also this is only a first attempt for this pattern so I will probably improve it and make it available online if you like it do not is it a li to let me know thank you for following
