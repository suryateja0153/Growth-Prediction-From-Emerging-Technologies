 recording right now yeah how many I do what it does like in the news wait I didn't get that I'm John DiStefano and I'm Glenn I'm jr. and we're fun King 3d all right tell us your story we're a father-and-son team who does 3d printing and electronic projects I spend more and more 3d printing and less and less electronic projects lately but our goal is to not only learn but then to reteach what we learned and establish a way for parents and kids whether it's a father and son a mother and son a mother and daughter a father and daughter to interact with each other in the world of making Zander and I him growing up as a wee little lad we had a good relationship building the house to the point where like he actually helped me pull all the wire for the house and then as he grew a little older he decided he hated what he calls working stores which being a home do Pond and so all of a sudden he was all about the video games and I was still in the making and community printing finally gave us something that we had in common okay it wasn't really the 3d printing it's the YouTube channel that did it all so but it is nice to have something to have in common hurry for you all right I'm here with a I'm sure he's got some awesome stuff he's gonna talk about hello so one of the things that I've been doing is I've been working on embedding materials into 3d prints via the means of printing hope for a little while pausing the friend and then putting in either fabric or in this case of metal rings so I can create on things like a movable mesh where the actual pin structure is actually very strong so the thing that I am working on is getting to a point where things like having the Rings or having the fabric becomes an automated process so that we are actually making full products at the end not just the parts of products okay so these are dragon skills and the thing that I can do with this is I can get the exact placement of all the scales in there that I couldn't do by hand because I don't have the dexterity required to do this but since I have since I have the 3d printer I can get that placement exactly where I want to the first time so we've seen a lot of things in 3d printing but I'd say got to say that this is one of the most remarkable things I've seen because we're now taking cosplay to the next level and he's even done it you don't have it here do it with LEDs no he's even done it now where he has areas that are hollowed out to allow placement of a specific size LED to light it up so it's a really cool stuff you're right on the cutting edge David and I think you're enabling your concept that's open right yeah your concept is open so which means that if you're not familiar with open concept this is allowing others to do awesome work but it could be considered more awesomer instead of work yeah because they get to build upon there's there's things that David may not have thought of themselves that other people are now going to use that as an opportunity to create the next level thing so this is really awesome for constantly people all right thanks for watching you do it and thank you David for helping out what up brother how do you see your efforts helping other thank you have you noticed anybody yeah yeah that's actually why I wanted to become a maker says all in her hood hi my name is Becky button and I've been a maker ever since I saw my first 3d printer when I was in the fourth grade now seven years later I'm still making what inspired me to become a sorry what inspired me to become a maker was the ability for the technology to significantly impact the lives of others especially in the assistive technology so relating inspect here putting apart your question how have I seen making my my projects impact the lives of others one of the best examples I have this is I did a hackathon where I met a woman with COPD the condition paused for every time she changed inclined to change the rate of oxygen going to her oxygen mass from her most called a portable oxygen concentrator so I made a device that made it so that she could manipulate the buttons remotely and this significantly improved the quality of life for her she was able to go about things without getting so inebriated from manipulating the machine because every time she had that she went and changed the incline she would have to take me taking it off the process of taking off the machine from her back actually caused her to become women so that's how I that's how that's why I wanted to become a maker and that's how making is touchdown when you do thanks for watching and thank you Becky this is John what do you do it and we have Chris with venturi 3d so basically this is our new printer that we're going to Kickstarter probably on July 10th basically it is a fully enclosed multi material multicolor has four spools a filament so it can do four colors are four materials it's designed to be very consumer friendly so basically what we're doing with this is we are pre slicing over a thousand models they're going to be pre-installed we're using the best slicing programs to do that such as Sakura slicer or subtree our idea maker and then when the consumer sees this they will have a touchscreen they can view the model choose what filament color or filaments they want to use press print and then it does the rest this is also open source so you can use any other foments any other slicers you want however if you do use a our partner slicing studio partner filaments we have a QR code on the front use the camera right here scan the QR code and then it updates the color temperature and any other settings and updates the g-code on the fly because we use a SQL database and we're going to do all that so basically we are going to be kick-starting this for earlybird of $999 and the regular retail price will be about $1299 and you can find out more information at venturi3d.com we're also on Twitter up in true 3d Instagram and YouTube have insurance reading
