   [music]   The size of Moisson Montréal reflects the size of the food waste situation. Because as a food bank, Moisson Montréal does not buy any food. On last year, we've given $86 million of food to the community agencies all across the island. And all that food was given to us. It was food that was recovered, if I can say so, from the retailer, from the grocer, from the distributor, all through the food chain. Last year, we were given almost 100,000 hours of volunteer work, and all that was done by roughly 10,000 people. So, the trick is, how could we get closer to those people? How could we better know them? So, essentially, the application that is being developed will help us gather all that precious information on donors, and better predict when they're going to come, and better manage the scheduling of all those people, because as you may suspect, it's not always that easy and obvious to accommodate 200 person on a daily basis. At the end of the day, if we accept volunteers on a daily basis, and they come here and they don't do something significant, they will go home, and talk very negatively about Moisson Montréal. They will never come back. And we just cannot afford that. So, it's not just a matter of accepting the people to come here, it's a matter of making sure that they're going to have a significant day, they're going to understand. They're going to appreciate what they do for us, what they do for the people in need, the people that are less lucky than us. And then, we can move on and wish for better participation, if I can say so.   [music]
