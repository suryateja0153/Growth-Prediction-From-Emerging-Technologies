 Now I'm interacting with the elements of Oil Refinery in VR. My task is to repair the generator in this location. The 3D model simulates in the smallest details the oil refinery. Dozens of buildings and facilities, hundreds of production plants and all networks of the refinery are placed In the virtual space within the area of 360 m². It would take more than a year for an employee to explore all these objects in reality. VR simulator can make this process faster. This training is obligatory for all employees. To visit the factory you just need to wear a 3D helmet. Training helps to develop skills necessary for safe operation and prepare staff for emergency situations. When you train using a digital twin, you actually work in VR at that enterprise you will work in reality. You will use the same equipment at the same location. UNIGINE’s product not only provides a highly detailed simulation of the appearance of your enterprise. Integration with an information system enables you to check current pressure in the pipe or the products you have in stock by simply pointing to an object with your joystick. You can observe processes at the plant from a bird's eye view (with all telemetry data and statistics at hand) and go down to the ground to monitor some small processes and interact with objects. You literally can move around the plant in VR observing all the processes taking place there, and take part in them.  The 3D-model enables you o monitor and control construction of the enterprise at each stage: from ground works to putting into operation. Which makes the process of of making changes at any stage easier. Using a digital twin also helps to reduce travel expenses. A lot of companies are interested in UNIGINE’s development. In the middle of April virtual factory will be presented at the International Oil and Gas Exhibition in Moscow.
