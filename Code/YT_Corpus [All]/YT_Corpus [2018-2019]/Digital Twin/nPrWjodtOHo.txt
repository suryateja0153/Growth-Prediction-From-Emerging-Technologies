 [Music] so in the future we think there's going to be a situation where individual parts manufacturers or people who developed engines will develop their models and then contribute them to the automobile maker and that will so all these parts will be brought together into the integrated model or the digital twin but the question is who really owns these models will the component manufacturer want to just turn over their valuable IP of a model to the car manufacturer those are really open questions and there are some approaches that are being thought about one of those for example is in one of those approaches for example is the use of block chains and in this kind of scenario rather than turning over your model you would still retain your model but every time that car needed to access your model it would be kind of a micro transaction and in that micro transaction you would be basically paying for information that comes from that model rather than the component manufacturer actually turning that model over to the car manufacturer so in today's world the business portfolio of an industry consists of the different product technologies let's say that they produce they manufacture they sell to others but in the future there's going to be an inversion where that portfolio will consist of the models themselves rather than the products in the world of digital twins what's valuable will be those digital twin models rather than the hardware products themselves and so the portfolio will will reflect that we're business portfolios consist of models rather than business portfolios consisting of individual products so one of the research projects I have going on in my research group is called interactive model centric systems engineer there's a lot of effort that's been putting into looking at how we do engineering that's model-based and much of this work has to do with things like modeling language or tool sense that one can use or appropriate practices for how to construct a model and maintain a model however there's really been very little that's looked at in terms of how humans interact with these models and what are some of the implications and as we move to this world of digital twins where models are going to be the prominent thing it accentuates this need to understand the relationship between the humans and the models under this project one of the things that I've had going on is an empirical research study an interview based study with experts in the field of models and in this study we've been looking at what are the factors that are involved in model-based decision-making and not surprisingly trust turns out to be a critical issue here you could have the best models in the world that operate in a superb way but if people don't actually trust these models the information is not going to get used in the research we've been doing we've certainly found that there's this preference at least in modern-day for human knowledge over say encoded human knowledge as models represent some of the engineers working on the project want total transparency in a model they want to go see into the code so to speak a senior decision-makers certainly wants their models to be transparent to those who need to find all the information that's in the model however they themselves don't need it so the question is how do we create these type of modeling environments so the individuals who need to go deep down into detail can get what they need and at the same time you could sit and say a senior decision-maker in front of a screen and they could actually interact with the model to get meaningful information without them having to know how to operate modeling language without having to operate modeling tool sets so we found an interesting behavior when we did this study and that was that there seems to be a pattern that involves three individuals in making model based decisions they're the modelers themselves there is the ultimate decision maker and then in between those two is what we call the through person so senior decision makers have high-level technical people that they trust and it's really those individuals then that are talking with the modelers and getting the information they need and passing this through so the question comes about with what happens when we start collapsing that and you can sit down and interact with a model based environment we've kind of got we've kind of eliminated that through person who can sometimes act as the the check and balance person that can point out things like biases oh well you're really anchored in your opinion on this so we're really studying what what can we do to create a more effective human model interaction
