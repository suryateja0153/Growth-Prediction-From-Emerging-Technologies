 Hi everyone, Maria Wilson here, global leader for data-driven advantage (DDA) in Howden. Welcome to our third DDA vlog. I'd like to start by thanking everyone who took the time to watch, comment and share our first two vlogs. We are reassured by your feedback and we're more committed than ever to provide exciting content, on a regular basis, about this exciting journey that the digital transformation in Howden is turning out to be. For our third vlog today, I'm going to talk about a couple of very exciting events that we're going to be involved in throughout October. If your world revolves around water applications then come and see us at WEFTEC. WEFTEC is the world's largest annual water quality conference and exhibition. It's a great platform for learning experiences but also it's a platform for getting to know cutting-edge technologies in this space. Howden are leading the way in wastewater applications with a concept we call smart aeration, this is a unique approach to dealing with the largest energy consumer in all waste water plants which is the aeration process. Our solution is a unique combination of OEM expertise, that's based on the largest installed base of rotating equipment and wastewater applications, but also unique mixed reality experiences rendered through mobile devices and Microsoft hololens which are really transforming the customer experience of owning Howden equipment in wastewater treatment plants. Our highly differentiated digital twin models are at the heart of our solution and they enable the performance optimisation of the rotating equipment in the aeration process. If you want to learn more about the Howden digital advantage in wastewater applications then come and see us at WEFTEC, we'll be there from October 1st to October 3rd. If you are a player in the industrial refrigeration worlds you will no doubt know of the largest exhibition in this space that takes place every two years in Nuremberg, Germany. Howden has been an exhibitor at Chillventa for decades and this year will be no exception. Come and see us and give us an opportunity to talk to you about a unique digital solution that coupled with our reliable screw compressors will transform the way you operate your rotating equipment in industrial refrigeration applications. We will talk to you about the power of our digital solution that enables data capture from our screw compressors. We will talk about highly differentiated machine learning algorithms that enable truly predictive maintenance strategies in your plant and we'll also talk about our Howden digital twin model that enables the calculation of the best efficiency point of your equipment in real time enabling performance optimization of your equipment. If you want to know more about the Howden digital advantage in industrial refrigeration applications then come and see us at Chillventa, we'll be there from October 16th to October 18th. Finally I'm really excited to tell you about our white paper on the digitalization trends in air and gas handling applications if you want to read about our take on this global digitalization trend and also where we think the technology trends are going to go next then log on to our web page on Howden digital solutions and download a free copy. This is it for our 3rd vlog thanks very much for watching this is Maria Wilson from the DDA team in Howden, keep watching.
