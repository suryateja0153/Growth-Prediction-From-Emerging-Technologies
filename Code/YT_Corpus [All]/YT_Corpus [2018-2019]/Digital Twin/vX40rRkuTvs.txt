 to take advantage of the price with the five flex and the free shipping and that's shipping on that thing it is a doozy so take advantage of that for sure okay so do you love the taste of fried food like who doesn't I crave fried food but then you have that horrible guilt well imagine if you could get the taste of fried with none of the guilt and that is our this day only and we're jumping right into it oh there we go I thought I had a little duty we could do oh you said don't do oh I thought you said throw sorry it's live television well let me continue my thought then no sorry I can't hear here we go we have black or white and this is from Philips we have a brand-new and we launched this earlier today I only have 700 left I think it's gonna sell out but it truly is this unbelievable experience of being able to use little to no oil but get real fried taste so zero guilt which I love Tim Wilkins come out here so Tim is with us a lot of products what you might not know about this man give me a muscle what are you doing give me a give me a super job Super K let me crudo there's a real reason why I'm showing you his muscle it's because if you want to make me blush on live TV people for 20 years he has been competing in men's fitness competitions and very successful at it so what a lot of people to know that although you are familiar faces you're really into the food you eat and bringing food that's healthier for people out there everyone especially my family that's one of the things I try to pass that along to them I'm not one of those healthy parents that has kids that are unhealthy and I try to impart that upon and inspire as many people as I can to live healthier which is why we've had one of these for about two years which is why when they said hey there's a bigger when I said you mean I can cook more bigger healthy food because trust me I eat a lot of food right and we are amazed what we can do in this now is not just delicious fried food roasting baking when you see all we've done here entire chickens when you see that you and I were talking about being able to have our delicious buffalo wings with no guilt with no guilt if you eat these out in the restaurant they drop them in a vat of oil and you add an extra 10 to 20 grams of fat you can now have these at home I've got someone I'm trying to be careful and I drop them on the ground they're still in there look at all of those beautiful wings delicious and crispy with no oil if you did those out in a restaurant you would have that vat of oil right there and you know the fact that that would add you're doing that without it now here's the beauty let me add some more stuff I'm gonna give you a tour of how unbelievably easy this is to use first and foremost what I'm cooking in every removable part can go right in the dishwasher okay make him clean up it's already nonstick so that's that when I want to set the time they've actually extended the timer to be 60 minutes so we can cook the whole chicken for 60 minutes it was I'm gonna set this for 10 minutes I'm gonna turn this down - well leave it at 400 for right now but this is how you adjust the temperature it shuts off automatically so you don't have to worry about am i cooking it too long and by cooking it wrong there's a recipe guide so here's this and then up here is a guide it is super handy to cook things if I want fries fish meat it's either 400 or 350 there's a couple things that aren't but it's up to 4 times faster to cook it like this so your healthy food is not conventional oven and remove up to 90% of the fat no that's a really big deal so I want to repeat it up so I think it's huge if you were tried to make wings in your oven first off they taste nasty and they're always mushy and they're not right right they're not crispy at all not crispy this will get the air circulating all the way around it and it does it four times faster so you don't have to heat up a whole of and you put this on the counter and you use it every day then repeat the 90 percent because that was my aha moment here's technology most and this is what really separates this most other airfryer's just circulate the hot air around in a circle like this it doesn't bounce all up and through here so Philips in there first one added this starfish design and that gets this circulating then they added this insert which is now part of the technology that makes this the unit to have twin turbo star creates a tornado of convection here and that's how it removes and traps up to 90% of the fat in food that's insane insane without I'm gonna stick a chicken there and that chickens gonna be like dust when it's done it's not it is some of the most delicious crisp beautiful food you will ever eat and the reason I know it's we have an air fryer from HSN it sits on our counter we don't even put it away we use it that much and I'll tell you putting veggies in it it gets that great almost like nutty flavor candy like candy my husband just bought Brussels sprouts we're gonna put the Brussels sprouts in because it almost tastes like candy and you can't achieve that in your traditional oven okay this is one of those long I call one pot meals which is so good I put the other thing I'm cooking in a minute but you talk about candy oh my god when you roast this on the outside it is crispy you hear that so that is like this chicken is fried and every bit of this is well look at the juice pouring off okay look at the juice I'm gonna pick it up so you can see it really look at the juice coming off this chicken the white meat is gonna be unbelievable it's in right there and just tilt it a little bit you guys have got to see how moist that is there it is right there seriously air frying why would I air anything cuz you think it'd be really dry and dried out it's not it's what does it basically for eyes the outside quote unquote and then locks all that moisture in so it doesn't dry out so look at that look if you're trying to eat healthier and you want it faster and you want a no thought no worry guilt free dinner there is the rotisserie chicken you were gonna spend all that money on and all that time and stop by the store look at these beautiful crispy wings and thighs these beautiful legs look at how beautiful that is you got this beautiful skin that we call that's like bacon look at this you know what I'm gonna let that cool but I've got Forks for you here that's on your okay if you were to do grilled cheese first and foremost they never come I know I know the grilled cheese never comes out right right you do it on the stove you got a coated in butter this is going right in here with no thought just a little bit of brush I brush this lightly with oil it fits three grilled cheese in there I'm gonna set this for oh let's see 350 let's turn that up a little 350 and just about six minutes and that is gonna be delicious grilled cheese in just a few minutes now the reveals continue wait till you see this Suzanne the capacity the capacity of this if you are having those guests over for the bow for the big game your favorite college team this is oh wait look at the Christmas those are well done french fries right there they are and they're crunchy Wow oh and you know what you can take these frozen out of the if you've got the chicken nugget kid he loves the chicken tenders or they love the french fries and you're on a really tight schedule you literally can toss this in here frozen within a couple of minutes it's gonna come out and the kids and you will never miss the fact that's not done and deep-fry that's so important because I think if you're trying to get kids to eat healthier you're trying to eat healthier we want the crunch the taste the flavor and that's why we love fried food why why do you order mozzarella sticks at a restaurant or jalapeno poppers because it tastes so good cuz they fry it so you want to replicate that with none of the guilt welcome to Philips and you know talk about around here because we all have one of these even even our expert chefs in the kitchen have an air fryer and they all have Philips it's the everything cookery it's not just a fryer I'm about to do restaurant quality bacon in this you don't have to tend to it flip it over deal with it and it's gonna remove up to 80% of the fat I did a few pieces earlier let's set this little guy here look at the fat that I took off of this earlier and how perfectly crispy this bacon is and it didn't sit in its own fat and that is that beautiful thick cut bacon you would had to turn and turn one pieces burned one pieces were on the middle this is all perfect this will all be done by the end you'll be able to see okay all right now we are continuing with our beautiful appetizer platter and you said mozzarella sticks by golly we have mozzarella sticks you ready for this okay and there again this pulls out and the entire thing is right in the dishwasher home look at how many this is this is two full bags or an entire box from our big box bolt store one of those clubs that you belong to right crispy on the outside I'm gonna pull this over to my mic so you can hear it crispy on the outside but here is what everybody looks for the goo look at that beautiful mozzarella stick and this is done without oil and I want you to see too what's interesting is and this is different than other air fryers if you if you go through any of this pile I can go deep into the inside this is cooked perfectly as one of the outside top ones were because a lot of turns of a lot of the air fryers they're not all built the same and that's a big problem that's really what makes this different is that twin turbo star it's that starfish design they started with a couple units ago and then adding that insert to give you eight points of contact for that hot hot air going around that's that big deal and that's what really sets this apart that makes this a special unit that's what creates that tornado effect inside to reduce that bat now I'm going to put in two giant bags of popcorn shrimp and I'm gonna continue our appetizer platter platter that crew loves on airfryer night bigger than ever over three pounds of capacity I've got a thank you there you public shrimp you ever that's had this kind of capacity you're cooking for the football team the basketball team the kids whatever the teenagers the big family comes over or you're cooking for one or two remember this can do a very small amount just as equally as well as it can a very large well I'm like the other day when my little one landon came home from school and she had acting after a couple hours later and she said I really want egg rolls I was able to put those in and in five minutes it had perfectly crispy egg rolls without heating up the whole oven four times faster because first and foremost no preheating I didn't have to wait 20 minutes for my hungry little woman with her blue eyes all doughy looking at me porridge done all right speaking while I'm in British mode Gordon Ramsay one of my absolute favorites and Ming Ming I didn't want to gush too much but I'm a huge fan Gordon Ramsay came to us and he said I love this so much I want to partner with you and I wouldn't have believed until I saw him do it that you could do a steak and Brussels sprouts in here he said ere is the new oil and absolutely loves philips airfryer's he brought one into his own house for his family now when you see what we did in here this is to beautiful strip steaks but underneath these strip steaks are Brussels sprouts oh my gosh okay there's that nutty flavor the veggie candy that we all love so much you ready these are crunchy like chips they're nutty and beautiful and delicious when those are cool I'll let you have some I don't want to do that to you again appreciate all right but this is like a restaurant-quality steak but restaurants would normally drown this steak in butter and you would they would mask the flavor that be beautiful steak and this is almost like you had seared it look how juicy look at that outside juicy on the inside Tim I'm sure you have too we just look at our stove I swear it's just a place to hold pots inside high do you know when you have all these really great appliances right there you tend to reach form all the time reheating pizza best thing ever if you want to do your vegetables in there easy quick fast and more delicious than boiling them to death or putting them in an oven and waiting forever for them to kind of get caramelized this is how you want to operate and you really your stove will just become a place to store all your cookware all your mini cookware you've got right because that really does take the place of so many things you do in the stove in fact almost everything in the oven here's I'd also convey baked we really haven't shown you baking yet we did this baked for you if you love fried foods but you hate the guilt welcome to this if you say hey I'm trying to eat healthier but I don't have time to cook welcome to Phillips if you say hey I gotta cook for two and then sometimes I gotta cook for 20 welcome to the biggest one we've ever offered but get this at home with our flex pay take advantage of the price because that ends at midnight tonight and see if it does not replace your oven and quite frankly much of the things you do on the stovetop in this one unit and everything is healthier and better and tastes better than a traditional conventional oven prime example coming up right now and showing the capacity there's an over three and a half pound pork roast in here with fennel and leeks and I believe a couple of pieces of squash in here as well that is absolutely stunning oh my God look at that I'm gonna come over to this cutting board Suzanne wait until you see this that's crazy I gotta get get my tongs open here that is a beautiful cut of me I'll get down on this one again listen to this Mike that is on the outside and that is not dry on the inside at all or pour this beautiful these roasted root vegetables that are going we can you see how beautiful and lean and tender and juicy this is normally you wouldn't get that or could really dry out quick really dry out now I will cook this ahead for my family my wife calls the kitchen the scariest room in the house so I pre cook she's the i'ma cook she's the cleaner and I will pre cook for them look at how beautiful and juicy that is absolutely stunning and look at this is white meat that is so juicy and you can see the glimmer across it so juicy and yet it still removed up to 90% of the fat from food so you can roast in this you can bacon it you can fry in it this is your everything cooker it'll be such a pleasant surprise when you get it home and you try it out and if you've never air fried before I love our return policy you have 30 days to make sure you love it if you don't love it you can send it back we'll give you your money back it's really easy but why not try it if you're trying to find alternatives for healthier cooking for cooking more often at home ie if you have a short on time and short on your budget you know any mean you don't if you don't a lot of time try the airfryer because you're cooking four times faster than a conventional oven that's worth getting it right there right there just to have healthier faster fun food faster just to have it all when you want it not have to heat up all in Florida we turn on the air-condition and we don't want to heat up anything to offset the air conditioning because they're just bills that are fighting so we can use this alright I do wanna mention real quick on to the next one I'm 6 flex pay you have not seen that today that is really unbelievable and it's only available tonight while we are in this day at midnight when we launch our new today's special the six flex pay won't even be an option and what it is you buy it for 4666 and then you have six months will you'll pay it off so it's a half a year to pay this off and I love this because you guys did cinnamon everybody loves chicken cinnamon rolls and this is the whole tube my kids love these the only thing that I have to fight them on is making sure that there's enough icing after they dip into it with their fingers and to actually ice the cinnamon rolls I actually some of the icing you see is on it already because I like to ice them a little in the last couple minutes but this only takes eight minutes to do cinnamon rolls normally maybe 12 to 15 in the oven plus another 20 to heat up the oven to get it in the right temperature and this is so fast so when you've got those guests over you want to give them a delicious treat in the morning where the kids are over for sleepovers on Saturday morning like I get about every other week they wake up and we want cinnamon rolls so I've got a rush in there and fire everything up now I can do it super easy with the air fryer and just kind of FYI I have around 600 air fryers left between the two colors total that's all I have we're in like 90 million households that's not a lot of air fryers that's really just a handful so if you are thinking about it I know we've got one more hour Ming's coming up we have all different products next hour we do not have another air fryer on today other than this one and it's launched it's the largest one we've ever done and it has like huge compete last because there's a huge community that loves their airfryers they we are it's already a xxx recipe booklet that comes with this but there's a community online that shares recipes for the Philips airfryer fan sites websites Pinterest frittata any oh by the way accessories anything that fits in your oven fits in here and is oven safe because you notice we weren't selling any additional bakeware we not only we sell pieces that go into an air fryer you can actually use your regular bake all your ramekins and normal great 12-egg omelet the cleanup is going to be super easy and again it's a OneTouch I'm gonna put
