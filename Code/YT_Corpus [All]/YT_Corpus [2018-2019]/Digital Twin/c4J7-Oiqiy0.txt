 the term data' fication refers the fact that we're looking at more and more things and using technology to render them into a data format simply said it's about taking a previously invisible processes or activities and turning them into data that can be monitored tracked analyze and optimize through analytics whereas digitalization has been a process taking place over many decades now data fication is a relatively new phenomenon the difference being that whereas digitalization was about converting information into a digital formats data fication is more about the interaction between the digital domain and physical objects processes and environments with mobile computing and the Internet of Things we now have all kinds of sensors in our environments and we're starting to convert all sorts of things into a data formats there are many examples of this from putting sensors on a bridge for monitoring its structural integrity to monitoring parking spaces performing a 3d scan of an object to measuring the activity levels of a person's health one specific example is the company general educators in the process of converting themselves from an industrial company to what they call a digital industrial company where they create a digital twin for every one of their products their physical technologies are now surrounded by sensors and controllers that can pull a massive amount of data from a jet engine from an MRI scanner from a jet turbine wind turbine which will provide real-time data about themselves that goes into a virtual model of the system that is unique to that machine this digital twin is a cloud-based virtual image of the physical assets maintained throughout its lifecycle and easily accessible within seconds of a new wind turbine going into operations tens of thousands of data points are created and instant the model likewise more and more of our social activities are being rendered into a digital formats Facebook data files our friendships LinkedIn data files our professional accomplishments Twitter data files our thoughts and Google Maps data files our location a multitude of different technologies are now available there help individuals monitor and measure things there were previously difficult or impossible to quantify everything from how much energy and water one uses what your food purchasing habits are the air quality of your neighborhood when you were awake or asleep knowing when you're stressed or what road you selected tried to work how you brushed your teeth in the morning etcetera we create data every time we talk on the phone send a text message watch your video would draw money from an ATM use a credit card or even just walk past a security camera all this can now be measured quantified and compared the word data comes from the Latin term meaning literally something given it is a set of quantities characters or symbols an assumption or premise from which embarrasses may be drawn it is the basis of reasoning or calculation data represents discrete units of information and thus were always isolating some aspect of the phenomenon and freezing its data is always a slice of reality we're chopping the world up into little bits and taking that information as in some way completes this makes data portable it can be taken from one context and brought into another making an amenable to cross correlation all data in the real worlds exists within an integrated context no matter how extensive are gathering of data we will only ever be able to capture a partial representation of the system and in so doing is separated from its overall context data is always incompletes but that discrete nature of data makes it quantifiable and thus amenable to formal quantitative methods of analysis as such data as a general concept refers to the fact that some existing information or knowledge is represented or encoded in some form suitable for processing within a computer where as data and information have always existed around us what data fication does is make that information available for computerized analysis the primary use of data is for manipulation within computer programs which are formal systems thus with data fication we're taking the informal everyday worlds and converting it into a virtual structured format that can be used within a formal system whereas previously with digitalization we converted many forms of information that were already in a structured and quantifiable formats into a digital form for them to be accessible to individual computer programs what we're doing today though is building platforms that operate as computers but now on the macro level a computer is a system that manipulates data according to a set of instructions whereas previously this data and instructions were in individual computers now with cloud computing online platforms of the computers with their algorithms running in data centers they take in data about people and things and analyze it to create an output a platform society is where our technology and social lives are increasingly channeled through online platforms our informal lives and our engineered systems become moved to formal platforms whether this is dating websites car sharing platforms or health websites they all require that we data Phi the things in our world in our lives and input that data through the platform which then acts on its analyzing it to create insight make decisions matching coordinate different systems as a consequence of moving ever more of our systems of organization to these automated platforms we begin to increase in the understand and manage organizations and things fear sets of data points as an ever more complete information picture of who we are and our engineered environments is compiled in these cloud-based information systems that we call platforms this is the current journey that were on we're going to turn our world into data so that we can bring it into these platforms these formal systems and process em however a lot of the problems we're going to have are going to really come from this incompleteness of data data will unavoidably omit many features of the world's distort others and decontextualize vents this process of data fication enables us to change the very foundations upon which we make decisions for organizing society and economy instead of people making best effort guesses in a context of incomplete information it takes us into worlds of decisions being made by algorithms based upon huge amounts of data that coordinate the platforms that increasingly mediate every aspect of our lives this has profound long-term consequences it begins to change some of the fundamental mechanisms upon which societies have always depended from the basis of the techniques used in the scientific method to how economies are measured and structured to how businesses are run to how we understand our bodies in the world around us
