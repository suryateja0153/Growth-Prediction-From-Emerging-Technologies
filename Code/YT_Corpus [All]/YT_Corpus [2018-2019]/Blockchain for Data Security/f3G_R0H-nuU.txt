 So here's what's really important and this gets confused in the industry all the time, crypto is not security, blockchain is not security. There's a lot of confusing information on the market and, if you thought that, I don't blame you because there's a lot of marketing departments that pump out a lot of data that kind of allude to it, but crypto is not security. We actually sat across from a VC not too long ago because, well you know, what you're doing with regard to security, that's kind of old stuff we want-- we want blockchain security. OK, I'm game, explain it to me. What is it that you're looking for? Couldn't. Because crypto technologies and blockchain are not security, they don't control access to information, they don't determine if content is well or mal intended, they don't keep things private, they don't encrypt, they don't identify-- as a matter of fact crypto does the exact opposite, it's designed for anonymous transactions, right? That's why you can go out there and buy six keys of hash with Bitcoin because it's designed to be anonymous. The person buying and the person selling don't have to know a thing about each other other than, hey I got my crypto, I gave you your crypto, do you-- as a matter of fact if you go on Silk Road or any other dark web market, you literally see like eBay and Amazon style ratings, you know, hey here's a used gun, alright, it's got two murders on it or here's six keys of hash or here's cocaine, they've got it branded and all of that stuff, they got vendor ratings, the whole bit. It's just that nobody knows who they are. And they don't protect the user so it's really important to drive that point home when you see somebody come out there and try to position crypto or blockchain as secure just know that whoever you're probably dealing with is probably misinformed.
