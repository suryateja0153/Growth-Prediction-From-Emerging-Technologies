 When it comes to cloud storage all lines lead to central but Norwegian based Iagon is on another track altogether. "So I Iagon is decentralized cloud service that's optimized by AI." It uses a network of computers and laptops including home PC's decentralised clouds of storage for data which has been sharded the owners of these computers act as miners who are then paid in tokens for the use of their storage so you and in a sense can be a miner if you're if you're with your laptop you can provide storage based processing power to Iagon in return you get tokens the company earns a 10% commission from the profits its miners make and uses artificial intelligence to learn about its miners we're learning behavior in terms of performance availability cost benefit and trustability information used to give a miner a cloud score and based on that cloud score you can price your services higher or lower depending on the client's needs Iagon says it's decentralised service solves three major problems with cloud storage including security we have no central point of attack we're completely secure and that's the main advantage we have. Privacy you can only access your data or your files through your private key and only you have access to that. And because it doesn't need one giant computer for storage and processing he says it's much cheaper. We're able to decrease the cost by up to 80 percent cheap but not nasty Iagon a guarantees that because the data is sharded it only accepts the client that can access it making it hack proof. In order to get the full picture you need all the shards combined together and then there's no way of telling from the hacker point of view where the rest of the shards are. We use the blockchain as a security layer to store the hashes the decentralized cloud model is also used for companies or individuals looking for additional processing power. Virtual reality, VR, they need a lot of processing power, the gaming industry needs a lot of processing power so what we do is we provide that processing power from these miners and it's looking for more customers to get on board the Iagon Express.
