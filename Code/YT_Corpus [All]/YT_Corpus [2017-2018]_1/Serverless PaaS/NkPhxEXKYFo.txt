 hi my name's miles ward I run Solutions architecture here on Google cloud but this isn't my first cloud I made the switch three and a half years ago from AWS and I've been talking to a lot of customers and partners that are in the middle of trying to do the same thing say they learned the basics about public cloud from AWS is training and certification programs but they're looking at the features of Google cloud and the sophistication of our technology and really eager to apply that to their problems so we thought maybe we should put together a training course that leverages that existing expertise your familiarity with AWS is public cloud and allows you to apply that to our new generation technologies maybe you want to learn more about a system that allows you to automatically scale from no connections to a million connections in under a second or a system that can process petabytes of logs without ever having to manage an instance maybe you want a system that doesn't quite cost so much or about 60% cheaper on average maybe you're just tired of complexity and you want a cloud that is easy easy easy this training course is designed just for you it's about six hours long the first hour and a half covers the fundamental differences the design differences between our cloud and Amazon's helps you understand and maybe be able to better guess how our system helps you build the tools you're trying to build and then four and a half hours of fast-paced deep hands-on labs that give you firsthand experience with our infrastructures of service systems but also our platform as-a-service databases of service both relational and non-relational functions as a service all manner of tools that make this such a rich suite we think that this course enables you not only to take on your first experiments with Google Cloud but prepares you in the right way for future endeavors and exploration I'm excited about this course I just took it I thought it was really informational and I think you'll have a great time with it thank you so much
