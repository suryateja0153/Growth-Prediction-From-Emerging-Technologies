 everyone this is tyrone from classify and we are pleased to bring your webinar can covering the concept of the important subject of data discovery and data classification are you doing it right is the question that we will be asking all throughout this webinar and probably while you have a look at the agenda we intend covering the following subject as far as this webinar is concerned we look at what is that subject definition of data classification look at the definition of a data classification policy and how does a data classification policy look like for an organization the other very important aspect that we'd like to dwell upon is to look at what is the relevance of information lifecycle management and data classification put together for in organizations information security strategy we will then 12 into the aspects of looking at what is that recommended solution approach that an organization needs to undertake for an effective data classification program what business benefits that an organization can look to see post a successful implementation of a data classification program and I'd like to leave some key takeaways basis the best practices with respect to data classification and last but not the least I'd like to spend some time in talking about the product that we have which actually helps organizations implement their data classification policy and therefore you know looking at some key features of classified post which I will you know have around five or ten minutes for taking questions from the audience and you can oppose those questions through the questionnaire panel on you know through the webinar so let's go ahead let's look at what is the real world them that the organizations are embracing today because of which data falsification has become a need data classification has become a pressing issue for organizations to look at I think everything starts off with data which is the lifeline of today's business businesses create more and more data every day and what happens with this data you know it's get saved employees move on data is forgotten and it's lost well we call this data as that unstructured valuable information that resides on the file servers and document stores and it remains unprotected unrecoverable when needed the most and why so because organizations do not know where to find it so that's the biggest contrary that most of the organizations are facing today let's look at something you know related to it it is a known fact that the information security is as strong as its weakest link and in most of the cases the weakest link is the end users because there are low of end users that are not aware of an information security policy or the sensitivity of data within that organization so what do they really do I think it is because of that absence of end-user awareness that they advertise or inadvertently put unprotected information at risk copies of data is made and shared without permission that leads to information security incidents breaches and frauds and this is one of the major security and data protection challenges that the organizations face today you know in these circumstances let us also look at what happens to technology solutions like data loss prevention that works in monitor and block approaches they are rendered ineffective because there are too many false positives and there are a lot of security constraints that cut get into the way of doing business because the data is not structured the data is not classified and therefore let's look at you know what happens to security and risk professionals like us we tend to approach data security and focus on controlling access to data without knowing what data are we looking at controlling we we look at approaches that would encrypt data regardless of the importance of data within the organization and I think it is this approach which is which is nothing like but building a skyscraper on a weak foundation because it is overlooking the fundamentals of knowing and understanding your data before you can put controlling mechanisms before you can secure that data so therefore you know these are real world problems of not having data which is structured not the you know having a fair bit of understanding of what is the important sensitivity and confidentiality of information what are the kind of approaches that are required for controlling access to databases the security I think the basic fundamental that all the organizations today need to address is understand and know your data and their of apply protection measures to it let's move on and let's look at what is data classification really that we are talking of I think in the most simplistic terms data classification is the process of categorizing data which is which has to be based on its sensitivity bases its criticality just look at up you know what are the kinds of data in an organization and what is the kind of data classification categories that most of the organizations have public internal confidential highly confidential restricted and top secrets are the ones that are the industry known terminologies that most of the organizations use to classify data these are the categories of data I think we will have a look at the definitions of you know some of the in order to understand what do they really mean to an organization as for this data classification policy is concerned it's quite a framework for protecting information that is critical to the organization and its customers I think data must be classified according to the risk associated with the data storage with data processing and its transmission and I think written procedures and guidelines for data classification should define the categories like public internal and confidential and the criteria that the organization uses to classify data has to come out very clear nothing in the subsequent slides we will look at a typical data classification policy look at what are the definitions of these categories and look at some very valid examples which are going to be helping an organization come up with data classification categories and look at the you know coming up with the data classification policy they're off so let's look at the first definition first categorization of data which is public and this is something which is ubiquitous every organization has data which is openly general public right there is data in every organizations which which has no existing restrictions in terms of local national or international legal restrictions and therefore it can be widely shared in the public domain it is meant for the public domain and therefore this data is categorized as public let's look at some of the examples of public information publicly posted press releases of organisations publicly available marketing brochures and other material that is good for sharing with the people at large outside of the organization publicly posted job announcements when I think anything which is unrestricted and can be sure head outside of the organization without any fear of any information getting lost there is no sensitivity or confidentiality which is associated with such information that is known as public from a classification perspective let's move ahead and look at the next level of categorization within an organization which is internal I think internal information is an information whose access is restricted to personnel within an organization it is an information that is not meant for public disclosure that means any data or information that an organization creates for internal use within the organization with personnel who are designated to to whom that information can be shared with as an internal information let's look at some of the examples of internal information routine office correspondence not required to be shared outside of the office employee newsletter is very specific to the employees of an organization and so is the internal phone directories which is very specific to the employees of an organization again non-personally identifiable information that means any information which is not related to an employee of an organization and organization charts you know none of this information and there are multiple other examples that can actually be drawn up but I think I wanted to make sure that we actually get some of the examples which will give you an understanding of what is it that is created by the organization produced by the organization but not meant for public disclosure and these are the typical type of information that are categorized as internal to an organization let's move on in fact one of the important aspect that I'd like to bring to the fore here is that while we move from public to internal to confidential we are actually in this is the increasing order of confident confidentiality or sensitivity of data we're looking at the more the sensitivity or confidentiality of data the more are going to be stringent measures that I gonna be applied to protect that information so we have actually looked at to set classification public internal let's now look at confidential from a definition standpoint I think any information which is sensitive in nature that if disclosed outside of the organization without due diligence could negatively impact the operations of an organization let's look at some of the examples financial information of an organization which doesn't have to go public this is very internal rate cards of an organization or internal to an organization and can gio pod eyes the business of an organization if it is disclosed to a larger audience outside of the organization there for umpteen due diligence has to be exhibited by any organization before any such confidential sensitive information is disclosed outside vendor contracts very legal centric document customer contracts again very specific to a customer the rate card the contractual obligation signed up with the vendors or customers this information is extremely extremely critical for an organization not to be disclosed outside that gets into a confidential category and so is the case with the employee reviews now employee reviews is one example that potentially could be a confidential information it could be an internal information but obviously this is something which is so very specific to the employees of an organization that should have no reason to be shared outside and therefore it is more confidential and sensitive and therefore falls into this category let's move on and look at another category which is supposed to be the highest category within an organization again while I talk about public internal confidential this is a organization driven terminology and it depends on to organization on how would they want to categorize and give it a name so these are not hard coded definitions or categories but these are intended and provides and guidance to an organization on how a data can be classified within an organization so let's look at an organization which has information which is protected by statutes or regulations or contracts this actually is an information that becomes very highly confidential or top secret it's also referred to as proprietary or restricted depending on what an organization chooses to pick as a category let's look at some of the examples and I think while you have a look at these examples any information related to any one of these if advertently or inadvertently disclosed outside of the organization can put the organization at the risk of financial damages or penalties or legal damages and therefore it is the highest level of information from its criticality standpoint that has to be safeguarded and as I said it's protected by statutes statute like HIPAA which governs the medical records medical history of patients is a very very very important information to be safeguarded at all the times by an organization which is entrusted with the you know patient information like a healthcare organization or hospitals let's look at another category which is customer credit card information customer credit card numbers a statute like a payment card industry data security standard that it governs that is governed by there is huge penalties associated with disclosure of credit card information and any other personally identifiable information affair employee of an organization which is again guarded by a huge set of regulations in terms of its disclosure is a highly confidential information of an organization it's top secret it is proprietary to that organization another set of example you know that is duly worth mentioning as far as sensitivity of information is concerned is intellectual property if an intellectual property goes in the hands of a competitor then it can jeopardize the existence of an organization and therefore you know the importance of this kind of information to be classified to be labeled within an organization and then commenced rating controls need to be put in by an organization depending on the organization's criticality that it associates with that information so I think with this fundamental understanding of what is data classification what does it solve for an organization what are the real world problems that are addressed by an fair bit of understanding of data within an organization becomes a key for a data classification program implementation now before we actually go into the aspects of looking at you know what are the recommended solutions for approaching data classification within an organization and the benefits that it actually brings to an organization and you know what are the key takeaways let's for a moment look at data classification and its relevance to information lifecycle management I am sure each one of you would have come across this popular phrase of cradle to grave which actually means what is the life of a data or in information within an organization where I say cradle that means it gets created the the data gets created within an organization it gets processed it gets transmitted it then gets stored and eventually gets destruct which is the grave so data classification is that unique subject that addresses the create phase within an information lifecycle management your information lifecycle management is as good as what it has started off when the information got created within an organization and therefore data classification helps organizations know what data they have where the data is located and how they can access it I think some of the very important questions that come to our mind of you know when it gets to looking at data classification is one what data types are available what are the certain where is that data located what axis levels are implemented what protection levels are implemented and do these protection levels adhere to compliance regulations these are these are the fundamental questions that we need to get the answers to and while you know we have a look at the present state of affairs in various organizations let's look at the you know some of the wider observations that we make of data classification number one businesses are not aligned to own data classification across organizations organization may have nice well-to-do formulated data classification policies but that data is owned by the business in most of the cases and if the businesses do not align themselves to own the data classification program within an organization or they do not participate well in data classification programs within an organization's the the data classification program can be over ambitious it will be difficult to achieve what it is intended to and therefore most of the projects fail because of this reason most of the projects will disappoint because the business is are not aligned to own data classification across organizations come to think of it wherever data classification policies and practices do exist we've also seen that data classification is not followed by all businesses and enabling functions like HR internal audit finance so on and so forth and I think the most important aspect that we are going to be discussing when we talk about classify eventually as part of this webinar is technology has not been adopted to enforce data classification policy and that is what you know classify brings to the fore that it actually provides for that technology can bend and help to enforce a data classification policy which is probably the least effective been implemented in you know and manual mode so let's look at very you know typical potential risks that in organization faces because of non implementation of effective data classification program number one in effective use of information protection mechanisms look at you know solutions like data loss prevention or information rights management I think the effective implementation of dlp and ir m solutions is hinging upon the fact whether data has been transpired I think solutions like DLP and ir m need to be made more intelligent and they can be made more intelligent to work on their protection mechanism only if data is classified and therefore better policies can actually be applied there are safeguards you know that organizations would employ they which would not commensurate with the criticality or sensitivity of data because the data has not been falsified and therefore you know what happens is that organizations have a tendency to suffer from legal and contractual compliance failures because of non-availability of that ability to discover data and classify data and put protection means that commensurate with the criticality of the information and that also leads to you know information security incidents and breaches let's further move on and now look at you know some of the recommended solution approaches that we think are very important that can help any organization address data classification and make a data classification program effective number one address data classification by classifying data with which you can regain control over unstructured data I think we talked about the real life problem that the organizations are facing of unstructured data regain control over unstructured data by classifying data I think when you classify data it can reduce the risks because businesses can retrieve information more easily and identify more accurately the protection mechanisms that are needed to be employed for a specific data within an organization whereby they can look at you know reducing the risk of costly data leakages and therefore increasing the efficiency of the business once you have looked at come once you have actually looked at addressing data classification you have classified data you have had a data classification policy you should choose the right fit data classification approach by making sure that you are involving the end users in classifying the information and use automated classification means such as classify or the other solutions that are there in the marketplace you know with which you can actually help the end users by providing them with a technology solution and help them in their classification decisions and as said involvement of the end users is extremely important a involvement of the business users is extremely important it is the user who understands what is the criticality of information and therefore is in a position to classify the information bases they did a classification policy within an organization involve end users in data classification make them more data aware is the key I think with this approach the end users can achieve greater understanding of the businesses information security policies and are able to value data which becomes you know the rock bed of a data classification program within an organization it has needless to say that any data classification program or any other program within an organization will require a top-down approach a tone has to be set at the top executive management participation is as important as the end user participation and I think with data classification which deals with data to the core end users involvement is the key to any successful implementation of a data classification program within any organization let's move on and look at you know what are the business benefits that an organization achieves I think first and foremost is the strategic advantage the strategic reason for establishing a data classification program is to enjoy the higher degree of trust build a higher degree of trust with your customers that is the biggest treaty advantage that an organization can accrue of having established data classification program I think this is one of the better means of showcasing that an organization is a security and compliance conscious service provider because it understands this data it understands the data which is it may be dealing on behalf of a customer and is able to put securing and controlling measures which commensurate with the sensitivity and criticality of data and what it really does to an organization's eventually is that it brings clarity to the business it helps organization define data protection measures which is akin to the data center tivity what it really helps is you helps an organization fund and put put it fun and resources and do the right set of allocation to defend the assets because it really understands which data needs more protection than the other I think employing a data classification scheme is also cost-effective for organizations in the long run in the longer run because it allows a business to focus on protecting its higher data assets before anything else as we've talked about the aspect of making DLP and other parameter security devices and data archiving solutions more intelligent this is what data classification program does to an organization it leads to enhancement of effectiveness of data protection and storage technologies thereby reducing the risk of expensive data breaches and last but not the least is facilitates organizations and businesses meet specific data protection and regulatory requirements which could also be contractual requirements that today the organization's sign with their customers and vendors and the most important aspect of all that we have been enforcing upon is that end user participation that any DLP that any data classification program really gets to an organization it involves the end user it helps promote the culture of information security by involving the end user a having an end user realized the responsibility and you know that they have for the organization so it increases the user awareness of their organization's information security policy and therefore you know this becomes the key let's move on and look at some of the key takeaways from the webinar for today there are two key takeaways that I would like to you not leave the audience with number one do your ground work before you do any implementation of controlling measures protecting measures like irm data loss prevention and the others define your data I think you should begin defining your data break it down analyze data and then defend it at the end of the day we've got to make sure that we give every data its identity which will then enable actionable data security and control policies so define your data that's the key have a data classification policy data are classification categories within an organization and number two whilst you are setting up this data classification policy keep it simple i think defining data classification policy to address the entire life cycle of knock often of an information within an organization right from its creation to its destruction please understand not all information has the same value to an organization different classes of information represent different risks with respect to confidentiality integrity and availability they're for classifying information here to ensure that appropriate levels of policies controls and resources are in place and that these investments deliver an appropriate level of value to the business in return and last but not the least the key is to classify newer data first and then you could take up legacy data if you are embarking on any data classification journey look at the data that you're creating now and then look at your legacy later thereafter so I think that really brings us up you know to the end of the subject of data classification and its importance and the way it should be approached to within an organization let's now for next five minutes look at the solution that we bring to the fore that really helps organizations manage their data risk of data not being structured data not being classified data not being labeled and that is where the solution as in classify comes to the fore so what does classify really do if you have a look at this slide it takes care of emails in terms of labeling and it takes care of microsoft office documents in PDF classify obviously will have further enhancements with respect to its feature set but today what it really brings to an organization is the ability to classify label microsoft office documents while they are being created PDF documents while they are being created and before they're getting saved and any email that gets created designed before it is sent out to the external world or the internal organization it gets labeled so what does the classified he does I only talked about the fact that it does labeling and it does visual marking on the headers footers and provides watermarking to microsoft office documents it provides for labeling on the header footer and subjects when the emails are designed or created so therefore it really works on the concept of meta tagging metadata tagging you know if you look at the advanced properties of microsoft office document the you know which is actually been used to create a document using classify the metadata we'll talk about that classification whether it is public internal confidential top-secret restricted so you will and so does that matter data tagging of the data classification scheme or categorization in an organization also happens in the X header of the emails so therefore any document that gets created or any email that gets created will always be a meta tag of the data classification scheme or label that their organization follows and therefore data protection measures which is commenced rating with the sensitivity of that data can actually be applied what classify also brings as a very important aspect is the logging of information menia when a microsoft office document gets created you can actually go to the advanced properties of that document and you could see who is the person who actually created that information and what is the kind of tagging did he actually provide to that document if the document ashley gets shared with somebody else and someone else were to do a reclassification an audit log would also get created for that transaction what other important aspects and features that classify really gets that it actually helps blacklisting and white listing of email means any domain that you do not deem necessary or warrantied to send that email to send organizations email to that domain can be blacklisted using classified so I think these are the very important features of classify as a product is actually helps you do labeling visual marking on Office documents PDFs and your Microsoft Outlook as in your email and the fundamental that it really works on is meta data tagging and it has a very powerful reporting and a logging engine in which you could see how many users are having classify on their systems how many licenses do you really have classified what is the set of documents how many documents in this organization are classified as public how many documents are classified internal and the other levels of classification it actually helps do the blacklisting and white listing go for email domains and has data loss prevention features as well so in a nutshell data classification framework within an organization can actually be enforced using a product and a solution like classify and classify works well with various different OEM solutions on DLP and information rights management and really helps make those solutions work more effectively by making them more intelligent so therefore classify really sits very tight between an organization's information security data classification framework and it very seamlessly ties up with the already invested in solutions like DLP or information rights management within an organization it really actually makes that environment more intelligent by ensuring that any data which is more critical is you know having more commensurate data protection mechanisms within an organization well this is a you know representation where in any document which is getting created let's say this document which is getting created within an organization and gets saved by the user classify will sit on the client of the user machine and when he tries to save the document there would be a pop-up that comes on the screen that will enforce the user to select the classification level of the document if you look at the classification levels public confidential internal the befitting classification level will have to be selected by the user before the document can be saved and you could also see that the user can actually choose whether he would like to have the label on header footer or he will also want to have a watermark of that data classification scheme to be mentioned in that document before the document gets saved this is a dashboard of what we call as the classified manager which will lead is the reporting and the logging engine that is what I alluded to at any given point in time you can actually see the number of documents with respect to their classification you can actually see who are the top five users who are really classified you know the data within within an organization you could also see how many events are there within an organization where in a data classification scheme was lowered and these are important aspects that in the administrators or the compliance teams within an organization security professors within organizations are really interested in knowing and therefore this rock solid compliance feature within the classifier solution and the tool is paramount and the next slide really talks about the various logging features that are available within classify any document that gets created there is an audit trail there is a log that gets generated to say who created that information which IP address was used you know to create that information what is the classification label what is a classification type for that information and it also provides for a classification that it also provides for a unique identification number for that document that remains with the document from the time that it gets created and therefore in order to find out whether document is today how many copies of that document have actually been created the it can easily be retrieved because the classification identification number that get associated with the document always remains with the document throughout the lifecycle till such time that that document is destroyed within an organization well with this I'd like to thank each one of you for a very patient listening and now I throw open the the forum for any questions that the team would have so I think there is a question that has come up you know from one of the participants it actually says where do you see data related to an organization which is generated by entities outside the organization that is data generated through social media where does this data fit into the scheme of things I think if if an organization has not created any information by the use of their employees or their management that data does not belong to the organization if an organization if n data related to the organization has gotten created by someone outside the organization you know that data would not belong to that organization and therefore that is a public information that is a public data because that got created outside of the organization outside of the realm of the organization outside of the control of the organization there's another question that has come in which says how do we classify the documents that have already been created this is what I had alluded to as legacy information something which has already been created within an organization I think there is a concept which is known as bulk classification classify also provides for that option to an organization wherein they can choose all the data wishes from a legacy standpoint being created in the past and all those documents can actually be collated together and they can be bulk classified that means you can actually pick up all the information that you deem is internal an organization or should be classified as internal or you can pick up all the information bucket them together that you think should be labeled as confidential there is a bulk classification feature that products like classify provide by which you can classify legacy information there's another question that you know is inquiring just inquiring to see if classify works with lotus notes email client I think classify really works with Microsoft Outlook at this point as far as Lotus Notes is concerned I think there are some template eyes features available within lotus notes for the classification of emails but as far as most of the tools or data classification are concerned they lastly work with the Microsoft Office which is you know the de facto Microsoft the de facto email solution that most of the organizations are using the question you know is with respect to whether data classification solutions support android and iphone and windows phone i think the answer is yes as far as the journey of classifiers concerned today it only is in a position to help an organization classify their emails but as a product roadmap we are looking at extending classified to work with android iphone and outlook web access so therefore in terms of the next year roadmap which is this year roadmap the next one year roadmap all these features in classify will be available then there is a question which comes in from a participating from participant which says whatever data classification resides in database server I think the question doesn't come out very clear but I assume that the question really means what about the databases you know and classification thereof I think as of now it is the microsoft office documents and the PDFs that are covered there are other known file types that classify will cover as far as data labeling is concerned there could be certain proprietary databases in which connectives will will have to be written but in terms of popular you know database structures like Microsoft sequel and the others I think classify can provide for that connectors but that will be on a very specific request of an organization otherwise you know the number of connectors can actually be in finite and therefore depending on the very specific need of an organization i classify can definitely provide for extended features for providing data classification on databases as well so this really gets me to the end of the questions you know that were there on the question board and I wish you all the very best if you know you're looking at having any plans for any data classification related policy enforcement or data classification programs within your organization if there are any questions that you may have please feel free to write in to me my email ID is Tyrone add rate classify dot I n you also have my mobile number you know on this slide so feel free to get in touch with me in case you have any specific questions outside of this session and I wish all of you although all the very best and thank you all for a very patient listening
