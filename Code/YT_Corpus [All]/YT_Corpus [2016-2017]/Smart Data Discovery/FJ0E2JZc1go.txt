 uh so yes my name is jan verhasselt i'm the founder and managing director of yazoom and i'm here to tell you today the story of our data science startup so it will not be about technology it will not be a lot about products it will be about our journey right about and our journey started about three and a half years ago in september 2011 when i had a very strong desire to become an entrepreneur i had about 40 000 euro on the bank that i was willing to invest in this adventure so i said to myself okay what am i going to do and on this intersection of what i'm good at and what i love to do i figured it should be something with algorithms with solving difficult problems with innovating inventing stuff improving processes processing data and this more or less this messy thing very technical thing was more or less our mission at a time today our mission looks like this we develop software we deliver engineering services that create value from data by optimizing company processes so i hope you agree this looks already a little bit more concise and professional so what brought us from that point a to point b first we listened a lot to feedback feedback from our friends our family but also from teachers there are a few people in the room here that have told me a few things and also of customers very important to listen to your customers and your suppliers second thing we experimented a lot not only with what we offer but also with the story of that we delivered the offer with with our pricing strategy even with organization how do you divide the work over different people what types of talents do you need and so on thirdly you can accelerate this process by taking a lot of education it's very cheap here in flanders as a starter to get free advice and to get education from organizations like series and the chamber of commerce there is uh flemish subsidized uh programs there is european programs and so on but as you work through that it takes time so be prepared to work hard for peanuts until at at one point you will get lucky and i agree i tend to agree with seneca that luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity so the preparation is all the hard work i was talking about but when you do that well sooner or later there will come an opportunity in the form of a potential customer and the luck is when you can turn it into a real customer and today we are happy to say we have some great customers very big companies very small companies some knowledge institutes um and many more than what you see here but it didn't come overnight as you can see uh the first year we didn't make a lot of revenue right this is this is when we were really living from peanuts and the second year was okay uh we actually made a profit but the road was still bumpy only the last year we we grow consistently and fast and that also translates into the team all right so very early on david first ratan who's from the uh reservoir bozok from the reservoir lab joined yazoom and together we have grown it into what it is today the growth engine the strategy that allows us to grow profitably is that we are selling a mix of building software on the mount selling our own software products and also selling software and services of third-party suppliers and we do this in a number of activity areas we improve processes mainly industrial production processes there we create software for sorting machines and for inspection robots and in the analytics words closer to this world it's about predictive analytics it's about prescriptive analytics so and we do that with a lot of services and in order to deliver those services effectively and efficiently we have a range of products products that we sell but products that we also use during these projects in which we apply these services and that goes from software to monitor thousands of control open an industrial production plant two software that can make predictions predictive models for hard to measure quantities from available data of course along this journey we made some mistakes one of my earliest mistake was spending time with a lawyer and a lot of money on creating general terms and conditions to subsequently learn that the big companies simply refuse it and the small companies freak out when you use it so today we are expanding internationally and we're learning that this is hard right so selecting and motivating an international network of sales agents is hard work and i haven't found a data science trick to find accelerate it but the overall feeling we have today is that we're very proud we're proud that we have always delivered on our on our promises to our customers and that has resulted that last year 50 percent of our revenue was coming from customers that were referred to as by earlier customers and that's why we're now accelerating this growth path so that was my story i thank you for your attention
