 you so our next speaker is Professor Batman's puff professor Beckman's heads up a startup called m3 bo has over though good morning thanks as I can speak mm okay I'm very good in making stupid mistakes and the one for today is out of the 40 speeches we give in a year I took a Dutch one so I'm very sorry I collected some things from the three dutch one we have so I will do it in English I apologize for that but don't worry let me see what if that works ok I can give the speech to teach what is the aim here we have about 30 25 to 30 PhD students and we only develop real-time wearable algorithms what is the basic idea in bringing instead of bringing all data to a high level you only bring relevant information to the higher level Ubik you pick it as computing computer power will be everywhere instead of measuring heart rate as 250 samples we immediately calculate relevant information ok in the presentation or in the team website you can get more information we started to spin-off companies by ricks and sound talks and I want to give an example of this on what by ricks was doing sorry I will say something on mental component stress is a positive thing and a negative thing scientifically stress is not the way we always connected to like negative you have different zones where you can be so you can be in the optimal performance zone in the under motivated zone or the anxious zone which is dangerous if you stay there what do we do what is a burnout means you don't get away from this zone although the stressor is gone I don't have to explain the importance of stress in a lot of situations one example AC Milan what that was done between 2006 and 2009 it was the first contract of by ricks what they asked can we measure the mental condition in real time because in sports that is d driver it is not the physical all of them are good when federer and nadal play a game it's mental game all of them are good at that level okay what was the project for three years they had the Milan lab they did the measurements in the laboratory physical and mental blot analysis ECG respiration etc question can we measure it in real time and it relates to what you see in Big Data take very simple parameters from your data that have that have interests that give you inside that's exactly the same here but now it goes at another scale this is the mental status of such a top layer only over two weeks it's varying a lot that was what a lab measured in these daily measurements and this is what we could get from the field measurements okay so very simple day in those days just to say how fast it goes the first measurements was an accelerometer with 150 meters wired to your computer there was in two thousand sticks no cheap the light wireless accelerometer today they they will throw you that with it but that is how it goes in in the evolution okay what came out was a product of adidas there is a real time algorithm in the t-shirt into my coach by Rex deliver that algorithm and it calculates condition and mental status of top soccer players it will go also to amateur players soon and individuals so basic ideas do at body level what you can do at body level go to the higher level for what you cannot do at that level why is so interesting because you have real-time feedback on that level but from energy viewpoint to send all those data takes more energy than to do calculations on the body and that's the basic idea behind it okay another exciting example last year a race team in the neutering boring in Germany they used the tool to see can they get advantage out of it they explained to us please make us a tool and by rekhs developed that unit for race team it has four units it is a watch with the smartphone that's all it is you have to combine ICT with biological knowledge if we want to go fast and I can explain if you want to know more about it it's all published you're very welcome to come to me so what happened is they start to use the real term stress monitor and I want to show this video before we play it let me explain this driver is in the last round he has to catch that car to win the qualifying and start in front of the grid he's going very stressed now and what you will see is the real time stress is shown there he only did that twice a year in ten races what you see let's start the video you will see how he knows in this last round that he only has one place where he can take over this car and he's approaching that could we start the video could we run that because this is the best part of the thing so what they did is there you see Death Star in front of Phineas it's a more powerful car and he is now getting nervous you see that here that is unusual for this rapper we only did it twice in the whole season he sees I have to do it now or I will not make it you see at the speed of 280 an hour he takes over with two wheels on the grass now he goes to a very high stress level how did the team use that what you what they do is what we can see is we make for each could we go further we can see where cote in stress but more important how is the lap time as a function of stress level for each driver here he is in the focus so here they make the mistake they lost the car they did win the season with not the fastest car the championship they did win 8 out of 10 races because they knew how to handle real damn stress we delivered the technology but they knew how to do that ok my time is gone thanks a lot
