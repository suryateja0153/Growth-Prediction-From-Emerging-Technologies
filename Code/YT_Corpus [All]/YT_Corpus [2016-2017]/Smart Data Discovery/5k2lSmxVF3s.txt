 good morning thank you again for joining our Meno for our webinar today unleash your intuition with qlik sense the next generation self-service data visualization tool my name is Mary Russell and I want to thank you all for joining us and I'd like to walk you through using your webinar pane you can see the webinar pane in the upper right hand corner of your screen you push the orange arrow to expand the screen and you're welcome to enter a question in for our presenters at any time throughout the webinar we will answer those questions at the end of the presentation additionally I will and let you know how to modify your audio settings if you are listening in through telephone please click the telephone button if you're using your computer's mic and speakers please select that that will keep you from getting an echo on the presentation here so and with that we'd like to introduce our presenters the first is John Horner he's a partner for our business intelligence practice in our Mannino he's got many years of industry and consulting experience working with data warehouse and business intelligence tools he leads a robust team here in our Mannino many of whom are well versed in QlikView and we are also supporting QlikView or the click company in developing the click cents certification program so we're proud to be presenting this information to you today and we're happy to welcome Peter Smith who's a partner enable it manager with click again peter has a ton of bi and business discovery experience with IBM Cognos and rational software and he is now working with the support and concierge teams for click in Raleigh North Carolina without any turn over to John winner thanks Mary morning everybody so just to give you a little bit of an overview on our Mannino before we head into the clixsense webinar here so we're the largest california-based CPA and consulting firm run about 450 employees growing every every week it seems and today we're going to concentrate and talk about the business intelligence practice within our consulting division you can see from a slide here that we have won a lot of accolades across the country top 25 best of the best managed accounting firms in the nation top 100 largest CPA firms in the nation were ranked number 28 they're ranked the fifth largest bar in the nation by accounting - there and we have offices primarily headquartered around the San Francisco Bay Area but we have a national reach in San Diego Portland and Chicago and an international reach through our move Stephens international connections so let me tell you a little bit about our click practice here we are the largest QlikView lead solution provider in the West we've done over 100 click engagements now with trend over 250 designers and developers with our clients we have around about 12 certified click consultants now on our team we have both an on-site onshore model and an offshore model for development in support we're a certified QlikView training part partner and we support both the click Samsung click view products and as Mary mentioned recently we were the only partner in North America to participate in the NCLEX very own clixsense certification program so we're helping build helping click build their certification program for the rest of the partner community and presumably the customer community going forward as well we do offer some industry and line of business solutions within our practice and one of which in 2012 was voted the top new product by accounting today it's practice CCH practice intelligence designed to look at professional services companies and what they do so gives you a brief outline just a couple of other things that I should mention just returned back from clicks first we'll use a conference across in Orlando and certainly proud to proud to tell you that we came three of our clients joined together in a Midnight Madness clixsense development activity there was claims from NFS Energy and Autodesk and very medical and I can tell you that that team came in first place in that competition of the world conference and also Rob Wonderlic who some of you if you've worked with QlikView for a while might might know also associated with all Menino here they came in third place within a United Nations hackathon that was part of that user conference so again gives you an idea of the levels of skills that we have as a team but also the levels of skills that now some of our clients have out there due to due to some of the work that they're doing alongside our team okay this gives you a little a little idea of some of the clients it's too many to post all of them up here would be quite the mess if we did but it gives you an idea of some of the scope and really all I want to point out here is that we we can work with clients who might be small small businesses growing to the levels but we can also work with large enterprise organizations and this is client list really spams that sponge that range and also gives you an idea that war in in multiple different industry to work in high tech money far to work in traditional manufacturing retail consumer product goods distribution food and beverage a little bit of healthcare in here as well and so it gives you a an idea that we can work right across the different industries and whether you're a small business medium business or a large enterprise business this is something that we can can help with a so I'm going to hand over to Peter Smith pretty quickly here but this should give you a little bit of an idea of the some of the things we're going to walk through today so well we're going to take an in-depth look at clicks amps I think Peters going to walk through demo of the of the product in action from two perspectives I believe one is as a user I after we've kind of developed something and put something together but we'll also show you how how easy it is to develop something within clixsense so without any further ado I think I'll hand across to Peter and allow him to take over from here thank you John well thanks everybody for attending this this morning this afternoon wherever your timezone may be my name is Peter Smith with qlik as a partner enablement manager and today I'm going to concentrate on the clixsense product and for those of you who have some history with a click company know that we've had a product after many years called QlikView and now we're embarking on a second product lines we're turning into a 2 product line company and clixsense is what we're going to be focusing on today the as John just outlines what I plan on doing is a kind of order of the demonstration here is to give you just a very quick high-level overview of what click sense is what but if purpose was in developing that its mission its goal and what makes it uniquely but as we feel in the marketplace show helped with some collaboration just to start things off interact with an existing app and show you some of the very interesting self-service visualization features of the clixsense product and then turn around and actually do it just a very quick build using the same basic data that you see in the existing app that I'm going to show here in a melt in a moment to show how truly easy it is to develop these applications in by a rank-and-file business and user community but first I'd like to give the the typical marketing slide you know what is click sense what do we define it as and click sentence the natural progression of the click company to reduce that accessibility gap between business intelligence of old where it was you know kept in the back room the back office some IT development community would develop some things then produce that to be consumed by the business end users and as time has progressed the desire for those business users to get more direct access to this information and be able to do this level of data discovery and visualizations themselves has become quite the trend and that was really the impetus for the click fence product click view product out for many years and that was much more of a you know build and publish to consume kind of model and really the market is pushing it to I want to be able to do things directly myself and and so the real goal here is as the slide says self-service data visualization allows a a broader user community to get a governed set of data in their hands to do that visualization and provide that additional very flexible data exploration to answer that next question that that typically happens when users start to delve into the data and information and yeah it's all about unleashing that intuition about the data and it's in three main clicks that's really targets three main areas that the initial focus is for this end user driven drag-and-drop creation of self-service visualizations and providing very intelligent visualizations right out of the box with the no programming smart search capability which I'll demonstrate in a bit the ability then to also share that analysis across groups the ability to take that information and communicate through what we call storytelling having an embedded storytelling capability right into right inside the application and then the final thing is the the entire product has been built with responsive design that's the buzzword nowadays in other words be able to accommodate anything from mobile devices all the way up to your typical computers and laptops but it was built from the ground up with the idea of being able to run this and do a development visualization directly on iPads iPhones all the way up to your typical traditional laptops and desktops then finally we won't get into this aspect of the product but just to let you know there's for you there's a server version of the product that allows you to centrally manage and govern simple to complex deployments sir the security of data etc etc once these applications have to have been developed and share it across a broader organizational context so what what might a dashboard in clixsense look like and this is this is the example I'm going to be using to just do a quick walkthrough with this information and the storytelling aspects of the the product is kind of sort of have that as the starting point is it gives you the ability to take that dashboard and as you're doing some data discovery you're finding some aspect of the data of interest it's revealing some patterns some trends and whatnot just two examples of Annotated the sales profit by product with the margin percent and showing these outliers that have high sales and margins how can we increase this yep what's interesting to have most amount of customers in the u.s. showing up versus other countries and whatnot and just interestingly enough since the very beginning of my presentation I've been using the storytelling facility within click sets even from that beginning slide even though it looks like PowerPoint but it's not it's actually the storytelling capabilities within that's built in within sense and this is giving an example of how you can annotate and collaborate with with your users you know which management if you're giving a presentation and what not and if you're like most if you've experienced a situation where you're showing a static picture if you're doing a PowerPoint presentation and then somebody questions that information they may want to do some well what happens if I did such-and-such for this what happened if I looked at a different angle of data did a different level of selectivity if you're doing something in a more static presentation mode you kind of stop you have to go back to the drawing board and be able to do those visualizations again and kind of come back to to the audience with this because the storytelling is actually embedded and it's actually part of the application and by the way you can have as many stories if you will embed it into this application it actually it is actively linked to the actual live application so if I were to go in here for example and highlight this bar chart I can go directly to the application right from the story and get into the active application to actually rummage around through the data at at this presentation time if you will I'll use that as a springboard to kind of show you what kind of interactions what is a some of these new smart visualization features about click census that's it apart to provide this enhanced self-service visualizations the first thing if anybody is familiar with a click view product is that this click cents products ears that associative data indexing engine that click view has been known for for many years where you basically have access to underlying data these visualizations are just specific views or windows into that underlying information they're all connected together so the first thing you could do if I to go ahead and select the USA as an example everything end up in the dashboard here responds to that selection everything's linked that's done automatically by the engine underneath the covers here you can see that you have maps of different kinds of visualization scattered scatter plots and whatnot a couple of things to note with this one selection when I came up with this notice it gives me some ability to say off let me I don't want that I want to go select something else but I can go back to this this is essentially allows you to have a preview of what if you were to do something like this this is what you might look at and is that indeed what you anticipated I could say yep that's the one so I'll just make that the final selection and now I can scope my further explorations within the context of the United States and you notice as I'm doing that in the upper left hand corner of the screen you see this country USA that's a little cookie trail where it is logging what selections I indeed have made I can also deselect this very quickly as well a couple of other things about this smart visualizations before I get into some details here notice that there's a scroll bar here for this bar chart as I scroll down this is very useful not terribly interesting with the amount of volume of data that we're having shown here in this particular example but imagine if you will you have quite a high degree of volume well you can only see yet so much reasonably in in a screen but having this thumbnail off to the side allows you to be able to scroll into various areas and for example in this particular graph down here in the bar chart at the bottom you see there's one particular aspect that is an outlier it really sticks out or you might have the data sorted in a way where you can see this outlier but it's way down at the end of the screen so it gives you that ability to see a very broad swath of information and be able to see that in a very reasonable way right off of that a lot of interesting selectivity with this as well and we'll get into that in just a just a moment the other aspect I wanted to show in terms of smart visualizations I'll zoom in on the scatter chart one of the things is well the hallmarks of this new release of click sense is the cult concept of progressive disclosure you've got a whole bunch of information here and notice that only certain aspects are actually labeled but if I simply zoom in using my mouse or if I were doing pinch actions on on a mobile device you could see that as I get more detailed level and zoom in on the picture more and more labels are are being displayed because otherwise you just it would just be a blob of text and bubbles with that you can't certainly can't understand what they are at that higher level but as you zoom in it makes more and more sense so there's a you know does it a good example of smart visualizations especially when dealing with a high volume of information now what about selectivity yeah I can certainly highlight this particular scatterplot and go in and I can simply lasso variety of different ways here with my mouse if I go Berzerk there that yep as I'm selecting this everything is active I can select in the map I can select on the bar chart and everything responds automatically to that I can make that selection permanent as an example but suppose you have a user they don't know fields they don't know the concept of you know database they don't know anything about sequel they they want to be able to just find some information about clothing and so there's a selections tool that allows you to go in and look at the entire our underlying model similar to a Google search of your of the underlying data and I just want to look at something that starts with cloth and I've got a category here it shows customers with this name their suppliers that have that in there but really what I'm looking at is men and and bath clothes I can use that as my selection and that automatically scopes when I'm showing here and I can further you can see that selection here in the upper left hand corner of category name so I didn't even know need to know what the what the field name was for this if you will and if I select the US make that a further selection I can start honing in on what I'm really interested in I see well I've got even the map I've got some interesting I want to look at the cities within the map and let me I'm going to just make this a little bit bigger so we can see it a little bit easier like just like I could on the others I can go in and lasso particular selection I see that I've got an extra outlier here that's a little smaller and I really want to focus on that I can deselect that if I wanted to and now I'm honing in on just that set of cities you notices that drills down to the Seattle Kirkland and Eugene now I can do some further analysis looking at the various products and the margins of products and do some further analysis on that now what happens if I were looking at this on an iPad for an example of the the tip of the hat to the responsive design aspects I alluded to earlier but I don't have this actually accessible on an iPad with the the WebEx situation here but what I can do is take this entire screen and shrink it down to a size that an iPad might look like if I simply reduce the size to some reasonable facsimile of you notice that the system automatically adjusted the the various visualizations to smart in a smart way fit into that aspect of the size of the screen and this doesn't require any programming this is actually just totally out of the box and notice down here at the bottom I made mention of the fact of you know there was an outlier way off to the side here that I'm not seeing in the actual visualizations that outlier was mentioning earlier I could then quickly scroll and see where that outlier is and even as I go up a little further notice how the visualizations they kind of abbreviate those bars to fit into that smaller space in a very intelligent way and show that expansion so you could see exactly that there's more data here but you can actually hover over this and see the final amount so all in all very flexible very smart visualizations for providing that intuitive data discovery that we alluded to earlier what I'm going to do now is leap in so what how hard was this this dashboard to build I'm not going to build the entire dashboard I'll build the bar chart the scatter chart just to give you a sense of no pun intended of what this might look like and what I'll do is I'll go to the hub this is the essentially the central place where I can start developing my apps and here I've got a variety of applications that are already out there that I can call up note that if the basis of click sense it is browser-based it just uses an html5 browser so there's nothing that's required on the if you were accessing this on a server all you need it as a browser for that does nothing has to be installed locally necessarily if you're doing a shared server environment in the desktop environment it's a very browser-based interface so I'm going to create a new application and I'm just going to simply call it dashboard I'm going to open it up and what I'm going to do is take the same set of information that was in that prior example application and show you how easy it is using not point-and-click necessary just simple drag-and-drop gestures so that the accessibility to the functionality within click sense is going to be far more broader and audience applicable audience I think you'll see a to allow them to get access to the power of that dashboard the first thing I want to do is take my customer information baseline demographics and I want to get that loaded into my app well how do I do that I simply drag and drop it as case it gives me the ability to change field names select a subset of information here across the top these column headings this is coming from Excel spreadsheet but I've missed for the sake of our example today I'm just going to load this data and edit the sheet and before I go any further I'm just going to actually build that bar chart that we saw earlier just to show you how easy it is to to build something right off the bat to go from an initial data loads as some visualizations so in this case I'm going to build a bar chart like we saw before I'm going to simply drag and drop it I'm going to add a dimension and I go over to my data area here this the fields that were brought over and as I can see my country field I can simply drag and drop that and add country if I want to add a measure I can drag and drop it or I can simply add this and I want to get a count of customer so I point a customer I'm just going to do a count and now I've got my graph I may want to do some tweaking to this I may want to change the labels here to make it a little bit more descriptive so I have a properties pane in this edit mode off to the right hand side and I'll call that summer count they want to change some further appearance aspects of this I may want to get under presentation and I want to flip that to the horizontal I want to change the colors to match what I had before and instead just the automatic I want to make it by a measure and to make this match up completely with the original app I can reverse the color gradients as I see fit I can sit there and also add the bar title of customers by country I could also change the sorting and again a discount I'm counting so the highest is sorting first but if I want to sort it by country I can do it this way as well I could just simply swap back and forth now I'm done so I can save my work done and I've done visualization not terribly interesting because there's nothing to compare it to we'd like to add some additional information this to make this a little bit more useful but you can get see the selectivity is all there built into the system now I want to do is go back in and I want to or add order information so I have an orders spreadsheet I want to be able to get that loaded into the system and you know before I had just a desktop or a facade of the application do I have to go to a specific area do I have to go to a particular thing to get this loaded no I just simply drag and drop it and I'm going to add this because GUI had some information you'd overwrite it same thing we saw before this case I'll just for something different I'll change this to costs just to change the the data and I'll go ahead and load that so now if I go to my fields you see there's an extended list of information at my fingertips that's been automatically added with this I'd like to just mention and show some examples of this final little link this is a master items and this is something that I think that folks are going to find very very useful it's an ability for you to develop a reusable area for your dimensions measures and even visualizations that have already been built or gathered together and put that in a reusable area for a broader usage community or even by the offer originating author themselves and how would I develop this reusable area very simply in this case I'm going to take an example from take a subset of information out of the mastered data that we see here and pull out a set of dimensions that I think are going to be very commonly used so if I simply create I'm going to take country and add that as a dimension I'm going to take customer add that as a dimension I mean want to do a drill down across multiple dimensions on the fly this is not built into it the data necessarily I'm kind of providing this as an overlay I go country city and customer and I'm just going to call that geography and add that as a dimension I may also want to do some very basic calculation kinds of things so in this case I may want to pluck the year out of the order date that's in the data model here of course for months done with dimensions now want to go into create a few measures and we saw a margin percent that was in the prior example application and so in this case I can develop a calculation where I'm summing the gross profit divided by the sum over all sum of sale and apply that as my margin I can spell it right percent and I may also just want to get some of sales by itself as an item so now this is becomes a a reusable area of the data so you don't have to go through an entire data model which could get fairly extensive so this could be a tighter more focused area perhaps have some more advanced calculations so you don't have to do that every time and I can now take advantage of that by going and adding that scatter plot that we saw in that earlier application now I'll just put that over to the side here in this case I can do the go over to my dimensions and grab my geography and add that as a dimension I can grab my margin percent calculation and add that as a measure and bring over my sales and voila I've got my visualization on already built for me automatically now here I may also want to do a few things make the numbers are not all that great in terms of formatting in this case that way want to take my fails or my margin percent and instead of doing that I want to make it a number and I want to make it a percent for sales I want to make it money to make it more readable some additional things like like that that you typically want to tweak and now I can do I save and start doing some manipulations look at the USA go in here look at a particular set of data so all the selectivity that I showed you earlier it exists again this is all automatic behind the scenes and the same you know progressive disclosures notice that idea if these dots between Spain and Venezuela don't have labels until I start suing in on it little home button allows me to kind of get back to where I was and the same global selection mechanism that I had before exists as well now what that we may want to do with this is do one final little tweak maybe what I want to do is be able to customize this a little bit to provide some listbox filtering to those of you who are familiar with click view this is kind of a typical style that you'll see click view applications so for those of you who are involved in that product you could simply grab over from that master list the country I may want to grab the year month and now I've got I've added a little bit more interactivity to to the dashboard so now I can go in and select when I look at the last two years maybe the first quarter if you will and I can look at specific countries or maybe I want to look at Canada and the United States I could do some further selectivity there just a quick note on developing a story because we've actually shown a story before but how it was a you know a story app built in this case what I could do is that's uh after this we'll just keep it what we've got right here and I can go in here in the snapshot mode and I can actively take a snapshot of and that snapshot actually remembers what any what if any selections were active in the application at the time I take a snapshot selected snapshot both of these get out of snapshot mode go ahead and create a story I'll just keep keep that as the default and now I can start looking at those snapshots and bringing those in and I can start annotating it with text we won't get to the sake of time I won't go to a great deal of detail because I think everybody pretty much gets the idea of how this is being built and I can overlay shapes across this as well so I can go here and highlight something over here that you want to like we saw before with the prior this outlier and the counts etcetera etcetera and save our story now if I were to go back into the actual app you notice I've got selections here already done based on my snapshots I go back to counter default state but then I go back to my story and I highlight this see Germany is way up here I can now go to source and lo and behold it remembered that because of the snapshots remembered what I was doing at the time I made a snapshot so this is kind of a picture in time to go back to that so it's truly a snapshot in time of that information that was really all I was going to talk about at this point I think we're at the point 140 probably good time for some questions thank you very much Peter so yes this is the time now to use your webinar pain that's in the upper right corner of your screen and send in your questions for our presenters so we do have a first question that's come in and that is what you see as the biggest advantages of clixsense versus Microsoft power pivot and Power View so John I'm gonna throw that your way yeah thanks Mary so um we do work as well with Microsoft how do you empower pivot we have a large Microsoft Dynamics ERP and CRM practice here at our Mannino and so therefore get involved in some Microsoft data warehousing and bi projects as well I think it's a little difficult to go through a you know a full comparison in the time that we have here on this webinar some of the things that we've seen is can be due to just the preference of certain users power Power View power pivot is a little bit of an Excel add-in and people who like being in Excel can can work with that product and like that I think some of the volume data volume restrictions that you that you get that we see in Power View and power pivot would be one of the things that I might stand out with click view although this demonstration isn't necessarily a large volume of data we are we are very used to dealing with hundreds of millions of records in these applications I also think the mobile piece that is again a little difficult to demonstrate Peter showed you how the screen resolution is device aware and unshrink sin so there it really it's um it's it's horses for courses different people have different opinions what we try and do is not necessarily restrict which products they should use but I think there's there's a place for for both of those in in what we what we build for our clients okay and here the next question I believe is for you and it is is click you next and click sense are they the same product yes quickly next was kind of the precursor product name to click sense it was kind of the code name if you will so the click sense is now the official release product great ok well good we thank you we've gotten our questions answered and would like to invite the audience if there's any questions that you have following up you can email John Horner directly and we will provide his contact information to each of you at the close of the webinar but we thank you for joining us today and hope that you learned a lot of valuable things about clixsense have a great day
