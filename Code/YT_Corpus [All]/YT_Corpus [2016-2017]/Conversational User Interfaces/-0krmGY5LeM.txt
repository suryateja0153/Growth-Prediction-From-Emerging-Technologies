 so thank you for having me I'm very glad that all you came here today a few words about me and about our team I'm David and I'm leading we are now 17 people user experience design studio you can see some of our guys here on the picture and what we do is we are working with product guys like you to design outstanding product experiences and what we usually do is that we delegate a designer and the researcher to design those digital product and in our experience this is a really good combination because designers are very creative they can build prototypes they can do beautiful picture perfect UI and on the other hand or researchers are like business analysts they can do in-depth research and get customer insights and this combination with this combination we can design products that people will actually use and love so what I'm going to talk about today is for design stories that will showcase why this combination works so let's get interesting my first case study is about a CRM system so sales people use this CRM to keep track of their prospects and leads and this is a really old design like five years old design of this software and to redesign this software we did some field studies so we met with a guy called Attila he's a sales guy and he was using this software and we spent a few days together and during one of these days we realized that what article I did every morning is he opened the CRM system and he opened the profile pages of each prospect on different tabs and he had a Firefox plugin that led him to color their steps so the dark blue tabs were the prospects that were important they were the guys who were ready to buy and light blue tabs were the not so important leads so when we saw that he does that we realized that it's very important for those sales guys to prioritize their leads so when we let redesign this application we put little colorful tags next to each each lead each profile so when they open this application they will see which prospects are the important ones that they have to start work with and which are the last important ones so with this move we can free up like half an hour for Attila every morning which was of course very useful for him so what we learned from what you can learn from this story is that if you go out from your office and if you actually meet with the people you are designing for you will you can get very useful insights and you can design a much better product my second story is about a mortgage calculator what you can see here it's it's very simple basically you can set the type of the property you want to buy you can set the mortgage term say how long will it take to pay back the money to the bank you can set the mortgage amount and hit the calculate button so when we designed this calculator we invited a lot of people to our office we were actually buying apartments that time and we observed how they use this design and we learned that there are two phases for buying a mortgage the first phase is when people try to find out how much credit do they have so they know how much is their salary how much money they can pay back to the bank every month so they try to calculate how much how big loan they can get from the bank and when they know the amount for example they know okay I can get like 10 million Hungarian forints then they compare different different offers and they try to find the best offer for the bank from the banks so as you can see there is one big problem with this design about it doesn't support the first phase at all so you can search by writing in the monthly cost of the of the mortgage so however it is it is very easy to use calculator it's not useful for the people so we redesigned it we put two tabs on this new design there is the traditional tab where you can search based on the mortgage amount and there's another tab where you can search based on the monthly payment the other thing that confused people on this calculator was the mortgage time so let's be honest most of us don't really know what will happen to us in a few years how can we make decisions about like in what will happen in 20 years time so the way I wanna get this mortgage for like 20 years or 25 or just 10 it's very difficult to make decisions make this kind of long-term decisions so when we designed the result page for this calculator we decided to put the different versions of the same loan next to each other so you can see the ten years that when 15 years and the 20 years a really long mortgage so this way you can compare the different numbers and it's a little bit easier to make decisions because now you have something to compare it so from this story we learned that we have to test every design we create because if you test those designs with real people from your audience you will get very useful insights and from those insights with those insights you can design a much better product so the best way of doing this is to create a quick prototype first test still with people iterate on this prototype and then do the final picture-perfect design and then develop it of course okay so I think many of you are product managers or product owners here can you put up your hands if you are some kind of product management guys or you are leading product development teams some of you yes ok cool so I think many of you have to make decisions about what feature to build next because that's one of the most important questions a product manager or product owner has to answer we have limited resources what will we use those resources for we worked together with the startup to create a tumblr add-on and of course they were startup they had very limited resources and we wanted to find out what will be the next feature that we have to build so what you can see here is this this tumblr add-on is for is for content discoveries so you can find nice pictures you can share on your tumblr blog and in the first version there is a caption caption below the picture and the first version you couldn't edit that caption so we had the idea to make this editing possible but instead of developing this feature we just add a little pencil icon there and we measured how many people will click on that icon and we get quite good results many people were clicking on that icon and it was fake so if you clicked on that icon pop-up came up and it says sorry we are very busy building this feature and it will be ready soon bla bla bla bla bla si so it was really just an icon and it took us like half an hour to implement this feature and we measured the clicks and it was quite successful so but after that instead of starting coding this feature we changed the pop-up so now it shows you the premium plan and you can see that the first feature in the premium plan is custom caption so actually it isn't a real premium plan thing if you click on the PayPal button you will get another pop-up that says that I'm sorry it's not really working yet but this way we can measure how many people will actually pay for this function and this trick is called fake door testing and this is a very very nice method to test which feature will be used by your users yeah I know it's a little bit like Deitrick so be careful with it but even big companies like the television brand here Airtel group is using this fake door testing and even like other big companies like Ustream is using this so so be careful but you can use this to do tests which Beach features will be popular okay so this is swag door testing this was my search story and here comes my last design and research story for today and it's about self-driving cars it's a very hot topic nowadays today the Hungarian Prime Minister mentioned that we have to produce self-driving technology here in the country yeah no comments here so yeah he said we have to so why we did a project about self-driving and we try to design the user interface of course of those cars and what you can see here is that we imagined a car where there's a tablet in the middle of the dashboard and this tablet will be one of the interfaces where you can control the car or set or adjust settings so the big problem with self-driving technology is its trust you know there are many cars in the roads many autonomous cars on the roads in San Francisco and now we have data we know that those cars are actually safe so they can drive safer than humans but still if you sit in those cars you are you're afraid right it's like airplanes we know that they are very safe safe but still we have this feeling so the designers job here is to build this trust in the and to do that we examined how we how we behave in real cars so if there's someone else is driving next to you and there is a dangerous situation you look at the face of the driver to check whether he sees that obstacle coming and we put this tablet there which will be the face of our self-driving software so all the time anytime if you look there you will see what the car sees around you this is the first prototype we did you can see that there is the street there are some obstacles like pedestrians a bicycle maybe some other cars and and we highlighted the dangerous obstacle obstacles the dangerous objects with the red box so the man standing there and the bicycle and of course we tested it with people so unfortunately we don't really have a self-driving car here I'm sorry but we try to mimic it with a real car and with the tablet and with this quick prototype and when we showed it to two people they understood this this interface they understood that those red objects are the sources of danger and but they tried to do something because they thought that the computer highlights those objects because you have to interact you have to do something with with them so they try to touch the tablet for example and this is a problem because it's an autonomous car and you can do anything it drives itself so this design was actually bad people became stressed because they saw the danger and they couldn't do anything so or in our final design we use the different solution we tested this also with people and in this solution we draw just a red line between the dangerous object and ourselves so it's like a fence it separates us from from that object and it also tells or shows that the car is like creating a separate lane for that bike so it won't enter that our area and when we tested this with people it was working working well they understood this thing I also have this animation that shows you how it works ok so this was another story about why user testing and research is important and sometimes your original idea your first idea is not working with real people so you just have to test and iterate on those ideas and create quick prototypes and basically that's what we do at UX studio so this was my first story thank you very much for your attention if you want to read more stories like this I just wrote a book it's called the UX design surprisingly and you can order the book on UX to do that hu / ux guys it's in hungarian so sorry for english speakers okay so thank you very much for your attention and if you have any questions just ask thanks so my question would be how long for the last example to get from the very first prototype on to the final design how many iterations in time okay so how many iterations and how how much time does it take yep so it was like this project had a lot of like features so this was just a small part of this thing so we spent the first week with brainstorming and ideation about many many aspects of self-driving and then on the second week we did prototyping and testing it was basically this part was just one week so we created some quick sketches and and wireframes we tested those and next day then we did it again and again so yeah it was it was basically one week what we usually do with because it was it was a lab project for us what we do with real projects for example like when we design some kind of enterprise software is that we are working in week-long design sprints and all those design sprints have a design phase and a research phase so we start designing something then at the end of the week Thursday Friday we do our tests so next week when there's the sprint meeting we can say okay that's what we designed those with the feedback from the users and we can now make decisions some part is working well we can send it to development some part is not really working well we can iterate one more round on okay any other questions no then thank you very much for your attention
