 greetings Dennis Daniels here this is the law bought chatbot on a galaxy note 3 android 5 it's a great idea but there is definitely some UI issues on handheld devices namely you can't really see what you're typing when the keyboard gets in the way I'll show you what I mean you can see that the previous chat is entirely consumed by the keyboard and because the keyword dominates the screen I can't read what's there I tap on it and then tap again I say ok and you see that again the text is all gone now if I if I accidentally pull down and get the refresh button then it starts all over again so it's it's very fussy and that's not what was something that you want when trying to interact with a chat bot so for the law but developers keep in mind a keyboard gets in the way on handheld devices oh it looks like just crashed on me and it keeps keeps reloading so there's no session there's no session memory either which makes sense because it's supposed to be personal and you don't want your legal information spread around on the web robots a great idea the UI needs help there is also the option for may be speaking directly to the device it's not going to work because I'm recording anyway thanks for watching and happy computing
