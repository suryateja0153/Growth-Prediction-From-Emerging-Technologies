 our mental well-being affects how we deal with stress how we relate to others and how we express ourselves mental well-being is comprised of three key components emotional psychological and social well-being problems with mental well-being can occur at any point in our lives one in five old adults have a mental health problem such as depression or anxiety due to limited capacity NHS mental health services are only capable of helping 15% of those who need help to help combat this situation we need to offer patients more treatment options one of these options is etheric II which can be delivered via computer tablet or smartphone research suggests etheric be supported by a remote therapist can be as effective as face-to-face therapy however many therapies fail to consider old adults in the design and development process meaning they face unique barriers and challenges when it comes to using e therapy my research will look at the impact of redesigning an e therapy for an older adult sample to do this I will be using an existing a therapy known as manage your life online or my life for short three studies will be carried out to determine the requirements of the redesign a system assessment to find out if Milo is acceptable to old adults in its present form a usability study to determine what issues if any older adults have with Milo and a focus group to discuss how Milo could potentially be improved through the use of specialist technology such as voice recognition speech synthesis avatars and touch screens once this data has been collected the redesign will be planned and implemented and one final study will be carried out to see if the acceptability of Milo has improved as a result of the redesign it is hoped that these studies will contribute the small amount of research currently available regard older adult II therapies thank you for listening
