 hi my name is Sean I'm a partner additional intent and I'm here to talk to you today about conversational interfaces and chat BOTS the opportunities they present the questions they raise and ultimately why we think that it makes sense to pursue initiatives in this space as I mentioned I'm Sean I'm a partner digital tent and founder equity here in Chicago and I teach digital marketing at Kellogg in the Innovation Program and digital tent is a what we call sort of an innovation team in a box we're an innovation development firm and we help four to five hundred thousand companies identify product opportunities that can be can manifest themselves in digital solutions and then we design and build them for them and then in many cases actually help them try to get traction and help them grow and big a big part of what we do is try to identify emerging opportunities emerging platforms and look for ways to kind of help businesses leverage them and obviously that kind of leads us to what we're talking about today which is sound at a conversational interface and the rise of chat BOTS and all that kind of thing so I'm guessing that most of you probably have some sense for what I'm talking about here but just a quick preamble on how we kind of identify identify or define these things internally in the past we communicated with computers uh via the terminal at the command line it required people to kind of have a working knowledge of the guts of the machine it required for very precise syntax not all that kind of thing and eventually we moved to this second sort of wave which we called the graphical interface and it made it much easier to interact with a machine in many cases that leveraged mental models kind of from the physical world to represent digital artifacts but rather than having to remember very precise syntax I could just point and click and all that kind of thing and the system would be responsive but a third wave is kind of emerged and and it's what we're calling the conversational interface and in some ways or many ways it kind of returns to the simplicity of the command line and that it is primarily a text-based medium but I think it defers and that rather than requiring the user to know exact commands it offers them the ability to kind of interact with a machine or even a person behind the machine using natural language which at a minimum makes it much more user friendly than the command-line and at best is actually able to parse complicated requests and execute them kind of in real time and return a result to the user that feels almost magical in short we've kind of moved from a paradigm of us having to learn how to interact with computers to a world now where computers are learning how to interact with us which is pretty exciting stuff I should state at the outset that the conversational interfaces does not necessarily mean BOTS know a lot of what we're going to talk about today are BOTS related and BOTS can certainly interact with users through conversational interfaces but you can also augment conversational interfaces with humans or even have them rely entirely on humans I should also state that that even though we're going to be talking a lot about these BOTS platforms and you know Facebook Messenger and all that kind of thing conversational interfaces lend themselves just as well to native app experiences they're fantastic for onboarding new users they there are many use cases some of which we'll discuss today that are just as relevant outside of the big messaging platforms and if you're leveraging BOTS or anything that kind of thing you can actually leverage the same technology which is cool last kind of bit of sort of background when you are talking about BOTS and sort of this sort of machine learning kind of paradigm there's really two sort of models that people are using right now the first is called a retrieval based model which you can think of as is similar to kind of a phone tree and that it has a predefined set of responses and it uses some kind of an algorithm to pick the appropriate response based on the users input in the context in which that are in and so while while the machine is learning or parsing the intent of the request it is not generating responses on the fly so you could think of it as sort of kind of being being smart on the front end and maybe a little bit dumb on the back end generative models don't rely on predefined responses and so they're actually smart kind of on both sides so they generate new responses from scratch they're typically based on kind of machine translation techniques which we've used for a long time in terms of translating one language to another both approaches have some pros and cons to them with a repository of kind of these handcrafted responses you can create a syn we're over time that that library gets built up into you know 10,000 responses or whatever and it can be kind of hard to maintain and it it theoretically lacks a little bit of the the magic to it generative interfaces theoretically are smarter and when they work well they give the impression that you're talking to a human but they're they're really hard to train they require tons and tons of data that are very likely to make grammatical mistakes early on and candidly I think most of the platforms that you would be leveraging for this stuff at least today are pretty much retrievable based models anyway and so while generative is definitely has promises and exciting and that's kind of I'm sure where things are going to be going for the most part you're going to be dealing with retrieval based models in the short term so why do we think conversational interfaces are interesting well obviously users seem to prefer them these various messaging services that kind of sprung up over the last few years and there's even you know rise of platforms like Siri or Amazon echo that don't rely on typed out text but they still represent conversational interfaces potentially even in kind of a better manifestation of them if anyone who's ever used an echo can attest to their it feels pretty magical when you use it so you have all these platforms that have scale in fact it took less than four years for them to eclipse social networks in terms of active users so users clearly like these kinds of interactions maybe even preferring them to other kinds of interactions and I think there's a couple of reasons why one is they feel more personal than apps so downloaded apps are basically the same for all users you have the same kind of Chrome and and the experience for the most part is pretty rigid as you kind of navigating between them because bots are so simple and all of the the chrome kind of gets taken away although the imager gets taken away all you're interacting with is text and that sounds plain and and maybe for the first couple of interactions or first couple of user requests maybe there's a lot of overlap between one user and another but very quickly because they're parsing the intent and kind of customizing responses for people the the interaction can kind of take on a life of its own which can feel pretty magical and so some things that you could do with that you could theoretically customized by the type of users so the same request to two different members of an organization that are in different roles could give different responses and kind of customize their experience that way you could also customize the way in which information is presented to them so as an user interacts with a machine and you learn sort of what their preferences are you can rather than having them kind of create filters and say filters and kind of click all around and all that kind of thing you can do that work for them and remember those preferences for later second thing is I think that they're more appropriate for many kinds of interactions so the four we did a lot of customer development we were talking to users as we were trying to wrap our heads around the opportunities that are kind of present in this this this way of kind of interacting with machines and there were a couple things that kind of came to the front the first one was brands have a desire to have a very deep relationship with their customer which makes a lot of sense but customers often don't necessarily want to have that same depth of relationship with them and when it comes to kind of their an app on their home screen they tend to be really selective about the kind of apps that they put on their phones and that didn't used to always be the case people would try out an experiment a lot of different things but App Store demand has kind of calcified in a way where most users are downloading no new apps per month and it's just they interact with all of these brands they they shop at retailers and they have a relationship with their mortgage company or all these kinds of things but they don't necessarily want to have an app for that on their home screen and so why that's an opportunity with conversational interfaces is they said that they would be more than willing to interact with with a brand you know through something like a Facebook Messenger or something like that where they can jump in get their question asked accomplish the task that they're trying to accomplish and then get out without necessarily having it on their home screen second reason was there are circumstances where users are sharing personal information where they actually like the idea of having a machine be the one interpreting it so things like diet or exercise tracking or for sharing financial information those kinds of things they like the idea of having a sort of an objective third party that that is not kind of judging them as they're kind of interacting and and one other thing about that too is they actually said that if the user assuming that the responses are accurate they would rather communicate with a bot in real time than a user who has to go and hunt for an answer for them and where there's kind of a lag so the delay and the latency is kind of an important variable there too third reason was related to kind of browsing versus curating and we don't think that traditional e-commerce is going anywhere obviously the rise of Pinterest and image based tools kind of lends credence to the idea that that sometimes people want to just sort of sit back and relax and it kind of browse through lots of of products and for an e-commerce retailer excuse me for an e-commerce retailer with you know 10,000 SKUs trying to shoehorn that experience into a conversational interface probably does not make sense but there is a good opportunity there from a curation perspective where they could have the a different kind of experience that's kind of more that more fit than modality of a conversational interface and there's times where people actually want your help and want you say hey I don't want to look through 10,000 items I want you to kind of pick you know five or six items that would be perfect for me the last thing kind of related to kids so there are anybody that has a teen kind of knows how they consume content very differently than we do they're there they're sending hundreds of text messages or thousands of text messages they live on snapchat they almost never check an email and other than Instagram they're a lot less likely to use social sites like Twitter and Facebook then the noldor folks are and so if you're a brand that is trying to reach that audience leveraging conversational interfaces probably makes a lot of sense and also kind of thinking forward like those those teens are gonna go to college and they're maybe in the professional world it's likely that that these habits they've kind of developed and the Preferences that they've sort of established from in terms of how they want to interact with machines will carry forward and so it's likely that they will have a stronger preference for this kind of going forward as well the third reason why we think conversational interfaces are so interesting is that they're available whenever kind of a user wants them and so it's becoming important to think about our products and services in the right context we're no longer a web app or a mobile app those are simply delivery mechanisms for the product or service that we happen to offer and that that sounds very obvious but you can get kind of tunnel vision and kind of locked in to the idea that we're mobile app or a web app person like that and so smart companies have been experimenting with this kind of stuff Taco Bell implemented a chatbot inside of slack Domino's Pizza implemented a you could where you could order a pizza actually from a tweet and something just quick aside there something that's really important is is in order to execute on something like that successfully you have to have a mechanism to understand user preferences really well so in Domino's the case they have kind of a user profile that you can select sort of this is my go-to I you know all the things being equal or generally speaking I'm gonna order a medium pepperoni pizza or whatever and by saving that preference all I have to do is tweet at them with even like a pizza emoji and it will it'll know what that means and it'll send me a medium pepperoni pizza so having a mechanism to capture preferences like that becomes really important in order to execute a conversational interface as well another example is uber allowing you to order a a ride from a variety of platforms Facebook messenger from from your echo that kind of thing and the echo one is pretty clever too because you realize again they understand context because they know they know your location because an echo is sort of a stationary device and it is either at your house or at your job or or whatever and so they understand context that way so it can literally be as simple as saying a single sentence and it will route you in the right way one other kind of quick assign around around this kind of concept is users also told us they like the idea of being able to interact with multiple divisions of a brand from a single interface and so rather than having to call a different phone number for sales versus customer support or whatever they can ask that question through a single kind of text input or command line or whatever and have the system route them to the appropriate person and with the right integrations that's that's you know relatively easy to do and creates a much better experience for the user and then the last thing is that you have the ability to kind of make non experts into experts and so through integrations you can kind of take disparate or complex systems and you can translate them into kind of bite-sized actionable information that customers could leverage so and this is an example of a development firm that leverage Google Analytics API to basically surface the stuff that is most relevant to a user so Google Analytics is sort of like an iceberg and you can really dig down into it and there's all kinds of stuff that they could do but if I could interact with that data through a text or a conversational interface it becomes pretty interesting because I can get just just the exact information that I want to get out of it and know more so that was kind of a pretty cool opportunity as well so for all these reasons it's not unreasonable to envision a scenario where your home screen kind of becomes the messaging app or multiple messaging apps where you've got all of these kind of threaded conversations with your friends and with brands kind of happening sort of interchangeably that's that's not an unreasonable kind of future to sort of envision and so having some space on that on that screen becomes pretty important obviously so assuming that you've kind of bought into this idea that conversational interfaces are important and you want to kind of dip your toes in it how do you go about doing that it's important to kind of the first thing to say is that that building a bot is easy you can build one in a weekend building a bot that actually does useful things though can actually be pretty hard because you think about it you got in the middle you've got kind of your bot brain and let's we'll say that you know it's assumed that's sort of a retrieval based model but it's able to take input from you understand your intent and then spit something back to you in order for it to do something meaningful there's this whole kind of underlying layer that has to happen obviously you've got you know a database or some sort of system that represents kind of your unique sort of delivery vehicle in terms of the product or service that you're kind of delivering and so it needs to pull data from that system somehow and then very often you have integrations on their platforms so I want to integrate with Salesforce or when angry with with my e-commerce platform or whatever to kind of serve up the right data it needs to be able to to stitch all that stuff together and be able to kind of pull from those relevant data sources when needed and deliver that beta data back to them many of these systems you need to augment at least in the beginning with some sort of human intervention and so you need agents that are either able to interact directly with users or at a minimum are able to kind of track the conversations that are kind of happening so that they can iterate on their on your interface and kind of improve it over time and then obviously you have the platforms themselves each of which kind of have a different modality and different way of kind of communicating with users they leverage their own technology and syntax and code and all that kind of thing and there's different expectations that users have and so users will expect to have a different kind of interaction inside of slack then they would inside of instead of facebook Messenger or through their Amazon echo and so kind of getting all that stuff plumb all that plumbing kind of tied together obviously you can see it becomes a little bit more elaborate I already mentioned this but well you know obviously the promise of kind of Jenner to base systems is exciting really this is sort of a non-issue because the platforms that you're going to be leveraging all pretty much leverage your your place models for now anyway now there's there's great the companies that are trying to to think towards the future so like whit is a good example of they follow kind of decision tree logic where you kind of identify entities and intents and all that kind of thing and then give them sort of a series of kind of answers or code to execute or those kinds of things and then the idea is that behind the scenes they've got a learner and that learner is kind of getting smarter over time and obviously that's the play with these platforms is the that machine learning is ultimately a data play and that's what data becomes incredibly important in terms of teaching a system on how to do that and so obviously these platforms are springing up because they want you to use them and you know 10,000 other developers to use them and then in aggregate you guys are teaching their systems to become a lot smarter and that's a very smart play you know for Facebook and Amazon and Apple and all these players to kind of definitely do that doesn't mean that you shouldn't leverage them I think obviously the likelihood that they're gonna build an intelligent learning interface or a generative based interface is a lot higher than the likelihood that your brand will and that doesn't mean you don't use them it's just something to be aware of that'sthat's that's probably why they're there they're doing that but long story short you're gonna be leveraging a retriever based model so plan on you know sort of a decision tree based type of system I definitely in the short term second thing is to really narrow the domain so the less a bot does the better it's going to do whatever it is that it's supposed to do and and the it also means it's going to be much easier to communicate the domain to the user which means that the better the user experience is going to going to be for them so it's better be known for doing something really well so from a user pure user experience perspective they're not going to expect that your bot can talk with them cogently about politics right they may try and test the edges and you see very often that's one of the first things that people very often do with conversational interfaces is they try to figure out what can the what can the bot answer and what can the botton on answer but just because the body is not able to answer a question does not mean that as an inferior user experience the important thing is can the bot answer a question that is relevant to the domain and relevant to the expectations that you have set for the user so as long as it's able to do that you're in good shape and so it makes a lot of sense to communicate the bot scope very early on during the onboarding experience or that kind of thing a second thing is to spend a lot of time doing error handling so alignment is super important bots need to very gracefully handle errors because every response that's kind of out of alignment with user expectations is going to erode confidence in the bot that magic is going to go away it's going to increase the likelihood that a user abandons the good news is that the UI is basically your log file so every single interaction that a customer has if you have a product team that is paying attention to those interactions and is using that information they can teach the interface and make it better on a daily basis or even an hourly basis one framework that we use additional amount ten all the time in the basis for my class at Kellogg is what we call the customer funnel and this is basically dave McClure startup metrics for pirates in a pretty triangle but their five-roll kind of levers that you can kind of manipulate from a product perspective you've got acquisition so users come to your site through various channels you got activation they signup they go through our onboarding experience that kind of thing retention they come back revenue you obviously monetize them somehow and then referral they tell their friends and so when we started looking at conversational interfaces we thought it was important to kind of look through look at it through the lens of each one of these levers and so starting at the top with acquisition we don't necessarily think that that bonds and conversational interfaces are primarily an acquisition medium so we do think that they're going to be really great for retention we do think they're going to essentially be great for referral at some point but thinking of them primarily as an acquisition play I don't necessarily know that that makes sense for one thing we don't necessarily know how new apps are going to be discovered there's a lot of people that are trying stuff slack has its bought directory Facebook has its directory all that kind of thing Facebook's doing a lot of experimentation with like send a messenger buttons and and you know kind of QR code like badges that you can put on there I think that most likely they will be rolling out ad units very similar to app install ad units I would be shocked if they don't do that at which point you know Facebook ads become the acquisition channel and instead of driving them into your app you your mobile app you're driving them into your messaging platform but I don't think that you can think of them primarily as an acquisition interface the only caveat I would put with that is that there may be your users that would not have been acted with or not what it would not have downloaded a mobile app that would be more likely to download something like this or started to - to start a conversation with a bot and so that's a that's a consideration or something kind of keep in mind now from an activation perspective an onboarding perspective I think this is this is key right the user is going to decide whether or not to engage with your bot or with your conversational interface on the basis of about the first couple of interactions and so what can you do there well first of all again just to reiterate narrowing the scope is super super important letting letting the user know this is what this BOTS purpose is this is what it can do and what it cannot do is going to be critical the second thing is is make sure that it has personality since since languages and text is really all that you have to use here the biggest opportunity that you have to increase user delight is to other than kind of being able to execute complex queries and return you know complicated kind of stuff in a way that users appreciate the next best way is through personality and so just as you would pay attention to how your brand communicates on Twitter or on a website it's really important to create kind of a personality for your bottom through your messaging interface and so we've made an investment internally bringing on some improv folks I think authors and poets who are really gifted at creating narrative are going to be incredibly important in creating these kinds of experiences and so when it gets time to kind of implement something like this your first step is going to be to create the narrative that you want users to have and to the degree that you have really great writers or people that can can write copy that has personality to it it will increase the likelihood that people adopt your product a simplified data entry that's super important so leveraging built in functionality as much as you possibly can is going to be important so in this example that you know they're assuming kind of location either they learned that from your user preferences previously or maybe they asked you to prompt your location using the location button and the bottom of the tool bar or there are brands that actually have explicit location permission from interfaces like Facebook already so Luber for example which is really tightly integrated with the Facebook messenger platform has explicit sort of location permission so Facebook knows your location and is passing it directly to Oberer it does not appear that that's functionality that they've opened up to the larger community yet other than kind of their sort of preferred list or initial list of kind of brands that have that have built BOTS on the platform but it's not unreasonable to assume that that's going to be direction that they're going in and so to the degree that they do that if you can leverage user preferences and in or information that you've gathered from the user to simplify data entry that'll be important the point is that you kind of want to avoid a situation we have to replicate phone trees even though retrieval based models you can think of them as sort of like a phone tree you want to avoid kind of this this scenario here where you're having to kind of tap on twelve their answer twelve different questions before it can show you something and you want to try to kind of do something a little bit more elegant than that as I already mentioned before I don't think that conversational interfaces probably lend themselves well to traditional e-commerce but I think curation is going to be a pretty effective kind of mechanism so you can curate in categories so in this example here they have kind of their weekly picks and then they also have sort of a Mother's Day list or those kinds of things and then once you click on that you can kind of drill down using natural language filtering I think will be important so you show a product and the user rather than having to select again and kind of a phone tree type of interface what size do you want or what color do you want allowing them to just kind of type it out do you have it in small do you have it in purple and having the system understand what that means and show them the right response I think it's gonna be pretty important as well if you could limit leverage image based search I think this will be important so you can imagine a situation where a user grabs an image from Pinterest and drops it into your messaging interface and then it's able to kind of parse that and return results that'll be pretty important and we've we've built implementations like that and it's definitely something that is doable but to the degree that that's something that would be relevant for the use case that's something to try to think about and then you know look for opportunities again a kind of bacon to lighters or bacon personalities so glamour Jing emoji based search for example pretty limited in its usefulness candidly but just something to kind of think about is what else can we do to kind of bacon the lighters that lead to increased customer satisfaction or increased theoretically retention or increase referrals so what about retention context is huge so to the degree that the system can remember and learn about me that will be really valuable so a good example here would be I purchased this product can I exchange it being able to have support and sales again happen in kind of the context that the same interface is pretty compelling and then being able to parse a simple sentence and and have it know what that means and actually take care of all of the the junk for me can feel really really magical as well the other important idea is to remember user preferences and you can kind of use that as an opportunity to kind of prompt a user over time so here are some gift ideas for you based on your mom's birthday which I know you order from us a year ago about that so if you can remember me and remember my preferences and remember my settings and remember previous conversations that I had with it the interface will become a lot more interesting and something that I want to interact with more over time it's important to note that you need to be really careful about how you use notifications this was true with mobile apps as well in terms of push notifications but I think even more so here because it is so easy for me to block a bot or block a person inside of these interfaces it's really really important so again I think it's important to not think about these as primarily push based interruption channels it's important to think of them primarily as channels that the user is going to initiate I think that you can do this prudently and I think that you can do this intelligently and and periodically point request things with people I also think depending again on the context of your relationship with the customer will determine the degree to which you can do this more or less so there are types of brands for so for example meal delivery platforms where I've kind of habituated and developed a habit where I like to order from those same platforms on a daily basis being prompt at each day might make a lot of sense versus my mortgage company I probably don't want to be interrupted on a daily basis or even a weekly basis for my mortgage company so understanding the nature of a relationship is really important last thing referral nobody really knows yet there are not a lot of good referral based mechanisms kind of baked into these interfaces yet but we know that they're going there I mean it there's there is no reason to assume that they wouldn't and so what can you theoretically do their group shopping could theoretically be an example of that you know potentially group customer support maybe have a family plan with your phone provider for example or something like that but thinking through ways that you can intelligently leverage referral to drive more people into your interface will be pretty important and so start thinking about that stuff now so that when that functionality is exposed as part of the platform you'll be able to leverage it so that was sort of the how when does it make sense to dip your toes in this stuff well obviously the first banner ad debuted a long time ago it was actually in 1994 on hot-wired had a click-through rate of 78% the average Facebook click-through rate as of 2015 was point one seven one percent so that's a 450 X difference which points to the idea of what Android Chen calls kind of the law of shady click-through so the idea is that with any new marketing channel in a new ad unit any new platform performance is initially pretty great there's a novelty to it users are open to trying new things but as a channel gets saturated its effectiveness wanes and user demand begins to calcify we saw this with the first iOS apps as well the first iterations of a new channel are usually pretty crude there's lots of experimentation and in candidly the current implementations of bots are not that great they they they don't they don't work all off that well they're pretty you know quote unquote dumb as far as it goes but that's okay right now you can think about this whole platform is kind of being in beta in a way and users expectations are pretty low but that is going to change over time the Gartner hype cycle is a tool that we use internally that shows kind of how emergent technology moves through a market so as the technology becomes viable really companies start to flock to it they begin to experiment many of those experiments don't pan out and interest kind of start to weigh in but smart adaptable companies that stick with it and understand that these experiments are investments in figuring out what works will often make it through this sort of trough of disillusionment and then will benefit from the emerging technology often in kind of a disproportionate way and so once the most effective business cases are clearly identified the companies who were sitting on the sidelines have jump in but the impact on the business is not nearly as strong I think it's safe to assume that we're here right now in terms of conversational interfaces and Bop based tools as I said most of the current implementations are crude the players aren't that great the first version that you create probably isn't going to be that great but I think there's at least five good reasons for kind of moving on this opportunity right now one it's a good PR PR opportunity there aren't a whole lot of people that are doing this yet and so there's an opportunity for you there in terms of jumping kind of in and being kind of positioned as an innovative company that's kind of forward-thinking and as you can Domino's has obviously leveraged this in a variety of ways to great effect number two you can capitalize on kind of an unsaturated Channel so again not necessarily from a acquisition push interruption perspective but at least from a there aren't a whole lot of bots that are kind of saturating the the bot sort of directory or the Bob marketplace yet and so users are experimenting with that kind of stuff right now and so there's there's not as much noise as there will be going forward number three the barriers to entry are lower as I mentioned kind of user expectations are not as high and so your bot can make mistakes and come to kind of learn and the user isn't going to necessarily be offended by that two to nearly the degree that they will in a couple of years and so it's important for you kind of to dip your toe in the water and kind of figure out some of this stuff now and then the last thing is that you get to figure out what works faster so one of the the platform are the frameworks that we're really big believers in is kind of the Lean Startup philosophy and specifically kind of decide the about build measure learn loop the earlier you but the idea is that the faster you iterate through the spilled measure learn loop the faster that you have hypothesis that you then build and test and learn from the faster you're going to make something that solves your users problem in a differentiated way and unlike App Store or at mobile where you have to kind of go through the AppStore submission process and all of that kind of thing you can actually develop a hypothesis build it and deploy it in the exact same day with a conversational interface which allows your cadence of experimentation to really accelerate and your cadence of learning from user feedback to really accelerate so we would suggest build version one now learn what works iterate on it repeat and get yourself out ahead of the game be ahead of your competitors and try to really figure out what what what the possibilities are for conversational interfaces and with these chat platforms for your specific customer base and to the degree that that that's something that you want to do we'd love to help you out with that we have a full-service team that can help craft the narrative we can design and build the conversational interfaces instead of native advocate app experiences we can help you kind of build that brain we can handle the integration work with your back-end platforms and we love the iterative process we love kind of putting something up and seeing how it works and getting some users in there so if that's something that you think would be interesting we'd love to talk to you about that otherwise I thank you for taking the time to listen to this and I look forward to seeing what you build thanks for - for listening
