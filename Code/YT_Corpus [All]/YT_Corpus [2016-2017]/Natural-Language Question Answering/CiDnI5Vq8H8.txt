seven years ago in early summer at Government House in Budapest very close to the Parliament building on their Danube River and I can remember this day as if it were yesterday I felt very nervous and uncertain I knew that when the decision to marry my husband in it would change my life at a fundamental level I understood once I accepted my husband Peter as my life partner it meant sharing decisions goals and the responsibilities even if they do not always match completely with my own thoughts now being married more than half a decade my life certainly developed as a result of my marriage I find I learned to be more patient for example my husband and I disagreed about where to spend our summer vacation we took our time to find a solution that worked for both of us my husband chooses money and I choose the next also I think my marriage has helped to make my life happier I feel safe and strong with my husband and we have built up successfully the business together that we have been proud of and in our daily interactions we joke and laugh with each other Afghan so I can definitely say that marriage for me is an event in my life that that has a huge impact and mostly and this has been positive okay and your time is up may I have the card back please thank you now that you've finished watching the part to the long turn part of the IELTS speaking interview what did you

candidate get a band 8 or higher for her performance in this part well there are several steps that she takes to get such a good score first of all notice that she uses her preparation time effectively first she reads all of the questions on the card carefully making sure to understand them then she writes down some notes you can tell by the way she's writing that her notes are made up of several words that are going to be useful when she begins her speaking in addition you see in the speaking that she uses her notes she looks at the paper and checks to see what she wrote so many times students will write down great ideas and then forget to use them don't do this when you have a good idea when you write down your reasons and your responses make sure to look at your paper and use your notes also this candidate does an excellent job of answering all of the questions on the cue card in order to get a high band score for the speaking section you must answer all of the questions on the cue card clearly and completely as well the candidate uses complex and compound sentences she has a great range of grammar furthermore the candidate does an excellent job of giving detailed explanations and examples notice how she clearly tells the interviewer where the event took place near the Parliament building on the Danube in a government building this is a very good description she also gives clear examples when she's talking about how her life changed she explains that when she gets into an argument with her husband they look for solutions and come up with good positive ways to decide what to do in order for you to also get a high score for part two you must be able to perform in a similar way so practice this at home and good luck on your exam make sure to
