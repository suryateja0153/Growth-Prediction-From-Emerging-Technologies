 get started I am so cheesy my thumb's always come out when I do you judge each of videos I've no idea why so again hi guys welcome to my youtube channel today i'm going to do the 20 questions tag because i figured you guys you don't really know me I'm Delilah Baruti i'm the founder of hug my hair calm I make all the products that you buy on Amazon and my website myself and but speed to get to know person behind the brand I figured a 20 questions tag will be good in sight until you that person is so let's get started question number one one thing you can't leave the house without I'm going to go with the first thing that comes to my head and that's my headphones because I have to commute to and from work not long about a half an hour there and back and if I can't listen to something then the journey gets so boring and I end up staring at people and I don't even know I'm staring at them because I'm just daydreaming and it can sometimes get really awkward especially if you're looking in a really awkward area unintentionally the question number two is favorite brand of makeup so I put makeup on for my youtube videos but day to day I hardly really wear makeup don't even plug my eyebrows um tier why but I'm gonna have to go with Mac Mac Mac makeup is great because they have good shades a good shade range for especially people with darker skin and I maybe light-skinned but I'm 100-percent african and in the winter my skin is a weird yellowish I call it boiled chicken color and for you people who know up or chicken looks like that's what my skin is like in winter so I feel like I need something like you know even if I just pinched my cheeks before I step out the house I look less corpsey but they have something called matchmaster foundation which I bought before I I went to a wedding and because what it does is it it it blends with the tone of your skin I don't know how but it does and when the woman in Selfridges that the MAC counter was testing it on me she was like all do you tan in the summer and I was like yes I do and she was like I hey good we'll use this foundation because it will match your tone at the time all right that's fantastic so Mac and they also have good mascara and good I just got good stuff man I'm not really very aware of many makeup brands anyway I used number 7 eyeliner in school and that's because I took it out of my mom's handbag so makeup makeup and one thing I learnt later on in life is that the expiry date does matter fact fee question number three favorite flowers hmm not sure I have favorite flowers I'm or a tree person i know that's even weirder but i do really like trees my facebook background is often a different kind of tree or some kind of you know the zoom in or the trees beautiful leaves or something but flowers if i had to choose cliche roses but i recently got yellow roses for my birthday and i thought they were really pretty question number four is favorite clothing stores favorite clothing stores and let us say zara because i like Zara and they have good stuff I got a coat type cape thing from them recently which i really like i also like H&M for their basic line and basic clothing line I've got lots of like vests and long-sleeved tease plain tees and I like block colours like that I I used to like Topshop when they sold clothes that weren't disposable nowadays you know you go to Topshop and they've got a top that's like 40 pounds and it covers this much of your body 40 pounds for a sock initially you're paying for so and but back in the day like when I was in school I've still got a jacket that i got from Topshop my sister bought it for me with her student loan I was 15 and that coat of my still exists and I still get compliments about that coat today my clothes aren't made to last anymore Oh another one of my new favorite clothing stores is an online one I don't know if they've got Department one but there i discovered them on Instagram they're called ania calm really good for modest modest clothing where so I had two friends weddings last year and lost you last year x is just 10 2016 20 had two friends weddings in 2015 and I really wanted to wear a really nice dresses but all the floor-length dresses I could find was sleeveless I'm like why can't I find a dress with sleeves that doesn't have like a massive gaping hole in the back or must have slit up the leg up to my eye you know so i came across an ayah which is modest islamic clothing or modest clothing i don't even know but they have really really elegant beautiful dresses that are modern but beautiful ania calm my fan next question right um favorite perfume is question number five favorite perfume again not really a perfume person I like body spray so like vanilla I love like standard vanilla body spray from what boots or body shop but but one time when I did cave in and I've always been a type of person to be like you know why have a perfume TV advert you cannot smell it it's on TV I never got it until up until Natalie Portman did her TV ad for dior cherie deal by Sheree and I remember thinking oh my god i want to smell as good as she looks so shameful shameful but it worked that advertising worked on me and when i was at duty free either coming back from the US or going to the US i tested it and i liked it so i bought it and it was good another favorite perfume of mine is such the even my bag one sec this little thingy is called lovely and it's very non Brandi I think I got it from one of those them islamic book shops that also sell lots of other things so it's oil based perfume and it's alcohol free it's a three mil and it's made by our rehab makeup that what you will but it's the tiny little Roland and it's so potent photos the wrong word so powerful that you don't need much which is why this little tiny thing has lasted me ages and you just need to pop it on your wrist one dot is really all you need I like it because it's subtle and it lasts all day so question number six heels or flats I think that's also an easy one for anyone who knows me I feel like heels heels are from photographs and not for real life i right anyone who can actually walk in high heels and and not look like they're falling over or hunched over or struggling and but yeah I don't have I don't really own heels once upon a time i did but i just don't bother anymore because often they're just not comfortable enough new look does have wide fit heels that will fit me and are comfortable but i save those for like special occasions and i'm not someone to wear heels to work at all question number 7 do you make good grades what do you make good group good grades okay so I'm assuming this is about school and education I take things literally sometimes but did I get good grades yes they weren't amazing that was standard always scold quite Aborigine at school I got higher schools and things like English literature and language philosophy maths took me a while i needed a tutor actually did coupon for maths at school and that got my grades up to Abby and I got to to that uni did really well my first year not so great in my third year and I okay my second year yeah so yeah I suppose I do make good grades I knew who wrote your questions what question are we on number eight favorite colors and again if you know me then you'll know about my favorite color it's very specific so it's green but it's the tropical rain forest green and the reason why it's so specific is because that's actually just type of green alike any other green is just the usual green right and wearing green today but I I like tropical rain forest green because it's shimmery it reminds me of nature is deep like emerald type deep green and it's glamorous at the same time I think someone's favorite color can change according to their mood but I've been pretty consistent throughout my life with liking green I also like this deep reddish pinkish brown color I'm sure there's a specific name for it but it escaped me right now I'm not sure I ever knew it but I'm just gonna want to go with it escapes me right now um question number 9 do you drink energy drinks no got a lot of energy in real life naturally don't need it um do you drink juice I love juice and I will choose juice over a fizzy drink any day Mia fizzy drinks we just don't get along like it it doesn't feel good when it's you know going down I don't feel refreshed or soothed or like my first has been quenched I'm a mango juice girl and if I've had time to think in a restaurant I will order mind go juice if I haven't had time to think my default answers apple juice and I'm always disappointed because it's just it's apple juice you know why get i'm going to have mango out of it um but for the drinks fizzy drinks taste better in hot countries while I'm in Tanzania I can drink using and it's always banter or spy letter if you go to Tanzania you have to order a spy letter it's like all the goodness or front is bright and one next question that was number 10 next one is number 11 obviously do you like swimming yes I like swimming and I can only I can only swim backwards though I know I never mastered the font stroke thing and you get past a point in life where it's too late it's just just just too late then you might disagree with me but I feel like it's just too late for me now to learn from stroke I can swim backwards just fine and question 12 do you eat fries with a fork okay I know now that this this is this list is from America because it says fries and not chips okay so yes I know no no I eat chips fries whatever with my hands because they taste better that way everything tastes better with your hands and I remember when I wasn't well and I had to use a knife and fork for my food and a straw I just couldn't lift things like a burger I couldn't lift it up and bite into it and I was so upset because i'm craving a burger but for some reason when when when you use a knife and fork it's not as there's not as satisfying when you pick it up and fight it it ya hands if i can use my hands for food i will use my hands with food no shame it tastes better that way I'm not talking about rice okay I'm not in a restaurant eating rice with my hands if I'm in Tanzania and you know it's one of those dishes where you know you expected to eat with your hands like all girly and some people call it foo foo and then yeah I'll use my hands but i think you know I'm getting out anyway my first chips are brother my hands I'm Pizza Pizza hands too I don't understand Pete's with a knife and fork party proper question number 13 what is your favorite moisturizer ok so when assume this is talking about the skin and growing up I i always used palmer's cocoa butter loved it my skin lobbed it was amazing and then for some reason I just became intolerant to it my skin became uber sensitive at some point during my life which is when actually I started looking more into more natural products excuse me but um now I just use like water I make sure water and oil after i shower and uglier in my mom loved sheer butter when I growing up I couldn't I couldn't stand the smell I know it's ironic now because I usually about doing my products but growing up I was like no get that away from me but now I really I really see the benefits of shea butter so sometimes I'll usually about it too in the winter winter needs good bata the skin needs good but in winter next question number 14 do you want to get married later on in life yes I do want to get married later on in life God willing god willing I will and question 15 do you get mad easily no I am a very patient person and sometimes to my own to my own consequence detriment for lack of a better word basically sometimes I'm so patient that I end up suffering and but when it comes to people other people who I'm who I love and I'm protective over then yes I'll get mad easily if someone runs them I don't know make of that what you will but I had a close friend who whose partner was cheating on them for a really long time like they were leader like a double life and they lied about it even when she confronted him and that got me mad because you just you don't do that you just you don't lie when you're confronted you shouldn't life will stop but to keep on lying I mean who is that person who has been who has that person being that the whole time I don't know anyway um next question are you it who writes this stuff are you into ghost hunting can't say i am i'm not into ghost hunting I'm I run away from anything goes to like even at the cinema I will not watch anything where someone is possessed or there's a poltergeist involved or there's a juju in them no because I believe in that stuff I think that stuff is real and I don't want to mess with it it's just it's next I mentioned unseen on on just omnis don't want anything to do with it um questions 17 any phobias ya got phobias I'm afraid of flying I dislike flying Lee however I I won't let that fear stop me from flying because I want to see the world I spend the whole time praying or watching the movie to distract myself and the fact that I'm thousands of feet in the sky and there's nothing holding me up but I'd rather sit from the part of the pad I like to sit by the window so I can see outside and so that I can associate any weird noises with any movements that the wings are making rather than not see what's happening here all these sounds and think that you know I'm going to become a victim of a broken for LAN Jie no not fun and so although i haven't had a near-death experience I can work myself up mentally to feel like I'm going to die so it doesn't really answer the question simple answer is no I waffle a lot as you can see 20 do you drink coffee no I'm not a coffee drinker I prefer tea I love tea and will sometimes have tea with bits of coffee in I don't know what to tell you it's true but sometimes I will have tea with a few grains of copying and makes me feel better lets me up it depends how sleepy on feeling in the morning before i start my day in the office and I have had cravings for mullahs more more a lot more recently I think that's because I wake up and I simultaneously need to wake up I need that caffeine buzz but I also need a comfort at the same time so I just mixed the coffee with the chocolate it's good I recommend it okay so that's the end of the 20 questions tagged I i hope i didn't for you actually whatever if I did boy then whoops right this is me this is my channel you were going to keep
