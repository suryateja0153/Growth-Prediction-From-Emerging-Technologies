 What’s up, teachers? Let’s check out this situation! Marcio’s problem is actually quite common. Having to deal with a person in a position of authority, in English would make anyone nervous even a taekwondo champion. "May I check you?" is a Yes or No question which means a simple yes or no will do. But the wrong answer could have  caused him a lot of trouble! Bom, se não é "no" deve ser "yes", né?! Falei "yes", e ele "ok, thank you, sir". So make it clear to your students that we shouldn’t answer questions we don’t understand and whose consequences might not work in our favor. A good tip to practice common scenarios with your students is through role play. Role play is an imaginary situation where students play characters and roles and interact with each other. Good morning, sir. May I see your passport? Yes, here it is. It will help them with the language and make them more comfortable and confident to do the same in real life. You can select specific locations and situations such as immigration and create a dialog. Hello, I have a reservation. What is your last name? The last name is Smith. Yes, sir. You will be staying in room 18. It's on the first floor. Some students will be shy during this type of exercise, so make sure you have a welcoming environment where they feel safe. In fact, role plays can be a lot of fun! You can participate in the skit when you feel it is necessary to support your students. Give it a try! You’ll soon see how relaxed and confident they become when interacting in English. Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes! No! Yes, yes! No, no! Did you enjoy this lesson?
