guests on the show it's randy brush vp of marketing for euclid analytics Randy welcome to Wi-Fi at TV thanks class thanks for having me it's great to see and I've been following you guys for a long time but just for the benefit of our viewers who are not familiar with what Wi-Fi based location analytics is all about can you take us through the basics Randy sure nickel has been around since 2010 and since our inception at that time we've really focused are our core data set on leveraging the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure that's out there we think about it about eighty percent of retailers and sixty percent of quick service restaurants to have deployed Wi-Fi and their scores today and what we do Lou run on you know on the existing structure from Cisco meraki era high ruckus HP aruba xirrus pretty much ninety percent of all the existing Wi-Fi providers out there and from that when everybody else is smart phone in their pocket and there but most of them are trying to make a connection trying to connect to the free Wi-Fi and from those non-personal signals that people who can get from their smartphones were able to detect some some information to go ahead and analyze customer behavior in the storage so similar when the online world is have for about 20 years for e-commerce were able to deliver that to physical spaces on a lot a lot of the mysteries customer behaviour patterns and stuff like that again that the online worlds have for so many years writing in when I first when I first learned about what you guys were doing it was also explained to me that you could kind of compare it to Google Analytics except this is google analytics for brick-and-mortar locations essentially that that more or less fits the bill right correct and in fact we were founded by the folks head what's a precursor to Google Analytics which was urgent and the interesting part those who as well as that once you take those core data sets and you apply that to your business outcomes you can then understand what's happening in your store so you know understanding attribution for you change of the floor step change you change a window display you have a marketing campaign did that drive more traffic in the store do people stay longer do you have more cross shopping so all of those things that you can understand what is how can your strike how they affect your business outcomes right and so how do you see the market for Wi-Fi analytics of the type that Euclid represents developing we're talking about a lot of you know a lot of different segments really we're talking about retail we could also be talking about carriers transport hubs anything like that how do you see that developing yeah it has applicability across the entire physical world I think a lot of the low-hanging fruit today are the ones and their businesses that are better going a lot of transformation that are starving for data within their stores so obviously retail quick service restaurants come to mind and if you pick retail there my tremendous transformation today and they're simply because I think a lot of that they have not been able to compete with the online counterparts they would drive their business on data and in fact you're looking at two as well as like big companies like Amazon or other retailers such as Warby Parker and so forth actually making it you know transferring their business into the brick and mortar world shows that you know they're looking to bring data into their scores prepare your perspective or why other Wi-Fi providers this adds permits values their existing Wi-Fi networks to monetize it with location-based analytics writing and it readies to just just tell us what you think we are in terms of the take of if you think of this as kind of an s-curve are we still kind of at the bottom maybe two percent up is that what we're looking at right now as far as these types of solutions are concerned I think we're starting to get into more mainstream market right now i mean i think the past few years it was uh was early market I think 2015 2016 we're starting to see tremendous uptake because again if you look at like a retailer's this is a do-or-die year for them and for them it's about bringing data to the source safe for quick service restaurants and you're starting to see proliferation of these capabilities for smart cities and transportation hubs and so forth so I think it right now we're starting to hit 2016 no mainstream great and I wanted to ask you all so bad your recent funding around because I know you guys were successful I think this was your second round of funding just I think was it a month ago or a few weeks ago and securing additional funding for for you Cleo analytics which is great news by the way do you see that as a thumbs up to the Wi-Fi analytics business model absolutely I actually this was our third or series c round and in fact if you look at it we had our existing premier investors benchmark in any a come back to the table and invest in us and you're starting to see additional investors such as the are no proof you made such a lot of these luxury brands out of the world and also Cox Enterprises invest in our company so for them they see you know again the prolific proliferation of Wi-Fi and smartphones as the best way to start digitizing the physical world and bring mediated to stores utter brick-and-mortar businesses right and I just wanted to mention to everybody out there that you just released by the way a very very good piece of research i read it just recently and the research is into how companies intend to use Wi-Fi Randy can you give us the short version of what the results of that piece of research were yeah it's fascinating we we interviewed 30 quick service restaurants and 30 retailers large retailers and we found is a overwhelming majority of folks that had already deployed why if I were pointed to leverage the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to gain analytics getting understanding of what's happening in their physical locations from that too as well we're able to discern that they want to leverage Wi-Fi as a digital platform to deploy new type of applications of services in the store to engage customers and provide we like to call this log in experience and be able to go ahead and show it's happening in the store to plug up locations and the same time to deploy Wi-Fi based analytics beginning and understanding what's happening so I got to challenge you a little bit Randy because one perhaps the most controversial issue in matters of data analytics is of course privacy and security and so forth and obviously there's rules and regulations protecting this but also from a market point of view a lot of consumers are very sensitive you know towards being watched in which other way how do you resolve the privacy concerns from euclid's point of view absolutely take privacy extremely seriously and around 2013 we founded the mobile location analytics code of conduct with other industry leaders the future of privacy forum and members of Congress and that dictates in terms of how we manage consumers personal their personal information of information that submitted from a smartphone device how it's stored and so forth but at the same time to it gives consumers an option to opt out and like I lines for our customers should clothes as customers if they are indeed deploying a Wi-Fi based analytic so again we take it extremely seriously and we've been pioneers in space to really define the privacy standards and and also from a technical point of view you make sure through your hashing algorithms and so forth that you cannot actually track the mac address data because this is knock actress data that mac address data that is beamed out by the devices but then you hash it and so forth as i understand it to make sure that you cannot you know trace it back any of that data back to an individual person is that correct correct we hash hash the mac address on the other piece to as well we report on aggregate basis so we do not for you understand see what Klaus is doing track you where you're going and so forth so we just report on an aggregate basis so twenty-five percent of your customers last month or new customers into the store that you hadn't seen before those sort of things but we don't go ahead and track you individual very good now i want to ask you about another challenge and that's uh getting businesses to actually accept this as part of the business process in in order to do that they also need to obviously apply some skill in interpreting results and what did you about these analytics results how are you addressing this issue in do we need more education you know to really make your various customers benefit from what you're able to discern from these measurements yeah it's interesting it's a lot of it i like to say customers don't know what they don't know once they actually have this new data set it illuminates a lot of things about their business i think the key thing for what we do again is give them some context understanding you know if your traffic numbers are going up or your dwell times where customers are going up your story having great across shopping how r that impact how is that impacting core business outcomes so being able to attribute that to point-of-sale data your marketing calendar for marketing activities other things operational things you might happen to your store and from them they can then understand the cause and effect between the two the other piece to as well as applying a lot of the best practices of learnings that we have from our over 500 customers we've been working with around the world hmm and thus far if you look at the Euclid solutions excuse me euclid solution we're talking about a passive analytic solution which from which you can then extract a lot of useful information do you think there's a market for active consumer engagement with Wi-Fi there's a bunch of other companies as well working on this absolutely i mean today we go ahead and measure the physical world on passive basis so just understanding traffic patterns and customer behavior and so forth but i think where the markets going and we showcase coach showcases a couple weeks ago at the National Retail Federation show in New York is this odd inexperienced with in stores so similar to when you go on to Amazon's website to log in they know who you are and they're able to personalize experience for you that same thing we believe will be happening in the physical stores too as well so stores will move from a transactional nature into more experiential nature so let's forget what you've been able to experience online they know they know what you like with your preferences are this is the same thing too that's going to be happening in the physical world and we believe that Wi-Fi is the best platform to create this log can experience in the physical world fantastic vision for what retailers will turn into perhaps in a couple of years or even less than that I really I really like that image or any and finally I just want to pass on to our viewers just a reference you can go to Euclid analytics com and I very much recommend first of all that you read the white paper the research white paper I think it's a
