 is presentation so please we love having you all here please come in take a seat so we can get started thank you thrilled thrilled to have you all here thrilled to welcome dr. Russell Walker to discuss in advance of the publication of his new book is talk on leveraging digital strategies and analytics and median sports so with that I'll turn it over to dr. Walker great thank you it's great to be with you guys today so first of all I wanted to just share a little bit personal thanks to the conference for sponsoring the book you all have copies of it and so very much welcome your thoughts and feedback on it and I'm really interested in the digitization of our lives and and what this is doing to how we participate in media and how we even participate in sports and I think there's a really big opportunity here I'd like to talk about that and the first thing about digitization is that companies who participate in digitization and our leaders have what we call digital platforms and so just you know a little reminder or sort of reference on this we've probably all used uber and Airbnb and Amazon and eBay and all of these things that we find immensely convenient what's extremely powerful about them of course is that they perform measurement they collect data they collect customer data in a very detailed way they have some other attributes that we're going to examine those attributes are very important in media and I'll show some examples of that and somewhat missing in sports I would say and so this is where I think there's an enormous opportunity for sports franchises for advertisers and for professionals who are looking to develop careers there and so these digital platforms do is I mentioned provide a very important function of measurement and if I could just say its data creation that they actually do record who did the transaction and this sounds very basic but I would argue that many of you came here in a rubric are on an airplane and checked into the hotel and may be used opentable to get a reservation and everybody all those networks all those digital platforms have recorded your activity right you go to a sports game and perhaps your name is not even known or your presence even detected and that's a real big opportunity of course the analytics that we're here to talk about which is so fast 10-18 is now possible once you have that measurement in place so in very very clear terms the measurement is a prerequisite in the digital platform is a very convenient way of doing that but why are some digital platforms more successful than others be it in media or banking or any particular industry is that they also offer execution so the owner of this platform is very convenient of course when you're at Amazon because they can offer recommendations they can offer tips and all of these other things that the company would like to do toward the consumer so that's a very important characteristic and that is customizable and so I think this is really critical it's not that you and I are going to watch different games but there may be aspects of our experiences that can be customized and I think knowing that realizing that we do live in a highly customized society and that we all expect the company to recognize us or taste and whatever it is that we've done in the past and and that level of customization I think in sports is tremendous right to recognize a fan that they've been there for 10 years but whatever that would mean is extremely powerful so one of the great successes in this space and it's a case that I wrote at Kellogg is to look at netflix in the case of digital platforms at work in media and of course we're probably very familiar with what they do but I just wanted to highlight some of the things that the analytics in the digital platform that netflix has created has allowed them to do first of all insights when and where people actually watch movies it was a big surprise that people watch them at odd hours and even watched partial movies and came back and played the rest of that and of course their predecessor and competitor blockbuster had no idea of that the fact that they could introduce new products I think that's tremendous the fact that they could bring TV shows to market they entered the game business with some limited success but that allowed those inventions innovations if you would were possible because they were measuring their consumer in a very detailed way the asset reuse and I'm going to talk a little bit about economic concept of asset surveillance and how it relates to sports but i think was fascinating about netflix is that they could find niche more yes so if you like foreign films as I do they could figure that out and say hey these films that essentially are not watched I can take those to market I can create a market around those this is immensely powerful in sports every one of us in here is the fan of some team and in mine have not always been great and so when that happens you say those few good years I'd pay money to watch those games or the highlights of those games so asset reusing sports has tremendous opportunity and at least I haven't found a great example nowhere near the example of netflix for that and so I don't want to watch other teams replays probably you would feel the same way you'd like to watch your team or a particular season and so I think that type of opportunity is one that could be very driven by data customized to unique customers and there's a revenue for that the introduction of new markets of netflix had a tremendous success and enjoys a great success on mobile platforms which i'm going to say a little bit more about it creates a whole new level of data an interaction with a customer because through their app they begin to measure other things to your graphic location time of day interruptions and other things that you do on your phone or we do and that provides a whole new level of insight where you live where you travel where you probably work it's very interesting if i wanted to establish measures of disposable income or likely salary levels which perhaps an advertiser would really like to know and so the pricing control if we were giving this presentation to people in the media industry they'd be a gas at literally what netflix has been able to do they've been able to decide more or less what the price of a movie should be at least the royalty rights on that and why is that the case they have put themselves between the consumer in the movie house and they collect the data on those consumers and in doing so they have the data that's necessary for pricing and so if you think about the parallel in sports we go to a stadium maybe we buy our ticket from the sports franchise maybe we buy it through another intermediary sports stubhub or ticketmaster or something like that but very few franchises or leagues i would even say have the opportunity right now to conduct that measurement at fan level basis and so then when you say well what's a fair price for a ticket well I'm not sure that it's data-driven I think it could be significantly more data-driven and I totally appreciate the dynamic pricing models that have developed but but none of those are specific to a fan those are just specific to a market condition and so this kind of opportunity that netflix has for us i think is a real wake-up call I really do believe that the customer is king and everything we do and so I think this is a reality that we live with all businesses live with this it's not sports or media it happens to be that there's some big inroads certainly in the area of media we will see this in medicine of course customized medicine this will happen in finances I'm sure you expect to go to your bank and your bank to recognize who you are and have all of your transactions and all of your frequent flyer points and all of that there and so this now suggests to me that a company who does business with customers and in fact you know sports is really more about customers I think then that we realized in their in their fandom is that the data on them is really an asset and we should think about positioning the enterprise to look at that asset so that we could cultivate it we could generate new opportunities this is the research I do what I get excited about so just a little final word here on netflix you know this is some measurement that they can take when is a customer of fan I think it's really powerful and that that question is very appropriate for what we all do here in sports and they do this by different shows and so you can see the the y-axis is the number of episodes and so for some of their very successful programs you just need to watch twice and you're a fan and in some of you might have to watch four or five times how does that work in sports how many games do you have to go to how many years how many wins do you have to you know experience and so something like that suggests exactly the same kind of phenomena I'm trying to measure or suggest that you would how would you measure fandom at a very particular and very individual level now I thought I would take a little step outside of sports and maybe give a little economic evaluation of why dad and how it's important and how intermediary in the world of digital platforms challenge us so this is an example from my book suppose I own a billboard a real billboard out here on 90 or 93 and you say well what's the billboard worth as an asset and I guess you'd call Department of Transportation and they tell you how many thousands of people drive by the billboard and you would use that at some sort of surrogate for the measure of the attractiveness and then your advertiser who wants to put their brand on this would say well well thanks that's really helpful and i'll pay you something as a function of the number of eyeballs who see this billboard but that data is wrong for certain nothing against your department of transportation ours in illinois is is horrific and so any case but who knows that data right now interestingly AT&T and verizon could take their data and train it on a longitude latitude this is a rather trivial exercise for them because they have that data if we just did a sort of inversion of the data if you would some sequel query we could come up with that but they actually know more than the count they would know the names they know where else you go they know where you live they know where you work and so now very quickly verizon AT&T could say something about not only how many people but which people in what types and if I'm Mercedes and I want to put my brand up there I want to put it in a place where there people who actually can afford my car and so that information now transformed into some data product you know recommendation for marketing a recommendation for price of the billboard raises lots of interesting questions who's in control of the billboard the billboard owner or the person who measures it and I would say the one who can measure it has immense control over that value of that asset and if you don't agree with me there are a few Nobel Prizes behind that too okay so this notion of assets surveillance and how we use that information to price markets is immensely important so I think that's at work in sports and I'll offer a little challenge here without going too deep if I can do that to a billboard which seems a little in oculus and you think okay I'm not going to really ever own billboards but I might own a building and that's a John Hancock building what's it worth clearly its economic activity is a measure of its it's worth who goes in the building what kind of people what kind of businesses operate there what are their revenues a landlord loves to pinch their tenant right I mean let's be honest I mean your contribution as a landlord is a function of precisely the economic activity and success that your tenant cheves now let's train that to a stadium I put up billboards I attract advertisers to be in my arena and they're going to ask who sees it how many people what kind of people and you can't answer that but someone else can that means you've lost control or you can lose control of that pricing and so that's very important because that's a tremendous revenue source of course for arenas for sports teams and the advertisers have very serious messages and and they're very intent on getting that to the right demographic um I think about this because there are a lot of open-ended questions in sports and I realize their technological advances helping us close this but for many teams some very fundamental questions exist who's actually in the seat where did they buy the ticket online threw me through a broker did they buy something else what else did they do while they were there did they buy food and merchandise I think it's very interesting because sports are in many ways and experience so you go to a sporting event maybe not because you're trying to find the cheapest hat clearly but you're trying to have an experience which is often shared with family members or friends or coworkers whatever the case may be who else is with you are you in a group party how do I measure collective experience if I can't measure individual i'm certainly not doing that very well and then what else do they do maybe even outside of the event itself and i think what's fascinating about random is that you don't stop being a fan when the game ends you're still a fan and so maybe your interest sort of moves with the season and when the the sport is played but your interest clearly is still there and so you know running a sports franchise you have a brand you have a message that's very powerful to people how do you interact with them other times of the year come so you know graphically and I mean this just sort of generalize what should a digital platform do well you have two sides you have a company that operates it they provide services and information and then of course an individual who interacts with it and their interaction is it please tell me your name and fill out a survey I wouldn't consider that a digital platform instead I can go to a place obviously you know identify myself but I get something back i get information about the team or the players i can buy tickets i can confirm my reservation i can go to amazon and i'm sure many of us probably have even done that today and say well what can I do I can I can shop I can get information and provide information as well so that interaction with with assets that's really what becomes really powerful and the platform and of course there's another thing about moving to mobile which is immensely fascinating this example I gave of the billboard and real estate and of course now related to say a stadium I don't have to ask a consumer please tell me that you're at the stadium once you've become a user of my app and this becomes really critical and why apps are so powerful i can get your longitude and latitude i can do it all the time provided you don't turn off the privacy setting that's a different conversation right so and if you say well that's the case then who's going to do that measurement of the fan is that going to be you know one of our networks is that going to be a sports team will it be an a-league and of course that happens on all the different digital platforms and so now location movement interaction with the brand can be measured what i say is passively i don't actually have to ask you for that you're going to start giving it up as a function of your technology that's that's happening right now while we're all in this room um the other thing that data allows us to do is create what I call data products this is a obviously a little outside of sports but I think it's fascinating that we've assembled you know so many people here who are MBAs and of course in management consultants and I have a tremendous respect for what linkedin has done in this space and when you think about LinkedIn you know we all go to it we get information about you know our our industry our career or who reads your your blogs and and then if you're a recruiter of course you have very specific information they pay I dearly for that now I use an example here from Lincoln's research team when the big investment banks failed Bear Stearns Lehman and such they they did analysis and they said well where did these people Lind up you know and provided that they had linkedin profiles they could actually measure that that's fascinating we could train that now to universities and say if we looked at management consultants BCG Deloitte and such and you say where did they go to school will hear the three top mba programs for that let's train it to fans where do you go what car do you drive where do you live that'd be fascinating who can actually do that now I'm not sure anyone can but if I had a franchise or if i'm in the league I'd like to be able to do that because when an advertiser or television contract becomes available I'd like to be able to say my league has a unique demographic in fact we can confirm the presence in our cohort of particular individuals of a certain wealth or a particular individual characteristic whatever that might be that notion that i can create a product i can answer a particular question posed by an advertiser or offered to an advertiser with the purpose of controlling price i think that's very powerful um I imagine some of you have seen this this is of course taken from the data science team at Facebook and this is an example of what I call passive data capture they did not ask people who their favorite NFL team is they simply went to people who denoted that on their Facebook page and I think that's really powerful I believe we could probably all look at this for days if you're a football fan and you could see the residue of certain you know television distribution contracts that existed back in the 80s and before being that we're in Boston I think we probably have some Patriots fans who would celebrate the reality that the New York Jets enjoy no plurality and no County anywhere in North America and any case they're their challenges being what they are how do you look at this and say if I'm a league or I'm an owner or the manager sports you know executive for that team advanced the dominance if I could of your teammates it's a little bit like playing you know empire building I do find a few things fascinating one of them is that the Falcons simply don't have as much of the south as you would think and you think why is that the case i don't know and and you know and i'm just giving tactical ideas here as an example he'd say well well how would I encroach on other areas they're probably things I could do this implicated there are implications to advertisers that are immense if I if I do want to advertise with a team where can I do it where would I be most successful possibly a agent of a player might even say where would endorsements of my player where would placement of my my cut my client be most powerful geographically how many people are there and again this is passive we just had people announce themselves and I think that's very powerful and if football is not your sport as it is for me we do the same thing for baseball agreed or complexities here and you know we were proud of both the Cubs and the White Sox in Chicago but you can see cub land is a lot lot bigger than in the White Sox and then you know this notion that I just raised of Atlanta and you say well why did the Braves have so much of the South but football wise the Falcons only have perhaps you know the Georgia area so there's kind of questions now become opportunities that can be translated into how you expand your brand and any influence and even control the price of it so what do I do and how might this help you so you know this is the area that I research in is how do companies then get ready to do the things that we you know spoke about today the questions I posed how do you assemble that the very first thing is that you have to have data so I've got a framework for how companies know about being successful in this space the first is to bring sources of data it's not enough to say well the league will give me that or I'll get this from you no ticket master or wherever you probably create your own data it's probably more attractive to do so and if you can't to partner with someone exclusively and then to innovate on that data to create these data products that i talked about to answer very powerful questions and answer questions that you might be able to answer for other people maybe you are one of these intermediaries that we talked about and then of course you know continue that through growing so I think a lot of companies have you data as kind of a attacks a cost right I mean I view it as an asset so if it's an asset how do I grow it how do I approach it with that kind of mindset and that's a management attitude and then of course taking that to market so if you can measure an asset you can say I know how many people looked at that billboard today and I know where they live and I know what cars they drive create a data product on that that you could provide to advertisers that's going to be very powerful and then lastly you got to have people who do this and I think you're in a wonderful community to find many of those so analytics are obviously you know the prerequisites everything we talked about and then of course some takeaways and these takeaways i should say come as as an observer to working with many sports franchises so at kellogg i lead and founded the analytical consulting lab which is a lab class and very proud to say that we've had the opportunity and privilege to work with many leading sports franchises in the Chicago area and elsewhere at NC double-a sports to help them with many of these questions and many of my students are here who have led those projects and so first thing that you need to do as an enterprise as a sports franchise or a league is to develop a digital platform begin that measurement to measure your fan when do you know their fan who are they and then of course to create these data products leverage passive data capture and then use data for growth and so I would also encourage the development of an experimentation clients a culture that is not every idea is going to be a winner right and so if you can build a team and encourage them to try and experiment with the data I think that would be very helpful I hope those takeaways help you hope my message share something powerful with you it's been really wonderful to be with you we may have a few minutes for questions and and I welcome any of those so thank you yes sir well that's very interesting we just did a project for Northwestern looking at their use of advertisement and we had a wonderful team that did some rank order analysis relative to other sports this is not an endorsement but certainly by what we saw it appeared that Stanford was doing quite a good job and that as you would expect other big well-funded teams big 10 SEC teams it was particularly geared toward football and men's basketball seem to be very far ahead and well full disclosure we at Northwestern have a few things to work on but let any case yeah that there seems to be a separation in the pack yes sir in the back no you know this is sort of a question around what we expect in society I used to be a banker and I'm very familiar with the privacy laws and financial services and of course there's another set of laws in health care what Netflix does is not illegal and what I think is very powerful is that even though it may have a little feel of creepiness to it most fans and certainly for the case of Netflix people don't say hey you're tracking me because you know why moyes Netflix tracking you they want to offer you better recommendations people are fine with that as long as you're not penalized I think that's fine and as long as you're transparent I think you'll you'll you'll win over most people and it's not illegal right now you know that I couldn't give you the fair answer because I haven't peered into that at least the teams we've worked with I think it's fair to say there's there's ground to be covered right and I'm not aware of someone who has I do think digital ticketing is really a tremendous advancement so I guess at least the giants are some teams have that which is great you know if I ran a franchise I'd want to measure my own fan you know and I'm just given very honest advice these models exists economically and other businesses don't let someone else do that for you or if you can't do it as the owner you know then have the league do it right and so you know there is some investment that has to be made but someday someone else is going to tell you what your tickets worth I mean that happens right now in the secondary market right so you know losing control of prices is very dangerous yes leader in digital end yeah I think I think there's some that are tremendous I mean everyone talks about uber and and so the principles I put up there for digital platform measurement convenience execution customization the fact that they can even do search pricing all of those in fact that they did this very quickly and a highly fragmented market is tremendous their capital investments nowhere near the likes of amazon or ebay so what I'm suggesting is you can be quite nimble in this space so many of them we would recognize and so they do have to achieve a critical mass what's fascinating about it is once you've done that you you don't usually have four or five competing you know it's a digital winners it's almost 10 some game like you can take most of it sometimes you see a second like lift and they compete or the economics would be they compete on some characteristics but but winner takes all generally any other questions all right great to be with you guys thank you
