 how is data analytics used today at North American national security is it enough to protect us from terrorism and cyberattacks how is it being used today and how can we use it to improve our protection against these outside attackers in this video we're going to take a look at four things the purpose and definitions of analytics historical uses of it a potential future state and define a roadmap to lead to the future that we suggest and some counted along the way there is a lot of raw data out there that can be further analyzed to improve our intelligence and national security the data can be transformed into important information pertained identities motives and actions of groups and individuals for example take the sony pictures entertainment heck of 2014 it proof that our enemies are getting smarter and using alternate methods to it threaten our national security the FBI was able to deduce that this attack was caused by North Korea but imagine a future where we can extend our analysis integer predictive realm and prevent the cyber attacks from happening before they become a large threat to our security in another example in 2014 a New Zealander Mark Taylor who join the Islamic states ranks treated above his new life what he didn't know was that his tweets are geocoded and it gave away his and Isis locations to global intelligence groups in the report the ISIS Twitter consensus by poking institute it was reported that 46,000 Twitter accounts were being used by Isis members and supporters and posting up to 9,000 times a day the photo metadata is of abundance and can be overwhelming with useless information but proven by Mark Taylor even a fraction of a percent of the daily trees can provide crucial data to eliminate our threats how is data analytics being used to achieve goals of economic and public safety vs. diagnostic analytics through extensive data mining there's a lot of data to be analyzed these are a few areas where diagnostic analytics has been used social media the Department of Defense uses data mining to determine threats from Twitter Facebook and other sources Facebook software analyzes criminal activity by looking at a members relationships the network if a member has no mutual friends are not on the same geographic location it raises red flags in the system this has been used to catch radicalization attempts as well as child predators geographic analysis is used by the US Army and uses data mined from drone and satellite to track terrorist movements used in Iraq and Syria all information receives goes towards a database in real time and military analysts make connections another area where data analytics has been used historically is predictive analytics at first it seems like something outlandish like a science fiction movies such as minority report and it's largely controversial what's occurring today and is big in national defense there's a branch of mathematics analyzing spatial temporal patterns to identify trends in terrorism and crime crime and terrorism is a law like an earthquake when an earthquake occurs there are many aftershocks and the probability of an aftershock increases after the first event the same is for burglary and crime when a house is burglarized the probability of subsequent events increases because burgers know the layout of the house and the street or in a terrorist attack such as the one in Paris in November many subsequent events follow after the original attack a team in the University of Maryland is using machine learning to try and predict some of these events before they occur machine learning uses Amazon technology to predict classroom activity and it's also being used to predict the movements of a South Asian terrorist organization called le T using algorithms to analyze the past 20 years of LED activity geographic factors political and location they found that there's an eighty percent chance increase of an attack when an ayiti operative was on trial lastly there's prescriptive analytics using analytics to push a desired outcome radicalization of North Americans occurs through social media as it mitigates distance terror organizations have been using social media extensively to radicalize individuals facebook has been trying to release content and adds to counter these attempts they are offering one thousand dollars in advertising and free advertising for groups wishing to counter terrorism on social media now let's move on to the future state of business analytics in the industry the speed at which data is generated is exponential 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily to be exact in fact ninety percent of the data in the world was created over the past two years the following tech trends are leading to the increase in demand for the business analytics industry the first trend is that information is social mobile and local as it is so easily obtained this trend largely contributes to the rapid expansion of the Big Data industry the second trend is that the internet is everywhere the rate of increase in data will only grow as more devices join the Internet everything from household appliances to industrial robots will generate and use more data further creating potential knowledge and vulnerabilities however data and analytical tools are useless without data scientists so raw unstructured data alone will not be able to change the face of the national defense and anti-terrorism industry an example of poorly handled threats include the lorry a gun threat at the end of the day agencies do not want to cause public panic yet they do want to appear as if they are in the business of stopping plausible threats as such this requires a better analysis of the abundant data around the problem then becomes analyzing the data structuring it training analysts and providing reliable predictive information as such the demand for data analysts and scientists will further increase as more data is generated throughout the world therefore the demand to harness big data will drive IT solutions to be more customizable and intuitive becoming the next Excel idea or tableau many ethical challenges exist in using data analytics and improving national safety measures recently apolis deny the US government's request to unlock the phone of San Bernardino's shooter believing it's a slippery slope which will allow the government to snoop unconstitutionally into people's lives the US government has been taking measures to improve the trust of the population in 2015 the USA Freedom Act most prominently it ends the government's automatic bulk collection of phone records instead the NSA will have to transition to acquiring call logs of targets and those of their contacts as needed in investigations these current news highlights the importance of population trust through the enactment of proper laws regulation and prosecution for personal data collection as such government worldwide will need to address the proper handling of personal data in order to protect privacy rights and discouragement it's evident that enemies to national security and peace like Isis anonymous and certain foreign countries are improving the way they strike making use of the Internet as a means of communication surveillance and attack there is a sea of raw data out there in which even a percent could save billions of lives if we want to continue to protect our citizens and our freedom we need to improve the data analytics practice to constantly be steps ahead of our enemies and be ready for the unexpected
