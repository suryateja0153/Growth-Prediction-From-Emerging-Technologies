 we're here to talk about Big Data and particularly about how we can harness the power of big data to allow people to improve their services their reach their product and all I just want to quickly start by asking my panelists to introduce themselves so we can get an idea of what aspect of big data they work with before we delve into the topic a little bit further so I'm going to start with you dirt yeah so I'm working for criteria for roughly six years and we what we do is performance marketing mainly for e-commerce companies so literally we are not just starting to deal with big data or being challenged with big data data has been the core of our business from the first day the first second that we have been founded it's a lot about delivering relevant pets predictions so it's literally whatever we do is is all about real-time data analytics and with the core goal to deliver the most relevant ad in a given moment to to a user thanks love really nice summary nas it can you give us a little bit information about what you do any emcee and what kind of branded clients work with also my name is Nasim Felicia I managed emc corporation in the vaunted America Africa EMC is a company of five Federation companies EMC and VMware and one of them is a company that we have built and dedicated for real-time data analytics and agile mobile development definitely we see this is our one of our vehicles to the third platform technologies and the response from customers in terms of transforming their business models the adapting a digital agenda transformation it's been amazing and honestly we are not able to cope up with the demands that are coming from the market our traditional market segmentation is the biggest industries traditionally as EMC telco and financial sector and public sector but on the third platform we see a major disruption and we see that our market reach has expanded from logistics companies to media companies and that's because of the disruptive technology that are happening thanks nothing thank you tebow can you give us a summary what you do when we work with also yeah I am working for Mahajan wanna join weddings and I take company created in in San Francisco and we use big data we use a programmatic advertising to connect bronze to their new customer that's why I we talked to today about predictive data and how we can I mean do blending with programmatic and advertising and with big data so what does the day we have someone who handles performance marketing we have someone who handles big data and a sense of real-time data analytics and we have also people who handles brands and marketing and performance marketing as well now where we start delving into this topic and I just with the show of hands anyone who's familiar with big data the topic of big data obviously not the technology big data raise your hands really high so we can just really quickly see you so more than half of the panel is familiar with the topic of big data that's a good start so just find during your introductions you guys set some really important keywords that I think are important to clarify so the first one was real-time intelligence or delivering relevance through real-time analytics can can I want to start with you and just quickly jump and see what other real-time aspects can we talk about what is real-time data analytics and what is the importance of real-time analysis of big data so number 1 i'm not surprised a lot of people raise their hands i mean literally big data among programmatic and r 2 bees like one of the buzzwords that is kind of following us for the past years it's a lot lot about said about that but the past years also met a lot of frustrated faces because everyone is talking about it but it's not necessarily creating value immediately for everyone in the industry okay so coming to your point in terms of real time when you look into the marketing world it's very interesting because when you look back you know years Becky even it's all about creating target groups when you look even in the US and there was very interesting article two years back in the financial times when it was about meth man versus madman that you know the traditional met men in the US the whole industry behind it advertising the media are getting frightened because the way they were working is that for instance for a big automotive company you know they were giving the briefing beginning of a given year then an agency started working on the advertising on creating the TV and etc and by the end of the year when all the automotive companies were releasing their new product that's when that n has been shown so in terms of real time at that time there is a you know a gap of like 10 months in between in you know the idea in the briefing until the ad has been deliberation of the campaign so clearly this is becoming a completely different world today and online has massively pushed it and driven it so today it's really about delivering the the most relevant ad in any case if you do branding as well if you if you do performance marketing of course that's where it started and by you know collecting as fresh and accurate data as possible you're able in real time to make the decision for you know a net impression that you get which end do you want to place and what's the content of Annette so at criteo we served last year about 740 billion ads right so if you take that right now that will be about 56 million ads during this panel that we are serving so what does that mean if every single ed is customized it's not pre-produced it shows you how real time is working there and how accurate the information must be that you're using in order to show a relevant ad and all of that you know in real time enables you to you know deliver you know the most appropriate message to your customer in that moment thanks for that nothing you mentioned that you primarily though that majority revenue is telco and and financial entities based or mean at least that's the history is it because telcos and banks have the most amount of data I mean or is it because there's a cost to maintenance kind of justification to it no I mentioned that the our traditional business as EMC is on the Falcone finance but with the big data and the third platform we're addressing much bigger market now the reason for the traditional business is because of the core business that the MC used to be the core business which is the mission critical business continuous solutions on the third platform it's a completely different ballgame I think the two maybe answer your initial remark as I think what's happening is the whole capital system was built on b2b business model which based on fixed acid versus fixed ass so for example a company like EMC would go to arab bank or to any bank and they know their financial report they know who's the CEO was the CIO who's all of this and as a result we look at their business plans and we developed product that helps them achieve that so we come relevant to them as a vendor now with the massive growth okay and the seaport instead of the B part yeah the sea is consumers yes us ok so if I don't know you I have no way of by targeting you and develop products to you ok now what is what is the problem here the problem or the enabler actually is social networking every big enterprise had traditional data if you're a telco you have the billing application of the CRM application if your bank you have the core bank application of all the rest and these are of historical data ok now our banks do not change their plans ok a real time they change it once a year they have a board meeting there is hot on their business and then they announced that and becomes public but if they see my customer is you ok and you are changing on daily basis I need to be able to collect all this information as much as possible about you a real time and know exactly what you want to do and try to influence ok the outcome of your actions ok now the problem was that one percent of all the information in the world was being recorded only ok so for example at this moment we have this camera it's recording the panel but actually the people in the room are maybe hundred times the size of the panel and there are so many actions are taking place he's touching his laptop he's touching his mobile this guy is talking they're carrying saying how boring we are so if you can collect all this information ok which is much much more than what's being recorded and we analyze all these details your name's your actions the way you look where you're coming from what time you came what time then we can really influence some certain actions ok so yes real time is needed bigtime on the sea sector when you talk about consumers when you when you have a woman in a house that is your target customer and you don't know she's married I don't know if she's working you don't know how much is their income you don't hope she's happy today is not happy as a result if you don't know all this information you can be designing common solutions and this basically explains why today the biggest companies in the world is not on the fixed asset companies they are not AT&T it's not General Electric ok today it's Apple its link then its Facebook the seaport the sea part became much bigger than the B part and anybody who build his visions model on the B part he is irrelevant to the sea unless they make a huge transformation very quickly based on the new business model ok I want to capitalize on the transformation concept and I want to jump to Tebowing and try to get an example from you and how you help brands transform or kind of change the way they talk to the consumers by analyzing this data and by optimizing it as well just I mean I want to just keep on trying to give giving different examples to our audience so we can try to cover it big data from multiple facets before we you know break it down um in fact first we need to analyze the audience also clients ok that is the beginning and to how we analyze audience or the clients we have some tools to collect I mean the obits the purview of the audience when the people navigate on internet but now we get in the real-time life with the localization for example and with all these data and with sharing we can create a personal of the audience of the clients and then with this person I will try to with a lot of parameters will try to find same people we say look like or clone and then we target these people this clone in fact typically for example for her people who it was 4f horse after horse wanted to target people who travel a lot what we have done we have to some geo localization of some airport dubai paris and to i see ok each people will go to 2 z's gate of these airports could be a good clients for a horse and we have targeted people yeah that's a great example I want to ask all three of you if you can give us also some examples about you know things that you don't think about that actually use big data on a day-to-day basis extreme amusing recommendations can you just list some aspects of things that utilize it and in such a subtle way that it's almost you know if I want to say intuitive for for the consumer experience or for the behavior what industries are recently jumping on board with big data and we spoke about banking we spoke about telco we spoke about retail are there other entities that are jumping on board what do they get out of it and what you know what experiences are or how can how can they transform their businesses by utilizing big data is actually the question I want to answer as you're generally it could be anyone right and it has been said already before there is massive data available and not just now that we're talking about it or for the past years there there was always a lot of data available and I think just for the you know the past year is generally with the you know further digitalization you know all the different industry started to you know being able to use that data actually and and the really important thing here is it's not only the access to data but it's like you know the competence and the technology in order to process the data and use it properly so that it adds value right we had a chat earlier and one thing I mentioned is I'm living in dubai and my community just has introduced and every single entrance and exit cameras right and those cameras are several ones one is literally filming everyone coming in and out but it's also automatic car plate registration and there is a live stream to the Civil Defense Department to the pool so they know and in life you know all the time which cars are you know what where were they and what's happening so you can see that you know has an impact on every single part of our life when it comes to security but again also you know back here to you know shopping experiences to marketing etc and as I said I think the key is you know the quality of data but then really really the competence and technology behind it that you need to to actually crunch the data to understand it and to process it that it actually adds value do you believe this is one of the biggest challenges that people face when they say I want to jump on board of a big data of database where I want to put my dad on the cloud yeah absolutely i mean i remember just a couple years back right when we started with the discussions about programmatic advertising and rtb and i remember one panel that are laying real-time bidding there yeah that i was in when it just started you know then in europe and i was sitting next to gentleman's you know from big agencies that clearly were saying at that point the biggest challenge that they had was literally the workforce right they had a lot of great competence and people good in you know selling and buying media and you know with the network's relationships etc but now dealing with data which is in real-time bidding and programmatic trading a key point as well it you know and then coming back to my previous point it's a lot about now meth men analytic guys technology guys rather than creative people etc right and clearly for the companies that have not been built for you know utilizing and using data they are challenged right now mainly to get the right workforce and to get the technology it so you might need to restructure yourself internally if you want to be able to deliver here bored you see that with a lot of companies that are doing this right and again looking at advertising looking at Microsoft over the past years they have completely restructured from a very brand focus initiative also how their teams were build up to a full programmatic set up right now and this is completely changing the industry I would say and everyone is is adapting already for the past few years okay not them I want to ask you again and though in the context of challenges you work with you know multiple service providers and you I think the first point of entry for you would be a chief technology officer or chief information officer or a head of IT who do you usually start with and what are the challenges that you face when dealing with you know the c-suite or the management of a company when you're coming in and saying I'm going to transform your business yeah actually that's a good point because traditionally AMC is one of the biggest companies in the IT just like 65 thousand employees sixty seven billion dollar market the our traditional business was in the IT so the IT is our friends the CIO most of the CEOs of all the telcos all the banking all the enterprise are very close to us to our sales team to our management okay when the big data third platform transformation starts happening we address that in the normal way so went to our friends and reality because this is a solution for that transforms the business it needs to start there okay so one of the main challenges and this is when you want to transform any business you need to disrupt this business and when you want to drop this business you disrupt the technology insert the processes you disrupt even the quality of the people that you have okay and for that you need somebody who sees the business impact to overrule everybody because we're going to wait and tell everybody is convinced of the outcome of this mission you're gonna miss the boat you can be too late to the market where somebody else is going to stop you okay so that's what that is the mean I would say a challenge your recommendation would be to unify the strategy and bring everybody on board and align on the objectives before they basically sure sent I mean in all the business transformation projects that we have worked on for the first time we're really sitting with the boards so the is the first time we really you need to address the board you need to address the investors okay and convince them of the challenges that their industry is facing and then how you're able to transform this business I'll you asked about example I don't about you examples but the examples are really really amazing i will use maybe a couple of examples we working with a logistics company that basically are being challenged with the newcomers to and the new startups that can operate and achieve the last mile deliveries but much much more lower cost okay okay so because this company and like any other company was based on the b2b business model they cannot compete with these new startups okay and these new startups are more agile just to clarify and bring it back to relevance to Big Data can they not compete with these small startups because these small startups have more data about the consumers than the logistics because they have less data or is it because no other results not really the challenge for big data is for the big guys not the whole guys okay the small guy doesn't need three years like maybe 30 scooters delivers the delivery on this small area so he doesn't and he he knows this it becomes close to his customer and use them personally but if you were talking about an enterprise big company with millions of customers okay they need this data in order for him to do the business transformation so what they did is basically said let's build a big big data okay and let's transform our model and immediately it was evident that their competitor is actually their partner okay so now they started partnering with these new startups link them to the app and to the use of real-time data analytics they can still guarantee the quality okay and they can they can really understand exactly who these guys are so it's this is this is just a small example in the banking industry the CEO of BBB which is the largest bank in Spain he announced that his number one competitor as a bank ok is Amazon and Google ok for the bank for them now why and why would they have as a bank would have this issue okay bank has his customers he knows them he sells them products okay hey let it gives them loan will through the real-time data analytics use cases ok Google launched something called p2p which means I can lend you real-time now $10,000 and I make a commission on it okay like two three percent and you return them after one week okay this is a segment or a new business model that I never touch it okay and if this model continues its success yes the banks are at risk okay the banks are too expensive what's the cost of google for this nothing and do you think this is only capable they're only capable of doing this because of the fact that they have the advantage of big data absolutely because how can I give you money if I don't know you now I know you I know all the details about you do you want to reject it just actually to the point before because you were asking like the advantage of data and big data even in logistic ass and as a matter of fact the the guys that that are disrupting it or becoming you know creative to the big traditional logistic companies are my clients so are the e-commerce players right reason when i asked them why are they setting up their own logistics it's certainly you know for quality reasons i'm in a lot of countries that that I'm you know working with my clients if it's Russia or even released quality is not given yet but a big thing and there were very interesting things and answers I got which for instance the logistic person that is delivering the package right with the the new pair of shoes or of the dress it's becoming a sales person as well so face the line counter there are that are running now their own delivery groups and they are equipped with tablets so when they go to deliver a package they have data and information in real time about the person that they're delivering this package to they know what this person has ordered previously as well and they can do upselling literally in front of the door because of that information and they get commission so if they do a good delivery in terms of quality if they actually managed to sell well because a big problem of resist the return rates and if this the delivery guy can sell well and manage that the return rates are decreasing then that's great for everyone and he gets a commission as well he's only able to do that because he has that information at her that had at that right time okay before I turned out to the audience and see if they have any questions I want to cover the topic of privacy paranoia concerned security I mean 10 years ago if somebody told us you know somebody's gonna be logging in everywhere you've been whatever you've looked forward everybody you've called it such a weed freak out now we line up you know in front of stores and pay a hundred dollars for phones that do just that is this gonna get better worse I mean again the terms better worse or quite relative but in terms of consumer data and being able to control your own data should there be a concern we're in an emerging market I think we're the last people who think about privacy and security but it's not a bad idea to at least you know throw that idea you know at you and see what you have to think about or what you know historically has happened in emerging markets that are no longer emerging or any concerns or regulations that you guys personally take into consideration i'll recommend to your brand's when it comes to data security and privacy given that there's big there and with big data comes big risks so with big data comes big responsibilities i would say and i mean i'll give you the example of you know the over god mode that came out a couple of years ago you know it scares people i was actually getting a bit scared when I was innocent previously to thank how he's the aim like okay we should actually collect all the information of everyone in this room and and other calls and text messages that are being done right now and no but I think there's a few things number one we are old already and in terms in terms of older a lot of the consumers today so they actually are much more open to share right when you just look at it the social media what they are sharing like crazy so and you know they are they are more open less concerned in general to share more private things secondly again and you know we are you know an advertising company so I can mainly talk about advertising of course here we we had a few experiences so on the one hand you know running highly customized that right so we were tracking shopping behavior and we were able to show you an ad with exactly the products that you have looked at a few seconds before only right so when we started with this a couple years back users were getting quiet scared maybe in the beginning because there's you feel like your stock what's happening them right and then indeed in the media and the press there was a lot about you know stalking or whatever but it was mainly because people didn't understand right and that's why coming back to the point in terms of responsibility we from the first moment that we served a net even though it was not standard and in advertising at that time we always had a little icon in every single banner that the user could click on and they get information about why they have seen this ad with the respective products in it how does it work and they could opt out as well so you give the user the chance to control it okay so at least in terms of advertising this is a very important step and that you have seen globally now the whole industry you know adapting as well ok tbell any comments on privacy security no no but privacy but just what I wanted to maybe to a disco signing big data I mean it's important to collect but we need to collect good data if you don't choose the data you don't need to collect that's why again we talked about Big Data I prefer to talk about smart data because typically if you collect the data but you don't use in your hella times this data you don't need to collect the data so don't collect data you're never going to use basic exactly and last things and typically I wanted to give you an example I mean what is the value of Spotify or Pandora typically it's not to have access of all the inventory of the music in fact variety is it's because specify will provide you the good song in the gun co text and that is the value I mean of the big data is not to have a lot of data is to provide you smart data and the good that I know in real time in the good momentum audience questions let me just like to comment on reason in the meantime I just let me show of hands of questions otherwise we'll just keep going hands please questions please keep on yeah so I think this is a very important question and it's a bit too controversial question to be honest so I have two answers for an answer you're going to contradict your own self yes okay 1 answer as the manager of EMC yes we own the largest security company in the world which is called RSA okay and we have the most advanced technologies to protect and secure data that's the pure mission but reality based on the disruption that we're seeing yes okay all the regulator's around the world are trying to protect the data they're trying to adapt their rules and regulations to protect this data I'm my personal opinion which is the second okay consumer as a humorous somebody's running this industry and so the industry impact there is no privacy anymore it's over that's all that's it there is no security I'll tell you why in the past when the b2b model okay there were organizations that would sit down and draw together the laws and the regulator will take this and impose it about how can you impose alone you this is the market okay that's it the law in Lebanon and in all of the emerging markets is not to store any data outside the country that is the law that's the law is that a Lebanese law that's everybody's loan the UAE low the Japanese no it will not store later or data outside the cause of that the opposite of what's happening exactly nobody is stopping organization from storing on amazon I mean apart from the European Commission the European I'm telling you this the power moved with this transformation the power moved from governments organizations to the people let me pause you there and just quickly see who agrees in this who doesn't want their data to be used for any reason whatsoever show of hands okay who has no problem as long as they're not personally identifiable who doesn't really care okay what else is there cuz I still see about a quarter of the pot so what else anybody anybody feels anything else user stored has to be stored to be used right yeah I think any time you get benefits more benefits from exposing your privacy more benefits as in registering win I like for example you get more services you get better marketing you get you are willing to give up I'll give you an example on the phone we all know that phone calls most of it around the world are recorded right yeah but because you won't use the phone because of the benefit you will use it okay you know Facebook and all the other sites legally the moment you say yes you are giving them the right to sell your data yes why do people put their private pictures there why they put these secrets on the internet because there is a return the return might not be financially okay they start sharing more and more so it's a balance between the benefits you get how much you're going to give up over your privacy and the end result is I think the show of hands today just and it tells you it moved it ok no more those people don't care yes because of the in return ok tell them to stop to stop all their Facebook accounts now ok they will not you know so that's what I think well I mean thanks for clarifying it and I think you audience also help us clarify I don't think there should be or there is a big concern about about the protection of data I don't have any more questions and I think the audience is equally satisfied as any question oh great can we have a microphone on the first row in the middle piece hi I'm nada I nada I'd like to ask about like lately we've been talking about data and information yeah sorry where is knowledge like we're not talking about knowledge I mean globally is there any emphasis on knowledge or they forgot about it we're only like talking about data than putting the data experience yeah I mean like when data is put in context its information then we need synergy so that information will become knowledge so we're only focusing on data where is knowledge where is the chief knowledge officer that we don't I mean like we all forget about knowledge and I don't think we forgot about knowledge I think now I mean like globally is there an emphasis on this topic or we always hear about data where is knowledge so is the data analysis that you're referring to looking at the data and coming up with yeah so I we are we going like going up the stairs to reach knowledge or we are satisfied with data okay no I mean this is what I mentioned earlier it's I mean it's absolutely a very good point it's not only about collecting the data but having also the right knowledge in terms of Workforce even internally people that are able to use the data transform the data into something that adds value right and in our case I mean we are going beyond that of course a lot now is even in terms of machine learning but who is programming the machines right its people with a certain knowledge for now so yeah for now so it actually and I keep you know doing the past years when I was presenting I kept showing my favorite craft and that was actually about the work for SEC retail which is an iceberg right so the most important people doing everything and making whatever we do our underwater the ones that you don't see right the most you know stupid ones are the ones that you actually see like me on stage talking the other ones that really make a difference are punching the data and Iranian our engineers are data analytic guys etc that are you know using their knowledge to make use of the data and that again is also one of the biggest challenges today there is you know trillions of trillions of terabyte or whatever of data technically available without the knowledge and technology again together there is no use of it going on other questions it's a it's a very good point it's the big data is the platform to dump and collect data knowledge is exactly what what he said is how you build a use case that is transformed this into knowledge and a business impact one of the biggest data big data projects in the world are taken as a second place now in the white would do by smart city would talk about a scene ok let me tell you about privacy huh what this project is all about is booting the whole government data in public so developers can go and start analyzing this data definitely we're not talking about the most classified security national security data this is off limit but everything else what are we talking about govern employees showing up on time what time they clocked in what time they clocked out yeah a much wider making even the government entities ok ok the financial sector the utility companies and you go in and you have access to this data and you start developing applications I think this is a great vision from the white to be honest this is the first real small city in the world because the rest of the smart cities were really silos something on transportation sector something the logistics sector ok not really big data since its are not really big data so that is the role and that is I really love this project because it's creating a new economy for people like us people in the emerging countries they have the same skills and capabilities that people in there mature countries have ok I need to interrupt you have one more question yes just go ahead you might have heard about the recent case between Apple and the FBI yes about the phone what are your thoughts on the matter and do you think it's a step forward if the FBI can't get Apple to to buy class the security gate well that's not a big data question if anybody has a comment on it so are you guys any of you up to date on what's going on with Apple and the FBI so I think what he's asking about is does does the government have the right to force a company to write code that will kind of break the security of a device and I mean I don't know if any one of you wants that said that's what I'd asking it is personal I'm not representing EMC because the NC has an official stand regarding this the personal answer is if they manage to do it today they will not be able to do it tomorrow okay because I'm that the whole point of a precedence is what if they managed do today they will do it more because that's what person what I'm saying is if today they let's say the government managed to force Apple not to do what they are consumer wants okay tomorrow they will not be able to okay okay so basically you feel like more and more the powers going to shift to the in the hands of the consumers it's the power totally is in the hands of the consumers it moved away from IT companies moved from governments moved from telcos okay okay well may I think we kind of shifted a lot from big deal all the way down to privacy into the new degrees but I really want to thank my three panelists were extremely informative answers everything from you know discussing the relevance that is driven to how much data do you really need to collect to even you know looking at real time and how that works to the transformation the business intelligence behind big data thanks again for Dirk MK nausea nazim fresh shot and t-bone naline for joining me and if anybody has any more questions for them you can definitely join them after the bomb thank you thank you
