 welcome everybody my name is Todd Harris I'm the director of marketing at select and thank you for joining us today once again joined by vivek fries are co-founder and CTO at select and also with us today is Paul Schott Miller who is a partner at Kurt Salmons retail analytics and IT practice so welcome Paul great to be here thank tub so today we're going to start off with Paul covering a little bit about some of the problems that retailers are facing he'll also talk a little bit how they're operationalizing analytics and some of the returns that they're seeing and then moving on after that we'll talk a little bit about the power of analytics with vivek specifically about something we're calling choice modeling and also how select can provide you critical insight in context from your existing data so again welcome Paul welcome to Veck and let's get going quick intro to select this will do this right before Paul this Paul intros us to kurt salmon but very quickly about selecting case those of you who haven't been on any of our previous webcasts or familiar with us we're a predictive analytics and choice modeling platform or based out of boston we are SAS based as a quick note we allow retailers to understand how an individual customer shopping in their store or online chooses from an assortment of products and why is this important with this retailers can better optimize assortments both online and in store so as you can see to the right there you've got a sample of a few of our customers there's a bunch more on our website if you want to take a look and if you're looking through the news maybe on tuesday you might have seen an announcement that we put out there about urban outfitters as a new customer so that was very very exciting and we hope to to keep adding to that list in the near future so definitely keep tabs on on select com so f over the past year and a half we've also been recognized in a few ways one of which you see below is from MIT see sale in C cell is the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory and what's really neat is that they listed our underlying technology in their top 50 greatest innovations alongside thing is like encryption in robotics and even the internet i think is on that list so we're very very very happy about that the Paul why don't I move it over to you and you can take it through Kurt Salmon intro to kurt salmon and a few interesting points about what you guys do it especially how we're working together great thanks Todd Kurtz ama the global management consulting firm most notably in our 80 years exclusively focused in retail and consumer brands and for those of you on the line and in the industry I'm sure you've heard of us probably many even have worked with us so really all about retail and consumer brands all about the retail value chain all the time you know specific to our analytic services which we're here to talk a little bit about today really helping our clients move along from capturing data turning those into insights and most importantly finding the value in the insights again have a heavy emphasis on that conversion of the insight to the value you know as a company you know in this business 80 years that really understand you know how to unlock that value in sight without taking that step just doesn't doesn't get you much not very relevant so you know we're all about helping our clients you know move along that curve and drive toward business value next slide please so just a way we have a context setting what we see happening with analytics in the retail and the consumer brand industry said you know despite all of the changes in technology and the changes we see happening all around us you know the formula for success in retail hasn't changed all that much it's really still is about getting that right product to the right place at the right time in the right price and again you know that's in an environment where we're seeing massive changes transformation and technology like consumers use technology cloud-based technologies artificial intelligence certainly there's more data than there's ever been out there before it comes faster it's more current there's different types of data of things like social data and location-based data and as we did you know move into the dawn here of the age of the Internet of Things that in everything you know you're only going to see more data so there's going to be any shortage of data and the types of data we've got new map that's out there as well as we see it being used on this new data and not only in traditional ways between humans and machines but awesome machine the machine so we got new date and we got a new math so what right so so what does that mean for retailers and consumer brands that's what I care about we work with our clients on so what we believe is that we're really driving towards sort of a next generation of operational performance and we think about that a call along a couple of dimensions we have listed here the first is the ability to drive an increased level of precision and especially in how we operate as recharge them it's umer brands so think a lot about how to get the right product to the right place and the way they will use analytics to do that more efficiently and more effectively than we ever have before we talk about personalization this is oftentimes a gear directly toward meaningful interactions with our consumers it Kurt Psalm we call that one-to-one retailing it's really about how do I start having conversations with my customers that really are you know much more about the individual is about as opposed to about the profile or the persona or the region of the geography as we've seen historically in the retail market space we also talked about prediction and prediction you know not only we have we have this data and we have more current data we can sort of sense what happened before kind of the rearview mirror we can tell what's going on now but also the ability to do a better job with this additional data of predicting what's going to be happening and this gets exciting on a number of fronts not the least of which is around consumer behavior whether you're looking at their behavior online their behavior in a store their location-based behaviors it relates to the mobile phone so next generation of predictive capabilities I've been working on predictive algorithms ministry for darn near 30 years now and we're really approaching sort of a next-generation set of capabilities here as you start to look at analytics and you're going to see some of that and some of the tools here would select on then lastly you know really hitting heavily on the efficiency side of the equation around automation so you know the ability to drive more data-driven decision making in particular we talked about you know trying to inject more sigh and two areas of retail that have been typically a very art driven so think about the areas of product design and development take about the areas of merchandise and planning these have been very centered in sort of the art of retail and that's certainly not going away but more informed with a dish with additional science as what we work with our clients on next slide so okay so so if we believe it's got you know there's great opportunity out there along some of these dimensions that I talked about you know then it becomes you know where should we focus and how should we focus and this slide is designed to cast a little bit of a framework they answer those questions so so we look we're looking at about five key areas we're working with our clients and starting to see analytics driving this next generation of performance so think about consumer insights marketing promotion forecasting the whole merchandise planning and buying segments and then the executioner on allocation replenishment and the flow flows the distribution centers flow in the sourcing process flow into the store etc so if you start to think about what we talked about earlier the precision of prediction personalization automation apply those with analytics in those areas and you know and then you know how do those then infuse into the actual flow the physical flow of the product across the value chain and so you know the the where do we focus you know is encapsulated here this is where we're seeing people focus you know now on to sort of how do we focus and that's really more good news right if not you know it's not about buying new systems or actually employing you know MIT phd's like the deck and his partners in the technology really you got the cloud you've got the opportunity to leverage the things that these entrepreneurs are creating to be able to to get those insights to take those insights then and bring those back into the business so it's this process of going out and consuming the insights generally in the cloud-based environment is what we see today and being able to bring those back infuse those into your business to bring more of that science into the process so you're going to hear a lot more about some of the specifics around areas where we see at working today in areas where select in particular is going after that so for you know for retailers and brands the the answer to the how you know is really around building a platform it's building the platform that allows you to consume these analytics to get the insights and then to move those back into your into your processes next slide please so these are some of the key areas we talked about solving hard problems and unlocking new opportunities these are some of the key areas we're working with our clients we're seeing a lot of activity you know the product development merchandising you know getting much more localized in terms of assortments optimizing store assortments and again you're going to hear you know some really cutting-edge leading stuff from select on that on that topic we've got to go on at sourcing supply chain certainly marketing and consumer insights no surprise to anybody continuing to see a lot of activity around you know driving toward that one-to-one experience and being able to really optimize the way we're spending in around marketing then as we get into the channels of the omni channels we like to call it you start to think about the store the website the mobile phone and the types of analytics that were able to get from those areas and the way we're able to apply those within those areas next slide please so how big is the prize will of course I'm a consultant so the answer is it depends and it really does i mean you really have to look at this you know based on the area of scope and focus the type of business that you're looking at but just to give you a sense of just the order of magnitude here and how significant it is you know these are the kind of numbers that we're working with and we're seeing with our clients so you know seven to twelve percent increase in revenue six to eight points in margin for those that are focused on the speed to market at the time to market a segment cutting thirty to forty percent of time out of that across a number of the functions including development sourcing and buying and then you know moving over into the efficiency side looking at five to fifteen percent decreases in SGA and i can tell you in looking in some very particular function area like merchandising we've actually doubled the 15 and some of the clients that were working with that's not a hundred percent analytics but it's analytics applied and then being able to make the business process and the organizational changes that are associated with that so if you you know if you pull all those together and you put them together in the puzzle the right way you know it's not uncommon to be looking for 25 to 40 percent increase in operating as part of this as part of this a broad application of analytics across a number of these functions next slide and I'll just turn over to bovec here in a minute so you can hear a little bit more specifically about how select does that and goes after those types of benefits but just to finish off a couple of the sort of lessons learned success factors that we're seeing as we're working out with our clients first and foremost is making sure you're keeping the focus on being business value driven when we get phone calls from clients saying they're struggling and their application of analytics seeing the value out of it oftentimes because they're too focused on the technology you know it's really easy to get focused on mobile phone apps and beacons and you know video behavioral analytics and Wi-Fi tracking and you know these are incredibly exciting technologies but they're just technologies if you're not able to figure out how to take the information that comes from those turn those into insights that can then be applied so making sure keeping a strong focus on the business value drivers you know really because of the nature of the technology the cloud based platforms you have an opportunity to go fast and they use this test and learn approach you know you can move fast you can try things it's okay if some things fail and something succeed obviously as you're going through the test and learn and then you know in the test and learn approach it's important to understand how this isn't this isn't like trying to install an ERP or a large functional type of IT platform these are cloud-based select and others are cloud-based so your ability to go out do a data pull get the insight generated and brought back to you it's much simpler much faster much shorter time to benefit and you would get in some of the more traditional IT implementation type work that you know we've done historically and we do we still do today as well in some and some of the major functional areas data quality is always a critical a big focus on that particularly in the beginning to make sure you get that right I can't say enough about how important that is to being able to get to be able to get success and be able to drive the benefit on the other side of this and oftentimes the data comes from different places in it and it has an opportunity to go to different places so unless you're in a very specific answering one or two very specific questions in most cases getting yourself set up with a lot of cross-organizational sponsorship as part of this is really important so the words i'll leave you with sort of the key takeaway i keep in mind here that this is really about translating these these new and these great insights into value that's really where we're seeing clients win we're winning with our clients we're seeing them when in the marketplace those that figure out how to make that transition first and fastest are definitely getting the benefit in the marketplace so I'll turn it back to you talk to the back to talk a little bit by our partner select awesome Paul those awesome thank you so much and feel free to jump in while we're while we're moving through some of this stuff here and now the VEX going to take us through a little bit more about using choice to understand true demand and especially how simply called context which is is you guys will understand when he goes through it but I want to take you through a few slides and we can talk through some of this right now so if you vent all yours sir thank you and and you know thank thanks so much call for setting this up so nicely I think I just Paul said something right at the start naturally of the conversation here where you know he said there's we have no shortage of data that was one fact and then you know in a short short second later he said so what right and this is this is something that's very important to keep in mind right where we're basically swimming around and data everybody's trying to convince you that you need more data but we increasingly find you know folks that I've invested in all of these sort of shall we say you know data streams as it were we're not really thinking through maybe to the question of great what do we what are we going to do with this and is it is it gonna help and so that's that's kind of the point I want to make ok so i guess in the short 10 10 or 15 minutes that i have here I first want to talk about a type of data ok that that's all of you know that that's in many that you can get a hold up from many different sources that's valuable ok and i want that that's one point that I want to make the second point I'm going to make is basically how we can actually use the entering the so wat how we can use this data to actually make an operational difference and you know this comes full circle to a lot of the operational issues that that Paul discussed you know as you is describing describing you know innovations in various pieces of the retail process as a as a board so let's start out with something fun okay or and it's my idea of fun right at least ah but but put your put your you know political leanings aside and you know I have a picture up on the screen ah right and you know it's a picture it's a picture of our president you know I'm going to ask you a question about this guy and of course not you know you're muted so you can't really answer the question but just think of your answer okay so my question to you is this right look at this gentleman and ask yourself right right how confident does he does he does we appear to be okay and I'm going to give that a quick second to sort of settling right how confident does this man appear to be all right so you look at that and you know you know he's got he's got his sort of traditional sort of smirk on his face right a bit of a smug smirk and you know maybe you've translated that in your own head to add to you know whatever your answer to my question is of how confident this man appears i'm now going to show you another picture and then i'm going to ask you a slightly different question okay so here's the second picture ok I've revealed the sort of the right hand side and my second question to you is which of these gentlemen appears to be more confident okay now again you can't answer me but because you're muted but right I'm willing to bet that irrespective of the answer right you found it easier to answer the second question than you did the first so the first one I simply asked me I showed you a picture of Obama and I was like oh how confident does might appear but then when I asked you well of these two guys who appears to be more confident my bet is that you know you're going to have a substantially easier time answering that question and that's not me just pulling something out of a hat it turns out that this the research that goes into understanding this is just a fact of how human beings think okay so you know psychoanalysts have actually sort of uncovered this over a hundred years ago and really my message to you today right is that you know this sort of context but that made that made that made that second question that much easier to answer is actually all over the place in your data and it's actually data that if we think about it carefully we're effectively throwing away all right so just like showing you context in this side you know in this picture made it easier to sort of answer a question imagine how unveiling context in your data right what imagine what that would do to helping you understand customer demand so let's let's dig into that concept a little bit okay um so at the end of this whole thing right really the Chiss is towards understanding to demand Oh gates it's this maybe if I if I could rename the slide you know an alternative title for the slide would be building a crystal ball for you know what's your customers right that's what we're all after because if we had that crystal ball business would be easy and the old challenge is not having that crystal ball so you know you should let anything fool you at the end of the day it's really about this you saw this challenge the other Domino's kind of just fall into place right so how do we actually go about this all right well here's sort of a traditional approach right you might say well listen I've got all of this data about direct demand okay so i know that you know here's this customer and this guy is gone bought this you know this this sad this blue shirt but in reality you actually have slightly more information than that right you know what he bought you know that he bought the blue you know the blue sweater but at the same time you also know that he did not buy the red sweater and he did not buy the you know the black sweater with the with the hoodie attached to it right now traditionally right this second piece of data that what you did not buy piece right that's something we actually throw away in trying to get towards what demand is will simply use that first piece to get through okay look this is demand for blue sweaters really what we ought to be looking at is demand for blue sweaters as a function of the context of that sweater when I employ the context of that sweater this is something we can get from data okay this is something we're having data helps if I can uncover the context of that purchase just like that picture of Obama of the Putin right I actually can understand demand for not just the blue sweater better but also I understand the role of the red sweater and the role of the black hoodie okay so that's what a choice model is all about okay a choice model gets towards understanding customer preferences okay if that sounds like a bunch of words to you right let me actually put it to you in very very simple terms right sticking with the blue sweater the red sweater and the black sweater right let's say you go about asking yourself listen should I had a green sweater to the mix right or should I take the red sweater out of the mix right if you think about those decisions those decisions aren't decisions that can be made in a vacuum because if you add the green sweater you're sure there might be people that want to buy green sweaters but uh you know that might actually take away two men from the blue sweater the red sweater and the black sweater all those Union all those of you in the audience that are struggling with you know sku counts that are sort of spiraling out of control probably understand exactly what I mean you're right if I actually add those things in and don't ever take away stuff right uh what I'm left with is an assortment that's just completely gargantuan and sort of very very difficult to manage on the proof side we know we can't have a very spot from the sort of maybe that will actually get us two words you know losing customers so you know there's a whole bunch of questions in particular that we could ask right I you know we could say well listen that we sold out of a product in a specific store what would the right hat allocation I think that is to say you know if you had 10 blue sweaters and you sold all 10 what should I do next here should it be 12 11 15 what's the right number right um if you know on the other hand um you know you've never sold a blue sweater at store 58 you don't have history on a blue sweater at store 58 how would that blue sweater actually do in store 58 again being able to marry contacts between stores might actually let you guess what the man for that blue sweater would be um maybe you're thinking of adding a brand new brand right to a set of stores what compact is not going to have on all the stuff that you're already carrying so as you can see right all of these questions are journeying to sort of the business of actually just the process of retail and fundamentally modeling choice gets to the heart of this task all right so let me let me actually skip over this you know for a second and and and and go from this picture over here where we're asking questions to let's say a candidate output ok I'm going to show you a candidate output and really what you should be thinking about when you see this candidate output is that that nice little no shiny objects you know icon that you had a couple slides ago right this is a star cluster okay I'm sure that a lot of you have actually worked with these clusterings or working after the towards a cluster right the first time you actually look at this or a picture like this it's interesting you're asking you're saying okay look all these guys go together all the other guys go together but at the end of the day I personally have looked at so many of these things right ah these look like colored dots on a map to me frankly right and it leads me to ask you know what's the operational value of doing something like this once you ask this question what is the operational value that's a hard question right and coming back full circle right to the sorts of tasks we want to answer really any cluster you come up with for instance needs to be something driven off of a model of how people choose so if two stores are going to go into the same cluster it had better be that tells me something meaningful about how to actually assort those stores or how to manage inventory at those stores or something something of that nature so that's that's kind of what we do with some of the choice models that we learn we do choice driven clustering right and what does that mean what that means is a effectively building representative models of customer choice clustering stores based on those models and then a sort of sorting those stores to those clusters so if you will as opposed to sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy where you put all your you know your large format stores together in one cluster and all your ethnic stores together in another cluster you know and so on and so forth these things are sort of self-fulfilling prophecy as opposed to doing that you're building clusters based on customer demand okay um what does this look like at the end of the day right at the end of the day you know this is one final point that I want to make here before you know kind of you know opening up to any any Q&A right one final point I want to make is you know we talked through science in some sense we talked through you know a number of questions that you might want to answer with this science we said a little bit about clustering at the end of the day when you inject all of this into your process on the outputs that you got need to be easy to work with right uh and you know that's that's that's one final piece right someone some of the things we're very focused on it select for instance is providing you know folks across the retail process be it in financial planning merchandising you know planning allocation giving all of these people a common user friendly view of the predictive analytics that emerged from from the sort of analysis that we that we that we do so that's quite a bit you know i wanna i want to just sort of pause over here right and you know really just kind of digest everything I've said really what I've kind of walked you through it shall we say the science or the predictive analytics counterpart to all the operational things that you know that that Paul was talking about and if anything you know one of the key points that I wanted to get across is something that Paul started this conversation with which is we have no shortage of data okay you're swimming and data there's no argument you know against that the question is so what wouldn't you do with this data and you know you're at select you actually believe that we have attack on this that we think really kind of gets a lot of value out of all that data that you've gone about you know collecting so carefully so let me just stop over there and you know how to hand it back over the top yeah so thank you be back this and we have out of that now is a couple solid chunks of content on both the process side perhaps the integration side the deployment side and into the practitioner side of the data and out of that there's a there's a few questions I think that that we could ask ourselves here a couple of which were asked by attendees but one of which I want to start off with right now and this is a little bit more towards vivec than Paul but Paul I have another one for you in a second so the question was about the data because you were talking about a lot about the data that's require the data that exists in organizations so the question is more about um where do we actually get the data from before you know there's a question about they currently have their data aggregated into a where they calling it a master sheet what was called so the question is if we're pulling data to analyze how do we exactly pull it from the sources and also how do we give it to them and whatever their current source of operation is whether it's a sheet like they said or whatever it might be I know it's a bloated it's a big question but is there way to summarize that that can make few minutes look like how how we present the data to them in a case where maybe they have their own spreadsheet get working in yeah so I guess yeah you know I look from qualitative to chime in here as well right but really sort of the last piece that I was talking about right a lot you know we're talking about all this data and all this heavy predictive analytics a lot of it is actually today happening in Excel right and if you think about this ah it's just like without even getting very sophisticated there's actually a lot of risks to this so for instance here recently we've been thinking about by quantification of a customer and you know if all of that analysis is actually happening you know in a in a spreadsheet then what do you do with virgin control on that spreadsheet right uh what are the chances that you're actually going to make a mistake and merging two versions of this so I agree there's some very very simple things that actually need to be done around data hygiene and data cleanliness before you get her fortunately i'm seeing like at least from my standpoint a very big change happening over over the last few years where people people are getting much more open to dealing in you know dealing with data in in sort of user-friendly systems that reside outside of excel maybe and you know you know coming back to exile only you know if and when you know if I'm when needed I trust always going to be a big piece of the puzzle huh yeah absolutely I don't have Paula do you want to add something no I would just say I mean it excels very heavily used in our client base it's a tool that's used out of necessity because oftentimes the the ERP system of the host systems the legacy sisters that are out there don't have a level of flexibility they need to manipulate the data and so you know as we're seeing the sophistication the visual nature of these systems these new systems come out you know there's as you said you know there's a move toward less and less reliance on Excel and you know the notable risks like version control like you know they you know how current the data is how do i maintain the date I mean there's there's all of those kind of things that get dealt with you know have historically been dealt with you know for a tool that was really used because it was it was a one tool that was user friendly enough that the average person could you know could make some progress with it yeah so we have another question here I'm just going to keep firing through these until we run out of time and about no no no 5 10 minutes there is a question instance for both you guys so a Western was can you provide more details and how you build customer choice models for the entire store and i'm going to read that as through across all of the stores meaning across wherever the stores are across the nation across the globe or whatever that's I think how we should answer that question so the vector you want to lead off on that one sure sure absolutely so that's a you know I want to avoid getting down a rabbit hole on the fight on the question but given that it sort of one side of thing that's the minimal chance of that ah let me just say this so I you know I'm not sure that you know the background person asking the question but you know when it comes to choice modeling by the way this is something that was done you know in the in the world of you know grocery for a very very long time actually right so if i put in a you know another brand of coffee on the shelf what's that actually going to do oh really what we're trying to do is answer that same question for retail more broadly and the challenge in taking the existing solutions shall we say that you'd see in the grocery world and kind of just applying them more broadly is that there is way more choice now than there has ever been and customer choices are actually evolving much much faster than they did so really our approach to modeling choice is effectively looking at trans out in a nutshell looking at transactions of every individual customer over time overlaying that against the context of that customer that is what was the choice that they had when they actually walked into the store and then feeding that to you know I you know you've not said you know we didn't say very much about you know IP that's core to select but there's some IP that's core to select relying on a methodology called tensor completion ah that that you know lies in the heart of Oz and I apologize for throwing that he's a jargon out there but it lies at the heart of us you know being able to do this sort of choice modeling task which used to be a very firm manual task that you'd imagine you know to data scientists would do for one category over two weeks we take that entire thing and do it across millions of skews in hours right and that's and that's basically necessitated by modern data and the scale of the problem Paul any thoughts from you know I think Rebecca cover that well it's you know with today's of storage Moore's law to processing though or the amount of storage statistics to deal with things like small sample sizes this is absolutely doable you know at an individual store level so going back to some of some of your earlier slides fault you were talking about some of the processes related to some of these rollouts and I guess some of the higher level steps you guys take when considering analytics in a retailer organization I guess a very high level question is that I think many of the participants in this webcast might might appreciate is to understand roughly how long does it take before seeing any tangible benefits so before I seeing any return or any adjustments and in-store revenues or anything like that based on your experience in the industry yeah I mean I think one of the things that's most exciting about this you know the sort of mash up of today's technology the cloud-based architectures you know the the new type of data that's out there is that you know you can do this pretty quickly I mean think days and weeks instead of you know a historical IT implementations type stuff that happens in months or even years you know this is days and weeks and you know test and learn environment you know you can very quickly start to understand you know the you know what the impact and the order of magnitude of the impact and you know we always try to go forward in a pilot and a test and learn type environment before we scale of course but being able to see that benefit within the test and learn environment is literally you know is as quickly as you've changed a decision and that's impacted you know at the store level if we're talking about stores so if I changed an assortment if I changed an inventory level if I changed an offer you know in a test and learn type mode you can start to see that benefit pretty quickly and again I think you know once you're past that pilot stage the ability to scale and scale quickly again you're talking about weeks now to be able to get after that you start to roll it out on a level where the you know the benefit becomes very meaningful and we're seeing that you know very consistently in our in our client base cool the other question we have here that I want to address before we break here is what about I guess specialty retailers that don't have a whole ton of stores so maybe not a single store but only a few let's it'll be back what do you think of that um yes I I mean actually even with a single store for a specialty retailer right um there's the flip side of this problem which is a lot of specialty retailers that have a small number of stores down are also doing a lot of wholesale and you know we're we're at the end and Paul can speak more to this right but at the interface of like if you look at if you look at the department store on the one end the department store is sort of saying listen I'm buying from this wholesaler uh you know what store should I actually be putting this wholesalers product them the wholesaler has their own view of what stores their product up two ought to be going in and so really you know even if you're a specialty retailer if you have a wholesale site in business there's very much the same question that comes in right you know what how should you actually what should you actually how should you what the ideal way your footprint pull your product across you know all of the all the customers you distribute to and I think there's some very very important questions to be to be asked and answered over there yeah i mean i think my perspective is whether you've got one store
