 sites with analytics and a/b testing this webinar is brought to you by 80 internet and Optimizely and our guest speakers the unique combo from 80 internet and Mario's cream Maya from optimizing my name is fabian vivek and i'm just going to enter this webinar to you help you with a few practical things and present the speakers and then pass it on to our hosts for today hope you can hear me well if not please just leave a comment in the chat and then we'll try to fix that as soon as possible all right so i said before welcome to optimize the connect and this as you might have seen and maybe you've joined a few of the other webinars is a series so we've already had a webinar together with our partner helium and together with Localytics that one was more mobile focused today with h internet and then our last webinar is going to be with our partner clicktale the purpose of the series is for you to understand how to leverage the data that you're already connecting to better understand your visitors and increase your RI from marketing activities your presenters for today ms set before veronique combo and marios clay Maya I think it's best to give both the chance to introduce themselves personally so Veronica if you would like to go ahead nice to meet you here when you came a product and partnership manager for 18 to net and I would be the woman voice today on this webinar hi my name is mario's I'm a solutions engineer optimizely so I help our customers integrate optimized into their existing ecosystem and that's also why I'm on this webinar today perfect i think this this perfect combination just like analytics and testing great experts here on the webinar so i'm really thrilled to hear from them and have them share the experience and stories with you guys and a few housekeeping items before we start so this webinar in total is going to take 45 minutes as always with our optimizing webinars you can ask questions at any time and if you're enough familiar with GoToWebinar there's a question panel where you can basically pop in your questions and then use this panel and we'll answer all the questions at the very end of this webinar and because i always get this question as slides and the recording will of course be provided so we'll send them over to the address you provided em at registration so we'll send them out after the webinar so you don't really have to take notes if you want to of course you're more than welcome to all right this program for today so first of all we have a brief introduction of both 80 internet and optimizing for those folks that don't know either of those technologies I think it provides a great overview and helps you understand the content much better and put it into perspective then we have fundamentals which covers the biggest part of our webinar today so how to use analytics to discover the weak spots on your website and the next step would be generating ideas generating hypotheses to start a be testing and then we have a few use cases for you to put that knowledge into practice and then at the end you can see how this integration works with an optimizing and eighty internet so how you can integrate both tools to get more out of them and at the end s said before QA so we'll take questions from the audience all right I think that's it and with that and without further ado I would like to pass it on to to the unica Thank You fabulous so for this introduction I just want to share a quick in size and quick numbers thank you so there is no denying that analytics data is at the heart of strategy for different companies we think that in 2016 it has been clearly demonstrated that we need analytics data and now we are more focusing on how to optimize website and especially with a be testing yes so beyond analytics a be testing is also very important for marketers ninety ninety seven percent of marketers actually think that a be testing is very useful for them almost sixty percent of marketers says it's even essential so it's key to their success if we look a little bit deeper into these numbers there's a study that we conducted about a year ago you also see that ninety-eight percent of the respondents of the survey said that it's very important of the success of the marketing campaigns and so it helps them understand their customers over also there are needs and desires but it also helps them to deliver relevant content and also increase conversions in this study what is really interesting also is that 72 person of the surveyed use analytics to inform optimization above all other tools and tactics we have worked with mario's on a different way to show you how we can help you to improve your performances by turning your data into value and you will see this is a synergy between 18 tonight and optimizely 80 internet we are digital analytics solutions our major competitor are adobe or google analytics our solution offers complimentary and interconnected applications we all are available in this in this solution like in this picture we cover different customer needs from collect to sharing by going through data analysis of course we can adapt our tool and support depending on your level of maturity your use and your industry we have current customers more than 3,000 in a hole over the word in the different industry you can see here we have a smaller company but also really famous words alright thanks Veronique a little introduction to Optimizely and most of you probably already know Optimizely but here's a quick overview what we do so overall we do a/b testing of course so we help you create alternative variations and what we actually did is we made this very easy for our customers so you will save a lot of time is you optimizely both non-technical users but also engineers will be excited to have this option and we also have you to target specific audiences examples are new visitors vs returning visitors but also the location of your visitors that helps you really to run different experiences for different audiences then when you run experiments or different campaigns we help you understand the impact in real time so you can really take action very quickly and the core of web optimization is overall knowing everything or as much as possible about your visitors so we also help you connect third-party data or also your own CRM for example and take this data and drive more personalized experiences what is a be testing a very quick overview in with a few simple images on the left you see how your website will work before doing a be testing before using Optimizely and you have your website you have a few conversions let's say you have about a thousand bucks in sales and that's it that's very left image then the two middle images show you that you can start using Optimizely maybe you create a variation that's different from the original and half of your traffic will see the variation half of your traffic will see the original and then you can track in real time how well those two variations perform and you may see an uplift in the variation that you can then implement and that's the right image so what happens after using Optimizely you implement the better variation drive more conversions and generate more sales optimizely is the market leader in experience optimization so what you can see on this chart is after we started in 2010 we grew pretty fast and that's mainly due to the fact that we made testing very easy easy to use then then yeah get people excited about it with over 6,000 paying customers here at optimizely here's a few logos of those now to start with how we are interconnected and how we can bring you some value we want to make a focus on three steps to start these three different steps are we've built of course it's theory and you will see after right after in practice what we can do so first let's imagine that we have a website and we are challenged by some directors to optimize turnover and conversion this is quite basic action in Syria what we should do the first thing we advise you is to analyze and use analysis of your KPIs to look deeper into your website and pain points if you can detect some troubles on pain points on some things that are going wrong on your website such as decrease of conversion rate or if you noticed a decrease of an increase of Abaddon card everything you want if you notice that and you you cannot attribute it to something you should know it you can probably think about doing testing for doing testing we think this is a good to define smart objectives to start off course smart is a method that you you probably know defining specific measurable achievable realistic and time related objectives helping you to well define your project then of course when you run a test you are supposed to do some conclusion thanks to the smart objectives you have defined well defined and this will help you to conclude and improve your website but also your next steps if you want to do a/b testing again let's see now in practice what we can do our thanks to our two tools we will share with you two different use cases the first one will be in media industry we will have the same framework for the two use cases so on the first step we will analyze and show you how to analyze your website thanks to different tools you will show we will show you how to detect pain points and build some hypothesis and of course run a test so for this first use case in media I'm really happy to introduce to you our new customizable dashboard for media industry this dashboard is available in 80 internets suites it allows you actually to understand that it learns your business this is just one part of the the dashboard we we share with our customer you can find unique visitors visitors percentage evolution of visit etc and many many other kpi's you can follow these KPIs for different periods on your website but also on the mobile on it on a nap and this is totally dynamic let's see now how we can detect pain points actually when you have such kind of reporting of dashboard you can see and compare different periods so here let's make a focus for instance on actually and active users we see that there is an evolution but not a good evolution versus the previous ones so um here we notice that we have lost 11 person on both and which action can we take to improve this given experience mario's will share with the with us what he suggests for example thanks to a be testing tool yes so a drop in eleven percent of active visitors that's a serious problem as vernix a and a solution we could think of here is make the new status sign up more prominent of course if more people sign up for the newsletter chances are they will also get the release letter read it and get back to the page and read something more on the side hypothesis we have for an experiment is really that we you would like to place a more explicit call to action in the left corner of the home page so more visitors will actually see it sign up for the newsletter and then re-engage so how do we turn this idea into assets variation with Optimizely on the left you see the original it's an example from from the mirror code at UK so what we do is we see that the new set of signups very small in the top right corner you see the small arrow here and in the variation that we want to create we want to make it more prominent so on the left you see that right now you can win some tickets we want to show something more more relevant for us and for the readers for example the newsletter so we can change the title like this we can also change the subtitle and promote the newsletter we can go ahead and add a hyperlink so people clicking there will actually come to the newsletter and then if we do some some more back fixing and just make it look nicer we actually have a nice variation with the newsletter on the top left so very prominent people will see it if they like news they will sign up let's now another example we are still in 1810 Atallah latest analytic suites dedicated dashboard to media you can find again meaningful inside you can follow in real time to manage your primary or secondary secondary goals how did you take the pain points here we've noticed that on our reports premium stories we have decreased by ten percent on the premium story so we need to turn these data into actions and make some hypothesis to not reproduce this for the coming months mario's which actually do you suggest for instance all right again so the problem is we're losing page views on paid content which is really money we're leaving on the table so we could improve the subscription page so people really subscribe for for a subscription the hypothesis we have is that we can add images to the subscription package packages and you will see what this looks like later so visitors will really like the offer and it's more likely that they will actually sign up so this is the current subscription page so it's it's informative it shows the different packages but people don't really or there are no emotions trigger let's say like this so in a variation what we could do is show more images to show people what they would actually get if they sign up so it makes it more likely that people actually sign up let's see another use case more on the e-commerce part now so we will cover the same points analyze your website detect pain points and build a hypothesis and tests with Optimizely tool so we are also offering new dashboard for e-commerce industry highlighting other kpi's so here you can find for example unique visitors average baskets conversion rate new visitors and their percentage new customers and their percentage etc this is just an overview as before here we can maybe make a focus on some papers you can just take a look on the the repeat buyers so in this monthly reporting for instance we notice a problem on repeat buyers the average basket drop down and the sales to marios what kind of action could we take to improve this with the optimizing ok so again problem is discount sales have decreased so a potential solution i would offer or proposed is really making this element in the menu more prominent so sailors and offers or sales just make sure people actually see it and buy stuff that we need to get rid of the hypothesis i have is by moving the sales and offers element in the navigation to the left and highlighting the text more people will obviously notice it and we will see an increase in sales from discounts so setting this up in the editor this is a very simple example on the left we see the original on the right we already see the first action we're going to take with the optimize the editor or in the element rearranging it and right now sale is on the right and if we change it it will be on the left next step from our hypothesis is also making it's taking it more obvious so we can go ahead and change the color of this element of the text now it's red and again it's more likely people will notice the sale and also go there by something in other hypothesis this is related to another problem it's that repeat buyers have dropped off and a potential solution is created buying incentive for those repeat visitors because we all know repeat visitors are good the cause of acquisition for those visitors slower you should make sure they also have an incentive to buy it and what we could do here is adding a prominent lightbox to the page and really welcomed the visitor personally as a repeat visitor and because this will increase the likelihood they will buy something again again this is a slightly more advanced example because we had to add some CSS here to make the light books look nice but on the left wrist you see the original on the right you seem very personal variation we welcome the visitor because we know he's loyal to our page and we already offer a small discount to make more likely the person actually buy something thanks mario's let's see a second example in e-commerce industry we have in our complete offer a focused dedicated focus on mobile and app analysis because we know this is relevant for you especially for a few years so we provide specific kpi's like date of first lounge for new users performances of the different OS or different versions study of the crashes etc so uh let's see what we could start e here so we are in the app analytics part and we have noticed that the engagements and visits have decreased over the last month since we have launched a new version of the app so you will see thanks to optimizely what we can do mario's will share I think hypothesis and test example yes thank you so in this case a page user engagement has decreased in this case by fifteen percent for example and a potential solution is make it more engaging make the f more engaging for example a delight functionality so instead of just buying something we offer more ways to engage for our customers and also giving us more information hypothesis is and that some users might just not be ready to purchase something but they would like to indicate a preference and continue later so we could add a soft call to action like a like button and users will engage more with the app this is actually an example from one of our customers from trunk club they also had a similar problem in the original to the left we see that people could add something to the trunk but that's about it and the variation they created with optimizely in their app is well people can still add something to the trunk but on the top you see different call to actions it's it's smaller steps towards buying something so they can indicate they like a product they can actually share it and and what they saw is an increase in engagement with this like button but at the same time there are main metrics its purchase didn't go down but it actually increases as well so that's a great experiment and they also control for the main metric which is improved as well so in this bird we have seen how to analyze and use an analytics tool to follow your your results but will also show you that we can do some high pettis and run some tests thanks to optimize it too but we have never we didn't talk about how we are interconnected and how you can use of course analytics also after the end of the test to show their results so here this is the principle of our partnership we are one click integrated this is quite easy you will see after with Mario's that in optimizing interface you just have to activate in one click 18 internet tracking and this will allows you of course to see in your 80 Internet's to the results of your tests campaign and variations and you will be able to segment we will show you everything so this is of course helpful to reduce your tracking implementation this is really really quick and you can consolidate all the data yes so how does this work from a technical point of view again we are looking into the optimize the editor you see that under options there is an integration option and if you go there you will see in the different kinds of integrations we have and then 480 internet it's particularly easy to integrate all you have to do here is really entry or eighty internet account number and also the URL of your locks over and that's really it so once you've done that the tracking automatically works optimizely an edge internet talk with each other then the next thing or what's important to keep in mind is that the basic analytics really learning what variation works better that's something we already tell you you from Optimizely we have a strong stats engine that gives you results in real time the tells you a works better or b works better so we can do that with clicks with page use but also with revenue but then you also have set set up different kpi's in your analytics platform like 80 internet and you can if you want to go more into depth it's very important to look into that platform as well and that's why we have this integration thanks Marius so has you you mentioned you have meaningful kpi's in your optimizing interface but most of our customers also need to use their analytics platform just to consolidate all the data but also to make sites and trick analysis so that's why this connection help you to get your data into your 80 internet at analytics weeks so we had a segmentation tool in our interface and it allows our customer to create segments on the fight on the part of their audience and they can get all analysis in real time for this part of this selected audience now we are here in the data query tool this is where you can build some segments so this is a useful tool if you want to request on the raw data and if you want to to manage and get answers to your questions so here this is an example how to build a segment really quickly into clicks you can go also further with the 18 to net a 96 weeds and once you have created your segments you can use another application to visualize your results so here this is an example of a test we're brown and you can see that we can display variation 1 and variation two different purchasing process and check which are the differences and which one as per from the best so to conclude this is a powerful integration we have seen that analysis of course are useful to start and to make some hypothesis to do some tests so it means that thanks to optimize the tool you could you can do careful changes to your user experience of course you can thanks to analytics also on optimizing and also on site centric tool such as 8 internet you can validate your test upon KPIs you can ensure there is no deterioration thanks to a dashboard so if you can do some reporting every day you can check that there is no deterioration and the integrations help you to continually improve your given experience meaning that if you notice that something is wrong in your dashboard analytics dashboard you can do hypothesis you can do some tests and if you notice the test doesn't work you can do another test and if it works you can do the changes on your website and finally do some new AP tests and new high places it's really helpful to continually improve a given experience our everybody em thanks very much merius and veronique of course for presenting those use cases and giving us a better insight into your tools and technologies and basically what they're capable of capable of of course those are some rather basic examples I think also with optimizing we can say that almost disguised limits so there's a lot of more advanced use cases that our users basically perform and on a daily basis that we can get into later in the question so we get a bunch of questions and great thing is we still have fifteen minutes so I think and let's just jump right into it and take the first questions and the yeah just a reminder at this point it's not too late to post your questions if you would like to have them answered by merius of course for optimizing and veronique 480 internet so first question I would like to ask goes to Mario's so and we had one of our listeners ask what about responsive pages so we've seen the example of top men a shopping website an e-commerce website and of course there's a lot of people that will use that website on mobile for example when they're in the train or on the bus and they are browsing and maybe they can bike back later they'd like to see a consistent experience marriage maybe we can um yeah share with our listeners how that works m for responsible pages yeah that's a good question so the short answer is yes that's no problem the longer answer is yes overall is possible you can set up either experiments for different viewports you can set up one experiment experiment that's good for all viewports but in some situations from a strategic standpoint it also makes sense to set up one experiment that's only for desktop visitors and other experiments that are for tablet users or iphone or phone users in general because those people browsing your website from different devices can be in different situations depending on the device they are on and there's also no problem because we allow you to easily target for those different target groups so for laptops computers phones other mobile devices that's no problem and but it's always a strategic question so what target groups do you actually want to talk to great thanks I think and I hope of course that answered your question and just a reminder here if it didn't then just please please let us know in the chest and then we can we can go with more you're a DJ on that one and let's do a little ping-pong here so next one I'll pass to tube unique and they leak the question we had here from the audience was what happens if I have different campaigns let's say maybe paid campaigns and so campaigns acquiring traffic coming to my website and how do i track that if I have more than one campaign on the same page okay I understand actually you can run different campaign at the same time and on the same page so our soul allows you to define different objectives on the on the same page so well you can you can do is you just have to talk with the the super team to help you maybe if you have specific questions on which kind of objectives to define for the different variation or for the different campaigns all right yeah it makes sense em and I think as without too messy as well if you would like to understand that in more detail of course you can get a demo of the the platform and then get a first glimpse of course and on what it can offer to you and the next question I have again for merius so one of our listeners asked is optimizing compatible with WordPress what happens if I have a lot of templates sitting in WordPress maybe for landing pages how would that work in the optimized the editor yeah good question again so overall it's very easy to implement Optimizely with wordpress like any other CMS or block system or shop system since it's it's a front front end changes we make it's still a one-line integration and the nice thing about WordPress though is that we also offer an integration with our REST API a and I don't want to want to go too much into the technical details and it basically allows you or your editors which are non technical and may not want to use Optimizely to still set up headline experiments so testing headline a versus headline be for example and from within their WordPress environment so they don't need to use optimize the design of experiments from within WordPress so that's the rest api we have great thanks various i hope that was useful and just one comment I wanted to make and because i saw the question a few times which is more general and applies to both nurse and villainy so m yeah in order to use this integration that we showed in practice or in theory if you would like to basically replicate that on your own website and you would have to use both h internet and optimize it to really gain the benefits of of connecting the data from both technologies so um i think yeah one listener asked that question and then I had another follow-up question on this so yes it is necessary to use both at the same time and next question goes to the leak again um let's say we have created an 80 internet account we work with you guys we work with Optimizely and we would like to collect data how does that whole at activation of the account work this is quite simple actually we have seen it in in the presentation so what we can suggest you our common customer is directly to go in optimizely interface everything starts in Optimizely interface so you just have to click on integration button and choose your analytic solution so in this case 18 ternet and activate it so I think you have a few parameters to to set up but you can have an ask your 80 internet support to have it if you don't know it I think it's the site number and your log your log URL so if you don't know them you can ask to to our support and then when you will automatically start your campaigns you will be able to see your resource directly into your eight internet interface in different application for those who are customers of eight internet you can use the reports you can use also the dashboard application and you can use a data query application if you if you can go deeper into your urinalysis you will find three different dimensions your campaign so the name of your AP test your creation if you are different if you had different creations meaning different banners for example and your variation so the variation one variation 2 etc and you will be able of course to do some segmentation on that dimensions which is a really interesting if you want to know which one has performing the best regarding some interesting kpi's behaviors for the time span the conversion rate and so on great thanks for Nick and brilliant answer I think and I hope of course and the person that asked that that question get the information they need it and Mary's I have another question for you which well definitely surprised me that it comes up because it's usually a question many people ask and many people are curious about and also very unsure about so it's the question of traffic how much traffic do I need and kind of the length of a test so for how long should I run a test until I get meaningful statistically significant results yeah that that's a good question I could talk hours about it I try to keep it short so overall statistical significance depends on first of all how much visitors to your test and but then also how big is the difference of the two variations you have that's more or less what it comes down to if you have a more obvious change or a change that really changes the behavior of your visitors strongly then you don't need that much traffic if you have a very slight change in more traffic an example is google for example they have lots of traffic and they tested like 20 shades of blue for their hyper and obviously it doesn't trigger a huge change in visitor behavior if it's slightly brighter or darker blue but Google still was able to measure an effect because it was a tiny effect but they had millions and millions of visitors they could test that's why that's why they could detect an effect um for most people we are talking to we say you definitely need to test a few thousand visitors for an experiment the more you can test the mark successfully will be obviously but then beyond significance it's also important to think about validity of the results and while our set engine tells you at any point of time it's significant and then you can believe it's significant that's that's benefit of stats engine for validity we always say you should be running an experiment for at least a week so exactly seven days or also 14 days the reason is that you want to test a natural traffic cycle because your visitors probably behave differently on the weekend then during the week or a day or at night you have different visitors to your page and when you test something you want to make sure you test it for all your visitors it's why it's important to run it for a network traffic cycle like week two weeks month but not just two days because that it's just not that great yeah i think there's also a lot of blog posts of course written about this where we go and more into detail i think you can also visit blocked or optimized ecomme and type type in length of a test or how long to run a test and there you'll find more more information on this same goes with our knowledge base where we go deeper on those issues because it's as said before something that obviously you need to get right and that's an issue that a lot of people have as well so the question that asked the president asked that question you're not the only one wondering about this yeah so maybe to rest one more point about this I sometimes hear people saying yeah I want to start doing testing but statistics isn't that important yet I mean I'm not a mathematician I I don't need all the details but at the end of the day it comes down to getting the right answers and getting the truth and that's what you need statistics for us so that's why it's not always a comfortable thing to think about or talk about but it's it's necessary to get the right answers that's why we highly recommend also yeah reading a few articles or talking to us about that great and yeah of course stats engine makes it easier than ever so you don't have to be a statistician but an interesting statistic is never wrong and with that I have one last question for 450 nique and so we've seen a little bit of app testing basically app analytics and obviously more and more traffic is also coming to mobile sites and more and more companies decide to launch apps at the same time so maybe you can lose a few words on the capabilities of 80 internet in this space when it's you guys add this functionality what do you offer and basically why should people use your app analytics ok thank you um yes actually we have 360 degrees too and we want to help our customer to measure what's going on on all their devices so it means of course desktop it means mobile and it means on us so we have a specific solution in our absent oolitic dashboard so this is a representation where you can have interesting KPIs and we can make a focus on this new uses actually our customers different website and different industries they have the same focus on discover what's going on on the ABS and how to optimize it so we provide specific SDK 22 of course optimize and follow the different analysis and kpi's so if you want or maybe a demo or if you want to show you want us with optimizing it to show you how we can provide and help you to improve you your website and your performance is how to turn this data the different data you can collect with optimization with us to inter value do not hesitate to request a demon women if it's specific and even if you're working with another analytics tool and we will show you what we can do with the different dashboard we are providing to our customer or in the mobile apps or more on the desktop part right that sounds like good call to action from your end via unique before we go to the next or the last part which is just showing people but the next webinar is I wanted to ask Maris one last question which was asked just now and the question was and can you explain and you showed that in an example for example on the top man website where you added a lightbox how do i add new content to optimize you so not only changing things that are already there but how do we add new content to optimize and is that easy to do okay I see ya so let me take a step back and briefly explain how optimize the works in general and you can make all kinds of changes in the optimize the edit or we save those changes on our CDN different CD ends actually a camera in EdgeCast and once a visitor comes to your website with our optimized descript installed we load those variations that you create in the editor and with a brief javascript injection we make sure that while the website builds in the browser the changes you want the visitors to see erica from this wall so let me quickly think so when you add new elements as well you can also do that so you can either either use the visual editor and just insert new elements that's very easy you can insert images text boxes you can insert any kind of HTML if you want and this content blocks be injected once the visitor comes to the page and yeah by the page loads in the visitors editor great i think that was optimized in a box basic editor and thanks mary's for that for that explanation and for all you guys and i wanted to just a big thank you for for being with us today this morning and basically getting a better understanding of how testing works together with analytics I think it's a very very powerful combination as we've hopefully shown you hopefully gave you some inspiration and ideas that you can then run and and turn into action on your own website and mobile app here and still the the context that I wanted to pass along to you guys so Veronique find your email address there merius the same we haven't unfortunately gettin to answer all the questions that we received sorry about that but what we will do is separate them depending on what the topic was and then get back to you via email and I hope that's okay for you and one last call to action from our my end was that we are not quite at the end of our connect series yet it's so there's another webinar with clicktale which is going to happen in May um same time same length and hopefully same great insights for you guys so we're going to talk about user behavior how to use heat maps in order to generate testing ideas and hypotheses in order to understand your visitors better so there's some great content coming down the line and yeah just one last I wanted to thank merius and Veronique thanks very much in greetings to Paris for being with us today thank you very much thanks Fabian thanks everybody we'll send out the recording and the slides so you have them at your convenience have a great day and thanks very much see you bye-bye
