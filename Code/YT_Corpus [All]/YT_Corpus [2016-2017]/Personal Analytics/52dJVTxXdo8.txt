 hey guys my name is Christian LeBlanc and today I'm doing an entire video on Google Analytics just two days ago I was actually invited directly by YouTube to join a Google hangout where I actually got to get one-on-one insider information on Google Analytics Google Trends and other tools that might be helpful to content creators so make sure to strap your seatbelts because this is going to be a good video okay before we actually jump into Google Analytics I actually want to take a look at Google Trends and I think this is an incredible tool so if you come to the Google Trends homepage you can actually see here are the top 10 trending things for this example I think I'll put myself in the shoes of my girlfriend she actually makes YouTube fashion videos so she often calls her videos look books so if I search lookbook which is commonly used by these YouTube fashion girls so we can see here that pretty much since the beginning of time lookbook has seen a steady increase until it hit 2012 after 2012 there was a steady decline that has gone on pretty much to present so that's telling me that essentially the word look book might be outdated or it might not be that effective but lookbook is not the only way to call it I can also say outfit ideas and right away we can see the outfit ideas although it didn't always keep up with Look Books and has gained popularity and is actually now looking like it's just about to surpass it so let's shorten the period of time just so we can get a more accurate read on this so I meant to set a custom time just over two years so we can get a bit of a closer snapshot of what's going on in 2014 you could easily say that lookbooks was probably a better idea than outfit ideas but we can see here the lines are converging until the point where outfit ideas is actually becoming more popular now it's pretty minimal and you could argue it actually wouldn't even matter but imagine if the line differences were more extreme this is a great way to figure out how are you going to title your videos and which will give you the best chance of being found on YouTube or on Google now we can scroll down a little bit and we actually get more information so if you look here look book is actually the most popular in Singapore the Philippines Hong Kong Morocco Netherlands and so on you can click right here and get more information on where's the outfit ideas being search from now I see Philippines South Africa United States Ireland UK so this is another thing that should be taken into account who is your audience and who are you trying to target if you're targeting Singapore definitely use the word lookbook because it seems like it's very commonly used in Singapore so now you want to scroll down and down here you can get a little bit more information what our actual lookbook words that are trending or rising so if I click here the rising is lookbook 2015 lookbook 2014 these are words that are actually being used and being used more and more so they might be coming into trend let's click on outfit ideas and it looks like outfit ideas for 2015 seems to be the most trending and rising out of all the outfit ideas tags now if I put myself in the shoes of a fashion youtuber starting from the top I can see here that maybe outfit ideas would be a better title than lookbook I can see that if I use outfit ideas I'll have a better chance of capturing these audiences and some great ideas might be within this category of rising so if I click on the rising I see here that flannels seem to meet making a comeback 90s outfit ideas are making a comeback and arise they're up 160 percent over the past two years one last thing that I'd suggest is why don't we try even a shorter time frame let's do the past 90 days now if we do the past 90 days you'll see some of the results will change it seems like in the past 90 days lookbook is being more commonly used in Canada United Kingdom in France outfit ideas somehow is still being swept by the Philippines now where it might get interesting is if you shorten the time frame to 90 days and come down here if I click on look books I can see here that lookbook 2016 is seeing a bit of a surge so this might be a great title if you're creating a lookbook so let's say we decided we're gonna call our video outfit ideas let's see what kind of outfit ideas are rising right now well it seems Valentine's Day outfits are very valuable outfit ideas for 2016 Christmas Christmas winter winter we can already see here that there is a huge demand for winter and Christmas outfits so it might be a bit late to be posting it now but when the season comes around next year maybe if you get your video up 3 to 2 months in advance you'll be able to ride the rising trend and get the most views on your videos I've already spent too much time on Google Trends let's move on alright guys I just want to start with a quick introduction to what Google Analytics is and how it works and from there we'll get into a little bit more of the advanced stuff to start I'm showing you guys my personal analytics and I've got the estimated ad revenue blocked out just because I'm going to keep that part private as far as YouTube's concerned the biggest indicator of how well a video or channel is doing is watch time and so if I go here I can actually hover over this figure and I've got almost 2.2 million minutes viewed every 28 days and if I actually hover over it I can see that there's been a 64% increase over last 28 days so that's a great great thing to see the average view duration of one of my videos is four minutes and four seconds and that's about a 15% increase over last month so again that's great because YouTube decides how well video is doing based on how long are people actually watching it not just how many views ad is doing so we can see here that I had a huge spike on this one day on the 13th of January and I think that's when my how to travel the Philippines video went viral so that led to a lot more views than normal so even though it looks like things are going downhill that's actually not the truth it's just that I had one extremely knockout day where I really did an amazing job at getting views on my videos but you can't sustain that necessarily and so things kind of dropped down to a bit more normal again if there's one thing you should take away from this video it's how can I increase my audience retention one of the things I recommend doing is taking a look at your videos and seeing where do I see extremely large drop-offs in audience retention so for example in this video here and this might not this doesn't exactly count but I can see there's a fairly large drop we go from having 42% of people watching to only 24% now I'll show you why that happened so as we can see here I'm just flogging but then we had a glitch so in that span of roughly 15 seconds the camera froze something happened to the upload I'm not too sure things get better though and boom all of a sudden our audience retention starts jumping back up if we go from 24 to 45 it's not that people magically reappear it's that they decide to skip ahead in the video so what I'm trying to say is I recommend that you look at yourself in your videos you know do you have spots your videos that are dry that people are leaving and this is often this can frequently happen in places like introductions when people choose to do lengthy introductions and you know viewers like to get to the point quickly so if you're doing a DIY where you're showing people how to make a costume you know don't take 10 minutes introduce yourself because you'll have no one to actually watch the video get to the point fairly quickly because you will lose your audience so let's start by selecting a video as we can see here this is a chart of how many people are still watching after a certain amount of time now by about the 1-minute mark I've already lost 30 percent of the audience is that a negative reflection of my video maybe but not necessarily because people just have such short attention spans you can be guaranteed that at least 20% of the people who clicked on your video will leave within the first 10 seconds even if they see what they want and you can actually answer that question how well are you really doing by clicking here on the relative audience retention now this is basically a comparison rather than just a report now I can see that at the one-minute mark remember I had lost 30% of my audience but according to YouTube that's still above average if we move further into the video well at about the 8 minute mark we're dropping just below average and by the time I video concludes we're below average so that's not to be taken personally that's just the nature of how things are but you can learn so much from it so I can actually go let's see where I started dropping off so if I click here boom it now shows me exactly where in the video that started to happen so where did we start losing people so if we click where I started to drop below average we can actually see that this is towards the end of my video and this is where I start concluding in my video I actually verbally say in the video thanks for watching my video guys blah blah blah and I start talking off about a topic that they didn't necessarily click for and so all of a sudden you're going to lose a lot of people so how can I use this information to help me well basically in this how travel the Philippines video I can see for a fact that people started to tune out around the conclusion of the video as well as my summary and at the end of the video I said you know what were my top five places is the Philippines safe is it expensive do you need a visa and by this point I was losing quite a few people a lot of people were losing off losing interest at this point because they didn't really care they just wanted to see the more visually pleasing side of the video so I learned from this and use that in my how to travel Thailand video in my how to travel Thailand video I actually shortened my exit and so my conclusion of my summary I made it a lot shorter so that I could hopefully retain a larger percent of my audience by the end of the video so one of the great things is I can actually compare videos so come up to here and where is the comparison there it is comparison so click on the comparison button and let's select how to travel Thailand okay now that you have the comparison all set up now keep in mind it's not exactly an equal comparison because how to travel the Philippines first of all had viral success behind it and it's been up for about an extra month how to travel Thailand on the other hand was only posted about a week ago but we can still compare some of the trends and some of the patterns how to travel Thailand has an average view duration of 5 minutes and 46 seconds which is shorter than how to travel the Philippines but let's keep in mind that it's relative to the length of the video so how to travel Thailand actually has an extra six percent of the video viewed if your YouTube you're actually deciding how successful a video is based on the percentage of view time so it might have been good that I actually kept my how to travel Thailand video a little bit shorter to even get that six percent extra audience retention that will hopefully help YouTube's search engine optimize it a little higher than it would up for my Philippines video okay so let's look at demographics and I'm actually just going to cancel the comparison for this because I don't think it's overly relevant for this part but if we click on how to travel the Philippines we can see here that 61% were male plus 40% female that doesn't add up I don't know where the extra 1% came from but let's ignore the unsurprisingly the Philippines was actually the number-one viewing country for this video number two United States Canada etc so how is this information helpful well immediately we've learned that when I create a title like how to travel the Philippines it interacts better with the locals than it does with foreigners so for future videos like how to travel Thailand well maybe I need to find a way to target Thai people because there's a better chance that they will watch it than anyone else it can also be said that maybe there's more males who are watching travel videos so how can I target that demographic I don't necessarily have the answer but it's food for thought another extremely useful analytical tool is traffic sources so where are people coming from how are they actually finding a channel so scroll down a bit after you click on traffic sources and you can actually see here that most of my traffic based on watch time 41% of views or on watch time minutes are actually coming from suggested video the one that I find the most interesting is actually the YouTube search so what are people searching that is bringing them to my channel if we click on this my biggest words are Philippines Philippines travel travel Singapore gopro hero4 l neat and we can see here that by a long shot the biggest is actually Philippines Philippines is 13 percent of my minutes watch which is huge so what can I take away from the statistic here this is basically telling me that any video I create and caption the Philippines or Philippines Philippines anything is a hot word it's bringing a lot of traffic back to my page and it might be a great thing to include in future videos same can be said with GoPro although only 2 percent is gopro hero4 we can see gopro session gopro hero4 session all these little GoPro words add up to almost 6 or 7 percent and that's pretty substantial so maybe I should make more videos with the title GoPro or you know day with the GoPro in Asia just finding ways to incorporate hot words but something that's interesting and worth noting is that if you click on the Philippines look at this the people who are searching the Philippines the most are actually not Filipino they come in second most of my Philippine searches are actually coming from the United States so it's also good to figure out what are your hot words and who is searching them because this can help you target that audience a little bit better in the future another really useful section in YouTube analytics is the subscribers bar so come down here click on subscribers and take a look at where your subscribers are coming from so for me I can see here that over the past 28 days I gained roughly 7,000 and lost about 700 but the most interesting part is come down to video click on it and this tab will actually show you which videos are creating you new subscribers so I can see here my best video is how to travel the Philippines and it's created me roughly 380 subscribers over the past 28 days which is pretty amazing I'm seeing a trend here and it's essentially that my highest viewed videos are creating the most subscribers and that's not going to surprise anyone here what you might not realize is there might be some genres of videos that you're creating that are actually being much more successful than others the main reason you should check this out is you just need to have a better understanding of which videos of yours are worth your time are you putting your time in the right places and which video should you create more of and the very last thing I want to cover with you guys is annotations and annotations can be an amazing tool to keep audiences engaged in your videos now I'm going to be first to admit I have done a terrible job with annotations and if we look here at my stats I'm doing very poorly with them to give you guys an example of what an annotation is I'll quickly pull up a video and so this little pop-up was actually added by me after the video was uploaded and the idea behind it is after someone completes watching your video you don't want them to leave your channel you want them to stick around and check out more of your stuff so adding this annotation hopefully will encourage people to check out another video of yours assuming they're still around at the 10 minutes and 12 seconds mark which is a bit of a stretch to expect let's go back to analytics and let's actually look at that exact video okay so if we look at the annotation success on most beautiful place in the world island tour El Nido we can see that success is not a word that should be correspondant with this I have been far from successful just over one tenth of a percent of people have actually clicked on my little pop-up on the other hand close to two percent have closed it so 38 people actually clicked it 595 people were annoyed and clicked it and said go away so I obviously need to ask myself why is it that it was so unsuccessful could be how I worded the pop-up it could have been the moment that I used in the video but also one of the bigger reasons I think it's also a failure is that it's so late in the video if we see here I quit my job to travel click here that didn't happen till 10 minutes and four seconds into the video that is so so late in a video by the last minute of the video I probably have only 50% or less of the audience left we can see here that by 10 minutes and 4 seconds we only have 32 percent of our audience left now that's still pretty decent when you consider this video gets hundreds of views every day but for some reason we're not capitalizing on that pop-up and people aren't clicking on it unfortunately I don't have the answer to that question but one thing that I will be doing is changing the wording around to see if I can increase the percentage of click throughs if you guys made it this far in the video you obviously liked it so make sure to hit that big thumbs out click the subscribe button and get ready for more videos to come thanks for watching guys
