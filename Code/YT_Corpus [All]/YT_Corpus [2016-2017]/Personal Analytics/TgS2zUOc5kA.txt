 good evening one my name is Paul yeah I'm just going to walk you through some internal audit trends in the outlook for 2016 because I China what I'm trying to do with these brief presentations align IBM solutions as well as kind of look as we move forward is turning addressing key issues and pain points for business this one presentation will be pretty brief it'll just talk about some of the key points that are driving internal audit in terms of the talking point on the pre-sale or up sales opportunity so I'm going to talk overview internal audit I'll just talk about high level view of some of the issues facing internal audits for many companies I'll talk about the top three trends and I'll talk about the overall value proposition IBM offers so many many years have gone by I've done some internal audit work in the past for various companies and the function has changed dramatically over the years and a lot of it has to do with the automation and that's driving it from basically setting up triggers the kind of manage think so yes you would still do the internal audit functions in terms of the cycles but there's a lot of more proactive work done by internal audit now more so than its probably ever been done in the past and I wanted to highlight that too there's also another big issue that comes into play there's more and more increased regulatory requirements that are being forced down by a sec or governments this is also triggering aspects of internal audits in terms of investigation in terms of part of the overall audit cycle so that needs to be bear in mind the other area that's going to drive this as well as you see here is cybersecurity is the more and more companies go online and do more digitalization of their operations from supply chain to e-commerce to just different aspects of their supply chain there's more and more pressure of hackers trying to do things so there's more and more pressure on internal audit the monitor controls around now we're adware any sort of things entry points that could disrupt the business okay supply chain management I brought that up is because it's becoming more and more complex there's more and more pressure on that there's more operational risk on that side I want to make sure that was clear that internal audit likely be involved with that as well let's talk about some of the key areas quickly and trends we're actually in a period of time where we're going to see probably slow economic growth so budgets are going to be stretched so it's going to be about how do you better manage the internal audit departments in terms of setting priorities so you're going to likely see that more pressure on them to look at solutions that will help automate that stuff to help better control the internal control processes but allow them to better leverage the cost structure in terms of keeping the cost down by the department that's really what you're seeing here this gets into the more the the regulatory side that's what I said earlier is every you've got the SEC so bring out new requirements on the exhibits whether that's to do with a mandate globally driven or it could be an SEC driven mandate that puts more pressure on budgets of costs because now that you have to add that to an exhibit on your 10-q 10k or statutory filings in general that means basically you have to have a review of that that means that's cost to business so there's been a lot of pressure to bring more internal audit back in-house because they want to control the costs that an external auditor would bring in as part of that mandate to part of the complexity of the regulatory side of filings as the more and more companies go online through different things they're going to be basically fused facing pressure from cyber security and different hack different ways maybe their business could be disrupted the other thing too as well as companies are trying to be more agile so this is where you're getting into more social analytics different levels of data coming into the organization the managing the big data so you're seeing a lot bigger Porsche to basically get this data better manage it better manage the infrastructure but also have the proper internal controls in place ensure that you're doing with accurate data and data is not being compromised either for privacy or any sort of security issues as well as that the data is being made is its comparable it can be made for comparison and it's accurate that's another key things where the internal audit department would come in how does IBM fit into this IV n has open pages which is a risky analytic solution there's an actual module call internal audit that basically allows you to automate a lot of the processes is part of doing the internal audit phase of a company and I would encourage you to go out to the site to kind of look at the IBM value proposition because as you're looking at the overall audit function in terms of how you can better manage it we also have other software in terms of different things from Cognos controller side which does the consolidation we also the reporting software call cognos disclosure management allows you to collate reports together maybe and bring some of the audit report processes into play as part of looking at that Soliris their solutions that you can look at in terms of automation as part of looking at how you move your internal audit department for because to maximize its value it's really going to come down to its ability to be agile to the decisions made by business but also be able to automate processes to allow them to basically put focus on key control structures and frameworks to help mitigate any potential losses for business thank you
