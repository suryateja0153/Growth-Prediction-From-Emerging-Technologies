 one of the changes has happened in marketing over the last recent years has been the the sort of explosion of data and so one of the questions is how does one manage and handle sort of the what is often referred to as big data but is its data that's down at the individual level and how do we take advantage of that obviously another domain that's changed is trying to think about the omni-channel we've got so many different domains in which we could be spending some of our marketing dollars and how do we do with that and that would include also trying to think about social media and the implications of social media and the evaluation of social media spending I know that any area that everybody is struggling with is the whole area of marketing metrics and how do we measure what it is that we're getting from that and for me it's it's become a personal interest and it's where I've been spending my research time is trying to understand the domain of marketing metrics and have written books on it and have a radio show on it but I find in this program that a much of the learning comes from the other faculty but also from the participants in the program and I really enjoy every time I teach this program I learn something and it comes from what it is that I here in the classroom what I hear it over lunch and dinner and in the hallways in between our sessions and for me it's it's an enriching process and so I enjoy it very very much
