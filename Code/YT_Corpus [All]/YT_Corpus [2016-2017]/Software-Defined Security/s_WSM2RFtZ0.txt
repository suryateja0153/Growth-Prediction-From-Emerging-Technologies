 hi today we're going to be talking about Cerner's journey towards a secure software-defined data center really there's a little bit of false advertising here because it's really about in FV here's our legal notices that we have to flash up my name is joke when I work for the cerner corporation that is not the CERN nuclear foundation it's a healthcare IT company over here I also have some co-presenters to rune and manish from intel and guy with the nice hair and hi I'm Pino de Candia from me toca rat today we're going to structure our talk around who is Cerner what is our requirements then we're going to get into IPs and ideas what that means which is our virtual network function and then we're going to get into some use cases which are the attack vectors will roll into some demo then we'll get into the nitty-gritty details of the solution so Cerner who is Cerner we are the world's largest publicly-traded healthcare IT company go ahead we're in over 30 countries our software is found in over five thousand hospitals used by nearly a half a million physicians our software is very similar our journey is basically very similar to sa p we started out as a mainframe a lab system and then we've evolved to a win32 oracle system that we host in our own internal environment and then as we've moved and migrated to any device anywhere we are now running on open stock and in the cloud if you've ever been to the doctor's office which i'm sure most if not everybody has you have this form called HIPAA it sounds a bit like a disease but I promise you that it is not it's about reasonable safeguards against your personal health information we call it pH I and what it is is it's safe guards around your past present and future mental and health conditions as well as any payment information so what we do is we have to make sure that there's not unintentional disclosure between one doctor's office or somebody else that's trying to get your information centers for medicare and medicaid services what these guys do is they they actually provide thirty percent of the United States health care and as that they actually provide stricter guidelines than HIPAA so when we looked at HIPAA they said reasonable safeguards well CMS for Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services if you read the risk management handbook volume 3 standard 32 it's a riveting read read it on your plane ride they'll help you fall asleep but if you do that you will find that they say that you can't just use perimeter security such as enterprise firewalls and IPS or intrusion protection and intrusion detection systems you actually have to do what's called defense and depth which means that you have to incorporate firewall and IPS IDs throughout the entirety of your entire data center platform let's go ahead so what is perimeter security well we're not going to try to divulge what we do for our own security but this is kind of a high-level graphic here so you have the internet on the far right or far left and from the internet we actually provide security tools such as IPs and ids sitting in between our enterprise network which is depicted in the top right hand of this graphic and our OpenStack environment and we use this the security tools to prevent unintentional traffic or malicious traffic going from one to the other dan Lambright from the last North America summit gave an excellent presentation on unobtrusive and unobtrusive intrusion detection what this was about was he went into what intrusion detection and prevention is such as monitoring network or system activities for malicious activities and then went into how this could be implemented inside of OpenStack it's a fascinating topic and basically what we've done is we've taken that work as a derivative work and extended that work so we've looked at we he talked about what network based IPS and IDs r which is basically what you do with that perimeter it's a device that sits in between networks host base IPS IDs runs on your laptop much like what's up running here and it prevents malicious behavior such as cryptolocker from taking over your laptop what I'm going to do now is as we move forward we're going to talk about me donut and how it's a critical component inside of neutron and we're going to get into how how this integrates into our solution you know thanks Joe so I'm going to tell you a little bit about me tonette meter that is a network virtualization solution for containers and virtual machines so the key points i want you to take away from from you from edo net it's built by me two piranha it's open source open source since late 2014 it's multi-platform its overlay based because we wanted to allow it to work with any standard IP fabric and we try to get rid of all single points of failure and make it linearly scalable so that means getting rid of the single points of failure means getting rid of the network nodes in in in Neutron essentially and that means that for layer 2 layer 3 and stateful layer for devices like source not far away service load balancing at layer 4 we don't use appliances we do it all in the agent and so instead of moving flows around to go to appliances where the state is held we actually push state around the network and that achieves a linear scalability I'll show that it with some visuals in a second we believe on we believe in and using layer 3 to scale your network so as you deploy more and more racks you don't want to have to stretch your layer 2 for the on-ramp on into the cloud so we use a layer 3 on ramp onto the cloud with bgp and finally because of how we've built the system we've pushing essentially Neutron models out to the hypervisor and having the models at the hypervisor means that we can have deep visibility into what's happening to each and every flow meaning for each flow we know exactly what devices it tours through the neutron topology and we can report that so that you can do debugging in trouble shooting in a very easy way next I plead blonde is okay so here I'm showing a standard neutron topology you're not used to seeing an edge router for us at me Tokra we use an edge router that is virtualized so that we can have the virtualized on-ramp in this slide I'm just trying to point out the standard in Toronto Balaji has virtual machine port level firewalls those are the ones that you're seeing right above the virtual machines then you have virtual routers that have source not far away service load balancing as a service you have a public network usually an external provider network for us that's also an overlay Network so next slide please so that topology what I want to show you is that in our implementation will be able to do a traversal of that entire topology which had only layer 2 through layer 4 elements no layer 7 elements like VPN or advanced firewalls but we can do that all in a single physical hop so here you're saying sort of a classic open V switch architecture but without the open piece which demon we have a flow switch which is the colonel open V switch module you have VMs on both sides the VMS that are circled on the left a green vm and on the right a blue vm the sort of darker those are the vm that you saw that you see in the in the smaller logical topology in the center and the one on the left is sending a packet that should get to the blue vm on the right so what happens is just in classic open V switch the a packet goes via the net on Channel and Miss packet goes to our agent our agent does a flow computation we actually simulate the entire logical topology that you see in the center it's as if the middle that agent is kind of thinking about what would a real network do if it got this packet and it computes the entire all the transformations that would happen on that packets headers computes that and then applies them in one flow rule and installs the flow rule in the flow switch and so the packet is tunneled over to the destination hypervisor and delivered directly because the tunnel key tells the destination hypervisor where to deliver the packet and all of that without going to any appliances anywhere so if you vallejo seven appliances will have to jump around the network but otherwise you've you've removed we've removed all of the network hops that cause you might have heard the term traffic trombones so I'm gonna hand it back to Joe to talk about security Thank You Pinot yes we're not really into trombones here I myself am a trumpet player so we're going to try to remove all trombones out of our entire OpenStack environment but first we're going to talk about three different attack vectors the first attack vector is outside in attack that means that there's an evildoer outside of our OpenStack trying to compromise a host within our OpenStack environment based on the the discussion that Pinot had which is the the traffic actually has to traverse through what's called a medial net gateway so when the traffic before traffice before it flows through that meet on net gateway it flows through the IPS were then that malicious activity would be flagged and then cut off and the other attack vector which is inside out in the unfortunate case that there's a virtual machine that is compromised within our cloud and trying to do some evil work outside of our cloud then it the traffic has to traverse through the Gateway then through the IPS IDs and then eventually to the victim where eventually what would happen is the IP SIDS would catch that traffic and make it so that we would be flagged that we would know that there was something going on inside of our cloud that's causing the problem so the issue in lies with the implementation or the goodness that derives from me donut so if there's an inside inside attack vector what happens is is that there's a vm to vm communication well on the left hand side of this chart we would see that that traffic never passes through the perimeter IPS ids because the host that's compromised internally is trying to get to another host or another vm internal and that traffic never passes through so one of one of these an example solution would be well route all your traffic through the IP SIDS from there well now you're sending data from the vm through the media in that gateway into the IPS ids would then it would be flagged and then back down through the Mito net gateway into another into another host now this may seem like it's okay but it's not really a scalable model notice that there is a what we call a traffic trombone all traffic has to go out to that IP SIDS that's really undesirable situation so how do we resolve this the way we resolve this is by virtualizing the IP SIDS as a network function so what we do we take advantage of the Mito net capability of service chaining and what we do is we're out the traffic from the from all VMS through that IP SIDS that would be local and then as it tries to traverse to another vm it would be then flagged and caught notice this is also a linearly scalable solution because we as we add additional Nova nodes then we can add additional V NFS as well let's get into what this looks like we have a demo the Manisha is going to talk about so you heard a couple of things right I mean you heard about the problem statement that is the need to that they need to have two trombone traffic if you have an edge edge device that's going to be doing the traffic inspection and then just just the ability to have visibility to east-west traffic and be able to secure that so what we basically did was when we when when the when the request came in from sirna we put together a an environment in which we could start doing some of these tests and figure out how we can do that in the manner that's automated and ensure that security is propagated across the data center right this is just a snapshot of what the what the physical configuration looks like i'm not going to go into all the details but what you can see essentially are the things i want to point out i use you see the mirror net component over there that's essentially a virtual switch you see the security controller it's called is see over here it's an int'l open security controller that we have put together to enable us to orchestrate security virtual functions you see the virtual IPS components over there that's that's from that's a mcafee IPS at this point in time but it's a virtual IPS and then the security manager that you see on top and essentially what you have are the three nodes and if I go into the the the demo setup essentially you have a an osc turn into the open security controller tenant which is seen as a if you think of it as a controller node and end it depend and this is just for the demo right but but it really depends on how you're going to be deploying it what the topology looks like within your environment and and and how where you want to place that particular control right so you can see the osc tenant has the security controller in place and you see all the virtual IPS nodes in there or the virtual IP is instances in there and the tenant do is essentially and then you see the two Tenon's the tenant one is essentially where you have three web server sitting behind a load balancer and think of it as a standard you know web server farm and tenant to is is a compute node as well but from which you know we were we have an attacker sitting in there from where we would be instantiate in some tags right so you see the attacker node over there what we did was we go through the router onto the onto tenant one yr the load balancer and towards this towards the web servers right and and and it's it's it's a basic demo at this point in time but essentially what we're showing is we we do this the attack goes through after which we use the open security controller to insert the virtual IPS at that at that spot so that you know it you're you're able to make sure that that the attack does not go through and you get the you get any kind of information that that that relates to a particular attack so so this is this is a you know the snapshot of the OpenStack environment those are the three tenants we talked about and this is really the the console of the open security controller right i mean we are in the process of developing this but what you can see is you see the connections into the into the whim the the virtual infrastructure and and then you see essentially the ability to define security groups those are basically the components that you're going to be securing within your environment and then you can you're going to see the element managers you know those are kind of the firewall managers the IPS manages things like that and you are able to to get to a point where you can define where these controls are going to be enabled where these controls are going to be deployed and how you're going to be able to deploy them in a manner that's effective right so so this is a more of an automated process you don't have to run scripts you don't have to write scripts for the same but essentially you're able to state a deployment spec that says for this environment ensure that you're able to deploy these controls in a manner in and such that they are positioned in in a specific way right and depends on your topology depends on how you want to control it how you want to enforce those controls right what you're going to see is now this is this is just a security manager you can see there are no events that were that came up over there and we were before we start at the attack and we're going to access the web servers and it's just a standard script right so it's a HelloWorld script you see that it goes through no problem and then we run some other controls like you run a command prompt you run route everything goes through and and you don't you you know it's at this point in time there are no security controls enforced and you know it's it's it's basically allowed to go through and and then at that what we're going to do now is essentially going to bind the controls on to you know what your target what your target environment is you go in you enable the IPS you have two policies essentially you know command cannot run route can run but we want to be alert at once route is run and and and and once you go ahead and bind it and you see its path so the policies are now enforced on there and and and we go through the process of doing the exact same thing we go to the attack vm attack a vm and we're going to access access the the web servers the computer web servers right on and you do that you see before we do that no alerts nothing on there and then we go to the process of saying hello world that's allowed to go through no problem it goes through you go to the command prompt and you see nothing has really happened I mean it's it you can still see the hello world you know script running over there so it's been blocked and it's not been allowed to go through and and this is Ben this is a control that's been inserted by the the security controller right and as soon as that happens you see a an alert come up in the in the security manager and the very same thing for for for root x root right a minutes it's not it's not prevented but we wanted we want to be alerted every time that's run so the exact same thing and you see those those alerts came up well the intent of the demo really and you know we try to do a live demo we had some technical issues yesterday and a couple of us just put this together we put the video together so the editing is not really the best I mean it but but honestly what we were trying to show is the ability to insert a security function in a manner that's automated into your environment based on your security needs and security policies right and this is this is with an IPS likes and and it can be done with a firewall it can be done with with a wife things like that run it so it can be extended to other other security functions as well so that's that's kind of like a snapshot of the demo and we go into some more details you'll go into some architectural details on on middle net and then some of the architecture details in the security controller okay so I'm going to tell you a little bit about how meet Lynette software-defined networking and service chaining enable open security controller to insert devices IPS is between workloads and attackers but before I do that I just want to point out that again service chaining is just an enabler if you were to try to use service chaining yourself you'd still have to take care of virtual machine management placement on specific compute nodes failover if that compute node fails and in load balancing of workloads onto service VMs so all of that is done by the open security controller which makes the solution really cool so what I'm showing here is on your left you see a workload vm with the standard Neutron port level firewall and in its network I'm not showing you the rest of the network but it's just a regular topology so you don't have to touch your topology at all and this is going to be very important we don't want to have you modify your topology in order to get layer 7 security instead open security controller insists on a layer to bump in the wire model and that means that we can transparently inject the service vm in the path of the traffic so before anything starts the open security controller in a way that short term showed during his demo will deploy service VMs according to your specifications in in the UI so for example do you want one per axle but at this point I'm going to assume that the service vm is already placed just want to point out that the service vm has two networks on the top you see a management network that management to that network is used for communication from the service vm to the security controller and a few things are happening here the service vm can report on traffic but will also take configuration and that's what the management network is for on the bottom you have a service data network and a port firewall there just set up automatically by OpenStack in practice neither of those is used because we only are using the service at a network to get a port which you can't get without a network in Neutron so at some point you decide that a specific vm is part of a workload that should be bound to a specific security policy press the button you say protect my VMS with this security policy so what the open security controller will do is it will send a message first to the service vm saying that a specific VLAN is being bound to a security policy now the service vm is ready to protect your workload the next thing the open security controller does is it does the service chaining now I have two icons there because at the moment it's a metal net proprietary amido net specific API not proprietary it's open source but it's a minute API for doing service chaining not the neutron service chaining spec so we're going to implement that later and that's why I have OpenStack and now that's what will eventually do but after that call service chaining logic is inserted between the VM and the rest of the topology and between the service vm and its data network so that when traffic arrives from the internet or from another tenant or within the tenant is arriving towards the workload vm the service chaining logic intercepts the packet and adds a VLAN header that has a tag which signals the policy and has the pcp bit set in order to let the service chaining logic know in what direction the packet was traversing and we'll use that in a second of the service vm and usually this is maybe this is a syn packet not really usually an attack packet off the bat it's usually let through and the service vm would send the packet right back out of the same port so you see this is a one-armed appliance and the service chaining logic of the service vm recognizes thanks to the pcp bits that actually the traffic should be re-injected but not just reinjected which direction it's going towards the vm and thence and hence the packet is put right back where it was so the packet hasn't been modified the VLAN tag has been now stripped so the packet looks exactly like it did before and it went through so layer to bump in the wire model now the vm responds for example to that to that flow and the packet is again intercepted by the service chaining logic redirected with the same policy tag but PCP bit set to say that this is leaving the vm going away from the vm and again the service vm it goes through the service vm and if allowed returned intercepted again there and it continues on it on its path as if it had never never been intercepted now at some point in time the service vm sorry the flow is established the service vm is just in the path and then sees all the packets and is allowing them and it's important that it continue to see all the traffic otherwise you wouldn't be able to block attacks can happen at any time in a flow a flow can look innocent and then later there can be an attack injected so the service vm is is the bump in the wire and then an attack occurs like that cmd.exe in the URL and that's recognized about the service vm the server's vm blocks the flow and packets in both directions are stopped the vm is protected and then of course the service vm will also alarm and send you know depending on what kind of ips you're using it will report the sim ok so well very briefly if the service vm fails there are ways to simply all traffic stops but there's a policy that's more lenient and that it allows it if we can detect that it's failed and the policy is more lenient meaning fell open then the internet will just allow the traffic right through because we don't want to block if the service vm is down ok i think it's over to you so this is manish now i'm going to just spend a couple of minutes to talk about what we are doing with our security controller there was a tech talk about this yesterday you know you can find the video on that but i'm just going to walk through real quick so the row we're trying to play here is of a software-defined security orchestrator and you know there is like four key things we're trying to do her security function one is automation and orchestration of the security functions so you saw an example in this or no use case where they are trying to do this for the IPS as a bump in the wire but we can also do this is same thing for a web application firewall before any kind of other you know next-gen firewall and other application delivery controllers and so on so the idea is you have some kind of a policy that you want to deploy for your security for your workload or your infrastructure and then this is how we are going to do the automation and orchestration the second part is the coordination of security policy so it's key to understand that we're not going to start managing the policy but we're coordinating it with all this security function managers so you're still going to be interacting for example the the screen you saw with the demo where the network security manager which is IPS manager still manages this policy but now you know as far as coordinating those policies like which workload how do you insert all of that and then the third part is interacting with the virtual infrastructure and the SDN controllers so you'll see some more details in the next slide on this but basically we are trying to get to a point where you know we can take this orchestration as for the security service is concerned and then interact with the OpenStack multiple things and also for the SDN controllers and finally to do the scale out of security so in the cloud we know scale out for your workload but then you also want to be scale out for the security for example if you have a web sprint if you have a web store with like 10 vm and then you know your auto scaling needs it to go to 1,000 vm but your policy says that it needs to be protected by a web application firewall so you need to be ability to you know autoscale your security also so this is kind of like a very high level I just spent two minutes on this it's really on the right bottom you see the virtualization this is where the OpenStack layer is you have the multiplies the end controller examples over there and then you have on the top you have the application intend does user in the applications and also the user intent in the policies and on the left bottom you have the security function manager this is where the IPS manager in action firewall application delivery controller and so on and then you have the virtualized security function itself so this is where the you know from multiple vendor you know multiple security functions and the security controller what it's doing is it's taking the policy or they intend from the top so you have the UI you saw some of the screenshots of the UI during the demo but of course there's an API which is an odd bone REST API so you're actually going to do things like you're describing how you want a security for your workload so you can deploy you know you saw one tenant attacking the other tenant as an example but you can have multiple multi-tenant multi BNF type of policies and you're just coordinating all these policies you know using your connectivity to basically through the API interfaces I show the interfaces from the number two to the sfc so with the SDN controller if they provide a sfc API will use that otherwise we'll use a lower level API and then of course we're going to use the neutron sfc but then also you have the number three which is the interaction with the virtual infrastructure itself and then four is where we do the policy coordination and five is actually you know what we're interacting with vnf to get some other telemetry and other information so we can do skoro scaling and things like that there's also a control the control plane channel or agent that we may make it optional because if the security function manager can do all this is then we might not have to interact with the virtual secret function so there was just a very high-level kind of overview and you know you can find more about this Roger Kahn in telecom /o SC as in open security controller so I'll let karoon summarize or okay so so in summary right menu you saw a couple of things that we really touched upon we had we had we had an enterprise user who had you know issues in intron is effectively secure east-west traffic we and we saw the components that came into play with with Internet providing the stn layer and with the with the open security controller being able to orchestrate the the security controls in an automated manner so the challenge like you know like like Joe talked about and you know what was really stressing about this is really two things like one was a trim burning of the traffic which which effectively in you know introduces latency into any kind of environment if you're going to have to go all the way to the edge to any kind of security inspections or security enforcement's and then you know the east-west traffic you know being able to have visibility to that kind of traffic and be able to see it in a manner that you can take decisions on we have some future work I mean so the open security controller is a project that's evolving currently we are you know it's it's do you will see additional vns being becoming part of the ecosystem you'll see additional controllers being part of the ecosystem and and you are also looking at figuring out how we how this can work effectively with container orchestration as well so so that that's some of the future work that's coming in we will probably have more you know more updates over the next few months but if you have any questions on on whether on the implementation on the problem statements on what we've done please you know feel free to ask her so you can always connect with us at a later point in time you might have a question so so you try the controller the security controller two neutron or how do you I think somebody talked about this theory in traffic so how does that tie into the field s the end solution or the neutron the native neutral triack logging in or yeah there's multiple ways but let's talk about the made on it implementation in right so the so the open security controller allows for multiple sdn solutions and for multiple I the service functions as well in the case of the SDN solution we have an interface that's called for the bindings so essentially the the the open security controller has a bit of metal net code that will reinterpret the service chaining in order to bind the service training so the neutron part so the open security controller will directly call Neutron to do things like create the management and data network for the service VMs and to launch the service VMs on on on to that network but it will call the SDN controller in order to do the binding now there could be a generic service chaining plugin for the neutron sfc API however there are certain some kinds of things that you can do in the plug-in so for example we have the ability to detect the attacker that's behind the source net it's not something that you can do with the neutron API so there's still some specific things that the that the controller can do and so actually we're doing that right now where there's a there's a function call and call there that can unmask the the attacker behind the source not and so that that that's something needle not specific that's actually a good point because you know what the implementation that we have its owner there's a sick stupid implementation where we won't get that level of granular detail where we are able to see you know suicide the destination IP source vm name the destination attacked and name things like that right so we get into into a more granular analytical information that you can be that can be acted upon with this implementation we have maybe I would just add that I think is likely that you'll see in the future that there will be a neutron sfc API generic controller that you can use in in in the open security controller and and that will work just with generic Neutron when you set up the when you set up the open security controller to talk to your OpenStack you're giving it the OpenStack API endpoints and you're and you choose from a drop-down the controller or plugin that you want to use did you determination detected is right that midlet or the security solution is to do some change in their coding to tie back into maybe misunderstood the controller there's the controller plugin that's java package that runs on the the security controller and and then of course meter that had to develop service chaining api's and there is a an analytics piece which is the basically f to go back to the flow records to find the flow that has the source net so when we're doing the unmasking of the attacker that's behind the source not we have to go to a flow record database yeah but from an integration standpoint we are getting to a point where we have standard api's ideas that can call and integration integration should not require you to fundamentally change any code with within the controller is is that the question yeah yeah that for this for the security solution whether yes for for for use integration to the open security controller that's correct thank you thanks to the question another question do be not ah can i enable a traffic mirror in with middle net you mentioned service chain and only just some strange case we're working on it both in the controller and in meter net we do have we do have port mirroring in marinette we have to enable it in the in the controller plugin it is it is absolutely something that we're working on yes things yes hi so my question is about the fundamental if i look back you're trying to achieve two functions one is the service chaining which is inserting security or service in the telepath the second is lifecycle management of the security right so if you look at the first path there are lot of options which are coming up right for example the ovn would provide some sort of native service chilling abilities if i look at different has diem controllers they have their own capabilities of how you can insert services right so I see a sort of a multi-dimensional world there with one more options being added hair from your side and then as far as the lifecycle management is concerned I would think that many security vendors are going to do it themselves and of course there are different environments like public clouds where he go but it's gonna be different done in a different way so I'm just trying to understand that I mean I i like the idea fundamentally but i'm just trying to see the ultimate success of this idea right inner universe which is there's so many options i mean oh yeah so i can i can so so firstly the service insert / insertion party is very easy answer because as you can see here you know world and pinot described a little bit of that you know like how we're doing a mortal ear plug in right so if tomorrow if the if there's a neutron or you know any any api you know which is all because you're just providing the intent from the top on how you want to those security functions and you know that that we can use so that that part were not really trying to do we're just going to use whatever is available so now to your second question about security or question that's a very interesting question I don't have a slide here but yesterday I did the tech talk more detail on this where i show that you know we want to do this so so we're already working with the security vnf winters so we're working some of the industry leading security on offenders and one of the challenges that they are saying is they have like this barrier of entry right the same thing that you described you know they have to do many too many integration with all these different permutation and combination of the security you know further for the virtual infrastructure you know whether you have to do what with OpenStack with different flavors of SDN sometimes you have to do even with the different flavors of service insertion options right you can do pump in the wire you can do simple service instruction or you can do like the actual you know sfc you know like advanced sfc with with network service header and all that right so we're trying to make it easier for them to integrate with all these different environments and we also going to go work on additional integrations with other clients so we have some integration with vsphere nsx but also going to work more into container as a service and we have not done any work for any of the public offering or like for example as your or Google compute or any of that but you know it might be something if we if we need to we might do it the future but is right now it's not on the paper but the main function for us is to be able to provide an integration point and also a security control point where you can have this you know across multiple data center for multiple vnf sand so kind of building this as sort of something within understand that we eventually we want to take it as a as a as an open source project that you heard was the multiple integration points right i mean so I mean for an SDN vendor if you can provide a single integration point with which they can access multiple V NFS I think we're making life easier for everyone and vice versa right for a Vienna vendor one integration point where in all of a sudden the integrated multiple lesbians multiple sfcs you know that'sthat's basically the problems a problem that we're trying to solve and it's an issue that we've seen in with enterprise and think so that web they want to do this in an automated manner and that's essentially what we're trying to get to maybe I'll add a point we've spoken to other vendors of security appliances and and load balancers and generally they don't want to build a controller it's sighs it's a quite an investment to build this this orchestration and actually then we have discussions well are you going to build the orchestration should I I'm providing the service chaining how do we should do that because each of us and I want to focus on sdn this this orchestrator is not really my specialty and likewise the security provider of the load balancer provider their secure their there are specialty ism to provide this kind of orchestration either so then we see that some of the vendors have developed heat templates to deploy their appliances but it's not as flexible and dynamic as as this kind of orchestration thank you welcome thank you we have any more questions you do can you go into little detail on how you monitor the health of mcafee IPS since it's in transparent mode yeah sure actually it's very basic right now so at the moment we are just monitoring the interface being up so that's at the level of the of the hypervisor so what we have in the works is to actually do things like ARP or other kinds of health check but right now it's very basic was just the interface being up and seeing traffic through it's very difficult no what about the low bow and if there's multiple IPS that's something it's not a current capability it's not a current capability but that's part of our service chaining sort of our service chaining roadmap to be able to to choose so we have layer for load balancing and you don't and it's stateful this is this is not layer for and that you're not actually modifying the packets so it'd be sort of a more more like a nice EMP load balancing but it has to be stateful so that you keep going through the same so we've clearly thought a lot about it but we haven't started working on it and this is a project in its infancy to be honest rally minutes it's really something we started effectively moving into testing and and integration about 3-4 months back probably so I mean it's be still in our early stages with this thanks thank you okay no more questions thank you so much for your time and attention appreciate it you guys have a good day thanks everyone
