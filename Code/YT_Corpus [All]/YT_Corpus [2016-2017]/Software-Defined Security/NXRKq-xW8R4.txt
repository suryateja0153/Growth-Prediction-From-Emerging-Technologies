 hi my name is mark berry and today I'm going to talk to you about software-defined Network security for my emergency technologies class int 7213 section 53 87 and today's date is May 26 2016 you so really quickly the company that I chose is called illumi o solo mio is a software-defined Network security company that delivers adaptive security that works across legacy data centers and cloud computer environments for example like Google Amazon anything that provides a cloud on they provide live visibility adaptive traffic segmentation and instant corruption through activating and centrally managing native security controls in the host they do this for the world's largest most demanding computing environments with no dependency on the network or the hypervisor some of the customers include Morgan Stanley Salesforce and play tronics so let's talk about understanding software divine security at alumium its purpose is a lumia wanted their customers to be able to write their security policies and a natural language without requiring any understanding of the underlying network so basically you can take a jack of all trades and throw them in a spot and have him understand it even without any experience in it they wanted a Lumia wanted security to follow the model of how users construct applications and how infrastructure should support computing including the use of public cloud like Amazon or etc who've i've mentioned before in a new virtualization or abstraction technologies a Lumia built the Lumia adaptive security platform which is also known as a SP to provide this unprecedented visualization and control the enterprise applications so the impact on the adapters really quickly asp constantly in specs and adapts to the computing environment is protect solo mio has a so much to talk about with rachel with episode that i wanted to focus on the most i play when you return every secure the right size for the mind of all what I so we have to be functioning of any ideas or fibers on fire- such fun we have stability what do get us crazy tell you're pretty awesome she like the Quattro snail I remember to it is I have a lot of high security policy center for technology and green is like having that you a member of your sister with a conviction delivering so I've won a major with red interior of something else enter hang out find 24 7 365 you'll see that we're limited data structures is a number of the layer worries often I besides the rich failures their companies the actual data or possible yearly don't appeal with regards to see the episode Elsa problem be Salesforce weird i believe so in addition were to find a variety of different it's all fairly the fire on systems data structures have such waves which are ya can you have known Daniel we see that we have three different services of the ASP by that you'll see that you have the illumination application which is like having a live MRI machine for your data center and cloud it builds a live interactive map of all application traffic and workloads and alerts you to any security policy violations across your data centers or clouds you also have a body type bodyguard type of enforcement labeled enforcement the enforcement service enables a range of adaptive segmentation and stateful firewall services written in natural language and deliver it at the most granular level the process work load application or user so lumiose painted and policy is the first to support a range of segmentation capability based on role like web servers application like HRM environment development location and users so I see you also help to talk about personal obstacles deserve a chat invite an under nano so how is he every new system GM element they were gear but I always needs to train here and a quarter of seven Moses you kitchen staff when we're talking extensively use one pick up and I met in heaven how you see I do looks like the tunnels but you might even have we're cool stuff we're actually it will have a today evaluations for the elected to some down time for the end users and other departments that rely on the IT team so you'll see that employee productivity may also be impacted which may lead to frustration from the current employees and eggs with organization itself however with new systems and new implementations it's a company-wide obstacle that just needs to be broken through and once it's broken through you'll have everything walking and talking the way as it should be as well as a back-up plan meaning that you can always go from one system so there are some opportunities that I identified and with adoption for the adaptive security so some of today's security challenges are scale and complexity of the network security where you'll see security professionals on burden with sheer number of firewalls rules zones VLANs and subnets you also see cloud computing architectures automation and hybrid environments break traditional perimeter and legacy solutions you also see the opportunity to expanding attack surface which is one of our competitive advantages of a Lumia having it night break the surface 99 percent so today's network segmentation model leaves ninety percent of the computing expose what ASP does is lumio ASP attaches adapted segmentation and enforcement to your workloads allowing you to secure individual applications and processes without changing subnets firewall rules zones VLANs or any of your infrastructure you
