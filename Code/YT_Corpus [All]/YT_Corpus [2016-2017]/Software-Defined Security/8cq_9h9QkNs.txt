 and hello from the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania we welcome you to the software engineering Institute's webinar series our presentation today is structuring the chief information security officer organization depending on your location we wish you a good morning a good afternoon or good evening my name is Shane McGraw I'll be your moderator for the presentation and I'd like to thank you for attending we want to make today as interactive as possible so we will address questions throughout the presentation and again at the end of the presentation you can submit questions to our event staff at any time by using the questions tab on your control panel we will ask a few polling questions throughout the presentation as well they will appear as a pop-up window on your screen in fact the first polling question we like to ask is how did you hear about today's event another three tabs I'd like to point out are the files Twitter and surveys tab the files tab has a pre presentation slides there now as a PDF copy along with other CISO related work and resources from the sei for those of you using Twitter be sure to follow at sei News and you'll want to use the hashtag sei webinar once again you want to follow at sei news and the hashtag is sei webinar and lastly the survey we ask that you fill out upon exiting the event as your feedback is always greatly appreciated and now I'd like to introduce our presenters from tenet for today Julie Allen will be joining us from California and Julia is a principal researcher within the software engineering Institute cert division she has been with the sei since 1992 she served as deputy director and chief operating officer for three years as well as acting director for an interim period of six months she has been with the cert division since 1997 she's the author of the cert guide to system and network security practices and moderator of the cert podcast series security for business leaders dr. mater knotter maja very is a principal member of the technical staff with an assert division of the sei his current areas of interest and research include operational resilience cybersecurity and resilience management protection and sustainment of critical infrastructure preparedness planning and associated risk management principles and practices dr. maja very has over 33 years of experience in leading and performing technical business research and teaching activities in aerospace defense telecommunications transportation in consulting industries for domestic and international entities as well as academic environments and now I'd like to turn the presentation over Julia Alan Julia once again joining us from California Julie all yours go ahead oh saying great can now hopefully you can hear me okay thank you so much for that warm welcome and thank you everyone for joining us today we're very excited about this body of work something that we've been working on for some time and we're hoping that you'll find it useful as well so the topics for today are listed here I'm going to walk you through not and I together are going to walk you through the process that we actually used for determining this candidate structure that we're going to discuss with you its foundation is four key functions that a CI fo performed also talked about the sources that we use to flush those out into the next level of some functions and activities will present a candidate organizational structure and of course we would be remiss if we didn't give you some ideas for how to take this work and apply it to your own organization I'm hoping that most of you are familiar with the software engineering Institute and hopefully with cert by virtue of your being with us today we are a federally funded research and development center have been in business for some time with our mission to improve the state of the practice and the state of the art in software engineering for cert cybersecurity is the name of the game all aspects full lifecycle all the way from policy and governance through to detailed technical practices controls and forensics investigations the team that nada and I are on is called the cyber risk and resilience management team as indicated by Shane's kind introductions we do work in applied research all the way through to application with our federal state and commercial partners both us and international specifically in the area is embodied in our cert resilience management model resilience management operational risk management and I think one of the unique perspectives we have as the amply demonstrated by not our background is the integration of cyber security and those other disciplines that can disrupt an organization's mission so I'm going to start with a process diagram and then a text slide to give you an idea of this structure and how we went through developing it we've worked for many years cert since uh 1988 we've been in business engaging with chief information security officers and security professionals around the globe you may be aware that were very heavily engaged in high-impact cybersecurity incident analysis and forensics investigation particularly on behalf of some of our government customers so we have a very pragmatic tactical experience dealing with ongoing and aftermath of big incidents and I think we all recognize the expanding risk environment not or we'll talk about this at some length about it's really shifted what if she is Oh needs to concern themselves with it's no longer sufficient to think about the traditional protection aspects of information security but you really need to extend your thinking to not if it'll happen but when it'll happen and how you respond recover and return to normal operations so all of these factors and the years of experience that cert has been influenced our imports and observations to identify 40c ISO functions that neither will be breaking down for you and that serves as a foundation for this organizational structure we'll be discussing so at this point not over to you thanks Julia for getting us started as Julia mentioned the first thing we're going to discuss today is these four key functions that we believe are foundational for today's chief information security organizations as as I'm sure you're all aware traditionally information security teams have been tasked to protect and shield organizational information assets from cyber risk and cyberattacks we also know that such strategies are are no longer sufficient we read about cyber intrusions on a daily basis we hear about them and I'm going to be surprised if there are some of you in the audience who have actually experienced it in your organization there are small ones there are large ones there are ones that we know about the ones that maybe are not apparent to our organizations the message heart here is that all of those traditional schemes and strategies and tools and technology to protect ones organization from cyber attacks are absolutely necessary there are no longer sufficient because they often fail from time to time and then they fail sometimes we don't know about it sometimes it takes weeks or months for us to identify them sometimes we are told by somebody outside of our organization that such things are happening in our enterprise and there are good industry data about such statistics and therefore a second very critical function for organizational to consider as part of the information security team is to build and enhance their capability to monitor and detect these type of abnormal activities in their organizations we want them to become hunters hunters for adversaries who might have penetrated a system or environment and look for them very explicitly so that's a secondary necessary function to be put in place we don't think that's sufficient either because adversaries are very clever they're very good about hiding themselves and and sometimes it takes some time to identify them while they're doing their mishaps now we frequently hear about consequences of cyber attacks they are often disclosure of privately identifiable information they reveal some corporate messages maybe they cause some loss of credit card information they all primarily interception of information or fabrication or modification these are things that we hear about all the time recently however adversaries are becoming interested in other things they are becoming interested in interrupting or destroying data shutting down day-to-day operations making physical damage to the infrastructure and deleting or destroying data once we realize that and examples of those incidents we here and read about from time to time the recent Sony picture cyber incidents is a good example of it in addition to all the consequences of that cyber incident the business operations at Sony was affected because the cyber intrusion caused damage to the IT infrastructure and therefore a very critical third function for the information security teams to be fully involved it is to respond recover and sustain operations once bad things happens incidents response type activities being involved business continuity being involved with disaster recovery having coordinated efforts to respond and recover from cyber intrusion defects those three are look critical there won't be as effective if they're not supported by a comprehensive set of integrated management governance maybe a bit of compliance education and risk management activities we can throw all the tools and technology at the problem if we don't worry about the items listed on the bottom of this structure if you don't worry about people and processes the other functions will not work as well so this is the four key functions that we now are believe are there are the key components of any information security team under a chief information security officer so at this time I'm going to bring up on the polling questions okay so as we mentioned the beginning will launch a few polling questions throughout the presentation to help us direct the flow of the talk to make sure you're getting all you need out of this presentation and that question is on your screen now asking do these four functions cover your current or planned CISO responsibilities so we'll give you about 15 seconds to vote for that and well while we're doing that nada will answer a question from the queue from Joseph asking I think this is from the it seems like the top three functions have more of a technical technology and engineering nature and the bottom one is more like a set of critical non-technical activities is a replace I can go to learn more to do the activities in the bottom box well let me know if you need a repeat they're looking for the word to do the activities in the bottom box well I think that's a actually that's a relatively accurate characterization of those four boxes Julia when she started our discussion she referred to a particular body of knowledge cert resilience management model that our team has been fortunate in having the opportunity to develop maintain and an help organization to put into place that body of work is in fact a very good place for organizations and individuals to go to if they want to learn about a comprehensive integrated way to deal with those people and process issues that concentrated in that fourth box okay I mean our solution another quick will squeeze in from Duncan asking do those three functions have to sit in a SISO organization or could they distributed throughout excellent question actually the audience will hear a little bit more about this as we talk about additional details of the system structure the idea is that no not all of those functions or capabilities or activities needs to report directly to a chief information security officer there are organizational structure presence in our environment in our organizations that's hard to change and therefore our study has taken that into consideration allowing for certain functions to be caught ankles subcontracted to other entities within the organization or even being outsourced to external entities okay let me just cover the polling result real quick so the question was do these four functions cover your current or planned sister responsibilities and our results were 61% yes 37% partially 2% no so if you're in that partial or no category feel free to chime in to the question box with some other responsibilities you have them will pick the otters and Julia's brain on one of those topics as well so feel free to type those in so not about you so I'm going to pass it on to to Julia to continue our conversation thank you neither and Shayne much appreciated so as promised we're gonna keep building out this process for determining the organizational structure he's going to talk about what said our conclusions to create the four key staff functions but not our described and now what I'm going to talk with you about is what we did next and really swatch these out and put some meat on the bone considering the series of sources which I'll describe in the next slide and then breaking these down doing affinity grouping and mapping them into the next level of detail that would result of entually result cio so organizational structure so I'm going to tell you a little bit about that here are the sources we considered hopefully many of these are near and dear to your some of your day-to-day efforts we've looked at a range of typical information security policies for large diverse organizations both geographically in Mission and production diverse in the US there's a whole series of publications from the national institute of standards and technology specifically 800-53 which is the catalog of security and privacy controls some of you may be familiar with myths work the cybersecurity framework that they have developed and I've been promoting for use the next one bullet number 40 may not be that interested in this deals with the workforce the education the training the knowledge skills and abilities of the workforce how you put them into a framework because as we know this is all done by people we took into account the current version of the sands top 20 we've talked about the certain resiliency management model and several organizations including the US Department of Energy have derived capability maturity model process models from search rmm and most notably the Department of Energy their model is basis for this effort and in many industry-wide research reports on current practice noticeable yfl mission perhaps is the whole ISO 27000 series and while we did not specifically map to it we did confirm that all of its requirements were covered by the combination of these sources so these were all taken into account and then what we did is we took all these we affinity group them we broke them down into their next level of functions some function and Department and others going to take you through some of those gory details over to you nada so just to give your idea of the level of details that that we went through and some of this little details is actually available to you if you download the our technical report we started by those four functions that I talked about the those affinity grouping that julia talked about we categorized all of those key functions from all of those sources into four groups and we started taking layers of onion off we asked a question okay what should be done in certain departments what should be done in certain sub functions within each department and as I mentioned a few minutes ago in response to the question we had we actually did consider each of these tasks of functions or departments could potentially be done another entity within their organization outside of this organization there's that information is available and then we double check our work by making sure all of those good well practice items that we had mined from those sources that Julia talked about are mapped and nothing have been missed so this is the level of detail that's available that eventually led us to draw a hypothetical orc structure that that one may see in their enterprise as the structure of their chief information security officer so we do have a sample of such a structure and I'm gonna let Julia to walk you through it okay at this point Shane did we want to see if we had any questions for my listeners let me pull it up here one sec okay yeah one from Amanda asking are there other sources that one should consider when tailoring the methodology discussed in this webinar so you guys I guess you listed some resources on an earlier slide do you have other sources that can be tailored at this point or that we can discuss at this point so when people - so some of those sources that Julia talked to are our topic sources that could apply to almost any organization operating in any industry in any part of the world clearly when organizations want to apply some of these work that we have done to their own specific environment there are other sources to consider clearly some organization depending on the industry they're in have to worry about rules and regulations that's put upon them based on the industry if they operate in 50 different countries they may have to vote about edition rules and regulations that they have to worry about so that list of sources that we have provided when they try to adapt it to their and why might they need to consider okay what other sources that I need to consider based on who I am who I work for what industry I'm in which bar the world I operate etc okay before we turn back every jeweler just remind it reminder to everyone or anybody joining us late there is a download files tab on your console that you can walk away with a PDF slot PDF copy of the slides from today's presentation along with the technical report on the this is Oh organization along with other work from sei insert in this space so Julia will take it back to you okay Shane thank you and another thank you very much so I was remiss in not mentioning the technical report at the top of my remarks but a lot of all the details of everything we're discussing today the mappings that not a referred to and a detailed description of this candidate organizational structure that I'm about to walk through for you are all described in the technical report and for those of you that have downloaded the PDF of that report I encourage you I'm going to put up the candidate organizational structure if you want to keep this in front of you while I'm describing each of these units that might help serve as a navigational aid but given the analysis that not are described that we did from the top from the foundational flows function to some functions activities departments affinity grouping looking at what could be in sourced and out sourced etc this is the the structure that we developed and we'll talk about this a little bit at the end but perhaps the way to listen to this is to think about how these various activities are done in your organization's today and use this as a if you will kind of a framework and saying okay do we do that don't we do that is that something that's working particularly well is that something that I need to shore up or maybe I'm missing a function or a department altogether so use this as if you will or something that you can compare your current organizational activities to and with I'm going to take you through each of these briefly I'm going to go from from right to left starting with program management okay so this is a pretty typical function in just about any organization be it security or or other related activity you've got planning you've got programming of the plan roles and responsibilities making sure you've got adequate resources dealing with funding doing all the tracking that happens when you're making a significant investment in an organization in this case for information security I'd like to particularly point out to you the last bullet identify review and assessment enabled business functions because corrilesa cybersecurity and the CIO soul is the supporting function that is here to make sure that the business continues to operate as intended and so a key part of the system's role in the program management office and then the manager that's responsible for that is to excuse me to make sure that all business functions are enabled as needed by the security activity again following along on the earth chart the next department governance risk and compliance sometimes referred to as GRC not to be confused with GRC tools we've you recommend the use of tools but you need to know what you're doing first before you embark on any kind of a tool acquisition and implementation but this is where the program plan is done at the policy level setting the strategic guidance for the organization and making sure that guidance is followed making sure you've got a reasonable risk management framework and process in place for identifying tracking and mitigating risk and then all of the oversight I'll talk specifically about significant oversight function the information security Executive Council in a bit but just making sure that change Control board's other oversight boards are done on a compliance perspective making sure controls are adequate and interfacing with the audit function of the organization the last but not least personnel and external relationships managing your vendor supplier and contractor interfaces your business partner interfaces keeping in touch with major external stakeholders regulatory bodies and others who you depend on for example on a major instance occurs in the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and making sure your press relationships are well established and then dealing with all the people aspects that come with an effective cyber security program knowledge skills and abilities training and awareness acceptable use so all of those things live within the program management department and its units in this candidate organizational structure so I'm going to move next to more of the operational aspect of the organization so the Security Operations Center I suspect many of you have these they're responsible for all of the day-to-day security operations activities and this is a case where much of this is performed by the IT organization with oversight from the CIA so as you some of you know I'm sure the relationship between the CIS o and C IT Director can be contentious at times trying because they're trying to achieve different objectives but they must really work effectively together to establish situational awareness intelligence collection this is where the the monitored detect and hunt function is done in large part going back to you not as for functions managing all the malicious code that crosses your desk and this is also the first line of defense for cyber security incidents sometimes called a computer instant response team or computer security incident response team and these folks interact with another major department very actively the Emergency Operations and interested management department and these are the folks that mobilize when something big happens so they exist as an entity I'll talk them in a moment about the things they do when during normal operations but when something big happens you emergency operations as the management team or department interacts very heavily with the security operation center to make sure that all the feet are in the ground people in the roles they need to be in think they're happening communication channels are established not taking place across the assets and posts and systems that are compromised and but in in on the times when they can take a breath and they're busy fighting fires they do planning in incident management business continuity and disaster recovery they run tests exercises and drills to make sure that the organization is prepared when something happens and I would say probably one of the biggest gap areas that we see in many of the organizations that we work with is in the area of problem management with cause analysis and after-action report typically when the dust settles after something big the organization often doesn't have the collective will to dig in and find out how did we get ourself in this match and that's really housed in this particular sub function where you really dig down try that what processes worked and didn't work develop after-action reports communicate to all the key players and of course investigation is a key part of this capability let me just pause here for a moment Shane any any questions at this point before I describe the last major department we do have a couple questions here one from Duncan asking where would security architecture sit would sit with other architecture practices or in the CISO organization a perfect question it's my next slide if I may hold that question until I advanced one anything else yeah we have another one from Carl asking managing third parties for example cloud providers and supply or connectivity to ensure to ensure risks to business data as managed appropriately is a significant challenge can you provide more insight into how to address this organizationally right so bear with me while I go back a bit two slides ago personnel and external relationships we have a home for that function and it's called external relationship management in the SIRT resilience management model we call it external dependencies managing external dependencies so this is where that function is performed in terms of the actual doing I would refer you to that portion of the search publicly management model that will give you detailed goals and practices for managing those relationships with critical third party great we have a couple will let you move on Julie unless you want to get back to the one with the architecture practices and then we can move on ok so let's talk about architecture so if you've got your org chart in front of you on the far left you'll see this department called security engineering and assets security and I'm going to talk about the six six role but that department fulfills including security architectures so typically we don't always see these functions combined so this is again security engineering and asset security so what this encompasses is the full lifecycle of your critical assets everything from the time you develop security quirements to acquire or build something all the way through to terms of putting a key system a host and network and information asked at a database can you excuse me in to its actual operational environment and I really wanted to point out and this is one of the areas I think that's rather unique about this structure if any of you are following the DevOps movement which is about creating a more integrated and more seamless relationship between development and IT operations we encompass that into this function in our in our proposed organization structure because if you don't have IT folks working during development if you don't have development folks having to follow their product into operation I think we're all very familiar with the kind of problems of that causes so with respect to the question you asked earlier Shane we put security architecture here specifying your security requirements whether you're building acquiring mashing up whatever it is if they're doing the security architecture making sure that all aspects of those requirements are reflected into the talk level and detail design and a component architecture in the interfaces of of that particular system or operational environment making sure that those requirements and that architecture are propagated throughout the entire development and acquisition lifecycle and certainly last but not least making sure that all the boxes have been checked and all the work has been done before you release the system into production so this is where we address architecture and yes we do consider that to be a CISM function but going back to something not I said earlier it could be outsourced to another to a development shop within the organization but the CIS oh that's very definite in our proposed structures very definite oversight responsibilities so this is one of the six units within the security engineering massive security department and I'll talk about the other type now so identity and access management this is pretty familiar as I'm sure most of you that are involved in this aspect managing the identities the access controls that implement those identities and all the various technologies that allow you to assert and confirm that your people your systems anything that's requesting access other objects are legitimate and authorized so that's where this book the third of six applications security just deals with the applications assets software anything you acquire inventories access controls managing those configurations patching keeping everything up-to-date making sure that your critical applications are protected as best they can be in managing changes to those you'll see a little bit of replication or duplication of these functions applied to a different type of that that's in your network make sure that you've got the critical ones inventoried you know who's connected on your controlling access and again configuration management and change management in terms of your standard configurations and any changes and network controls everything to do with your perimeter both your intranet your internet to everything that has to do this is where you actually implement a lot of the security architecture that was such as requirements early life cycle information asset security you might also think of this as data management where you categorize the sensitivity of your information and vital assets to make sure your critical assets are inventory that you've got an owner assigned I should have said that earlier for any asset that's inventoried clearance designation of ownership and custodianship who owns it and who's responsible for taking care of it and your information asset controls in accordance with requirements we do have a placeholder for physical access control typically all all of the physical security facilities security is physically managed outside of the CIO so the organization's sometimes by a chief security officer or facilities manager but there's a very critical interface between those two roles here in terms of electronic access to facilities badge readers other types of biometrics other types of ways of controlling execute facilities and hosts and networks and making sure those access controls are enforced if this is a relatively small operation for a CIS oh this could be combined with the Identity and Access Management function if you wanted to get those down to a little bit smaller subset and before I move on I wanted to repeat here the reason that we put these together the early lifecycle activities requirements architectures with the operational activities is to encourage through the organization structure a much tighter coupling between development and operations and then one of my closing charts in this section is to bump up to the dotted line box that reports in or connects to the chief information security officer which is the information security executive uncle these folks are the advisors to the CIO so they bring in as you can see by sample membership the other key leadership roles in the organizations that need to care about in politics requirements for cyber security this council is one of the ways to enact governance as managed by the chief information security officer and as you can see it includes legal concerns financial concerns obviously HR because this is a big people issue but you also want to have the business unit leadership VPS the engineering VP and certainly whoever is responsible for managing information technology at this point Shane I think we might have another polling question and you can also take take some questions and we do have a question in that the third and final polling question for today is asking does this candidate organizational structure cover your current or planned system responsibilities so if it's something you're facing does not has not been covered or feel free to type that into the Q&A box and we cannot add that to the list of topics but let's get some questions while people are voting so lots of questions in the queue so we're gonna go one from Murray here asking would you say that the four blocks is described correspond to the four CISO functions would you say that the four blocks is described correspond to the four CISO functions I I have to say yes because the four functions that I described at the very beginning are the underlying structure of the org chart the candidate org chart that Julia just walked us through okay Julie anything add yeah I would say that it's not it may not be kind of an automatic one for one shame but clearly program management is the foundational management and governance function that not are described emergency operations those with respond and recover the Security Operations Center certainly goes with some monitor hunts detect and there are clearly a number of aspects of the protection side of the equation that are in the security engineering and asset security suite of units and activities so I I think I would agree with nodded that they do a line but I think it would be too simplistic to say that there once the one because you'll see and you've got as you dive into the detail you will find activities in each of these departments that could span two three or four of the functions okay we'll get in one more question here from Leslie asking are you recommending that the CISO function exists as an independent organization rather than being part of another department such as the IT organization what position should the CISO report into so we get that question very often mother most often questions that that we we get is where should an organization place their information security organization or function or who should the chief information security officer report our examination of many organizations and having looked at incidents and how organizations respond to we have to say there is no silver bullet there is no right answer that matches every organization's needs and respond and and businesses so clearly many organizations have chief information security officers reporting to the their IT organization form any organization that works we have seen chief information security officers reporting to the organization's chief risk officer because information security is a major operational risk management activity so our recommendation for organizations to decide where to house their information security function is let's look at your overall enterprise business objectives how things are done today where the functions that Julia just talked about are performed today and then ask the question does it make sense to move people around or move these partners around or put the CISO under a different structure great ok before we turn it back in order we'll give you the survey results real quick so the question was does this candidate organizational structure cover your current or planned system responsibilities we had 54% with yes 38% with partially and 8% with no so again if you're in that partial or no area feel free to type in some information into the Q&A box not or we'll turn it back to you and let me add one more one more piece of information to answer to the previous question regardless of where you end up putting the information security organization or regardless of who chief information security ports do maybe a more important things to make sure is that information secure activities have a very high executive sponsorship and that executive sponsorship makes the information security function to be elevated at the enterprise level so it gets the focus that it needs regardless of the verdict activities or actually perform that's probably even more important that learn to put the functions right all right let us finish our conversation today by just recommending a few potential next steps that that that you who have been sitting through our conversation today could could could take one thing you could do is you could look at your existing chief information security officer officer organization how its structured and see if it maps to the candidate structure that we have talked about ask the question hey does it map bail if it doesn't map bill are the things that are missing or are the things that should be enhanced so those are some of the maybe next steps that if you want to take right away before before too long that that that probably makes sense and then if you identify areas that needs to be changed or a hanser moved use some of those sources that that Giulia talked about that will provide you guidance as to how to implement some of these activities and don't forget to take baby steps you don't want to take too big of a bite of an apple to begin with we have provided you some additional resources as as I mentioned a copy of the technical note that has the details of our study is available the copy of the slides are available in the next slide we have listed several references that might be of some interest probably in late December early January we'll post a podcast based on on this subject so if you want to hear more about the subject you can you can take advantage of that podcast and then as you go down the road and you want to get additional wider training about chieftain patient security officer activities you can consider such programs as Carnegie Mellon University's chief of mission security officer executive training program that is that is available so that's a list of references that I was referring to that's in the back of the slides and Shayne I think we're gonna stop here and see if there any more questions or any other conversations you want to have great we got lots of great questions in the queue and just a reminder everybody before exiting today's webinar the police fill out that survey as your feedback is greatly appreciated all right let's get to another question from Marie asking can you talk a talk a bit about having security architecture with an assist an of control and the need of security architecture to also relate to a chief architect in an enterprise architecture function please let me know if you need a repeat I'm gonna actually that Julia answered that question since she just finished talking about some of that concept a few minutes ago that is actually a great great question which I appreciate so that is that's really a lot of us gonna depend on the people involved the kind of leadership model that's in the organization if it's strictly hierarchical or if there's more peer-to-peer more collaboration between units but I would recommend that if security architecture is a significant activity within the organization that the chief architect together with the chief security architect both sit on the Information Security Executive Council that there would be very active collaboration because clearly the the architects for the entire enterprises and it has many concerns beyond just security but security needs to be first and foremost in their thinking and through some mechanism like the information security Executive Council or some some unit of that Council I think that you'll be able to get the kind of collaboration collaboration and integration of those two perspectives but I would still keep security architecture if not a direct report activity to the CIS oh certainly an area where the CIS au has some legitimate recognized oversight responsibilities this goes back to my comments earlier about working hard to integrate earlier lifecycle activities in a system or software development project with the operational responsibility for keeping that system or products Cure once it goes into its operational setting okay great we'll move on to the next question from the Tanisha asking how will you structure the CISO with an already established configuration management and change management how would you structure the CISO with an already established configuration management and change management I guess structure is that yeah so as Julia was walking you through the candidate structure there was one department there configuration management and change management was listed explicitly to be part of that function so most organization already have change and configuration management activities if you are happy with the performance of those existing change management and configuration management and whatever happy means to your enterprise then you could leave them at they are as you consider how to change the rest of your organization if you think you're not happy with how change management and configuration management are done today it is you're not happy with how they perform or support the rest of the activities then you want to go through that exercise that I mentioned okay compare what you have today with the sample structure that we have provided you to see if you go to the sample structure where does configuration change management fall into and then ask the question if I move them there would I solve my problem neither can i interject as well of course so going back to our proposed organizational structure you may recall that we took what we call an asset centric view in establishing these units so you have a units for application security one for host and network security and one for information asset security and if you look back on those slides or in the technical report you'll see that each of them has a change in configuration management aspect to it and to go back to the original question when you said that there's an existing approach does it cover all of those assets does it cover configuration and change management for your software and other applications for your host and networks and the one that tends to typically be missing is information asset security in other words you have really conscientious changing configuration management around your big information assets your big repositories your inventories your various databases and are those really handled all by the same team likely not but regardless of how they're done is not I said if they're done well adding the CIO so oversight or interaction to those existing functions may suffice or you may need to to do some summary architecting and summary engineering ok next we got one from Borja asking who would be in charge of the security life's like lifecycle of applications that are created in the cloud who would need to participate in this lifecycle in the security organization can you explain the roles participating in this lifecycle in their tasks Julien you want to take that one yeah that's that's a really great question okay in the instruction that we've proposed there it would be a combination of the security engineering function so it still is under that though someone who's responsible for carrying the security requirements all the way through architecture design prior to release into production but when you're dealing with a cloud service provider that is an external relationship and you may recall that the management of external relationships at least we have it you know in our candidate starts are allocated to the program management function but again still under the CIS oh so you would need to take whoever's responsible for the relationship with that cloud service provider and marry them up in some some type of team with your security engineering staff and make sure that there are mechanisms in place either through a service level agreement I mean sometimes these big cloud service providers you know you basically get what they give you you don't have a lot of ammunition unless you're a big customer of theirs but through service level agreements or whatever their terms are conditions whatever recourse you have for monitoring whatever happens when a big incident takes place on the CIF those side the responsibilities would be those responsible for managing that cloud service provider relationship together with those in security engineering who ensure that the requirements of the security requirements that you as a customer of that service provider have are actually being fulfilled through whatever mechanisms you have with them to to monitor to oversee and ultimately to pay them for providing the service that you've contracted for so you'd have to actually take advantage of several of the capabilities within the CIO so structure hopefully I answered your question at least partially it sounded good to me all right next we got are there any planned updates to the cert resilient management model the book is excellent but it was published in 2010 and I imagine that Julia Allen and others have new insights and developments to share and that was not submitted by Julia Allen herself by Mark so Julia if you want to chime in there well actually you just i think it's funny this sounds even though I'm listed it's one of the authors and understand more intimately involved with the team that is actually looking at version 1.2 and version 2.0 so if you'd like to summarize that not so since the model was formally published in 2011 in the book format in addition for our team helping organizations to put into process we have actually developed what we call derivatives of the model we have developed derivatives for certain communities we have developed derivatives for certain domains of interest every time you develop out of those derivatives we have actually updated certain aspects of the model for example julia referred to the work that was sponsored by the Department of Energy that resulted in the creation of what is referred to as the cybersecurity capability maturity model when we develop that derivative of our mm we introduce new domains and process areas that is not explicitly present in the book so the body of knowledge has continuously being evolved and some of those evolvement are documented into these derivatives that we have developed we have developed a expanded version of the model for a US Postal Service where we have actually made a model bigger so the model has been changing and there are documentation is available to show how the model has been drive to for other purposes or had made bigger for certain other environments although we can't point you to version 1.2 of the book because these days maybe a typical textbook might not be the best way to to keep up with all the changes that are taking place terrific Marie go ahead Julia yep yes sir I should say though we do have plans in the very near future to start releasing updated process areas that we're calling version 1.2 so there is an incremental update to the 26 process areas and Sirdar mm and we do have plans in 2016 to begin looking at significant maybe even architectural changes to the model that would eventually be reflected in version 2.0 but I'm not prepared to commit any dates on that what we're looking so we're both looking at both an incremental upgrade and their major version upgrade terrific thank you okay Marie would like to know can you talk a bit about the relationship between the CISO regarding information management function and larger business intelligence initiative in organisations where information management represents but one component of the overall business intelligent undertaking so we have worked with as Julie mentioned at beginning we spend quite a bit of time helping other organization to put into practice some of the things that that we work on including some of the things that we talked about today we have worked with organisations that data and information is part of the day-to-day operations day-to-day business function for those organizations chief information security officer and chief information security organisations becomes an enabler for those part of the organisation's whose job is to collect manipulate deliver that information to the rest of organisations to enable day-to-day business operations so making this CISO a key partner with those part of organisations becomes critical okay Trevor yeah about a minute left so we'll just get to dive into one another we're real quick from Carl asking can you give can you ballpark the relative size of the four organization structures compared to each other Julie I do want to take the last question sure we really haven't done any kind of detailed analysis on size by the four major departments but we do have in the technical report some really I think excellent rules of thumb for sizing the overall chief information security officer organisation and from those you may be able to derive some kind of units of measure for each of the four major departments but I would point you to the technical report for some additional guidance on sizing and resourcing this organizational structure okay I know we're 2/3 we're trying to squeeze in one more question here real quick from Patrick asking we are at the advent of cloud computing and much of it is already in use commercially today as opposed to traditional secure servers what new or special security developments are needed before the general public can be assured that cloud computing is safe from cyber hackers so I'm gonna go back to something that Julia mentioned a few minutes ago in response to the previous question that we had about cloud services in the same way that organizations are dependent on external services for many things you know anywhere from power and Internet service providers cloud services could be looked upon as yet another very critical external services that is required for day-to-day business activities to to operate in the same way that information security teams worry about how to deal with issues related to their Internet service provider they can also start worrying about that the same level of hard I should worry about their cloud service provider that includes not only availability but issues of ok how does the cloud service provider satisfies my requirement for confidentiality integrity availability what confidence can they give me that they are meeting those requirements for my stakeholders right and what actions will they take in the event of a major data breach how do I be protected how will I be notified how will I be involved terrific nod or Julia thank you very much for your excellent presentation folks that's all the time we have for today thanks again for your participation and we look posting you at the next webinar have a great day you
