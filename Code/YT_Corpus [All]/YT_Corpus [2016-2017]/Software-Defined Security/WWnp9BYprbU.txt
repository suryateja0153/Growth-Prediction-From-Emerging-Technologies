 hello and welcome to today's session as always I'm your host Kevin grote staff systems engineer here at VMware we're back again with another quarter of fantastic enablement we've got lots of stuff to talk about everything around and user compute as well as content on V san and so much more so today we're going to be double clicking in to workspace one now live you may have heard a little bit about workspace one but today we're going to be looking at an introduction from a technical perspective what it means to have things like app volumes horizon as well as workspace and then attaching MDM components from AirWatch inside of that space so that we're able to provide to our customers a clear and holistic offering that covers them inside of their end-user compute so as we look at workspace one keep in mind some clear ideas that it's not just about end-user compute it's also about all the things that end-user computers like virtual sand NSX for software-defined networking and security as well as operationalizing and monitoring with things like V realize operations so without any further ado let's go ahead and start talking more about what you can expect from workspace one so when we start to look at workspace one it's important to remember that workspace one is really a composition of several different components including app volumes horizon and certain components of AirWatch that lend to increase flexibility with mobile device content email and application management you know workspace one exists to address specific sets of needs when I was an IT admin I remember the very first time an Executive came in with brand-new very first iPhone right and he brought the thing in and we're sitting there looking at it going wow okay this is really cool but after about 30 minutes of owing and eyeing over you know this new touchscreen technology we started to think geez he's going to want email on this how are we going to deal with that and that's really where it all started and it's only grown and exploded from there to the point where now users are just driving IT into consumerization they don't want to use the device that IT gives them they want to use the device that they like in you know rose gold or shiny black or whatever the heck it is that's what they want and that's what they want to use and that's what they're going to insist upon and it's going to be across all different sorts of platforms it's not just Apple devices it's Windows devices it's you know Android devices it's you know Mac devices all of these things all being attached into the same space and so today we have to look not only at the device but also what they're doing with it they're going out and if they don't have the application that they need provided by their own IT teams they're going to go out and find the one that they need they're going to go out and find a SAS based application or some application they can download that they can leverage inside of their device and so we've got that to deal with as well this leads VMware to a space where we realize very clearly that through workspace one our vision is to provide a digital workspace that is consumers simple yet still enterprise secure something that allows consumers to feel like they still have charge over their environments and their devices yet at the same time the enterprise and IT still understands and feels that they can do what they need to do to secure the data on the backend workspace one is really about flexibility this allows the employee themselves to be really in control of what's happening everything from zero management all the way into complete management now this isn't saying that you know IT doesn't get any say in it maybe we've got devices that are corporate issued or devices that you know the employee issues or and runs themselves maybe we've got you know stuff where you know we have unmanaged devices you know versus completely managed devices so it's about giving employees and users choice without sacrificing the flexibility and security inside of the enterprise end workspace one allows us to bring all of these features to bear self-service access to applications digital workspaces being able to allow users to choose their own devices inside of this space and to be able to do things like secure email and content and this can't be underlined enough if we talk about you know an instance where you might have a user that's leveraging you know Instagram or Facebook or or other forms of social media whatever it is and on the same machine they also have a you know secured email collateral or data collateral we want to be very very cautious about the types of things they can move from one application to another so being able to secure that and to create logical isolations between those things is imperative and tantamount to the success of your end-user compute deployment and also being able to provide conditional access and we'll talk more about that later and then to be able to scale this in a meaningful way so let's look first at self-service access being able to give users the ability to you know you know open up a box with their brand-new tablet and power it on and have it ask them to put on their fingerprint so no longer do users have to know the password if anything it's a good idea for us to obfuscate that password because now the user is no longer responsible for a piece of information that really only they know and they would always have to go back to and say hey you know can you can you reset that for me again and again and again or they forget it or they type it and wrong and it creates an error now their fingerprint is their point of access so biometric integration is key and then be able to tailor branding so it's not hey here's your new VMware tablet this is you don't Acme corporation or whatever it is and be able to tailor that branding so they have a unique experience that is comfortable and familiar with them and also through leveraging user environment manager to be able to provide a consistent experience across all of their devices and this access gets them into everything they need you know those of you that remember workspace and worked with it in the past know that it's about giving ubiquitous and far-reaching access to everything now this includes legacy applications may be thin apt application sam'l based applications like Google and Salesforce and and and onedrive and all those sorts of things and even SAS applications maybe you know Dropbox or box or slack or anything inside of those those realms internal web apps as well as applications that have been created with things like app volumes and let's not forget applications that may already be sitting inside of legacy maybe they've got an existing Zen app environment they could go ahead and attach those applications inside of this space so that it's not a full you know rip and replace and change up they can leverage their existing investments you guys have heard me say this a thousand times what VMware does is about leveraging existing investments in providing greater scalability into the ecosystem not only this but then also giving them access into virtualized desktops so they can access their VMs from the same device in case they need a full desktop experience and then to be able to do all of this with VMware's mobile single sign-on so again having that you know trust identification and be able to leverage by metrics and digital keys to not only provide access to applications and services that exist inside of the data center but like I said maybe even sam'l based applications where we can Fedder eight forward so that we're not having to wide and unwind users as they're being on borden and off boarded inside of companies or different divisions this really gives users the ability to kind of just log in and go from anywhere they get the box they open it up and they're ready to roll so if we look at it you know we've got you know the user chooses their device and then right out of the box they're going to be asked to provide their touch ID they enter that and then all of a sudden they've got all of this great access to everything they need and we're able to align it with policies as well so that maybe they're not going to get the same access on every network or they're not going to get the same access depending upon the type of peripheral that's plugged in that's very important like I said we can't underline the concepts of secure email and social media and content enough being able to really secure through content locker and to be able to leverage secure email gateways and secure applications inside of the device itself allows us to ensure that information cannot be copied and pasted from one point to another and that we don't have an intermingling of potentially feral information that could be disruptive to the corporation conditional access is another one you know being able to use the user themselves as the control point where their access of the resources is what's determining what they get access to whether it's cloud based applications on-premise or just applications that exist inside of the device and to be able to do this based upon how they're accessing it like we said their identity is the access and so based upon what they're doing we are able to ensure that whatever the the vice brings us whether it's jailbroken whether it's you know dealing a you know in you know malware or whether there's blacklisted applications we're able to address these through adaptive authentication so that we can provide a secure method to allow both internally built and public applications to access corporate resources that are residing inside of the network on a per application basis so this really gives us that flexibility of policy security and conditional access goes even further to talk about per app VPN you know you might have seen the other demonstration you know where we showed you know a dashboard and the dashboard may have multiple components and you know to a user they're just seeing they've got a bunch of resources what they don't see is that each one of those resources is tied to a data string and based upon where they exist that data stream may or may not be secure or safe to view and so per application VPN allows us to granularly control the data streams that are being accessed by the user we can also integrate clearly with intelligent networking with nsx and also to be able to provide device and usage analytics how are the applications being leveraged how are the data streams being utilized what are they accessing how are they accessing it where are they accessing it from this allows IT to follow user behavior and create more intelligent policies as they go and then to be able to automate in a scalable way you know IT used to have to build an entire operating system stack and then install all the applications and then manage everything now all they have to do is just focus on the apps and then work space one will take care of all of the background complexity so now IT can really easily manage Windows apps in real time from a single platform while still maintaining control they've always had so with this now we've got applique someone can fire and run directly inside of workspace one again with consistent experience across their entire device platform set also allowing us to have virtual application and desktop delivery to create smart groups that align to policies and also to be able to remote configure these applications you know it's really about tying in people applications and devices all together because people are going to do all sorts of different things but we have to stay fluid and that's what workspace one means to us so if we look at kind of a high level of all the different things that are at work here we've got you know a device that's accessing remote apps web apps native apps sam'l applications packaged applications virtual desktops all of these different things and inside of workspace one we're able to integrate with existing Active Directory or other forms of security modules to align with mobile SSO and to be able to take workspace one to provide that application service through the applique authentication module and to be able to deliver those remote apps web apps native apps packaged apps regardless of the device posture or the identity rules whether they're leveraging our own Identity Manager or third-party authentication so leveraging things like session time Network scope like we said per application VPN being able to be aware of the location of the device blacklisted applications malware jailbreaks so that they're still able to get what they need but they're able to get it based upon the policies that apply to the device that they're using because of this IT can then again develop clear policies define points of SQL and then automate the actions that align to it workspace 1 is available in three flavors standard advanced and enterprise and then inside of this space we're able to bring users what they need when they need it so just remember when we're talking about workspace 1 we're talking about a clear set of innovations mobile single sign-on being able to provide any app anywhere anytime on any device and to be able to provide a conditional access and secure messaging and content points for those users that at its core is what workspace 1 brings to market so that's a lot of great content around workspace 1 now we have a really cool demonstration video that I'd like to share with you take a look at this hello my name is marilyn basanta from VMware's end-user computing group i'd like to talk to you today about what it's like to experience the digital workspace the digital workspace is powered by workspace one which is the simple and secure enterprise platform that delivers and manages any application on any device by integrating identity applications and enterprise mobility management so let's go ahead and dive right in so every day we come into work and we all have the same struggles we have multiple devices mobile devices and we all have to log in with either multiple passwords or different tokens perhaps we have to look up our server address for you know these different applications either way this experience of having to remember all this information is not ideal and not with your end user expects so we've gone ahead and cooked up the little scenario to show you what the experience is like to onboard a brand new employee with the workspace pawn as a new employee perhaps one that works off-site they can be FedExed a new iPad and they can take it out of the box switch it on and it can auto configure itself on the back end we are hooking up Identity Manager error watch and we're automatically configuring this iPad to give you the right access to the right set of applications it may look simple with a few clicks but in the backend we've taken away the complexity from your end users now that we're all configured let's go ahead and fire up the workspace one application and it has a launcher and a brand new unified single catalog match with my single identity will give me access to all the applications I need to get my work done some of my applications you can see are being pushed down as part of my enrollment and other applications I can install on demand from the catalog that can help me get my day-to-day job done so there are apps like boxer box onedrive all of the apps that we need what about passwords so as you saw we have single sign-on and with my single identity I've only logged in once when I enrolled but I have access to web apps native apps horizon apps and we can also support citrix applications as well so let's take a look of these applications in action we can go into DocuSign and as you can see I've met eclis been logged in because our identity is known by the workspace one system I didn't have to put in server information or password I can just go in and start getting my work done next let's take a look at Salesforce I log on experience was beautiful easy and seamless and I can get right to work now the next set of applications is all about communication so let's first take a look at the boxer application which is one of our recent acquisitions this email application is a great user experience it's such a cool client you can do swipe gestures to move away spam or if we get important emails I can swipe left or right to like' or dislike' you know of course depending who it's from and we have a customizable action palette as part of the client to make it easy to set up gestures to do repeat actions is just a really nice experience so that's email next let's do something a little more real-time chat is everywhere in the enterprise so let's go ahead and here go to a private chat room type in a quick message to one of my users and hit Send it was an easy way to collaborate using the new social cast chat feature and lastly let's bring together content for content we have content Locker in content locker you can see all the different resources such as box Google Drive sharepoint onedrive and even Windows File shares that content lunker brings together with just one single identity so I have access to all of my different resources and finally let's deliver a 3d horizon application such as AutoCAD so you can see a great user experience bringing our existing on-prem amplication x' onto our mobile devices next let's talk a little bit more about single sign-on and we want to announce mobile SSO or secure app token system a patent-pending technology we are the first company to take a SAS or mobile app and be able to establish a trust to the enterprise through workspace 1 to deliver this great user experience single sign-on which is far more secure than passwords or tokens lastly let's bring our own device into the enterprise I can have the same experience with workspace 1 and I can use touch ID as my method of authentication now you can see in the workspace one application I've got the same applications as you saw on my iPad that are being sent to my iPhone so if we go ahead and look at Boxter you can see that I have a few updated emails and I can do a swipe gesture to archive them or I can launch the native Salesforce application which was already pushed under my device and of course since I'm already signed in with us or so I'm able to quickly get on and continue to do my work from my own device next let's move on to Windows 10 so let's take this Windows 10 laptop and we can add it to our enterprise infrastructure we can take advantage of the normal Windows 10 enrollment flows go to work access put in our corporate email and be able to connect to our workspace one instance in the background identity and air-water being connected and pushing down the enrollment of workspace one I can go ahead and sign in and you can see I've got the same launcher with all of my different applications in the same unified catalog that gives me access to additional applications it's the same user experience I can go ahead and again launch the Salesforce application and can to work no matter what device I'm on and lastly I want to touch upon security in particular office document security one of the major issues that come up with IT when you take these type of initiatives is data loss sometimes data loss happens on accident rather than maliciously you know people in your enterprise accidentally leaking information but let's go ahead and show you an example this Windows 10 device is enrolled in workspace one I have my work documents that are encrypted to my enterprise so as you can see Word is a managed application that I'm allowing the user to access these documents from and since I'm so excited let me go ahead and copy some of this text that I'm going to try to tweet out to my followers so I'm going to go ahead and copy the text and I'm going to launch Twitter from the Start menu you will see that manage applications have badges next to them to signify that they are secure so if I try to paste in this text I'm going to get a pop-up box that says cannot move encrypted content here since I'm not allowed to copy encrypted information on to this application next let's go ahead and try to load the word document in a different application so if I try to launch this in notepad which is not an authorized application I else look at an access denied so let's say now your employee is leaving the company but we have to be able to securely wipe and remove all corporate data from this device so very easily I can log on to the air watch admin console search for my user click all of their different devices and with one click delete them off the system and as easy as that all of your corporate data is gone from all of the devices from your user so now you've seen a high-level overview of what it's like to experience the digital workspace with workspace one thanks again for taking time with me today hopefully you found this information valuable as always I look forward to talking to you again soon and until then be sure to reach out to your local engineering and sales teams for more information on these fantastic products and so much more be sure to check out the playlists here for more content regarding end user compute software-defined data center mobility storage and software-defined networking and more and also be sure to follow me on Twitter from or updates thanks again have a fantastic day and I look forward to talking to you again really soon you
