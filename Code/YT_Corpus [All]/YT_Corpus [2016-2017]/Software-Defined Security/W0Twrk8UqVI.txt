 My work is at the intersection of networking and network security, and the goal of my work is to make the internet a safer place. What we see today is that the bad guys are winning the battle against the good guys, and part of the reason is the good guys are stuck with tools from the 1980s. They don’t have the right tools to implement the right kind of lenses to see what’s going on, and the right kind of hammers to enforce what they really want from the network. And my research is actually trying to provide them precision-guided hammers and lenses to have more visibility and more context into the security process. What we’re developing is what I call a software-defined approach to network security. But what if we could actually have tiny micro-software modules running to protect different users inside the network? Looking forward, I actually think that this kind of approach is going to be fundamentally necessary. What’s going to happen, essentially, with the Internet of Things is we’re going to have like a catastrophic combination of insecure devices with unfixable flaws, and there are going to be billions of them embedded deep inside your network. So we’re going to have this sort of lethal cocktail of insecure devices with access to critical assets. And sort of traditional approaches of defending networks is not going to work in this case. You can’t run an anti-virus, you can’t update the software on these devices. So we need these kinds of richer in-network capabilities to defend future Internet of Things deployment. I think the world of network security has always been sort of a chasing your tail kind of game so far. We’ve always been reacting to what the attackers are doing, and that puts the good guys on the back foot. So what I think we can do with this software-defined security approach is change the dynamics of this attack-defense game, and instead we are actually proactively protecting our next-generation networks against the next generation of threats.
