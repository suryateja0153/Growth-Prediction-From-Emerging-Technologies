 it all starts when an idea forms deep inside the brain then gradually develops and takes shape it crosses countless connections before it becomes a decision then a command then an action each connection plays a role reaching far beyond the brain itself to pull in information from the outside and transform signals into real world functions the brain is the chain of command the idea is the mission all connections that make this nervous system work is synapse the new broadband tactical software-defined radio family from Telus designs to the latest international standards this new broadband software-defined radio family represents a great leap forward it's networking modes and waveforms are reprogrammable to match the requirements of each mission broadband low latency snaps radio support collaborative combat all critical command functions are right there at your fingertips the synapse family builds on key features of contact the national software-defined radio program of the French MOT the largest in Europe with an open design to meet each country specific needs this way commanders can work together exchanging every relevant detail in the blink of an eye to race the tempo and accelerate collaborative combat connectivity is key it is the beating heart of every tactical move radio communications are just as vital just like connections in the brain that allow the human body to function all this mission critical information needs to be protected some communications can't be jammed intercepted or altered just like if signals from your eyes and ears could not reach your brain synapse provides the optimum combination of speed security and connectivity it makes sure radio services are available when they're needed in every tactical situation and it guarantees the integrity and confidentiality of data can what may synapse draws on Telus know-how in radio spectrum management and communication protocols to deliver superior range performance and use less frequency spectrum for a greater amount of useful data throughput friendly forces on a mission need to communicate with one another they need to know their own positions understand the tactical situation and anticipate the enemy's intentions in every case mission success depends on real-time collaboration and access to gain a complete view of the battlespace and all the forces in it when it comes to collaborative combat synapse gives the command structure a real operational advantage it's expands coordination to include all the forces in the field special forces to joint operations at Brigade level from ground troops to airborne and naval units from all arms deployments to coalition forces synapse provides the level of coordination needed for every successful coalition operation within NATO or under any other allied command as the human body develops and grows it has the capacity to continuously improve armed forces to need their communications and information systems to evolve over time they need a clear path to the future while taking into account legacy systems already in service this is the path that Tallis is chosen with the new synapse broadband software-defined radio family synapse accelerating collaborative combat you
