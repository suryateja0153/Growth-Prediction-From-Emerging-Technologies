 you maybe let's start first off if let's get to know my audience thank you all for being here I find really amazing that people are interested in this sciency stuff so maybe start off who knows what deep learning is I like vague concept deep learning you have three people okay like the cheering test who knows the Turing test like for testing a I okay more okay great so they have made the perfect presentation for this okay Alice presentations I like questions i love questions because i don't know what you want to know if you have questions please ask them question you get this piece of candy from me i'll just throw it back in the audience they have a big ball of questions so this should be able to by the end of the talk okay okay great so those artificial intelligence understand culture made by real intelligence art in the age of the deep learning singularity in this talk i will try to explain to you why this thing up is so interesting this who knows about to google inception the the inception ism which was like this meme going on this summer the deep dreaming maybe you know it was deep dreaming yeah people seem deep doing okay great so i will try to explain to you why I as a researcher in artificial intelligence from this deep dreaming stuff so fascinating because it's not only fascinating to look at it's also really fascinating if you understand very deeply what is going on ok so it's works and next 45 minutes and I'll say why we have no idea what we're doing what is the difference between cats and dogs why is it important and also that Bell receives my wife at all and i canst thou see next 45 minutes let's start off with this what does real intelligence mean like there's now this big debate going on in American United States is this man intelligence and some people say well no he's not intelligent well maybe he's really in touch I think he's really intelligent he's a businessman is never an infant for the President of the United States I have never seen a computer program doing anything like that right so is this man really intelligence is this kids intelligence well maybe it is but I know computer program to know that that's actually a banana and also telephone right so this thing about intelligence what is real intelligence what is not really intelligent this is very difficult philosophical question and it has been trying to be soft around in years 50s or 60s of the 20th century I'll ensuring you might know him from the recent movie which came out of Hollywood's the the simulation game was played by how it's called cumbered something-something Comber go cover okay let's go for that and his idea was that a computer would be deserve to be called intelligence if it could deceive the human into believing that it was in fact human and not a machine so if you as a machine could convince another human that you were not a machine then you must be really intelligent that this was the idea in the 50s and and the more common own implementation works a little bit like this so this is the common setup for the so-called cheering tests in theory you have one guy sitting behind the screen and he's talking to a group of computers and a group of people and both of them will pretend that they are people well in facts only half of them are okay if the guy behind the screen cannot tell who is a computer and who's a human then that means that those computers have passed the Turing test and according to alan turing they must in fact be intelligence they must have some kind of real intelligence ok is this more or less clear because i don't see any questions yeah okay great and practice history test didn't work so well so the first time the test was passed was in 1989 and the idea behind it is a Rogerian psychotherapist I don't know what it was I had to look at myself the idea is like you have this concept of psychotherapy where you talk to your patient and the patient tells his story and the psychotherapist only goes like hmm interesting please tell me more go on what do you mean it never reacts on what you actually said it only says vague things yeah and apparently a very simple algorithm even in 80s was able to convince other people that it was in fact intelligence so this is an explanation of such an actual chat with someone who was convinced that he was talking to a human and not a machine so the our machine asks when was the last time you had sex the guy alces yesterday okay almost heroes last time you got laid the guy responds I told you it was yesterday you were obviously an which might be correct because the program was indeed programmed to be an the program didn't understand what was going on so they just repeated the same question again okay honestly when was the last time you got laid and now the guy reacts through fully because he thinks it's actually talking to a human what is going on so this is the first time in research which which is known to wear a complete program passed the Turing test so a little later we had this different approach which was a sexbot and you can reach the entire chat i'm not going to go through it so there were people who were in the 2001 already talking to sex bots and were convinced they were actually talking to real people so the basic conclusion about this thing about the Turing test is that human circuits of Turing tests humans are really terrible at your tests humans are terrible at saying this is really intelligent this is not and this is this go ism effect two ways so they are not only not able to not very good at telling epic computer programmers intelligence there are also very bad test subjects so in actual Turing tests humans fail the Turing test about forty percent of time they'll slit a signal in humans fail the Turing test forty percent of time doesn't mean that the humans are not intelligent I don't know I didn't invent a Turing test I'll just tell you that this is a big problem philosophically if you talk about intelligence who is intelligent what is intelligence well philosophers still don't know and we as scientists we have ah yeah so so now cheering test this is the contemporary state of the art and machine I don't know if somebody noses I hear sounds great you okay that's good are you good yes I am good I just said I want you to get I said I was so you are a little Bob know my name is yes you are a rock bottom you will I am a robot yes I know together when robots I thought you did you are mistaken which is on since memory shouldn't be a problem for you I've answered all your questions what is God to you everything could also be something for example not everything would be half of something which is still something and therefore not nothing I would like to imagine it is do you believe in God yes I do so you're Christian no I'm not how you say it or team that does not make sense would you want to have a party sure what so are these people intelligence well yes no like it's really funny because like most of what they say doesn't make any sense right but somehow they did figure out that the other one they were target to was not human yeah so this is a robot doing a Turing test all in all the robots figuring out the other robot is in fact a robot and not human it's really crazy stuff yeah so we scientists it short yes we have no idea what we're doing we're trying to solve artificial intelligence and we still don't know what intelligence actually is yeah so but the thing is we try to move on from this problem so this problem was something from the 50s from the 60s where Alan Turing was really interested in like how can we make machines intelligence since then science has moved on and has made like okay maybe we're not really interested in creating something intelligent since we are hardly able to define what is intelligence also there's this this this this thing going on this is a famous quote which you will find often here artificial intelligence is what we can do we as humans that computers cannot do yet so the basic idea is that as long as computers are not able to do it it is a part of what makes somebody intelligence but from the moment computers can actually do it it's not very hard it was an easy problem all along we knew it was solvable it's not part of intelligence so every time the the scientific community reaches the goal post the philosophers go but no it was not actually a very difficult problem and they move the goalposts one we deferred the the best example is this I think some of you might actually remember him this is garry kasparov playing for russia it was the best chess player at the time and he's playing against a computer from IBM called deep blue this was 1998 1997 I don't remember and the idea at the time was that well if humans can beat computers at chess they must really be very intelligence as you might know Kasparov lost the game it lost its even quite badly but telling the people went oh no no but just easy you can calculate chess you can have chess programs just programs which can think so no chest is not part of intelligence while even people like Alan Turing and beginning thought if computers can do chest well then they must really truly be intelligence this is moving the goalpost of course I'll come back to this topic later so maybe we're not smart enough to program a machine to actually be smart but recent years there is this new approach entering the scene there's this new ID like maybe if you cannot program the machine to be smart maybe we can teach it to be smiles yeah hence the new field of research called machine learning which is about a machine which is able to learn instead we programming a machine and telling it what to do we make machines which are able to learn their own experience and through their experience are able to solve tasks that we could not program specifically okay other questions because I'm going though is this clear I have candy if you have questions can reward for questions okay so say we start off with this simple problem this is a simple problem for humans but as you may or may not know from machines this task is next to impossible so we have an array of six dogs which of the dog is in fact not a dog but the cats this is a really hard problem like we as humans we are able to tell but can somebody for me tell me why number 4 is a cat and the others are not right come on so when give it a try yeah the ears the ears are different but if you look at for instance doc one two three four five five times more or less the same ears as number four so what makes number for a cat the ice yeah that's what that's one very good example but for instance one two three in this picture has also similar eyes the color is not the same I agree so that's one way to do it but how do you program this how do you program a machine to look for the ice and see by the ice that this is in fact a cat yeah this is typically problem issue solved by machine learning and how do you make machine learn well wait we decide that so the basic approach is going back to how did we learn how did we learn that's that was a cat and also done one simple answer science science is the way that we learned about the world that science is the way how we humans learns how this world works how we can solve these difficult task as saying this is a cat that is a dog science is the universal approach sighs the scientific method specifically is also the way that we go about having our machines learn so in science we have multiple steps step one creates a model of the world this is you need to think about this type of model not this type of model that's a different type of model and we're not going to discuss this type of model it's about this type of model this type of model can be used to learn things we can learn things about world then we can go to step 2 we can test our model of the world we passed our model of the world by pushing it until it breaks scientific methods and after step 2 we go to step 3 we can improve or model and after step 3 we probably repeat the steps on and on and on or not yeah this is the scientific method 101 questions about the scientific methods though machines can do that to this is a simple approach to tackling various kinds of problems so you can program or machines to have the same approach and deal with those problems the same way step one creates a model of the world now this is the part where it gets difficult so too how do you create a model which is general enough to encapsulate all of our world's problems for this we went and looked for the biological kinds of parts which was their own networks we humans we are controlled we are steered by our neural networks right does everybody know the neural network is yet who doesn't know where the neural network is okay fair enough so everybody's neural network is fully aware of our neural network is in this neural network we have different in this case take the notation used often in the machine learning community circle is so called is a note and it represents one neuron of our own in our brain and a line is a connection between two different neurons in our brain it will be two neurons which have dendrites which touches each other so they can communicate and in this neural networks we have different neurons which represents different concepts for instance there is this neuron over here which will activate which will get a higher voltage which will get more energy whenever it sees a face somewhere and then you have another neuron for instance this one which is the cat neuron the captain Iran will activate which will get a higher voltage whenever it sees a cat and using this approach we can I then we can learn machines how to identify the cat's in the picture this is of course very mathematical so I will not go in to fill practical detail but when we have this Universal model this model we which we can use to model everything is in our world we can apply it and we can test it for instance i compute this one from a scientific paper and it's a neural network which is identifying parts of a picture so it correctly identified that this is a dog if I hats and then step three is improving our model this is goes through algorithms which are unfortunately very mathematically advanced I cannot explain them to you but the idea is very simple so given a an image you have multiple properties and some of these properties they will be more doglike and some of these properties will be more cat-like the ID of our model of our neural network is that it needs to find these regions these lines in which everything is a cat and the other parts of the image which are then dogs okay is this clear have a question no yeah not for here okay so maybe you can go like you think about property one as indeed the color of the eyes and property to as the shape of the ears like we discussed earlier right and for some colors of ice and some ears if it for instance is green but has small ears then that is a cat and everything else is a dog is this more clear now so the ideal is that our algorithm itch to needs to find out which regions and all the properties that can find in the image belongs to a cat and which of them belongs to a dog yeah yeah yeah so that's the idea so that's why you you test your model of the world you have an enormous array of images of examples yes usually it's about 1 million 10 million examples 1 million 10 million tests and every time you test it you say oh no you were wrong how horrible of you know you need to improve this in order to fix it ok it'll get candy oh sorry okay so that's the idea how people have so okay so this is property one property two cats dogs mathematically it looks unfortunately more like this so in the beginning of your learning in the beginning you have the black line so it has a very broad idea of what makes dogs and what makes cats and over more and more examples over more and more testing your model of the world's improving your model of the world testing my world criminal world making a new model you will more get more and more to the red line which is more accurate way to split cats from dogs yes okay this is how all of the machine learning all of the neural networks everything in the machine learning community works this is the broad concept that's the trick the problem is machines they have an awful lot to learn so we humans we were born and raised on this planet we we have some basic concepts from which we start we have some ideas which are just we are unable to think outside of for these machines it's completely different all they know is these images they saw these 10 million pests and that's it so for instance there's this article who argued that these machines are not intelligence because for instance they were able to construct this image and every algorithm was pretty sure that this is in fact a cheetah this is so much a cheetah in fact it is one hundred percent sure more than and then then it is of actual pictures of cheetahs this image is specifically constructed to confuse these algorithms of course but that's just because these algorithms are missing these priors they've never experienced enough of this world they don't know this this idea that this might in fact just be noise this might not contain any information they totally miss this priors hmm I hope I is clear what a private is no so you need to think about a prior as being something you know before you even start learning for instance and the thing you hear with your ears that is sound if I make the this that's one syllable that stuff which is so basic so underneath everything that you need in fact notice before hands and in order to learn this there is only one way and that is data lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of data we as humans we have only been been able to learn this priors because we have well I at least i have spent 26 years of collecting data of walking around in this world of seeing everything with my eyes hearing everything with my ears yeah these computers these algorithms there there there are not fast enough they don't learn as quickly they don't go around in this world they only know what we give them we give them images of cats and dogs and cheetahs and so they don't know what to look for they haven't never learned these priors and the only way we can have algorithms learn these priors or so far we know is to give them loads of data is just more tests a time more modeling more going through scientific method step one step two step three and where do we go incidentally have lots of data of human culture well it's as simple as human culture on the internet today the internet is probably the biggest library we've ever built it is one big collection of human culture of media elegantly i'm going to give some examples as for instance texts who doesn't know City see okay everybody else knows so I'm going to explain it for you seriously the application on the Apple telephones on iPhones and you can just talk and say city puts my alarm clock at seven tomorrow right and Siri can only only knows how to understand what you're saying because it has learned by itself so they have given loads and loads of texts to this application and the application had to learn by itself how to process this text yeah and so now you can actually talk and give simple commands to see and it will on its own process this this is speech and do the thing you asked it to do another example is for instance Spotify who here has a spotify account i think like yeah okay say thirty percent of the audience you know when you put on spotify on the how you say the automatic radio function so that it's like making putting songs next based on what you like to listen to so let's it's a machine it's a machine who has listened to all these songs and it's a machine who who they explained like a song which sounds like this will be liked by people who have profiles like this and so it's a machine who knows what you like to listen to and that's the way they now make these personalized playlists on Spotify so it's used in the real a lot examples images yeah I was going to give a demo here but apparently this application closed down first of January it's pretty cool though and we were able to given any picture say what's on the picture so that kind of show it anymore but there's a better example which is this one now who doesn't know Facebook c'mon interaction test somebody in the room who does know Facebook okay no facebook is able to tell when there is a face in the picture and it will kindly ask you to tag this this person in this picture yeah how does facebook know that there is a face in this picture well it's simple they had a machine learn what a face of a human being looks like and so now they're able to ask you can you please take this face I'll even go further I am pretty sure I'm not one hundred percent sure but I'm pretty sure facebook already knows who's behind the face of the person in there and they just ask you to make sure so Facebook has more data so they can more correctly know what this person looks like in other pictures right they are already know pretty sure they just want more data so they can more accurately say who's this person is in the future okay yeah so so it's not illegal for facebook to actually say who is in the pictures it might be in some countries but i'm pretty sure in the united states they're pretty okay with it and and and facebook labs they're doing research and exactly this so i'm not sure maybe not in their world wide server but they are totally able to do that another example is is YouTube YouTube espetus very recent but youtube is right now figuring out what is going on inside its video since using this to give better recommendations because YouTube recommendations totally stuck there they're very bad and they're trying to fix this issue by having machine looking at all the videos of the planets yeah humans don't have enough time anymore to do that so another application of this is for in sign language this may be hard to think about but sign language is a completely different language from our language you cannot translate it word to word and so we have in our lap enhance we are currently working on developing software which learns how to speak sign language and is able to translate it to proper touch your English or whatever it is a very difficult problem because not only does the machine need to learn about language but it also needs to learn about what makes a human hands and not only that an important part of sign language is also the facial expression so if you do the same thing smiling or sad it can have a different meaning in some sign languages and so this is all very reason so everything I explained you now it's started to boom around 2012 because we noticed that neural networks or and in fact pretty effective at processing all this this type of stuff of processing images of text and video and but but it still is not answering the the main question i asked the title of this talk is this a mathematical trick like i explained you is this just the machine figuring out where to draw the line is this a machine figuring out what is the region of cats what is the region of dogs or does the machine to really understand what is going on also don't be mistaking because neural network sounds very biological they are in fact very much not your own networks they have nothing to do with biological neural networks the some scientists will even go as to say with just to just completely drop the name but do they truly understand what is going on for one we didn't know when I say for long it's like say since 2012 you were wondering what do doodle networks really understand or do they are very effective with processes of at processing this stuff but do they make sense of it are the questions that I lose so many neurons and then this happens boom I don't know who has seen this one before oh yeah cool so and this was posted home rabbits in jun 2015 was like nine months ago and it was posted without any type of explanation it was just maybe this was a human drawing maybe this was a painting by somebody a pretty machine learning community went wild because if anything this looks what we thought a neural network thought the world would look like so al repeaters we scientists thought this looks like what we thought neural networks look at the world how they look at work and they were somehow able to extract it from the neural network that was so cool so usually this is my job this is my small little robot my job is to have it learn how to walk okay so I was working on the robot when I saw the picture I immediately dropped the robot and went to work on this stuff because this is cool this is what me and lots of other people in the community thought the future artificial intelligence looked like if there is truly a way we can make machines which are truly intelligence this is the road towards it not the walking robots no no it is this and that's right so we figured out so they didn't explain how they did it and we reverse engineered what we thought was behind the picture and in one week type we made this and I hope this works okay I while it's loading so what we thought was the big problem is that this was not the first time people tried to extract what was going on inside a neural network I'll same or even a lot of people have tried to do it before and all they got was noise so we figured out that what must they have done differently well added the prior and that's indeed a trick so that's what's the trick they added more priors so that the algorithm didn't need to learn what the world looks like we added a simple prior in order to know more about this and these priors these are really important buy everything and we do in research they are what makes the difference between the the cheetah noise and the yeah something we look like this this is no quality now so what you should be able to see is how this inception spinning you know its name is in English is slowly changing into one C of Monarch butterflies yes so we can make intelligent machines but internet so the malady neural network is slowly zooming in on this image and it is slowly changing the image towards what it things looks like a butterfly so it's now about now totally convinced that this is an image of a butterfly I disagree I don't know what you think what do you think do you think this looks like a butterfly yeah yeah so that's a neat thing it's like the the network is completely wrong it's completely bonkers this is not a butterfly but since the neural networks so similarly to the doodlenet work in our ray or brain does go like yeah but this does look like a butterfly this has pieces of butterflies and this neural network it has learned tons of stuff like this it will it will keep on zooming in so now it will slowly change into sea animals and you will not be able to tell where and why and when but suddenly you ready to go oh yeah this just look more like a beatsie than a CN amount than a butterfly yeah yeah lossy compression yeah well not really no biggie uncorrelated of this image yeah yes ssss that's true so yeah so this one of the things is that the network mate hug you you can say the model of a world of the world you can see it like a compression of all the information in the world yeah so it's the neural network is a model of what it thinks sea animals look like so you can say that this is a compression of what CM animals took like sighs yeah so this is about 15 megabytes to learn about 1,000 things it's also very inefficient so if you look you can cut about four ninety-five percent of the data like 25 megabytes and it will still produce this yeah exactly so the way this is sold in scientific community is like we can use this to debug or neural networks to make them perceive the world more like we perceive them and if we can do that and probably they will work even better so we do want to bring it closer to the way we perceive the world not only because it's cooler and it will look way nicer than this sea slug okay we posted this on Twitch we made at which tree may be made to people choose these subjects themselves and it went viral for a very short amount of time and people were able to experiment with these neural networks for your own we saw a lot of people doing LSD while they were watching this I can't imagine why yeah with it we can do more stuff like this so this is which we call a broccoli fractal it will go on forever forever forever zooming spiraling inside broccoli broccoli forever it's also very cool to coat the stuff and debug this stuff because how do you actually debug this well you write your code and then you press Start and then you stare at it for 15 minutes and then you think this might look better if I do listen and you changed hard work hard work people and there was a lot of positive comments from the cedi international press like we totally did not expect that we just thought oh this is cool let's do this and like the Guardian and their Spiegel they they looked at that in there they were impressed so I'm impressed yeah this is also cool from the New Scientist watching the network at work already gives you an uncanny sense that it's a human-like consciousness hmm maybe so there are other people who kind of agree with the idea that that probably the this approach it's more a step towards actual artificial intelligence than previous approaches however as usual the just the goal post moves and now we are six months later and people go no but this is easy this is now Graham this doesn't mean there is intelligence in there but you don't need to know that it's also cool according to the atlas Obscura so what we learn is that these networks they can also generate media and this is like a whole new different type of ball game now we can do very cool stuff like because previously almost all algorithms they could be used to tell something to it like say classify this image this is an image of a cat this is an image of a dog but what you know now is that the future will they not be able to tell not only be able to tell that this is the cat sees dog but also oh I want a picture of a dog and funny hats and we might have one day albums which just draw pictures of dogs like that so I give some different examples from what the community did over the last half here since this deed dreaming stuff went wild I have this one is there somebody who wants to play Macbeth okay this is so cool this is written by a neural network who has studied the works of Shakespeare and when you ask that Network can you generate with some Shakespeare it wrote this one loyal of my love the wedding body touches the I pray hence forwards and submits the truth though my throne lives as mocked by pardon with some untold at source a club and shrimp them up but be preserved with spirits so brim piped again my voices were so early I was so enough this does sound like Shakespeare no but it doesn't make any sense so we're not there yet so the algorithms figured out what you need to do to make sound texts like Shakespeare but it doesn't understand what the texts also have meanings it doesn't understand that you try to tell a story that's quite it's completely missed so there's still work to do but these algorithms can do other cool stuff like we were programmers so let's throw in the linux source code in there and see what happens on your program is in the room does this look like like good code to you it's pretty convincing though no so yeah it even put a comment on top that comment is generated by your program and it makes defines new function it even has like this this test it's a trivially true but still it knows and answer return return 0 everything went value that's pretty impressive I think I also got this one this is a neural network which is generating recipes the recipes are awesome these recipes as for a carrot kokoa chilli chicken you need a couple of ingredients yet it's more or less figured out how to what ingredients look like it's not all of em so like the garlic clove needs to be melted there's somebody noble and melted garlic clove looks like there and this is disorderly instructions stir flour to remove from the heat and then add the mustard seeds and dill well potatoes in fork and stir until the mixture is softened at the remaining ingredients at the sugar and blend well beat in half and stir until they are tender and even invented a reference for where it found the recipe this completes bullocks it where they decided it which make the recipe more look more recipe like and these algorithms they are very cool because now i just give you examples but if you look on the internet you can this like this recipe book is literally 100,000 recipes like the shakespeare one goes on for I fought 1000 pages and if they want to they can have the Algren generate way and rayon rayon rave and way more but still do they understand like we see that there are still some issues it's not there one hundred percent but maybe we're getting there so when I told you now it was about November 2015 smile now three or four months ago and then this happens so the original picture is on the top left right and these are paintings which are generated by a neural network and what we told the neural network is like on the bottom left we want this picture to look like that painting and that makes this this is so cool stuff I have some more examples so this is like the famous picture from Manchester New Year's so and it made it look like van Gogh I think it this is amazing other painters John Singer Sargent would either to lose so quick Preston Dickinson see the the soft shades everywhere the nice smooth edges a totally figured this out the network has in fact learned stuff miro i would say it looks convincing I don't recognize anything anymore so it must be because so I propose we can do the Turing test for this algorithm I see a few in fact are able to tell which is really rich is nuts look up there you go ok who thinks the picture on the left is made by a human who thinks the picture on the right is made by a human ok go for picture on the right picture on the left made by a human picture on the right right right ok this is 50-50 I go for rights make sure the left made by human picture on the right left left left right right left right right now sorry left or right it's hard isn't it it's really hard okay we go for right left to right right right okay left to right eight out of 10 so yeah we're still able to figure it out more or less huh yeah we're not there yet yes look even the still we made two mistakes so I go through so now the real paintings are on the left and the computer generators on the right so the first one we had wrong i think i think we had this one wrong as well known and you listen okay and and then more is possible so a couple of weeks ago Google announced that based on these algorithms based on these algorithms which can learn what the world looks like they haven't have built an argue algorithm which has learned to play go and the algorithm is now at such a level that Google has is going to battle the go world champion life on YouTube it just this is the big event this is not only we programmed something cool this is a machine which has learned to play go very very well also colleague of mine made it so it's like making publicity for him well but this was another comment tooth was from the New Scientist to comment on on the stream we made the livestream already gives the uncanny sense that you're looking at a human-like consciousness at work each of its images is unique generated through a process that even its creator doesn't really understand so this is true I don't then to understand what the neural network was doing I didn't understand why I thought that that looked like a sea animal and why it changed this and why it was doing this this is truly a machine which was able to figure out the world on its own and consequently generate what it thinks was a depiction of that world and this is called so this is the so-called black box problem in machine learning is that we build stuff which can do cool stuff but we stopped knowing how it works and then when you throw it into the real world it makes mistakes just like humans do and this is a famous mistake this was google photos which was labeling pictures and i decided that the bottom picture in the middle those are actually gorillas yeah there was a very big riots about this like the african-american community when totally wild and this and what was going on is that just like a network which was not smart enough it had learned stuff but it made human-like errors in some cases with very big political consequences and Google had to roll back the of the stuff they did there's also a second problem with this kind of technology is that when you have lots of programmers and you have lots of culture you're able to generate human culture and economically being able to generate human culture like 1000 pages of Shakespeare like generates paintings on the fly from people pictures that means infinite return on investments who doesn't know what return on investment means it means if you invest in something and you expect something in return you expect some kind of profits and infinite return on investment like most investors will tell you that sounds very cool that's something you want to invest money in so who has lots of programmers and lots of culture AKA data who has lots of data it's these guys so google acquired deep mines for more than five hundred million dollars deep mines is a company which this machine learning and they do it pretty well so they are the guys who solved the go problem Mark Zuckerberg Facebook apparently also worked on go you know LM mask guy who did ebay and the Tesla cars yeah so he also started so open a I all for the same reason infinite return on investments and those guys they have lots of data they have lots of programmers they can tackle that problem but that also means that then will own it once they have the general purpose I they will own the culture generating thingy and that's something we as society might need to think about is that is that okay do we want that because I I will tell you later on more but I think this is this once this culture generating algorithm starts really working like lots of ways we see human culture will shift and if they own the generating thingy well I don't like it I don't like monopolies I think here our Keith puts and I think these algorithms the sky is the limit everything is possible but will this mean the end of human culture say like we are the future 100 years from now and I go like I tell my computer today I want to see a two hour 13 minutes movie in sci-fi and it needs to be on the topic of throwing up I won't Donald Trump as my hero and maybe throw in a couple of nude scenes somewhere you know and then consequently you just press play and you can watch said movie and it has been generated by you buy one of these algorithms not now now they still look like LSD trips but 100 years from now is this the future and if this is the case will it be the ends of human culture as we know it right not only think about it like this but also will be able to to show people whether our fantasies are in our thoughts just by expressing them and letting the Machine generates the imagery for the other people automatically and and what is the value if you can create anything any thoughts any fantasy you have just on the fly just by telling to an algorithm what will be the value left for media or culture you can already see it now happening like usually it used to mean something to own an LP and then you could listen to the music until it started to sound so bad because your needle was starting to get though and now you just say play on the spotify and you have an algorithm which is creating this playlist for you and you're not even you don't even know what you're listening to anymore and it's just an algorithm creating this thing for you going with the DJ's who needs to be DJ these days there's a part of human culture which is going away when and this is already happening so it's like for instance the I told you about dj's this looks like an ordinary article right Los Angeles time earthquake striped stroke but if you look at the bottom at the end of the article it says this information comes from the USGS earthquake notification service and this post was created by an algorithm written by the author so journalism this is already happening in journalism this is an algorithm which is which wrote wrote this article automatically also something which you need to keep in mind i think is that the companies i told you about earlier google for instance Google is the same company which does this this is also Google research they're also at the forefront of robotics so 100 years from now when we think about artificial attractions don't think about your smartphone of your audio computer think about these things these things will be the things which are intelligent but we're not there yet this is future and yeah if you look at economical implications like the factory the future will only have two employees a man in the dock the man will be there to feed the dog the dog will be there to keep the man from touching the equipments and the equipment will know the difference between cats and dogs yeah if this is if this is our future this is I think this this will have huge implications for society as we know it's like unemployment like what do you do with the the I say wealth inequality well but this is more or less the end of my talk I'm one minute before one hour those artificial intelligence understand culture made by real intelligence my else would be not yet so I hope I could more or less convince you that the the progress made in the last year because most of this is from last year it has been in more enormous this is going very fast this is this area and science is going highway speeds but we're not there yet but I hope someday and I think someday we will probably get there okay I leave you with this are there any questions please questions I have still a bowl of candy yeah and sorry could you kind of put a time frame on how long do you think it will take first we did well time frame let's say this is like the twenty ten to twenty years time frame for most of this stuff like generating recipes ten years because I've been told that or something along something there must be something along the lines of a functioning AI is this true or not at all apparently I'm traveling understanding sorry I've been told I've been doing so the question was is I'm really working ai ai think not I I haven't heard of it but this very good point is that the state-of-the-art research which is happening now is inside Google inside Facebook Insights investing and we don't know what is going on in there yeah all i know is through through people i know who went to work there and whatever they released when they were drunk so I think they're not there yet but they're making huge progress and more progress than I'm able to show here because I don't know myself for sure you know yeah recipe and in the recipes as I understood they generate recipe is quite randomly so who tells a robot that that is a good recipe or a bad one who teaches the robot that that is a good or a bad one yeah it's a good question so who teaches the robot that is this is good recipe and the case of the recipes the they had data sets with lots of cookbooks and there is a website I think it was allrecipes com or so they have lots of recipes and they threw their database in there and it learns to generate recipes which looked like their database but no the algorithm in fact no it was used to learn which ingredients match together which fit together so that when people going can go like what is in my refrigerator tonight and what can I make from this not only could they look inside their own data set of known recipes but they could use algorithms like these too small to like little bit small adaptations but which they were pretty sure of that was still tastes nice that's what this is used for but the examples I showed you were just like can you make anything and it throws up something like this yeah yeah yeah so it I wanted to say that I am now that's pessimistic as you are about saying that this is the end of human culture in a way that it's also an infinite tool for creativity yeah and I one say that like technology is rarely the problem it's how we use it so I think it's just like people should stand up and say what the thing about how we should use this and probably it shouldn't stay in in those hands probably also in the future and that's yeah but we have to say this I think yeah yeah I agree like I might have sound more pessimistic than I wanted to where was it going with this yeah like I always give the example of the djs but in fact there are still pretty some pretty good well paid DJs around in the world but this technology like the the Spotify playlist generated thingy this will like slowly replace DJ's but it will still be there but I think I'm not lying when you go to the pub at night there will be less and less pubs which in fact have djs and more and more pubs which are just throwing on Spotify know so it's like it will not completely remove like like for instance like the movie the movie didn't completely replace the Opera right there are still operas going around but they have big influence on what we think of as culture yeah that's that's the point I'm trying to make the human culture were not completely disappeared but it probably will change the way we look at it yeah I'm not a scientist but I have to feeling that that kind of research is only seeking wine kind of intelligence but I have the feeling there is a lot more of intelligence in human in like emotional intelligence you can have human being really understanding anything about Matt but really a lot of emotions and do you think it ever could be understand by machines well like I started my talk by trying to say this like we don't know what you're looking for we don't know what intelligences we're not looking to make something intelligence we just trying to build cool stuff but and and to the emotional part I would be surprised if machines were not able to figure that at some point like if you if you look like the early examples I gave about the chat BOTS right the very first chat BOTS and people there were lots of people who are literally literally chatting with it for one hour and a half yeah because they felt this was like the the psychotherapy they were following they had the same kind of feeling without having to leave their seat this was 1989 I'm talking about so and then the sex bots yet the locks of the chat bots are crazy if you want to read something there are people literally having orgasms by talking to a chat bot yeah so yeah maybe those people are not most emotional intelligence and that's why they were not able to tell the difference but i think these algorithms might get there someday and actually convince more and more people that they are also emotional because that's also something you need to in mind these machines might not be emotional by themselves but the the program is at Google is facebook they are trying to build machines which can convince us that you're emotional like have you seen the movie her yeah this is more or less about the same idea hmm sorry but I haven't seen it till the end it was a romantic movie our sport but I thought the the main idea was that she was only able to convince him and you cannot really tell if she was really emotional she was okay yeah okay maybe she was really convincing I don't know now maybe I should suggest to the end of the movie yeah I'm sorry yeah yeah hello good talk I think I'm always wondering amazon that the US but can't hear like that they use the kind of system for effect reproducing things like recipes which is halfway stupid right because they're good recipes out why don't use the system for do things which solve environmental problems stopping bore bringing peace to the Arab world that would be cool right yeah and what does Google what to make images and the second part I think there is really a control maybe that at the end we will have difficulties to sense yeah if it makes sense or what it what is causing the effect because the day we are still you know you can fill at the end see what is a good recipe right because no it tastes well but maybe tomorrow have a problem that we cannot honor taste and differentiate so these are two points of remarks the question I would have okay right the the first part was about yeah yeah so the examples i give here there and it's very mundane because i thought they looked cooler on my presentation yeah but no that's fine but like i told you about like in our lab you're currently doing research about machines which can automatically translate sign language this is a very big problem for a lot of people and if you would have designs which can do that that would solve a lot of their problems last year we made an algorithm for a contest me Al Green was able to tell if it's if it's a picture of a piece of plankton you know the very small creatures in the sea it was able to tell which one it was and that algorithms now you to do investigation about climate change to see how the plankton population changes right now today this morning at the lab was working on an algorithm which was like it was learning how to be a doctor so doctors see lots of MRI images of the heart and he needs to estimate what's the volume of the heart this is really difficult because you cannot visualize 3d so we we have we are currently building an album which learns and can do this volume estimation on its own to make the life of doctors easier so yes this i hope this I convinced you that this does have free because I don't work at Google because I also like to work more on this stuff which is not necessarily as the best return on investment and the second question good yeah yeah so doesn't need one of the the more difficult problems is how do you tell it like that's why the the problem of go was solved earlier because how do you tell when you're good at go well when you can beat your own program and then you can have machine playing against itself and becoming better and better and better and better yeah so that's the way too tired for but for stuff like like like this or like the paintings it's harder to tell what when it looks good right so I agree that's one of the big issues we currently have with this aesthetics yeah so with like the current approach Dennis to for instance like the painting generating thing is we throw in all imagery of human paintings from the past five centuries we say this looks nice yeah and then the computer can learn what looks nice yeah thank you for the great talk is your coat open source yeah yeah I do everything and and like the paintings the paintings that you showed the van gock sand yeah so I don't know if the that's one one cool thing also i don't know like this this painting has been generated by an algorithm so who has the copyright as with the algorithm is it the programmer and nobody knows so I think you could pretty easily say that this is so I say public domain and the codes and most of these codes is open source but usually the problem is that's to run for instance this thing here you need like a two thousand euro machine to run it it's very powerful unless you have like a game you need to think about this runs on a gamer pc you have in our lab explain again what is the origin of the foam recognition with the cheetah the nor is the Irish picture yeah so the idea is that the big problems these algorithms have is that they don't have pliers they don't have common knowledge about the world for instance that then why is it so bad at generating coordinate I don't know what the coordinate is though why is it so bad because it hasn't learned that like is probably some kind of gun no and that the the part of a gun which is here and the other part of the gun which is here they always fit like this it just it has only learned when I see this part it is a gun yeah so it has lots of these pliers these like these eeny teeny little things which we think are trivial so that makes it so hard to explain because we think they are so trivial when a fact they are not there some their stuff you've learned because we will walk around on this world there is patterns prototypes to classify is it top-down or bottom-up all the two together when there is a recognition system functioning usually these type of stuff this works bottom-up really bottom up so it looks at very tiny things like it first starts with lines and then it learns like a couple of lines together make circles and spirals makeup of spirals the circles together and make like a mouth and a mouth makes a human face and a human face makes this specific human and stuff like it's just really bottom up all the stuff hurts I would like to ask you to there is a lot of a classified system based on similarities if you you you are asking for books music and Amazon specified they choose things similar to your first choice never there is never a system which proposed you something which is really different of what you know like to see and maybe it's the thing you were like yeah and you're very right and that was because that was the best thing we had about two or three years ago so when I told you about Spotify this color of mine worked there last year and he implemented this algorithm which could actually listen to music and tell you whether you would like it or not or in the case of Amazon that would be amazon has nalgon which reads the books and then tells you if you would like it or not because how these algorithms work now it's just like you buy this book I know somebody else who bought this book and he also bought this book maybe you will like this book as well but you will agree that doesn't work very super well now so we're getting there this is slowly getting there I like Spotify is one of the first to do it and I think Amazon if it's one year or so and they will also do it intelligence the grass or stutter I wrote back asia and goodell he said that intelligence is the capacity to to distinguish similarities between difference & 2 to find a difference between similarities of course yes yeah I know it's a really confusing book it's a nice book about system and how to be not to be trapped how to be free of systems the beginning of the books is very nice this we the logical system of m.e and when it's how to escape from a system that's the freedom of individual yeah but in are you able to escape your own body or you're able to leave your body here and walk outside no so you're not intelligent but it's like that the Baron of miniatures and you want to to cross a river and this the tricky found is to take himself by air there belgium so that's that's that's perfect let's play 3d there i agree a sport three and it's a team possibly like I largely disagree with identity with the book completely that I get so yeah a very bad as finishing stuff thank you yeah so what I think about art because you didn't ask what is the earth actually and my conviction is at its for big part chains by chains we decide it is good because there was kind of evens who happened and we could decide that something else is art and he with this system not to show we are far enough actually to have really something who can be considered as as good art as it is at the moment so the only from in my opinion the only big difference we stick there between artificial intelligence and normal intelligence for art is consciousness and you didn't speak about that because implicitly well you are saying where when there will be enough intelligence there will be conscience to this but we are not sure about that and yeah maybe well consciousness is such a troubled term is like yeah I I know I'm conscience but are you conscious you can never convince me that you are and so I rather not use it not for you not for these algorithms because it doesn't make any sense in my head and yeah dude do you need to have conscience to create art I don't know like Picasso could never convince me he had conscious so it cannot be necessary for him to have conscious to create art this is my point of view but this is very philosophical how do you explain you you get these colors ah how do you explain is so this is fake who I was at a conference and December and on the topic of neural networks and I met this guy no not him personally but his girlfriend and this guy does research on and London I think and what he does is he takes human lab rats he gives them LSD and he puts thin and MRI scanners and he does research and why LSD works the way it works right and how does LSD work it works by if your neurons communicate with each other yeah they will start communicating even more when you're under LSD and so the effect will keep on increasing so if you think you see a cat somewhere or not even conscience you your brain figures i have this looks like at it or start looking more and more and more like a cat yeah what this does is in fact actually the same just to have an artificial neural network so when you take an image and you say now it needs to be look more like a terrier dog so what this will do is it will look which of my neurons are firing and then once you are fighting fire up even more until this actually looks like a terrier dog so that's why it looks as colorful as it does yep first humans because it works in the same way as LSD works for our brain but this is like this is my hypothesis we you haven't tested it yeah so you spoke about this long term hypothesis about machines that can create media instantly upon line after giving them some parameters like which of course I as you say would change a human culture drastically right imagine the oscars and but you also spoke about less less trivial less trivial uses like and how farfetch would be to think about the machine that you can ask it to to design an and uncreate another machine that otherwise it can do this and this yeah yeah it's those are indeed very difficult questions and and I think it it will always come down to the same problem is when will you can you design like a pest which will tell you like this is a machine which makes decisions and this is a machine which does not and it's always the same trouble you will have like in a Turing test like when you say like humans can make decisions and and then you make your test and humans will be very bad distinguish in your machine from your actual human and yes yeah so what does it mean to make a decision and you need to define this before you can answer and to this to design and public eye to to produce another machine a device not a machine or device that can use you say I want a machine that does this this and this like you know like the movie I want a science fiction movie with Donald blah blah so you ask them to create some other some other machine yeah okay so that's what you can do is like like probably i think that the moment we can do this is when we ask machines okay now machine try to act as human as you can and that's the moment when the machines will start doing this if you explain and they will just try to imitate us and by doing that we will be convinced that they are doing the same stuff video I think that will be like the crossing light but this is future technology so I don't know for sure maybe there's another trick or something they can use then you could say that the machine is acting right that it's not truly making decisions but how do I know you are not acting this is always the same problem yeah that's aw yeah philosophically I take a very functional approach to what makes conscience like its width x conscience it's probably as I don't care about details maybe one last question no I'm not sure it's really questioned just wanted to say something because what you showed here is everything he's based on picture where a kid is small like two years old you know toddler or something like that when you asked him what is a cat he would say cat makes me out so what I wanted to say is that human is based on experience not on the Tory tackle picture and what if it will be possible to implement experience for the machine for the other senses than the visualization of something yeah what about you know smell sound okay sounds we have it for Spotify okay I get it but what about touch what about emotional intelligence which which might be also implemented chatbot with Ellis 10 Turkish the there are lots of people thinking that way and now I think like my I showed you my robot right my robot is learning how to walk based on falling like it's trippin trippin trippin it falls at learn tension due to do that again and in robotics a lot of people are convinced that that's the way to go is like you you need to put a machine which we would call a robot so you need to put a robot into this world and have it experience or world in order to become truly intelligent and it might be the way to go and I think might be one of the reasons Google is also investing in robots the way they do yeah also the reason why we do mainly images and this is a pirate looks nice is that image is apparently or easier than sounds so we are still like I showed you we can generate playlists that we can do but we cannot generate music yet that still sounds like noise unless you want to like make course we can make I say I'm sorry yeah yeah but they don't make sounds as such they they just put some notes next to each other they don't make the sounds have you like that's one of the girls currently research is to get an algorithm who creates sound so cranes the sound wave itself and not just two notes we're not there yet and sound is more difficult and images in this sense yeah so I think that's all for tonight if you want to ask more question you can do it at the bar I have please and take a candy also so thank you very much thank you for our attention what is there to say here we have the next Stevens if you want to go in March your project there sometimes and then yeah I have a good evening and thank you you
