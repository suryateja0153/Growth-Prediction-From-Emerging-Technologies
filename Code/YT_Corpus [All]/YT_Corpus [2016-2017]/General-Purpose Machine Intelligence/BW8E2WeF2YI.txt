 The biggest thing to happen recently was Google's DeepMind startup, which is located in London, and it uses a variation of deep learning. And basically what they've done is they've trained a system to learn to play video games, and then very rapidly, become superhuman at that and blow away any human competitor. And the latest big news was that they built a system that could beat the best Go player in the world, and Go is the ancient game that you see in Asia, in countries like Japan and Korea and so forth, that is more complex than chess. It's really quite a staggering achievement that they were able to build a machine that could learn to play that game and then beat the best player in the world. This is the general-purpose technology; you're building machine learning and you can apply that to any kind of data. So this is a technology that's going to scale across everything. I think that what's going to happen in the future is that as these technologies develop, the tools and the building blocks for building systems based on these technologies are going to become more and more available and easier to use. So what you're going to see is that basically anything out there that's on some level routine and repetitive, in any industry, any type of job, doesn't matter where it is, some entrepreneur or developer somewhere will see that opportunity, and will utilize all these tools to very rapidly build a system that can be applied in that area. What we're talking about here, at least in the near term, is not building this general, artificial intelligence that can do anything. Really, what it's going to be about is building potentially an almost infinite number of very specific systems that can do specific things based on this very scalable, general-purpose technology that's being developed.
