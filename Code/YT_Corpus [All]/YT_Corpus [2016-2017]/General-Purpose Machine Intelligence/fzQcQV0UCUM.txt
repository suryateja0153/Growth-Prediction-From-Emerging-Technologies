 hello everyone welcome back to the course I'm Sami Kalra from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur and this lecture is about introduction to Android platform so in this lecture we will be talking about what is Android what makes it so special for running on mobile devices and then what all features it is having what is the security model what is the app model so let's begin so what is operating system it allows to manage hardware resources shares them between different hardware's so we have been seeing lots of operating systems running on desktop laptop which includes Windows 7 machan Ubuntu but for mobile devices we have additional sensors like we have touch screen we have cellular functionality like calling SMS so we have location management such as Global Positioning System and then we have more communication protocols like Near Field Communication and Bluetooth and then we have sensors these sensors vary from microphone to camera to accelerometer and lot more so mobile operating system needs to support all these additional devices so Android is such kind of operating system which runs on mobile devices and it supports all these additional drivers so what is entered it's a software stack and main components are operating system middleware and key applications so operating system is Linux kernel which supports the hardware libraries which allows us to interface with hardware's and communicate with them and then in Middle where we have application framework which allows to develop applications and then there is a runtime environment which allows to execute those applications then we have applications running on deep framework and operating system which includes phone contacts browsers and many more little bit about Android history so Open Handset Alliance it is founded in 2007 out of 47 NEADS currently this consortium have 84 companies so goal is to develop open standards for mobile devices what do mean by open standards so we have multiple mobile devices with varying capability so goal is to develop a common operating system which can support all these variable devices capabilities so in this consortium we have various companies or Wiley operators over the phone we have semiconductor companies like Intel and media we have software companies like eBay Google we haven't said manufacturers like Samsung LG Toshiba and there are many more commercial companies like Nasser so goal is to have open philosophy for developing a common platform to run on all these variable mobile devices so why Android so if we look at current market of Android there are more than 1 billion active devices and the rate is increasing with more than 1 million daily activations of new devices so idea behind open philosophies to have open access to all the features of Android so Android is open source so it means we can download Android code modify it and recompile it use it then from user perspective also we have a final control over their experience so user can control their experience and they can install any number of applications and uninstall them so they can extend the functionality of basic Android platform as per they need them from developer perspective also we do not need any permission and license for developing and delivering the applications so Android founded in 2007 and since then we have till know many versions so started from Android 1.0 to Android 5.0 and if we look at the the emergence names like Android then beta came then cupcake donut Eclair Froyo gingerbread honeycomb Ice Cream Sandwich jelly bean KitKat and lollipop interesting thing about all these was names are that they are named after some desert and they are in alphabetically-ordered so lollipop is the latest version having all these various versions what is the update process from previous version to next version Google releases the Android version and these versions are ready to use for flagship devices of Google comes under the tag google nexus and for other manufacturers like Samsung Toshiba LG they need to configure the newer version further their devices and for their manufacturer applications so for older devices manufacturers may not give the updates very soon because the priority for manufacture is the releasing new devices not supporting the older devices why it's necessary to know update process of Android because if we want to have access of latest features of Android we should go for flagship devices so let's look at Android architecture which is layered bottom layer is Linus kernel which provides access to hardware drivers like Wi-Fi drivers camera display and many more then we have libraries which are general-purpose like SSL secure socket layer then we have sequel I'd database we have WebKit open source web browser engine we have Android runtime dalvik virtual machine which provides the runtime environment for the applications so Android runtime is the enhanced version of dalvik virtual machine in newer Android versions Android runtime replaces dalvik virtual machines then we have application framework consists of activity manager which is responsible for handling lifecycle of activities like opening them closing them then we have window manager which is responsible for transition between Windows animation and what to display and how to display and then we have location manager which is responsible for providing services related to locations and updates then we have applications which runs on application framework like contacts browser for anymore from the programming language prospectives what a most layer is written in C libraries are written in C C++ application framework written in Java and applications are also returning Java so applications are varying from contacts to browsers to phone so let's look at the applications in more detail and direct applications mainly known as apps we can compare the application model with the web in web model we do not need to install any applications on our operating system we just use the web browser and run those applications example is Microsoft Office versus Google Docs Google Docs is a web browser application we do not need to install anything to use the Google Docs but using Microsoft Office we first need to install the Microsoft Office on a operating system similarly with apps we need to install them on our operating system and there are more than 1.4 million apps and these vary from different fields like gaming Angry Birds educational applications like duolingo for learning languages then we have social networking applications like Facebook Twitter and some utilities like maps all apps are equal and they run in sandbox environment so these applications do not interfere with each other so they cannot impact the performance of each other so it's separate out the concern of security from having interference from other applications where do we get all these applications so we have some online repositories of applications like Google Play imagine a pistol for Android and third-party repositories like Android patent getjar these opposed it is very in sense they have different review process some repositories provide application support for different operating system not only for Android like Apple iOS and Windows Mobile's the largest repository is the Google Play which consists of 1.4 million apps and till now we have more than 50 billion downloads so now we will look at the security aspect of Android so if we look at the our current this marks devices we have sensitive informations like we have files on our device we have called data we have contacts we have our location history and we have pictures and many other private documents so there are 100 plus permissions provided by Android and these permissions are need to be granted explicitly from the user for any applications to use them they sensitive information so in summary we have looked at the Android how it's different from that traditional operating system and what is the architecture of Android what all the main components and what is the update process of various versions of Android and what is the application model and security model thank you
