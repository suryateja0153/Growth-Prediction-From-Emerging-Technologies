 but biggest events and the failures of the memory success specifically some ways this has some resin I am a robotics researcher and today I would like to share with you some of my thoughts about the topic robots that learned from us before we talk about robotics I'd like to start with the humans I am a mother of a son two year old boy it's very interesting for me to observe the process of his development and how he interacts with the world including people and robots he's now a source of my inspiration for my research in robotics let's think about the process of how human line motions when we learn new sport maybe we usually follow the three steps first we learn basic skills movements with the help of the coach so under special codes then we practice this skill in order to improve or to and to optimize that and further these learned skills can be further expanded to the more complex scenarios one approach to to learning under supervision is imitation learning imitation learning is an interesting topic for different disciplines including neuroscience psychology control engineering and robotics and it is very nice approach it's easy for the teacher to teach something just by showing it in a very natural way a student can learn the general concepts or so very easily I applied this idea to Robert here we can see a general users can't program or humanoid robots even if they are not experts in robotics or computer programming with but we apply different approaches for the different humanoid robots here and you can see a human rubber can imitate humans motions a pre-party motion and lower body motion in real time and also you can see a cat imitate lifting a food or so economy pet walking behavior as well in contrast to the most of humanoid robot walk with tantony our robots can also imitate with knees trust in the stress of me working as well however there is a side effect you can see from this movie actually so even I didn't intend to the my robot to imitate every single of movement she can even imitate my coughing as well actually transfer motions from one person to the other person is not always a straightforward humans have different body structure and body properties as well the same applies to robots robots have different kinematics and dynamics and this leads to another approach to learning under supervision so-called kinesthetic teaching this is basically dissolving the problem of how we map one person's motion to the other person so this is correspondence problem and in this case student doesn't have to care about this correspondence problem because a teacher does and this is a very good approach for Robert because it makes robust job easier since human will take care of this unhappy problem with a human's brain so we put a lot of cognitive load to the human's brain side yeah however there is a one down side human can teach maybe only one part of the body like one arm this heart for the robot to learn about synchronized whole body motion especially when you think about very many many degrees of freedom robots so we proposed approach incremental learning approach based on combination of imitation learning and kinesthetic teaching with this idea I tried to talk a robot the famous perfection dance Irish as a first step I showed these are perfection dance to a robot as an expert although I'm not good at dancing at all so anyway he tries to imitate my behavior as a first system and then here you see the robots initially learned motion is not perfect and was too high so it is that okay I want to show him another way using the physical coaching so I just go and then pull out put down the robots hand to the height of the eyes and this new demonstration goes into the incremental learning approach and then it looks and now here is the results of this so you can see it's a very intuitive way for a general user to program robots just show it and then another demonstration very good but what is next after this is for us learning interesting about the learning is the effect afterwards one thing is about is a generalization once we learn some motions we can reproduce them again and again and we're so we can generalize them in a different context and new situations actually there has been a lot of research contribution in robotic robot learning community in this area generalization the under a fact about the after learning as recognition so here is the markers attach the owner human body can you tell what human pose is what the action is it's hard right so if we watch this a lot of bunch of dots here as a movie yeah then you could actually realized humans motion so human is running in a circle and also we could tell that we're humans configuration is we could really see the humans pose roughly and this is actually called biological movements in psychology and then we could also apply this idea basically when we do not have which image information we could use some movement information like to the optical floor information in order to recognize and reconstruct humans more here is a research of the reconstruction of 56 degrees of freedom of human body shown in blue and for the comparison purpose the ground truth is shown in magenta color and you can see we could reconstruct the motion in a reasonably well even from the only limited information like a 2d of the good floor so after this provision res provides learning however there are some tasks which are hard to learn only from the supervision of teacher for example walking and use of chopsticks most kids most babies take their first steps around between nine and twelve months and they walk very well by the time when they are 14 or 15 months old I think I may be started I eat with chopsticks when I was around 5 and I mastered this much later and some of people never mastered is the fine motor skills in their lifetime so we know that we need some practice for some challenging tasks this is actually correspond to the reinforcement learning in machine learning community however most reinforcement learning algorithms requires hundreds or thousands trials even for relatively simple tasks however this might be unrealistic for some of robotics application like bipedal walking most of humanoid robots are rigid and they are not designed against many faults when I see this movie robbed a falling movie from the dark for robotic challenge this year I cannot have say out it reminds me of something few years ago we demonstrated our research at automatic car which is the one of the biggest robotics fairs in Germany my student was a confidently saying to the other colleagues that the producer of the robot had performed falling test and robot past few minutes later our small humanoid robot now fell from the table and it broke his neck and we had to stop our demos so we decided to go for a less painful way for our robot and for us so we proposed online trial and error learning approach for the robots here by using some existing knowledge and in order to improve robots walking stability the algorithm showed great resort so here we see the error of center of pressure which is a well-used measure for the stability has been reduced by about 55% and this video shows the algorithms performance against unknown disturbances so as you can see compare our approach works better compared to a node learning case so we went through two steps of our learning and now can we scale that learnt whooshes to different scenarios like interacting with another people other people like interaction in order to motivate this maybe you might heard of the movie called Terminator in the Terminator 2 there is a interesting scene that a boy teach terminator interesting physical humor Robin traction so let's see it's different when there's nothing wrong with you but you're in anyway no problemo give me five I like it fun all right now hit me give me five okay so here you see how the boy teaches The Terminator give me five physical interaction is in a very simple way basically following imitation learning paradigm first boy shows this motion and ask Domino to imitate this to put out the hand and then he shows how to react to that right which is the interaction and then he puts out hands again ask the terminal to imitate that reaction we can summarize the four important issues of the learning physical human robot interaction imitating ones motion and understanding motion primitives and understanding interaction rules and stabilizing an appropriate contact that to heart right you shouldn't hit too hard so we avoid this idea a humanoid robot in Japan robot has learned 12 motion primitives and eight interaction primitives when it interacts with the human it use the motion primitives and interaction primitives it hasn't learned before so it recognized what human is doing and interpret what human want to do what kind of interaction what to do based on that it generates is the reaction strategy the numbers on the monitor basically say that the identified interaction primitives and you can also see our rubber also makes the contact appropriately although my hand motion might be enough differently you know it's always a very and also he doesn't hit me too hard similarly the motion learning can be expanded to human rubber cooperation like sharing a table with a human and raba together okay I dare his incremental learning and prediction what the partner is gonna do in the future so as learning goes robot gets better understanding about the task and it can predict what the partner is about to do in the future based on the prediction it can become more proactive to the task we applied this idea on our robot and experiment research shows that the as learning proceeds the prediction error goes down and this prediction enabled increase of the robots company contribution and decrease of the humans burden when we turn off robot assistance based on the prediction again human force goes back to the original value which means robot is contributing to disk having a table task so when we compare machines with humans machines nowadays are superior to humans in terms of computational power and precision of execution however my two-year-old boy work maybe is more capable than my robot even after 11 years of my research in terms of robustness to the uncertainties and adaptation to new situations although it has not been discovered how our brain works our learning mechanisms seem to be our crucial key that's why I would like to build robots that learn from and I strongly believe this will lead us to our entry intuitive robots which can coexist with us thank you
