financial services retail and manufacturing clients again thank you for participating in today's webinar at this time I'd like to introduce Jeremy and Laney thanks Travis hello and welcome everybody to today's webinar appreciate you all being on the webinar looks like we've got a good audience today so very excited to talk with you why are we here is probably a question that we need to address right off the bat and why is this an important topic leveraging machine learning for early case assessment and I'd like to start off with a little bit of data that really explains why this is such an important concept and why we're here you'll see on your screen these data points but I'll read them real briefly 6.3 billion dollars in total losses twenty-three percent of cases causing losses of a million dollars or more and obviously with that the average would be a bit skewed so we'll look at the median loss per case and we see that it's a hundred and fifty thousand dollars medium loss per case he may be trying to wonder okay what exactly is that what are those represent los weyes they are not data breach losses and they are not identity theft losses in fact these are losses attributed to just internal frauds as reported in the association of Certified Fraud examiner's 2016 report to the nation's so not only are these internal fraud losses but this is over just a two-year window so it's a very small window of time to accumulate these losses what's more if you think about it only those losses that are reported by fraud examiners are included in these totals and also only those frauds that have been investigated and the cases have been complete or included so really the losses as it relates to fraud are far greater than what you see on your screen here and if we think about all of the other frogs that are out there and the other types of investigations in cases that you may be handling related to losses this number is very very small as it relates to the grand scope of things which makes it all the more impressive because these are big numbers to start with this is a pretty big problem just here alone let alone all of the other types of frauds and other cases that may be out there so while this is internal fraud what exactly does that mean really it works down into three different types of frauds financial statement frauds asset misappropriation and corruption being the three categories that the acfe uses to categorize the frauds it's interesting if you consider that then this actually happens across all types of industries so we have a variety of frauds and we have a variety of industries represented you can see here what are the most common industries that are hit by frauds we see banking and financial services up near the top followed closely by government I'm manufacturing but really all industries are hit we see religious organizations on here arts entertainment recreation communication real estate insurance oil and gas there's a variety of items that are on here a variety of industries that are represented and while there are a variety of industries represented and there are a variety of fraud schemes within the industries one thing that we know that holds true regardless of the industry and regardless of the screen of the scheme is the fraud triangle and this is what's really important in early case assessment we know that the fraud triangle theory says that for fraud to occur three things must exist we must have a perceived pressure on an individual a perceived opportunity to commit a fraud and also somebody must be able to rationalize the fact that they're about to commit fraud that inherently people don't wake up saying yeah i'm going to go commit fraud today that sounds like a pretty good monday that's not the way that most people are really programmed that it has to change at a point and once that changes we now have all three legs and fraud has occurred now an early case assessment the fraud has occurred that's why we have a case that's why we're out there investigating this so that is already there what we need to now think about is how can we get back to the edges of the fraud triangle and how can we determine that all three of these things existed so how can we determine the person you know it was facing a pressure whether or not it was real or not if they perceived it to be a pressure it's real enough here how can we identify those opportunities and how can we identify when they're rationalization changed and really to do that we have to start looking at data that's outside the traditional area that we start looking at data and that's where machine learning is going to come in very very important to identify the frauds themselves many times data has already been used data analytics has been used to identify those anomalies in transactional data but the pressures and the rationalization are going to be found elsewhere they're going to be found in email communications instant messages social media data you know traditionally people talked about their pressures around the water cooler now the water cooler is ritual and the communications are virtual but they're still data out there which means we have an opportunity to leverage that data machine learning is what's going to help us leverage that data so we can identify as we're looking back at okay this fraud has occurred where can we identify a pressure that existed in our organization six months ago 12 months ago 18 months ago two years ago wherever that may have been where can we identify the opportunities that may have existed in access settings who has access to various elements of the financials various elements of the building maybe it's building access parking garage access inventory access what have you there are a lot of different opportunities out there as well and we can start to identify those using the data and again machine learning is really what's going to help if I these patterns and identify the elements of the fraud triangle and when they came together to allow this fraud to occur who had the elements of the fraud triangle how can we get out there early on in the case and figure out where do we focus in our efforts and machine learning is it's really going to help us with that and to do that I'm going to bring in Lainey morrow and Lainey I'd like to get your thoughts a little bit more on the different data sources as it relates to the fraud triangle and then some more information on just exactly how machine learning can help us in this regard yeah absolutely in thanks Jeremy and I've already visit the arms of the fraud triangle throughout the talk as it not only applies to fraud but basically all forms of decisions and behaviors they can be really useful in this early case assessment process and in the investigative framework in general in very unique ways now I see that we have a mix of litigators and investigators law enforcement prosecutors and even some internal counsel and risk management types on the call today so we have a pretty diverse group so I'll start off by defining what early case assessment or ECA is and while there are a lot of parts of that process that we're not going to talk about I at the corn we're talking about activities that are designed to assess risks and costs of pursuing litigation or an investigation now I believe that investigate or litigation eca activities in the process of beginning and investigation are really very similar it's all about very early on in the process getting your arms around the issues in play and making decisions about the next course of action what to take so we're going to use machine learning a branch of artificial intelligence to help with that process and really there it's centered around four primary benefits in that area for one machines do do one thing better than us and that's crunch data and so that's exactly what we're going to let it do we're going to let it crunch a bunch of data in an investigation or a litigation for the sole purpose of helping reduce time reduce costs it's also going to help us reduce air machines are very consistent they don't have imaginations they don't very very much and so when they're properly programmed they're going to run through the same every time and that dramatically reduces error we're going to talk a little bit more about that later as well they can also help find insights that are too deeply buried or subtle to be reasonably detected at the manual level we're going to be talking about vast amounts of data and we're going to talk about what that data is here in a second but it's too much data to reasonably go through within the budget or the time constraints of a litigation or investigation so they're going to help us find some of those insights and also from especially from a litigation standpoint something that's very comforting because it is a machine it's an algorithm it's software that runs consistently that's going to give us the comfort of a consistent statistical foundation for the decisions that we make and the ability to defend those on down the road as well now there's been an increased focus on textual content and litigations or what we call unstructured data and you can see some of the different types of the textual data here we have email social media content documents unstructured data is growing far more rapidly than structured which is more numeric financial type data dramatically as the graph shows in fact at this point between eighty and ninety percent of all the information in the world is in this unstructured or textual form being unstructured also means that it's not in a predictable location it's not occurring the same way every time and so we need a very special class of tools to help us get up around that so these are the various facets of machine learning that we're going to cover today and machine learning is really not magic it's just a class of software that's very adept at recognizing patterns and can be taught by us what those patterns are and what to recognize and so through machine learning we can teach it to recognize emotions extract themes even find documents buried within that massive data that we're looking at that we might not be able to efficiently go through so we're just excuse me so we're going to start with predictive coding and predictive coding is essentially using artificial intelligence to help us find relevant content and large collections of data like email social media and documents one of the primary motivators for using predictive coding is based on this 2011 RAND Corporation study on how humans review documents and I won't read the whole thing you can see in red the areas that I want to highlight we humans exhibit significant inconsistency when we examine documents over a long period of time and a lot of documents and we do tend to make mistakes and that's fine we are human after all we have limited attention spans we do have lives outside of our work that we want to go and pursue and through this predictive coding process that I'm going to explain to you we're going to let the Machine set there in the evenings and on weekends and overnight and do some of this work for us and help us out and help us reduce some of that air that's inherent with tired eyes the all-too-human concept of chasing rabbit holes that may not actually be relevant to a case but they seem interesting or seem like they may be machines are going to help us stay on point in that regard so a basic description of the predictive coding process and first I'm going to give you the scientific formal process that you're used to seeing in a lot of litigation environments I'm going to get a kind of backtrack and tell you my thoughts on that process and what I consider a better best practice to be when using predictive coding machine learning in the eca process in this process we first start with a random sample of documents and I'll explain later why that random sample is important but basically the AI tool is going to go through and just select certain emails documents social media posts lead thrown at the investigation team who's going to look at that initial set and decide what those items are relevant or not just two answers or one is zero yes or no it's relevant or it's not those are going to get fed back to the AI that's then I'm going to do something very similar to a Google find more like this search it's going to go out and based on concepts not keywords look for similar content to return once it's retrieved those items it's going to send them back to the investigators who are going to review those and say yes you did a good job on this one I agree it's relevant or no this one's not and that process is going to continue until no more relevant items are found which usually takes several passes but working together humans and machines you very rapidly find all the relevant content in a case now a little bit deeper under the head into the technology of how that works let's talk a little bit about this random sampling concept and hardcore litigation at the core random sampling will protect against bias in the next slide I'm going to talk about some best practices and indicate that that may in the early case assessment or investigation phase not be such a big deal but that's a theory on why it works the initial random selection protects you from any kind of bias hey I does learn from initial items that are marked as relevant and then as it goes through all the documents that hasn't seen yet it assigns a probability based on what I've learned about what is relevant this document has a ninety percent probability of being relevant so I'm going to flag it worse another one is an eight percent probability I'm not going to flag that one so that's how that works there's a true scientific process behind that that governs it we won't get into a lot of that here and also to point out that the AI compares decisions of the investigators and the attorneys against what come to understand about the documents that and can retrain itself it even incorporates in some of the better systems a gaming component that isn't will intentionally and on its own select documents that it doesn't feel like a really relevant but it wants to show you those anyway because it may be really close to the threshold of what it determines to be relevant or it may be really far away but by peppering the responsive set of documents back to you with that are kind of false-positive they're not really relevant and it knows it but it wants to trick you into thinking that it thinks they are it watches how you respond to that so if you look at a document that's been determined by it to be seventy percent relevant and the AI sub percent relevant but then you say it's not it gives that the opportunity to retrain itself or to continuously learn from you and that's a very powerful feature is that it's constantly learning and relearning and watching our decisions and refining what it does and also to point out this process is keyword independent as a digital forensics examiner back and then 90s and early 2000s keywords dominated everything you use keywords to get an initial foothold and in this case the AI machine learning tool is actually looking for underlying concepts and not hard keywords which is also a very powerful reach now to throw out a little bit of what i consider best practices for ECA or for the investigative process I agree that random selection is becoming less popular in fact there's a person who blogs a lot in this area an attorney named Ralph losi who came up with the lost keys analogy which I like and the analogy goes that if you've lost your keys in your house and you're trying to go to work in the morning not many people will take 50 locations around their house and write those down on a piece of paper and throw them in a bucket and randomly pull out ten locations to go look for the keys rather you go with what you know you think I normally leave them on the end table but they're not there previous experience tells me that I leave them in my pants pocket from the night before or yesterday I remember that instead of going in through the front door I walked around back because I heard the kids playing in the pool I set at the table on the deck for a while then I went inside the kitchen and made a sandwich and sure enough there are the keys on the kitchen counter where you lay them that's a far more effective way of looking for those keys and similar to litigation and investigations starting out with stuff you know keywords party names specifics of the case that you already know and feeding that kind of relevant content that you've already found into the machine learning tools I believe is a much faster more effective way and so to me that's the best practice on how to handle that here let's talk a bit about the real magic of predictive coding I think there's a lot of popular press out there about this class of tools that they can help you find that smoking gun and that tends to be the emphasis I think there's a current popular article entitled something like how how we can let robots win your next case and will that health smoking gun when the case stuff is kind of dramatic and appealing and that's not the real magic of this class of tools and machine learning the real magic is something more practical like for instance 85 to 90 percent reduction in the amount of stuff you have to review and under showing you the 85 to 90 percent number because that's what's been currently published and I can cite in our experience here at bkd in cases involving what sometimes can amount up to millions of emails and social media posts and documents I've hardly ever seen a case where more than 2% of the overall content actually has any kind of relevance directly or tangentially and so that's a ninety-eight percent reduction as far as I'm concerned and when you equate that back to the benefits of machine learning the time cost of the savings the time and money cost savings that's a really dramatic benefit also again comforting every part of the process is documentable and repeatable it's statistically validated it's a computer program that's running and so if you have to defend some of the decisions you made or some of the findings it's easily retrace of and repeatable which is always very important in a litigation environment and I feel that it's excellent in this early case assessment investigations phase for rapid identification of materials very quickly and again it reduces inherent human error so the results do tend to be more accurate that ran study indicated so Jeremy it looks like we're ready for our first polling question all right it appears as though the majority of participants are not using machine learning though we do have a few that have used predictive coding or machine learning for early case assessment so that is good to see I think this isn't necessarily all that surprising now would you agree Lani yeah absolutely i'm i'm actually encouraged to see that there were some people that we're using it it's still a very new concept to use machine learning and artificial intelligence sometimes not altogether a comfortable concept again i expect to see that grow over time but given that it's a relatively recent in my recent i mean in the last few years concept it's still taking some time to percolate through as well so that doesn't surprise me as well there's a great answers ok so let's explore some of these other facets of machine learning and how it can help we've already looked at predictive coding and now we're going to look at something called emotion detection and this is where we're going to take machine learning tools and teach them how to recognize different kinds of emotions and emotional states and again when you're reviewing email and social media that's enormously important because these days is Jeremy alluded to people don't talk around the water cooler as much as they talk around the digital water cooler through their Twitter their instant messaging text messaging and email and so the ability to pick up emotional content in written material is extraordinarily important probably one of the most powerful features of using machine learning in this eca or investigative process the ability to detect that emotion goes beyond the typical adjectives and phrases and idioms that you would expect it can include slaying emoticons or emojis punctuation your various forms of sarcasm and metaphors you know the people who lay on the keyboard ! when they want to get a point across or people who tend to use all caps all of those are ways of expressing emotions and machines can be taught to recognize those and draw those out now in an early case assessment or an investigative fans we want to automatically identify and focus on the more strong type of content the more emotionally charged content certainly in a motion detection you can find exuberance and happiness and joy unfortunately in the litigation investigations environment we tend to deal with more the darker side of human emotions and what motivates and drives people thinking back to that fraud triangle and so these are some of the categories and then we're going to focus on and be more interested in and these are all of them but these are the categories we primarily focus on investigations anger and frustration anxiety and tension vague evasive and conspiratorial all together those tones really appear a lot in financial statement fraud good ol boy networks kind of conflict of interest conspiracy level type events in litigation and investigations yes there's even an intimacy tone that's actually does have some use in domestic relations cases and family law although the way we use it it's actually a smaller subset of a larger set of emotion detection an area of harassment and so you can actually pick up on emails and communications within an organization where somebody is engaging in discussions with another employee that may be deemed to be harassing so from that vein you invest really use some of these before an incident even pops for you investigators internal counsel risk management types on presentation you can actually actively monitor email and pluck out some of these risk or danger areas where somebody is communicating with somebody in a demeaning or harassing manner and maybe get that yet before it blows up into a full-blown incident or investigation that could cost a lot of money and reputational harm not just to the organization but to the affected individual and get that situation taken care of more efficiently so very powerful by way of a quick example and I told you we'd like to focus on the big evasive and conspiratorial type tones especially in fraud and in criminal matters in this case if you chart that out by persons of interest you come up with some interesting insights that can immediately let you dive in and find which people to depose or to interview or to get answers from in this case in a department in a city government engaging in kind of a criminal conspiracy together we see that Rick and Brian have the highest percentage of tones of this big evasive and conspiratorial tones we determine this before we ever read a single email which is particularly powerful you don't have to read any emails to get these initial insights Rick and Brian did end up being heavily involved in this case as it indicated drilling into those emails that were driving that vague evasive conspiratorial tones made it very easy to get an idea what they were talking about people tend to forget that even though the organization owns the email and there is no right to privacy in most cases it become such a casual common way to communicate that people tend to forget that and Rick and Brian were very open about their communication just a side note Milton well he might seem to have been the third spoke in that wheel was actually not involved at all dis from reading his communications it became very apparent that he felt that shows like The X Files and ancient aliens for a reality TV and his entire life was a walking conspiracy theory so he was what we called a false positive also to show that this stuff is not absolutely perfect and thinking out who the criminals are and I don't you think that high bars on a chart is indicative of that Jane actually ended up being the ringleader of the entire event the entire criminal act and yet she had one of the lowest vague evasive conspiratorial type tone she was very emotional as an emotional type communicator and so how do we found Jane well under interview and depositions through Rick and Brian they were very happy to rat her out when pressed and so nice to know that outside of machine learning the traditional process still works just as well also now going back to the fraud triangle discussion when we're talking about emotional states the front triangle oftentimes works at the individual level we like to talk about the individuals pressure and their personal struggle as they rationalize to jump into their crime and then we'll looking for that perceived opportunity well this chart shows we like to look at emotions by department within an organization as well for instance in the slide you see finance and HR maintenance administration sales and purchasing or the department's we looked at the red bars indicating more of the heavier anger tense anxious nervous type tones and the orange bars more the Vega base of conspiratorial tones so you see that there's something worth looking into in the finance department and in the sales department and so you can drill right into that but we like to consider the fraud triangle in the various aspects at this departmental level because well it's very powerful individually if you think about what a department is its collective wisdom that's collective behavior and so if you're in a department where you're under pressure like in sales to make the numbers we have this month in sales goal or taking a lot of criticism here you know we're gonna get a lot of trouble people are going to lose their jobs then you don't have that individual pressure anymore you have a collective departmental pressure with a toes that culturally at the top and so now that pressure isn't just individual its collective the rationalization becomes easier because it's not an individual rationalizing their crime it's an entire department that are feeding off of each other we deserve it we work so hard I think we can do this and whatever we replaces I it becomes a lot easier to get that collective madness of the crowds type thing going and that point then since you're operating one of the triangle is the reason we lit just turned so easily because everybody's pressure and everybody's reservation is fed off of each other and that opportunity is actually set from the top down and it's totally institutional I and that's why the fraud triangle so important at that institutional and departmental level it's also which is what we're looking at in these grafts here since you know who's sending and receiving it you also know what department they're assigned to you so you can pick it out like that you can also look at it by various staff levels so the graphs at the bottom you can see staff to staff communications or upper management better upper to middle and we see that a lot especially in cases of financial statement fraud or some type of a fraud that's perpetuated and encouraged either directly or indirectly from the top down we see the staff level people and they communicate with each other or extraordinarily frustrated and worried and upset about it when you go to the upper to upper cut communication though it tends to take on more of that evasive they conspiratorial type taught a type talk and this is stuff that you can find from looking at the Enron email sets as well and analyzing those which are publicly available so comparing emotional states at this level is very powerful from an organizational perspective as well and again that takes us to polling question number two Jeremy alright thanks Lani polling question number two I consider using machine learning to enhance early case assessment to be either frightening you wouldn't use it potentially beneficial for cost savings a competitive advantage if use the disadvantage of the future of early case assessment or not sure now we've talked through the predictive coding and emotional detection components at this point so curious to see how people are viewing machine learning as it relates to early case assessment at this point in the process give you just a few more seconds to go ahead and answer the polling question it looks like nobody is frightened so that's very good to see very very glad to see that I think the future of ECA is starting to gain some traction but it's one where people do realize it looks like here eleni that most people realize there's there's a potential benefit looks like kind of focusing on that efficiency standpoint probably relates back to the that reduction and effort on the predictive coding side and some think that it was that competitive advantage and I think as we work through the rest of this may be a few will a few more may agree with that so Lainey I will get your thoughts here yeah absolutely and I was actually encouraged to see that one of the and nobody answered on the frightening side and that was great because in previous presentations and when I talk about this which I do a lot it seems that that a lot of people are frightened by it and they're like okay this is a passing fad let's not use that so it's very encouraging to see but you know there's some recognition of the potential benefit and the competitive advantage because I do agree with that as well well we're just going to continue our trip then and I'm glad that nobody's frightened so maybe you'll find the remainder of this enjoyable we're going to move on to the next set of facets which is actually three of them that tend to work together and these are relationship networks or social relationship analysis and that pretty starfield that you're seeing is actually what an organization looks like when you accumulate all of their email T's and from together you can see that some people communicate more heavily than others but overall this is what the digital great line or the digital communication or information exchange network looks like in an organization and all that is from a social analysis standpoint very fascinating there's also some very practical uses in litigation and investigation as well if you were to dive in just by way of a super simple example to that complex chart and you might find situations like this where tom has recently left the organization there's some evidence through his social media email that he had been invited to lunch by an agent from the competitor an officer another salesman a recruiter from a competitor and sure enough when he left the company or the organization he went and joined them by looking at the organizational dynamics then you not only see dick Tom get an email from this competitor agent bit so to Julia Tom left and is now working for the competitor julia is still there Tom and Julia were connected they communicated regularly and she's the only other person in the organization that's been contacted by the competitor may give you some insights into what to look into next and how to act next so this relationship analysis is very powerful we're going to spend a little bit of time talking about that in more detail let's start with Tom and Tom is not an island as it appears here we're going to slowly grow a limited set of his relationship network and find that he's a loan officer and this is National Bank case that occurred he's the employee of Jerry who's the president of the Bank he makes loans to various properties in the various people as this relationship of how people are related grows it becomes more interesting you actually get to the point now where some unsettling things start to appear like for instance through interviewing others and the research during the investigation we find that Don and Frank who are business partners are very wealthy very influential but very bad people and the fact that Jerry and Don Jerry being the bank president or best friends is even more concerning and you start to see this very tight-knit web of relationships Jerry's daughter Melinda actually has a financial stake in eagle creek properties which tom has lent to tom ken the appraiser tends to appraise all these properties that appear kind of suspicious and that everybody in this very tight clustered buddy network has a hand in and go in the right direction here we start to see convergences then and Twin Pines was one of the properties where a lot of these folks converged without knowing anything else but looking at the graph you would think that that would be a property you would want to look at for some kind of financial impropriety it wasn't the only one just Omar showing for illustration purposes here Twin Pines was a multi-million dollar development project under construction there were actually pictures in the loan file of the property and various stages of completion and it was supposed to be about eighty percent complete yet when one of our field examiners went out and physically visited the property they found it to be an empty lot and this was actually a straw borrowing or a fictitious lending situation where the money was actually diverted to some of these actors that you see in this relationship map oftentimes they would use that money to pay off the principal and interest from other loans and basically keep getting these ever spiralling loans that were never intended to be paid they would just take out new loans completely trumped-up in order to pay those off and the picture is interestingly enough in the loan file we actually digitize the and did a search for those on the internet and found that those were two stock photos of construction projects which is very interesting as well but that a diluted bank examiners for a number of years was an interesting finding and that's how relationship analysis works sometimes you can get insights from looking at how people are related who they're talking to and about what now how does machine learning come into this because some of the early relationship maps that were drawn on investigations are really just end by hand on the back of a piece of paper and later with relationship mapping tools machine learning can help us a lot because they know so much about the structure of our language that they can detect and extract the names of people places and dates out of email and when you think about what email is it's unstructured data it's not going to be in a predictable place all the time there's not a field an email where you need to list out all the people you're going to talk about in the message body the message body is the data and the ability to pluck that information out and then plotted on a map is enormously important and machine learning can help us do that it can also perform relationship math which we're going to look at an example of because we don't want to look at those big star fields all day if you think back to that first picture I showed you that would take a lot of time to go through those point by point looking for those relationships and so the machine learning is going to go in and assign some quantitative mathematical values to certain types of relationships and that's very powerful because that way we don't have to stare at the pretty graphs all day all day although that sometimes fun too so taking an example here of network math if we look at Anthony he has obvious important implications because he connects the green group and the blue group together without him those two groups wouldn't communicate so by extension Anthony is what we call an information broker he's a very important person between two parties that otherwise wouldn't be connected and if you actually delve into some of this relationship math and look at the middle set of highlighted boxes Anthony has what we call very high between the centrality that is he is connected to people as a bridge in between them and because of that he's a very high value subject for perhaps an interview or an interrogation or deposition in a large organization Shana is a very connected very important individuals therefore she has what we call a very high I convector centrality which means importance of her connections she's not only important herself but she's connected to other people who are very well connected oftentimes in an organization that's pretty obvious those are like your c-suite types and what isn't so obvious oftentimes is people like Anthony who is that bridge often times we find that those people that have that higher between the centrality are administrative assistants are lower level staff type people that just because of their position happen to fall into that information broker standpoint we also find in investigations and litigation that the smartest people in the room quote unquote and in this case a highly influential person like Shawn a lawyer up very quickly and you don't get a lot out of them however if you can identify through this relationship mapping somebody like an Anthony that observes everything like a fly on the wall information flows through them you can get a lot of information about the sean is the world through them and so that's how that's very powerful and it takes us to our third polling question Jeremy thanks planning polling question number three is artificial intelligence based systems will help reduce the volume of matters that go to litigation do you strongly agree agree disagree strongly disagree or unsure as we're talking through a lot of these different systems there is a preventative aspect to this as well which I know Elena is going to get into here in just a bit but curious to see what level you think this will help reduce as far as matters that end up going to litigation looks like the majority of the audience agrees we've got a few that strongly agree and fair amount that not sure yet still debating as to whether or not that will happen so landing what are your thoughts on artificial intelligence systems helping reduce what goes to litigation I tend to agree with a majority on the on the results and not just because I do this stuff and design these systems but because it appears that that's that's something that's already working and in place that these I based systems are helping make decisions to maybe settle matters before they go to litigation and that might be a bit of semantics and the question you know sometimes the early case assessment phase is that even though it is a pre-litigation environment is oftentimes considered to be a litigation type activity and definitely within the realm of corporate risk management internal counsel using it a lot of items to basically ferry ferret out the frauds and the misdeeds ahead of time kind of finding those before they blow up into litigation is certainly happening so perhaps at the law firm level and there may not be as much data yet to show that these am bae systems or helping things not go to litigation and but we're certainly seeing that a lot of the organizational corporate level so those answers aren't surprising and good answers okay let's move on to the final piece then that we're going to talk about related to machine learning in the various facets an investigation in any CA and that's topic extraction the idea behind topic distraction is that it rolls up underlying concepts and keywords into these overriding larger topics and that's very powerful because again before you read a single communication document or email you can get a flavor for the overall topics the overall themes that are being discussed it's a matter of reducing the very complex to the very simple and just a very simple visual word cloud you can see what an entire department or two individuals or an entire organization is engaged in talking about and that makes it very powerful I really like social media and email also and it's oftentimes one of the more underplayed type attributes of those forms of communication but they're datetime oriented all emails all social media communications have dates and times associated and so we're allowed to go back in time and see how these topics and emotions are evolving over time here's an example of the topic extraction or a topic map this was actually done in tandem with an investigation related to financial statement fraud and what we're seeing here is a word cloud or a concept cloud of all the emails that they exchange back and forth discussing now in a healthy finance department you might find things like balance and reconcile and we're forwarding but in this case looking at the overarching topics and again this isn't a word map of commonly occurring words these are topics where a bunch of different words that all have the same meaning but different words were rolled a lot into an overarching topic and that's always something concerning one in the finance and accounting department and in the c-suite of an organization you see words like shortfall creative struggle monkeys very interesting because when the machine learning tools doesn't know the word well enough to know that it rolls up into something else it leaves that word as its own topic in that case we had a controller who whenever he was asked by his staff how to handle a certain situation or that something wasn't balancing or it wasn't coming out with and his email with disco monkey with the numbers it's no monkey with it a little bit and come back and tell me what you found and he actually became his own topic because they use that terminology so much which was interesting this powerful again like I said with emotions because once you detect the emotion you don't necessarily need to be at that level yet where you've read emails this can actually happen pre-reading the email phase and then what this simple as a double click in some systems you can click on the word struggle and dive into those emails and who's saying what and that makes it very powerful under the head here subtopic extraction works if you were to talk about the topic of the car there might be different ways of expressing that without using the term car and you could be talking about a component of it like tires or engines or something that the car goes into or onto like garage or parking lot and where the machine learning comes into play is taking all the different modes of expression around a certain word or a certain topic and roll those up into the topic so you're not sitting there looking at a massive list of words that people use in emails you're looking at more succinct simple topics and that's how that works so let's tie all this together then and see how it works together the question might arise okay which of these facets do i use when and the answer is they do stand alone individually but also collectively they work together very powerfully let me show you a couple of dashboards or how that works here we're looking at a motion detection network analysis together this is the same graph that i showed you before so we won't jump into those but the fact that we're actually looking at the emotions department by department and at what employment level but then also the ability to tie that into network analysis with the same color coding scheme so drilling in we can now see who's saying who to what how they're connected within the organization and that's really powerful a way to tie that all together another area is reputation risk monitoring which is certainly pre-litigation maybe even pre investigation when we see a lot of cases where an entity's reputation suffers their brand rumors about them a certain event a lot of times those are initiated by activist groups these groups these days not happy with the organization or the entity and they're sometimes even initiated by competitors and so the ability to kind of dashboard these underlying emotions that are being expressed how are they proliferating who's retweeting these is it getting liked a lot and reposted to where this bad message about your organization is now proliferating where is the source of it coming from and again back to network analysis who's the person or persons generating that and oftentimes you'll find with an activist movement and a reputation risk situation they collectively get together to trash the reputation or to get bad press out about an organization and yet by looking at their social network express through their own Twitter feeds or through their own Facebook posts you see that they're very tightly related this may be more of an isolated incident so that's how it all ties together and that brings us to our final polling question all right our fourth polling question social media and communications data is key to early case assessment looking to see if you agree disagree or are unsure on that so if you'll take a moment to please answer our fourth and final polling question I know Laney and I are both very very keen on social media and communications data for a number of firm number of applications not just within the context as to what we've talked about here but quite a few different applications so curious to get your thoughts on early case assessment use of social media and communications looks like the vast majority eighty-five percent agree a few disagree in a few still still undecided on that I know that well you know I've worked on a case Lani where an individual actually posted on Facebook mid case that they expected to be arrested so I thought that the social media was working pretty well there that wasn't necessarily early case that was mid case but a interesting to see what people will post out there what are your thoughts on using this early on in the case yeah absolutely and that's certainly a good dramatic example to how that works oftentimes you have to go a little deeper and kind of make some inferences from that but just about every investigation litigation we work on social media and email communications really helps and if you think back to that fraud triangle and the various arms especially with a fraud you're not going to find evidence of that fraud percolating in the idea of it forming in financial data that only shows up then when it's already manifested itself but in litigation matters and in financial fraud type matters the ability to get into the person's thoughts and what they're thinking is expressed through social media and their emails is very powerful so I'm going to wrap up here before we open it up to take questions and what Jeremy kind of take us home with some thoughts with just a comment on preventive litigation and of course the area preventive litigation includes things like arbitration and mediation but using machine learning technologies and some of these newer less traditional data sources can be very powerful they can actually help prevent litigations when used in a risk management or an internal legal counsel using these types of tools these types of methodologies can actually identify some of those pressures and rationalizations that are occurring in that fraud triangle and in some cases predict before a crime actually happens that it's going to happen or at least mitigate it early on and so to throw that thought out that these are very powerful tools to use an area preventive litigation and of course and Jeremy and thinking about this stuff it's very new data it requires kind of a new mindset as well to get comfortable using that right it really does traditional you know this isn't what a lot of organizations are used to using from a data standpoint and one of the biggest things that seems to really catch people's attention and really get them concerned is really what we're focused on and I think it's important to read it right here that you know we're not focusing even when talking about preventative this is not designed to go in and read somebody's personal emails and all their detailed communications we're really looking to analyze the patterns as Lanie pointed out and some of the dashboards and the graphics it's really patterns of communication patterns of emotion and the trends and how those patterns evolve over time it's not necessarily going and looking for the word monkey and an email and reading the email it's looking to see when did the word monkey become normal an email and then going in and saying okay now we have to figure out what caused that and you know does that indicate something else is going on if it's an early case assessment that maybe if we have a financial statement fraud those are the the patterns that we're looking to you know to own in on those red flags they may not be the smoking gun but it tells us who to look at and where to look within and again it's really it's focused in on the patterns and the trends not the specific reading of people's email over and over though that may come at some point in the case as well another thing that we need to address or some of the challenges that we have to overcome obviously each organization is going to be different what are their policies around data ownership or their policies around data use is lying alluded to a lot of organizations it's in their policy that all employees sign that any email that's you know that they send on on the corporate email system belongs to the corporation and you know that they own it still yet and obviously talking with a group of attorneys the legal implications or something you all are going to be more familiar with than most but it's important to keep those considerations in mind as well as the underlying ethical considerations even an early case assessment say we have a fraud that's going on when we go back and we start to look for those individuals that have pressures they have the opportunities and you know we're looking for that rationalization it's important to note that that just gives us the place to start looking simply finding patterns and train and trends that indicate this person has the three legs of the criteria of the fraud triangle it doesn't necessarily mean that they are the one that still committed a fraud in fact Lainey and I spoke at a conference last week and an individual came up to us afterward and said you know a couple years back both my parents or my dad had died my mom was really sick and I was having some other issues and you know I bet if my organization was looking at this or if something had gone on and they went back and looked at my email I would have been flagged and it's important to note that that doesn't necessarily mean that that individual committed committed a fraud so we have to consider imbalance the ethical considerations which I know is something that we could probably go into a whole nother hour on which we're not going to so hopefully that doesn't concern anybody that I said that really what I would challenge you to do and challenge we challenge organizations to do as it relates to the case for why we should be using machine learning is we really need to reframe how we consider these communications how we reframe social media and all of this data if we really think about it our email is used to transact the company's business that's why the company gave us an email account is so we can transact a company's business they gave us a laptop or a phone or a tablet or whatever device they gave you so we could transact the business of the company those assets are used for that and anytime that were transacting business and we're sending an email or communication really that should be treated as a business transaction it was using corporate assets in order to transact the business of the company which means that we were completing a business transaction when we start to think about things as business transactions it becomes a lot more comfortable to start analyzing that data machine learning is what we're really going to need to start analyzing those business transactions especially an early case assessment and threw out an investigation or prevented of life cycle but it's important to start reframing that and as you're talking with organizations that you all work with and those that are in internal council the more that we can get folks comfortable with the fact that these are business transactions they're not necessarily just email that that doesn't that isn't considered a business transaction the more that we can reframe that the more success that we're going to have of the adoption of machine learning and a lot of these technologies as it relates to early case assessment with that we're going to open it up to questions and answers just as a quick reminder if you do have a question that you'd like to ask please do so using the question in the questions tab on your GoToWebinar toolbar any of the questions that aren't answer here within the scope of the webinar the presenters Lani and I we will get answers back out to you if you'll simply have we have your email address we'll get those answered for you so Lani we've had quite a few questions come in and a lot of these I think are going to be in your area of expertise so I'd like to just go ahead and start with a couple of these questions is there a certain size of organization or a number of employees where you think that you applying the principles of machine learning makes the most sense well certainly it can apply to just about any size now if you have an organization that's just a small handful of employees you know 10 15 20 it may not be the best fit but then again if that 10 or 15 or 20 are a traveling workforce traveling salesman people that are decentralized to where the leadership doesn't necessarily know what's going on out in the outposts using the technologies would actually make sense there now certainly up at the mid and large size level where you basically lose touch you know with you don't know how many employees you have you've never personally met them all for instance you know that's absolutely a good case but even if the smaller end again in a more decentralized type of environment you a lot of people work from home these days or don't even have a set business location they're kind of spread throughout the country and you tend to lose track a little bit and so the ability to use these tools do hell they're very efficient tools to use and so there really isn't a huge fixed cost component to using them so they do apply to the small organization level as well when appropriate thank you very much we have a couple other questions one of the couple here I'm going to kind of combine them which goes into the the availability of the software for machine learning and what is the typical cost of using machine learning I would say that that tends to vary depending on the type of tools that you use first of all there's a lot of interest in machine learning these days and so you're seeing a glut in the market from a lot of vendors that are selling the tools for self-service or offering the service as well and mileage kind of varies on those some aspects are widely available for instance predictive coding is something that they let a discovery tool relativity can do I think they use the model where the person is not allowed to actually do it themselves it's a premium service that they handle themselves other areas like social network analysis and certainly emotion detection are very limited right now because a lot of people haven't come into the market that actually do that or have have developed that yet so availabilities kind of all up and down the scale in terms of all the components being available and some of those can be quite costly and in others it's it's feared to be more efficient effective so I guess just do your research on it very good thank you landing at this time we are going to wrap it up and we do have a few questions that were left an answer we will follow up with those individuals after the webinar via email and those answers will also send out to the group so as a conclusion as a reminder don't forget to register for the remaining sessions in our spring semester at bkd calm / forensics institute next week's course topic is cyber security investigations planning and best practices followed by our last course on May eleventh the science of business value associates who attend all three sessions of the forensics Institute will receive a Starbucks gift card from bkt thanks again for attending our webinar and have a great day
