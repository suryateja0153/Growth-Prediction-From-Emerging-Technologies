 all right greetings in hello everybody my name is Davis Monroe I'm Kaylen Bruce and today what we discussed the multi-systemic therapy for used with adolescents experiencing antisocial conduct disorder spectrum of problems MST is a systems approach way of Willian therapy in which you don't work with the client individually they keep doing a lot of other therapies instead you work with a family system and every aspect of their environment from the ground up for example MST you will go and you will speak to the individual you will speak to the family will speak to the school will speak to any social service system that they're currently involved with and you will even get into their peer groups the main goal is to put in as much therapy in every level of the environment so that it generalizes well and helps resolve problems of every at every level for every day when providing MST there's a lot of avenues that individuals can take to employ your services sometimes you'll get them through the juvenile justice system and they're talking through the school system sometimes the parents will just be concerned enough to bring the children themselves regardless of the way this happens there's a couple things you need to know about the population you're working with a lot of the individuals who suffer from things from symptomology so long an oppositional defiant conduct disorder antisocial personality and disorder spectrum and behaviors is they share a lot of commonalities in their - most of them come from low socioeconomic status they usually didn't complete much school most times they they come from a broken home a lot of the times there will be abuse that is present in the house of the child sometimes will be substance use disorders happening with the child or with the parents regardless of what's going on a lot of the times there is a lots of lack of structure analyzed there's no remodel presence to teach them how to be a socially acceptable individual and exhibit behaviors that don't get them into trouble by breaking the norm because there's no guidance for role models in these kids life a lot of other times they can get into trouble with things that might be just their way of filling time sometimes when the kids are out there vandalizing property getting in fights other things along this nature it's just because it's it's ways they can hang out with their friends they can do something that they think is cool without an adult figure present so that's probably not a good idea you just go along they just go on about their behavior with no consequences until they're picked up by the police or something along that nature sometimes the behavior exhibited by the youth will be ways of gate garnering attention from their parental figures if they come from a large home when there's a lot of siblings that are fighting over attention sometimes breaking into the neighbor's house is all it takes to get mom and dad to pay a little bit more attention to you and a little bit less attention to your younger brother we're looking at it this way it's very easy to see that these are healthy children that have good adaptive skills or just being used in the wrong way mostly because they haven't been guided the correct path of a socially acceptable all right so I'm gonna be talking to you about the process of therapy using mystique with MST you what you'll have is it'll be a group of counselors clinicians social workers individuals of the sort usually be one case manager and three to five other clinicians involved with the matter what will happen as a case manager will look at the case as a whole and tibia responsibilities throughout the counselors one counselor is going to go and work on mom and dad one counselors can go work on the kiddo another counselors are going to go talk to the school it's happening so the entire process is happening simultaneously there's not we have to fix this and we have to fix this we have to fix this it's implementing change in all levels at once that way there's no real fight back from any one source of the individuals environments so in MST what will happen since you're working with the system is you are going to take the whole family and and you're going to kind of do an assessment over the family process usually if children experiencing content disorder antisocial personality disorder oppositional defiant disorder any flavor of these diagnoses if you will there seems to be an issue within the child's life the child was not a bad child the child is not stupid it's not wrong it's not broken the fact of the matter is the child is actually functioning the best it possibly can in an environment that's broken although its behavior seems maladaptive the child is actually adapting the only possible way to sustain life in scranton condition because of this what you need to do is you need to look at all the aspects of the environment that are breeding these maladaptive behaviors that are causing these problems to circumvent so when you're looking at the maladaptive behaviors or the problem behaviors the areas of interest you're going to try and trace it back to a source for example if you have a fourteen-year-old kid that's giving it fights at school just staying out late skipping and fights being drunk with his friends you know all problematic behaviors for a 14 year old to have what you might do is you might start look at the start by looking at the family system maybe you notice that mom and dad aren't getting along so great their marriage is on the rocks they're falling apart the only way that the two of them ever unite is to discipline their child maybe the child is not necessarily a bad kid maybe he's not doing all these bad things because wants to more or less because he's trying to find something to keep mom and dad together in this way the maladaptive behavior that we're seeing is actually a highly adaptive behavior that's trying to preserve his way of life and the most in the safest fashion imaginable so when you look at a problem like that PC there's an issue with mom and with dad maybe mom stays out too late drinking maybe dad has a gambling problem regardless of the issue or in the context the problems can still exist outside the identified patient the child with conduct disorder so what we're going to do is we're going to take a step backward look at that environment we're gonna find areas in which we can intervene that will help change come all the way down through the system so you're working in the system maybe let's take dad for example as part of the problem the system let's say dad has a drinking problem and we relate his drinking back to a problem with depression that he has so the first step of the therapy process is sitting at the environment for the child would be to work on downstream we get down to a healthy to a healthy state to be the stereotypical responsible parent that we're expecting that the child needs as a role model in their life then we'll see the dad can implement changes that will have long lasting effects on the child when the parenting style changes maybe the behavior will change through that we'll be delivering things like CBT through cognitive Authority structuring maybe some behavioral activation just anything we can to get dad's behavior to change and to get the depression to dissipate from these system a lot of times what you'll do is you'll make a real contract with the child and the parents the behavioral contract is basically there to state that the child will not commit behaviors a B C or D and if they don't they will be rewarded with a meter C basically it's just a way that there's public permanent product that everybody has agreed to all the rules are made everybody knows exactly what's gonna happen there's no surprises left in the system dad and mom can't get mad at the kid if he's doing exactly what he was supposed to do if he breaks the rules however he has to face the consequences they turn on beforehand once behavioral contract is in place then we can start to implement changes on the child's behavior in such a way that will help reduce some of the problems he's having in social interactions another important part of the treatment process is looking at peer relations in the child a lot of the times when you take a child in for counseling services what will happen is you can do a lot of work and get a lot of change but it's only going to be within the context of the laboratory of the clinicians office or in the home setting there's no generalizability mostly because the kid can get out of the house get back around his friends and go back to his old ways the friends being a bad source they might be just like he is they might be acting in a similar way and because nobody's trying to manipulate their behavior trying to change their behavior there's nothing you can really do in order to decrease it so instead of decreasing their behavior the intention then becomes to get child away from the problematic situation one common step that people delivering MST services usually engage in is to enroll the children and recreational activities this takes up a lot of their free time where they might have been out roaming the streets with their friends getting into trouble now they're in a structured environment it's providing all the structure and guidance that they need in order to exhibit behaviors in a more along the social norm and a lot of these times you can get them just playing sports you can get them involved in volunteer opportunities just involved in the activity in order to keep an eye on these and still provide the structure that they need to thrive I'm going to talk about the nine core treatment principles within MST these nine core treatment principles are the key to guide treatment planning because the clinical problems that you face within MST there needs to be flexibility within the design and delivery of the interventions MST therapists are to adhere to the nine core treatment principles high adherence to these treatment principles equals favorable long-term outcomes for violent chronic juvenile offenders poor adherence predicts high rates of REO in incorrect car serrations in chronic juvenile offenders that are seen within MST's these nine core treatment principles help the therapists to identify the problem effectively treat the problem by coming up with interventions that are suitable to the child to the family into all systems that the problem behavior affects it also helps the therapist and the child to come over come up with overarching goals and then intermediate goals that are to be met weekly these goals help the therapist and child track progress and helps the child realize that they're making progress and is this supports them in a positive way it keeps them wanting to strive and get better within the system's context within MST the child is embedded with multiple interconnected systems these systems are family extended family social network of friends school neighborhood the juvenile juvenile justice and child welfare system and also other mental health systems when assessing and identifying problems the clinician has to consider the reciprocal and the bi-directional nature of the influences between the youth and each system that the behavior affects for the treatment to be effective the risk factors across these systems must be identified in addressed this is done by using these nine core principles especially in the first principle of finding the fit which helps you identify the problem and effectively look at solutions to how we're going to come up with interventions to address the problem I'm going to talk about some conceptual assumptions within MST one conceptual assumption is all youths antisocial behavior is affected by every system and level of the use life another assumption that MST makes is that all interventions assess and address potential potential risk factors in a comprehensive and individualized way focusing clinical attention on developing the caregivers ability to parent effectively and strengthening the family's support system treatment gains are more likely to be maintained MST incorporates empirically based treatments this might include CBT behavior therapies behavioral parent training pragmatic Family Therapy and certain pharmacological interventions that have reasonable evidence base because MST views the caregiver as the key to achieving long-term clinical outcomes the interventions would be delivered by the caregiver with consultation of the therapist this allows for the most effective treatment and allows for change to take hold in a more natural setting within MST treatment fidelity is needed to achieve desired outcomes within the therapy itself and the last conceptual assumption is that MST has intensive Quality Assurance protocols built into the program these include training and monitoring components principle one is finding the fit the primary purpose of assessment is to find out what's going on in that child's world and why the behavior is occurring this is done through the first principle of MST the therapist child and caregiver together identify problems and their broader systemic context and how identified problems make sense within every system of the child's life an example of finding the fit could be a teen who's been smoking marijuana now this is a behavior that's been caused by something so let's say the marijuana smoking was because there's no parental boundaries well then there's no parental boundaries because mom has two or three jobs and it isn't home to enforce those parental boundaries so marijuana smoking and no parental boundaries leads the youth to hanging out with peers who abuse drugs to these peer relations leads to having trouble in school and skipping classes with friends which this leads to eventually getting in trouble with law enforcement the second principle within MST is positive and strength focused within this principle therapists emphasize what the youth or the families are doing well emphasizing the child or youths and the family streaks gives them empowers them and has many advantages these advantages are it decreases negative effect builds feelings of hope identifies protective factors decreases frustration by emphasizing problem-solving enhances caregivers confidence an example of this would be that your family has a good support system or the child or youth family has a good support system of extended family or maybe within their neighborhood they have some reliable neighbors that could help them out and and help them out with things that they need and problems in situations that might arise within their life the third principle with an MST is increasing the responsibility interventions within this principle promote responsible behavior and give the youth a sense of ownership while also decreasing irresponsibly hey irresponsible behavior among family members an example of this could be maybe one of the parents is undermining the other parents ways of setting boundaries and applying consequences to the youths behavior and the parent points this out with the help of the therapist to show the other parent how this is irresponsible the fourth principle is present focus action-oriented and well-defined present focus is when the therapist is trying to help the youth realize that what happens now is a central point within the therapy process problems are defined specifically so that anyone would be able to know what the problem was and how it has affected the other systems within the youths life this allows treatment participants to measure progress of treatment and provide clear criteria for criteria for goals to be met it allows family members to work towards goals versus gaining insight or focusing on the past clear goals delineate criteria criteria for treatment termination the fifth principle is targeting sequences within this principle interventions target sequences of behavior within and between systems that maintain identified behavior so basically the therapist is helping the client are helping the youth and caregivers identify behaviors that affect multiple systems within the life of the youth within this principle treatment is aimed at changing family interactions that promote responsible behavior and help with pro-social support systems the sixth principle is developmentally appropriate within this principle a developmental emphasis is building youth competencies in peer relations acquiring academic skills and vocational skills this will help the youth in turn have a more successful life and be ready for adulthood once that time comes because the youth has gained these new skills it decreases the likelihood of riah rests because there is no reason for them to go out into partaken maladaptive behaviors when they are successful people who have newfound skills that help them cope with behaviors that they couldn't cope with before the seventh principle is continuous effort interventions within this principle are designed to initiate and engage the family and youth and require daily and weekly participation there are some advantages to intensive and multifaceted efforts to change these advantages are more rapid problem resolution earlier identification of treatment non adherence continuous evaluation of outcomes more frequent corrective interventions more opportunities to experience success and family empowerment as members coordinate their own changes the eighth principle is evaluation and accountability intervention effectiveness is continually monitored from multiple perspectives the MST team assumes accountability to overcome barriers to treatment MST therapists do not label families as resistant not ready to change or unmotivated to avoid placing blame on the family this places the responsibility for positive treatment outcomes on the MST team the ninth and final principle of MST is generalization interventions are designed to promote treatment effectiveness across all areas of the youths life this generalization and long-term maintenance is the key to maintaining the therapeutic change this is done by empowering caregivers to address family members needs across multiple systems and context within the whole system of MST within MST the caregiver is viewed as the key long-term success the caregivers are the ones who make most of the changes within MST with the therapists just guiding them and acting as consultants advisors and advocates to guide the family members through the process of change interventions are designed to be consistent with the nine core principles of MST to be empirically based when possible and to emphasize behavior change in the natural in the natural environment empowering caregivers and youth engagement and assessment begin with meeting family and youth to explain the MST philosophies and principles the therapist is more closely aligned with caregivers than the youth and this is seen as a critical process within therapy this is seen as critical because in all reality the caregiver is going to be the one who is engaging the youth in the interventions with the therapists just being there as a guide each family member tells their perspective of the problems and their goals for treatment the therapist gathers information that is obtained about the family other people that might be living within the home extended family family supports and quality of important relationships that the family has guided by this information the therapist meets with other agencies and individuals and organizations to gain their perspective about problem behaviors that might be happening or going on within that context the therapist meets with these organizations and individuals to gain their perspective of the behavior each system is evaluated for strengths and weaknesses and is incorporated into the treatment plan hypotheses are then generated that might concern factors that facilitate goal achievement barriers to progress and that might maintain negative behaviors then these are tested and established as the baseline for intervention the MST therapist chooses specific parenting interventions with the help of the MST supervisor and the expert consultant the assessment of the fit of the particular problem to be addressed and the process of implementation are seen as pivotal points within this process in a supportive and non blaming way MST therapists praise positive aspects of parenting while they also identify current parenting practices that might need to be changed and benefit everybody within the system when looking at interventions within the context of peers the therapist looks at the peer relations that involves that are involving the youth they do this by interviewing caregivers school personnel siblings and they also observe the youth within this process the immensity therapists is looking for the number of quality relationships that the youth has built over time the therapist is also looking at the reputations of the peers the social and academic functioning of their peers and whether their peers respect their parents and caregivers alike and whether their peers have respect for others that are in a higher position like teachers and parents and how this might affect the youth in their context of life if it is found that the youth is associating with peers who have a negative effect on their life the therapist helps the parents or the caregiver address this problem in a non critical way and show the youth the possibility of the net of negative consequences that might be coming with these association with peers interventions that might be put into place would be system monitoring of the youth to know where they're at and to monitor the parents to know what is going on and where they're at and also might include adults who are in the caregivers life who are support systems to help monitor and check up on the youth when parents might be at work or when they're the youth is home alone to check up on them and see if they're there and see what they're doing this also includes if the peer is not able to be found these supportive peers of the family will be helping the parents maybe search where the teen hangs out where his social Lane is and the avenues and everywhere that he might be hanging out and might be found if the caregiver and the support system can't find the youth then there could be a possibility that the law enforcement gets involved to try to help and find the youth another intervention that might be used is not allowing the youth to have telephone conversations with these peers who are influences or bad influences on the child or on the youth this will help reduce contact with these antisocial peers and will help the youth and caregiver improve in the area of peer relations so within the school context the therapist is frequently helping develop and collaborate relationships between the youths caregivers and school personnel reasons for this is because a lot of times the therapists see that this relationship between caregiver and school personnel is fractured and stressed and there's a lot of conflict within this relationship so the therapists goal is to help this relationship out and to help the caregivers build trust with the personnel of the school to effectively help the youth eventually have a more positive school context when the therapist is doing this they need to remember to carefully assess the nature of the conflict and to know both sides of the conflict they need to know what parties are involved and they need to help establish trust within both parties the therapist often highlights common ground with a goal of setting collaboration with a goal of setting collaborative interaction between the school and caregivers these positive changes can help the youth avoid previous decisions that might affect the relationships of might affect the relationship of the caregiver and the school and it also will help with any perceived or any consequences or negative consequences that might come out of those negative behaviors that happen within the school context the therapist often makes arrangements in which the parent is responsible for studying up contingencies based on the youths behavior in school MST individually oriented interventions always occur in the context of a large systemic treatment these interventions can be considered or categorized as addressing continued or problematic behaviors after the implementation of systems interventions so within the systems if the problematic behavior is still occurring then the intervention goes on an individually based context within the individualized treatments a lot of times the family is needed to be addressed sometimes the mom and dad and have problems too and for a real change to happen within the youth the family problems need to be addressed so there's a stable environment for the youth to return to at home within these interventions that are specifically designed for the youth or the caregivers CBT is frequently used within this context because it's empirically supported for anxiety depression and externalizing conditions the evidence is relatively strong CBT is also consistent with MST in that it is present focused in action-oriented it's also individualized to the developmental level of the person receiving therapy CBT is also evaluated from multiple perspectives and it provides a skill that potentially is generalizable upon the finish of the therapy within the MSD sometimes the therapist is going to have to do or know about psychiatric interventions the therapist must be familiar with and able to recognize youth and adult conditions that may respond to psychiatric medications ADHD is comorbid with a lot of these disorders that the immensity therapist is confronted with within this population of kids they work with when ADHD is seen with conduct disorder this association is seen as more negative or within this association there's more negative outcomes than just conduct disorder or 88 or ADHD alone if the MST team fills that there are symptoms that are consistent with ADHD and these symptoms are interfering with goal achievement within the therapy process the MST therapists might need to think about possibly using some type of stimulant on a trial basis when this is done the MSD team and the therapists within this team need to realize that they might need to see child and adolescent psychiatrist who are systems oriented and who are well versed in empirically supported literature and research in treatments if the MST team decides to seek out a psychiatrist to help with these problems the therapists role within this is to have a positive working relationship with a psychiatrist and to be a support system for the youth and family to help them follow through with appointments and with medications there are several things that the therapist needs to consider when treating family and social supports and providing interventions within this context a major goal of MST is to develop and maintain social supports for the youth and family and this promotes sustainable treatment goals assessment of family social supports occurs during the assessment of other youth involved systems social supports can be characterized by the type of support it could be an instrumental support and emotional support appraisal and informational and also this is on a continuum ranging from informal to proximal relationships to more relationships that are distal then that also goes into professional relationships and then into even broader context of formal systems so for interventions within the family and social support the therapist the therapist preference is to develop more proximal and informal supports the reason for this is because these are more likely to be responsive accessible and maintained over time to maintain long term informal social supports families who receive support must reciprocate that support an example of this might be let's say you have a neighbor who you ask to check up on your son or daughter after school because this neighbor does this for you you in return once a week mow their lawn for them this is seen as their new out but you are also reciprocate reciprocating that and showing that by helping them out by mowing their lawn within MST treatment termination usually ends in one of two ways either the goals are met with mutual agreement between the therapist the family and all stakeholders that have a claim within the context of the child's life or the youths life that's one way the second way is usually that the goals are unmet and it has felt that treatment has reached a diminishing or reached a certain point where there's not going to be any return for the time invested in trying to give the youth and family interventions within MST approximately two-thirds of all MST cases in community settings end up being successful with this success it means that all stakeholders are in agreement that the therapy has had positive change within the life and the family has maintained those positive gains in the latter stages of MST it is spent preparing the youth and the family and all the stakeholders within the system for the withdrawal of the MST services this includes the eventual termination of the service and this is discussed openly with the family and everybody that's involved all the stakeholders with the therapist explaining and guiding in this area at the end at the end of treatment process every caregiver of confidence is highlighted and mechanisms for maintaining progress are discussed if the therapist or family feel like there might be a need for further surfaces the therapist refers the family to the appropriate place of where they can find help that will appropriately appropriately address the problem but within the MST termination process most MST therapists do not assume that the family is going to need further services beyond this 4 to 5 month process so thanks for stopping by watching her video today we hope you really enjoyed it and it was really informative about MST if you'd like to know more about MST just google MST you can find a lot of cool things online
