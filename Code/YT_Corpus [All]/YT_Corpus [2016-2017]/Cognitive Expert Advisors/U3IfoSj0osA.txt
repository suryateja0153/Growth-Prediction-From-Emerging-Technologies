 all right let's continue how to get trading discipline and before we start let's let's watch the traditional disclaimer information this webinar is provided for educational purposes only and by no means conserves the trade enoyed vestment applies risk of trading in financial markets can be substantial and you will have full responsibility for any of your trading decisions past performance is not a guarantee of future returns and the first question that I want to pay attention do is do you have an edge when trade is sometimes ask me how to develop discipline the first question that ask them is do you have an edge we have a special webinar of this topic that is available on YouTube Xmas channel it is named the traders edge how to develop a successful trading strategy or how to wean a trading marathon or something like that alright so do you have an edge first make sure that you have a trading edge that you have a statistical edges you have a successful trading system or a method that you believe in and if your method can't make you money if your method cannot respond to changing market conditions if your method is has no expected value discipline won't help you too many times traders think that their problems lie in the psychological field which is not necessarily so so first I would suggest that you test and evaluate your strategy and we have many winners on this topic for example the non-random way to trade part 1 the non-random way to trade part 2 how to trade breakouts and other other topics that might help you in this in and this India alright so do you have an edge well for example I have met a trader ones who were risking too much and he was trying to fix his psychological issues I have asked him what is your risk and he answered that his risk is 10% for a single position 10% of the gound for the single well that was absolutely insane and he had absolutely he had absolutely he has negative or losing maps beyond his trading and that's why he could not make any money you're not generating any profit and discipline will not help because if he was disciplined in trading such a plan well five losses and he's out of the market well that's why that's why I first want to make sure that trade has an edge when I work with traders all right the second thing that I want to know is where the traded is committed to his trading style too many times would take someone else's strategies trying to figure out how the market works or trying to earn more because we hear from time to time that scalping is very profitable or position trading is very profitable or I don't know maybe options trading is very profitable we hear it from many places from many traders and we might gravitate to one strategy or to them to another strategy but if it is not the strategy that is good or that fits our personal strands and our lifestyle we will not be able to follow this strategy for a long period of time and the first thing is commitment and too big to be committed to to your trading first you have to know that you have free enough free time to follow the market that is number one well uh too many traders try to day trade but to date successfully day trade you have to be in the market you have to be near the monitor during the most active hours of the trading session not too many traders have this time even if you have this time you might not be very active trader well it might not be a personal strength you might not process information that quickly that that is required for acting day trading and some trade is spent two or three years discovering different trading styles or wanting to know whether one trading style is good for them or not well I will recommend you to keep a journal to to listen to yourself to listen to your feelings to listen to your your response even to your body language make sure that your trading style fits your personal strengthen your lifestyle number two you don't feel bored and get enough stimulus for example some traders some Freitas think that if they make one trade a month it would be sufficient for generating profit of course Dara there are strategies that generate pretty rare trades for example position trading you can may you and have no more than one trade a month even if you have ten or fifteen trading instruments you can have no more than one trading month for many traders for many active traders stimulus is not enough when they when they follow the market and they are not in the market they feel bored and they lose commitment so you have to find the exact point where your where where the activeness of a trading strategy and your personal strengths come together when you get enough stimulus I don't don't move maybe you a scalper I don't know maybe you can make fifty trades a day well I know such traders that make fifty trades a day and still they are successful they don't make much money very much money but they the earn earn money and they are profitable after all and the third one you are interested in the pros is not in financial result if you have these three points you will have commitment if you have commitment to your trading style well we can talk about this woman because because when you are committed to your trading style you will you will have what it takes you will spend enough time to execute upon your strategy and after that you can work on your emotional issues on your execution you can work on issues because they will unnavigable it a beer in your trading so three points enough time or enough capital maybe two to follow the market or follow the strategy yon are feeling bored and get enough stimulus from your trading trading is interesting to you and you are interested in a puros is not in financial result there have been times in my career as a trader when I was not able to make any trades I didn't have account I was just paper trading you know making trades on a demo account or or just observing the market without without being involved without risking money on the market well trading was still it was still interesting for me and that's why it was some sort of a test I have identified that I am a trader because I'm interested in the pros it's not in financial result and after that financial results also also come by all right let's proceed let's talk about disciplined trader who is disciplined trader in my opinion first to be a disciplined trader you have to have four key points the first is knowing you emotional pain threshold what do I mean by emotional pain threshold for example when you risk too much when you lose too much money when you are unprepared to lose that amount of money you can cross your emotional pain threshold not too many traders think about that they think that alright I can trade on the $1,000 account and I can I can afford losing I don't know 30 or 40 dollars on a trade on ass on a single stop-loss so things would be things would be the same with the account of fifty thousand dollars but when they start to trade larger account they can lose for example I don't know they can lose one and a half thousand dollars in a single trade and they cross the emotional pain threshold because they see these numbers they see these numbers and they are absolutely unprepared to see such loss on the account so they cross the emotional ban threshold and that's the first thing the second thing is that when you lose maybe not too much money but too frequently it is also it is also the danger of crossing your emotional pain threshold for some trade is a series of five losses is is that totally stressful is absolutely frustrating for another trader it is okay to get series of ten losses for example in Buddha days of my career I was very uncomfortable with the losing more than 3 to 4 for 3 to 4 freedom than getting 3 to 4 losses in a row and that's why position trading long term position trading was worse what was not good for me because in position trade I have to I have to turn on a relatively smaller number of events I have I don't know 80% of losses small losses of course and 20% of profits and that's why I was unable to trade with position position trading strategy for now I am ok with small losses and good series of small losses my emotional pain threshold has become more robust more solid and others other strategies or different strategies I available to me for right now all right the second is commitment to the process we were talking about this so far and the third is observer state of mind what is observer state of mind we have to cultivate observer state of mind because because it is a state of mind where we can from from this state of mind we can really obtain self control our view on the market will be will be broad not narrow and we will be able to medical tournament is due to to make actions actions not in automatic mode but we will be flexible with fourth point is flexibility we have alternate ways of response it is really flexibility you might ask me how flexibility can mix with discipline and I will answer that flexibility is flexibility is the ability to switch between different ideas when you search for trading ideas when you analyze the market you have to have flexibility but when you are in position you have to have rigidness so your turn don't to risk manager from analyst or from even a trader you turn to risk manager you simply manage your position so flexibilities and flexibility is the quality work it is the characteristic that that is good for for the period of preparation for the period of analysis all right so four key points now let's talk about now let's talk about emotional banter short about the point number one well when intensity of stress increases substantially for example we lose very very much money in one trade or in one day and our emotional pain threshold is crossed we are losing self-control we are losing south of self-control and we are losing connection between our between our actions and our personal strengths well I don't know whether you are familiar or not with with training systems that require don't require no stop losses for example martingale expert advisors or so they are in small amounts of money very frequently they might have 95% rate of success they they earn there are very small amounts of money but but some day they lose I don't know 30 percent of the capital because because market market goes mad volatility increases substantially for example Fed comes with announcement or any other central bank and such traders experience really big losses really really big losses in a single day and that's why they continued to average losses they continue to buy even more and more and more market goes down they continue to buy more and more and more and they they can control themselves and intensity of stress is very big that's why such kind of strategies with with with very big frequency of winning trades and very big magnitude and of losing trades they are very dangerous very dangerous that's why I avoid any martingale and any martingale based strategies and I recommend to avoid any martingale based strategies to go to all traders alright so intensity of stress when we are crossing our emotional pain threshold we are no longer able to to sustain connection between our actions and personal strengths alright very good very good question we will we will talk about it a little bit later okay so of course we will have tools how to work in this dress we have tools all right for example we have patience is our personal strength right or we are good at recognizing patterns or we are good at rapid thinking and reacting for example a good scalpers while we are making good research and analysis when we cross our emotional emotional pain threshold we lose our connection we lose connection between between our actions and personal strands for example with we we start being impatient if we had patience before and we we fail at recognizing patterns we find really real bad trades we find really average and mediocre trades and our analysis starts starts to be very very very mediocre or very bad in some cases if we as we have been scalper twister we start overreacting over trading or and doing more and more and more trades that we have we were not expected to do or on the other hand we start trading defensively we avoid risk for example if we have to trade frequently in this case is reviewing we might we might freeze and and avoid trading that is a danger of that's the danger of cross the emotional pain threshold but what what if we are already in the drawdown inside a trading tilt I call it the position insider trading till the first phase the first phase that we are dealing with is denial is denial alt all problems are problems all issues with discipline start from denial when we have a losing trade when we move our stop loss it is denial we cannot fix the loss because we are not fixing the loss we are fixing our negative emotional state it is very important to understand we are not fixing a loss and we're not fixing a profit when we trade in emotional state of mind we are not fixing a profit we are fixing our our pleasant feelings and when we are not fixing a loss we are fixing our negative feelings and that's why we avoid doing that we deny at that but when our position becomes even more and more losses more and more money we start to feel an anger we start feeling anger right anger in the market or we say alright I will fight the market I will fight the market it's not going to capture my money no way I will I will sit in my position I will not let it to get my money all right it will get back inevitably and I will I will I will get it all back I don't know guys whether you are familiar with those states of mind but they are familiar with aviary there the every trade is familiar with those states of mind because I don't know maybe you are new to the markets or maybe you experienced traders if you and straightest you know you know that stuff all right here feeling anger the third one is bargaining we start bargaining the market all right please market come back to our way entry point we will I will not I will not execute such trade no way in the future we start we start asking the market to come back and and we we experience hope the feeling in this phase the phase number three is hope we hope that the market will get back we we are waiting for weekends because market is not trading in weekends and we are not losing money and weekends and finally we are coming to the phase of depression when we understand that the market will never come back and we have lost a lot of money when we have lost brave real big amount of money from our account we starts we fall into depression in the to depression phase depression phase is really uncomfortable in a pleasant phase because we feel we feel helplessness we can do anything to help our position we we cannot influence the market right and the number 5 is humility when we accept the loss to accept the loss we take a rest and we get rid of our position so that is a five step process denial anger bargaining depression and humility so the first theme that we have to know is that we have to avoid the phase number one denial it is very very important to avoid denial honesty is very important in trading why do we keep a journal because we want to know we want to be honest with ourselves we want to know whether we are experiencing or feeling feeling anxiety now or we are we are afraid of we are afraid of losing money now or or we we are we don't want to fix our negative emotional state so we have to very quickly very quickly recognize what is happening to us it is it is called self-awareness the self-awareness is possible in number one characteristic for trade because if we are self-aware if we have emotional intelligence if we know very quickly what's happening with us we will not we will not deny we will not deny and we will not make our position below as many little as much - all right what if we already in the face of a drawdown first thing to do is to halt our trading to stop our trading and to take press from trading or even withdraw our funds because for some trade is it is not enough to take the rest to take a two or three days arrest I know one trader who who had lost what lost very large amount of money previously he had lost around several several I don't know it was around around forty eight forty thousand euros well pretty large amount of mine and I suggested that he would he would take a rest he can't take an arrest and he was not trading for a period of three weeks he came to the market after this three weeks of rest and and and he hadn't lost him had lost even more money or I don't remember the exact amount but it was pretty large amount of money so his decision of his solution was to withdraw funds to train his skills on a simulator to train his skills on a simulator well this second secondly we have to leap through our pay for painful experience before we leave through our painful experience we should not we should not do anything and what do I mean by living through our painful experience so we stopped our trading then we start just journaling our thoughts our our I don't know fixing our emotional states we might we might do some exercises we might do some physical activities well in this face we should take a rest from the mark even not to look at the chart and number three only after that only after we stopped stopped our trading and we have come to the face of humility you guess that number point number two living through a painful experience is a phase of humility right so we are coming to the phase of humility it's the final phase of loss final phase of the loss only after this fifth point we can get rid of our loss we can come to the next level we can we we can make a trade in a fresh state of mind all right only after that we can analyze and make conclusions it's very difficult to analyze what is happening when you are inside of a trading tilt when you experienced experienced losses it is very very difficult to make analysis and make conclusions when you are when you have come to to the phase of humility when you are okay with your losses will you accept it the lessons that market has given you now you can make analysis now you're going to make conclusions now you can get your important experience out of your tilt well some traders never capture important experience out out of losses but I hope that you guys will will do that because because it's very important well really no nobody really learns on what one gains everybody learns and losses and I I will say to you that I have become very disciplined with risk management only after losing two accounts the first account was in was lost him in 2004 it was pretty small account not a big deal it was around several several hundreds of dollars and the second account was several thousands of dollars so it was larger larger account and it was money that I could not afford to lose at that time after losing the second account after entire listen of the second account I said to myself I will never ever let my account be lost in other words I will never let my drawdown achieve more than 30% of my account I have learned all the important lesson from from this loss all right I hope that you will you will do it as well but I am NOT saying that you should lose money on the market but if you will lose you will have to capture important experience all right what is the problem and what is the solution for trading discipline trade is to often think that performance depends on emotions that they have to eliminate emotions everyone talks about emotions emotions emotions and emotions we have to eliminate emotions we have to manage our emotions but I will tell you that our performance depends on our actions not on our emotions we can be very emotional we can even break keyboard we can even I don't know we can even cry out loud but if we do everything right if we if we not not bring this emotions to our trading it is free it is okay and I will tell you a story about George Soros you guys met me may know him as a large speculator who had been involved in in the British Pound crash in 1992 and everybody who were working with George Soros they know that he was he was feeling the pain even physically when his positions were losing money he experienced he experienced pain and the pain in the back and other pains he was he was not able to sleep to have a good sleep the pressure was enormous he mentioned that he was losing I don't now he was losing hundreds of millions of dollars in a single position of course he was experienced in emotions and other traders they also very emotional trade is in professional proprietary trading firms sometimes they can cry they're very nervous they can even break keyboards but but eventually they are good at doing the right things they do right actions well when you trade I don't know for what several years you are already are not so emotional but but the key here is to do the right actions to do the right actions all right so what does it mean that we do the right actions when we experience any emotional stay at state too often we do automatic automatic trading decisions we our responses on a magic it is it is a response that is unconscious we start fighting the market we we deny with that we start fighting the market we experience fear as a fear of missing out which we want to jump in a trade we want to change the market and many many other destructive actions I would say that those responses are automatic we we have those instincts you know fight of life freeze fighter fly it is quite widely known proverb when our ancestors when our ancestors were at the threat of Oh of some danger they had to run away and either run away or fight so when we trade in the market we might view our losses as a possible danger as a possible danger as a potential danger and so our fight-or-flight response turns on and we start fight in the market what has been fighting the market we start over trading it is a form of fight in the market or we start proving that we are right when market goes down we start buying more and more and more to prove that the market is wrong and we are right so it is automatic response what do we have to do actually what do we have to do we have to we have to alone to halt and observe we have to learn to choose our response not to be automatic we learn to have we learn we have to learn to choose our response it takes really you know around three months to really develop a new habit especially when we are talking about self-control and ability to choose our response when we are living in automatic mode I don't know for four entire life I don't suggest that you are living the automatic mode right but many many people they they are not even thinking about that doing something automatically when you drive a car you're you're just you just drive a car you don't think about that right when you work from your home to I don't know to the subway station you don't think about that you are doing it automatically and many many of the things that we do in the life we do automatically so it is in trading when we come to trading we start doing something automatically but the market is very very different from what we are familiar with and it's very different from any other form any other field of field of our life because because it is probabilistic its probabilistic approach probabilistic field of decision-making we are not so familiar with with dealing with probabilities ok so we we know how to how to drive a car we know how to work we know we know how to communicate socialize but we don't know how to estimate the odds we will not simply thought this this in a school I don't know in the university so we have to learn to do the first thing to hot and observe well it is approach that have come to us from cognitive psychology because we can you know we can we can even work now emotional states and we might we might you know I want to know where from our emotional stage come from come from so where our emotional stage roots in our early childhood and now you can go to psychoanalysis and and spend three years in the coach to to discover where your emotional state has come from but it is a very long process and sometimes you don't have the time you don't have there I don't know it is not a tool because you have you have to communicate with the psychotherapist I would suggest you another way the cognitive psychology cognitive psychology is a better way in many cases because you you are not dealing with your with your with the roots of your emotional state you just learn the simple action when you feel automatic response you'll learn to stop to get yourself back to them to the observer state of mind and to choose your response it seems very simple right here it looks very simple but in reality of course it's it is absolutely not easy it is absolutely not easy and later on in this webinar I will suggest you differ several exercises to do that several tools to learn to do that first of all the first tool is a journal of automatic thoughts it is underestimated by manage many traders they they think that the journal is a training log you just put down the numbers your entry point your exit point your yellow so your your gain but also when we keep a journal of automatic thoughts we is sort of a sort of anticipate our response we we get a step ahead before before ourselves well smart outsmart ourselves what is a journal of automatic thoughts we can fix our automatic thoughts in a journal because many many thoughts are coming through our mind throughout the day throughout the day and we are not aware not aware of those minds we just just don't we just don't pay much attention to those thoughts well for example what isn't what is an automatic thought I knew that I would lose money here that is excellent example of automatic thought and in cognitive psychology or in cognitive finance it is called insight bias it leads to false conviction that you knew what to do that you knew the outcome but you lost money due to self sabotage it is absolutely false conviction why is it so because really you operate in a in circumstances with with the circumstances without without predetermined with the prescribed result if you face uncertainty we all face uncertainty all traders nobody really knows what will happen nobody really really really will predict the mark nobody can predict the market all that we are all that we can do is to to have the odds on our frame stack the odds in our favor right all we have to do and all we can do is is managing risk reward is not our is not our responsibility reward is responsibility of the market so if you feel for example that or you think I know that I would lose money here and you might notice that if if you if you catch this thought later on you might notice that this thought leads to the emotional state of shame depression anger and disappointment because you start thinking that alright you you're you you've made it you have you have made it to self sabotage yourself you are not acting in your own best interest and that's why you feel this you feel shame you feel anger you feel disappointment you want to you want to get it all back an example for example when you buy at the top of the market when you buy at the top of the market and market goes down of course you you see what what has happened in a hint side you have seen that you have bought on on on the top of the market you would say all right oh my god I'm a loser I I knew that this would happen but I'd lost money I have lost money I've done to harm myself but if you fix your automatic thoughts you sort of sort of eliminate your emotional state of shame depression anger and disappointment that goes after this thought another example another example when you feel that you know what will happen in the market for example break into a level opens a path to be level all you have to do is just to fix this this thought and later on yours you analyze your journal and you understand that that after after after this thought used you started to experience anxiety fear of missing out a trade over confidence because if you feel that market will go right now you have to jump in this market you have to catch this train and of course guess what trader will do in this case he will double his position double the size of his position possibly or add to his position because because he trades his conviction he is very much convinced in in a successful outcome so he will add to his position and when market will market when market performs something something I don't know something very different from what he was expecting when reality is not corresponding to his expectations trader loses money more than he was expected and I observed this better all the time analyzing traders accounts for example I see that tradin try to has average losses average gains and then in a trading log I see it lost that that is three times greater than average loss I asked a trade what what was what what is the reason why did you lose I don't know $900 $900 your average loss is $200 why have you lost $900 in this pride and he answers that he was very convinced in this trade and he felt that he had to be aggressive he had to be aggressive right and if you keep a journal of idempotent Magna thoughts you might you might you know be one step ahead of yourself alright another example generalization when you think that this trade is going to be a loser I would rather exit you feel emotional state of anxiety fear and use will start to defend you position you will start to defend your position and too many times you will exit your position at possibly the worst point of course you will feel very very much disappointment after that because when you when you enter your position and get immediate loss it is it is the one situation but when you are entering a position but you have got your position and later on your position I don't know when team went to the target it is very frustrating and I will say that even even I with digs with eleven years of experience still do the same mistakes from time to time well I do many things right I do more of what works but sometimes I do the same mistake like beginner traders and for example my pattern my pattern that appears from time to time in my trading is defensive trading is defensive trading when I am inside of a when I'm inside of a drawdown I start trade trading defensively I will show you an example the recent example from euro versus American dollar that I was trading so far well it was April 12 sorry yeah April 12 I had a pretty good entry here I had a pretty good entry here because we have a rotational Center we had rotational Center one point 1405 and my first trade within this day was a long trade I started to buy this market from the billion from the early hours of European session from one point fourteen eleven so it was pretty good point for entering market market rallied higher then him then suddenly the big seller had stepped in and I have reversed my position here I have reversed my position here well guess what happened later market had rallied that's aii I said to myself okay I am in a good position now so market will go lower because I was expecting to see low targets to achieve but later in the day market started to trying to get back and I have cut my position with with a small profit as small as 10 tips guess what has happened later my stop-loss also was twelve twelve two people good sorry 20 pips or so 20 pips or so and not even no no it's not it was not 20 it was 12 for 15 beeps well it was pretty small stop-loss here it was pretty small stop-loss I have taken a small profit here and at the pedo at the one hand everything is okay but I have violated my blood because I started to trade offensively I started to trade offensive the market has rallied lower at the very next day I would have burned very very nice profit loss raishin this trade possibly ten to one but I have missed this trade because of defensive trading this is an example of how how psychology really works really influences our results well I was analyzing my journal later on and I have noticed that I started to I started to you know to know that market is very rotational it was my words market is very rotational nothing will really help not nothing will really you know happen in a three or four days market will remain to be rotational possibly I will need to to sit on up sit on my hands and not to trade to wait until until volatility comes back to the market and guess what volatility came back to the market but I have I was not in position it was very frustrating of course but as for another example with Australian dollar things turned differently because I was prepared for for this volatility break I was prepared for this volatile to break that happened yesterday we had for two days really we had two days of guys I guess that you see what I'm showing you you see my screen alright I hope that you see my screen alright there were two days of very small volatility here it was April twenty twenty twenty second and April 25th and April 26th also was not not was not very volatile date three days of no action right three days of no action and that's why I was expecting this volatility break and I I had I had given a trading suggestion in a Twitter but I was not really tricked trading this set up I will not tell you that I have I have burned here I don't know fifty to one profit loss correction no I was not entering the market this day because I was out from the monitor I was not following the markets due to some beautisol due to some circumstances let's say but I was prepared to this situation and I have given a suggestion in Twitter that market will possibly break to either direction to the outside or to the downside well it might even be the the external day day with with great volatility but it might be an external day when you see sequences of two to three days of very low volatility the day with a big volatility is followed you never know whether it will be a trending day on it or an external day what is external day external day is a day that that shows you higher highs and lower lows than a previous day so the example was from the Europe from the Euro I have shown I have shown mature so far now is that these days external it is really external then it was possible to earn trading in both directions well how it relates to trading discipline when you are you know well you're not denying when you're not anxious when you are not when you are not trading defensively you recognize right opportunities because when your mind is free you recognize right opportunities and you are able to recognize opportunities in the market because when we are when we don't understand and we don't recognize what is happening with us our perspective is very narrow our perspective is very narrow and it means that we will not recognize opportunity once it appears all right and to make our mind free to free our mind we have to catch this automatic behavior automatic response or automatic perception catch once it appears so the the exercise is to keep a journal of automatic thoughts or you can even create your own list of triggers because because every every automatic response is stay dependent stay dependent for example when you are I don't know you are when you feel good when you're when you don't feel any pressure when you have enough money when you are when you have good relationship in your family you come to the market and you have you have a support the feeling of support I know psychological support from from your family from your friends and you feel yourself you feel yourself as a successful person and if market does something or for example when you win when you you when you catch a stop it will not affect your trading it will not affect your trading but when you come to the market when for example you are we were sleeping not very good you have a sleep deprivation when you had some conflicts some misunderstandings with your friends with your family don't know so you have come to the market and you try to trade in the state of mind of course when market generates frustrating something frustrating possibly you will start doing something automatically to defend your to defend your emotional state you will start doing something automatically right to fight the market and all we have to do is to to know what emotional state are we experiencing now it is very very important when you start your day you might start your day with with fixing your thoughts and feelings in a journal without any relationship to the market you may may just open your journal and write down all your feelings and emotions what are you feeling right now what I think about right now well it is called drill down when you just free your mind in a free writing mode you free your mind and after that you might you might notice that you don't want to get in a trade your approach to the market has become more adequate you reverse the market and you you are not feeling any pressure you don't want to get in a trade right now you just observe you just watch and once setup the peers in the market you just give you you can trade up on this set up but you don't want to jump in a trade right now if you don't free your mind if you come to the market and you have an unconscious pressure and conscious emotional pressure you might experience the need to trade you will possibly have the pressure to trade and the first exercise is to make a drill-down the second exercise is to keep a journal of automatic thoughts yes the presentation will be provided to all participants of this webinar you can write me an email I will I will lay it I will live in a male after the webinar ends well you can ask me some questions because we can go through the markets watch what happens in the markets for example if you want my opinion on sub situations where you can ask the questions about discipline I suggest to come to the phase of questions well if you have any any tools or exercises for developing a discipline you can share it with charging it shut you have a question of alright please ask your question you trade binary options and it becomes intense when candles move in a different direction a given timeframe what do you mean what becomes intense what has become intense emotions right candles candlesticks move in different direction in a given time frame do you mean do you feel that or do you do mean that market starts to move very quickly or it rotates back and forth it lags destination what do you mean by that market starts to move very quickly right and and it pushes you to feel to feel some kind of emotions right what emotions do you feel during that moment do you feel anxiety fear or fear right that is excellent that is that is very popular better in Amman traders it is called fear of missing out fear of missing out possibly I am suggested I don't know it's my suggestion because many traders feel this feel feel this whew missing out market goes back and forth betting back and forth with with increase momentum it's breaking out one level ten it it gets back it's breaking out another level it's getting back and traders think that all right now it will break right now it will break I have to get inside a position now it will break when I will tell you that it is very very dangerous type of the market you have to know how such market works it is neutral or a normal day it is called neutral or normal day when markets does nothing everyone shall we it is it is a trap you know market goes back and forth back and forth it generates many folds break outs and for trade is it is it is very popular but your day for all the trade many traders they start increasing their volume they start increasing their there are a number of positions in such days that's why you have to filter your traders in such day use your fear is a key is a psychological key if you experience this pressure use this as a notification that all right I have to sit back I have to relax and I have to take a rest from the market I have to just observe I will not enter the market this time my fear is my key your emotion here will be your personal filter do not get inside them of this market what is the perfect countdown timer for trading options so that you can be in the money Wow I don't trade binary options I don't trade binary options maybe it's question not for me alright guys more questions please if you have any questions feel free to ask them here does anyone here experienced anything similar for example when market breaks out from a ratio market starts really rallying many traders many traders feel uncomfortable they they don't want to trade this market if you're uncomfortable they feel that they would rather want to to see average volatility they don't trade big days and it is also the form of defensive trading well it is not discipline it is it is it is a flow influence of emotional state of mind well as for discipline as for discipline really discipline consists of three parts the first is wrist control the second is self awareness and the third is is knowing what to do exact trading plan how do you place a stop loss how many pips from the entry point you know it depends on the trading strategy for example for example if I trade the breakout momentum trade like I was showing you later previously for Euro versus American dollar here it is a breakout momentum trade right and my stop is pretty tight here I place this stuff below the law of this small candlestick below the law of the white candlestick that closes beyond the level okay so it violates the level it closes above the level and I enter in position I place this stuff below this below this candlestick sometimes I use ATR sometimes I use ATR when HR is at its lowest values for example six pips I have to multiply it by one and a half and get at least nine or ten bits for my stop loss well from for example when Mark is breaks this level breaks this level to the downside and I enter a position I also use ATR curatu is equal to 2 a 12 pips so I multiply it by one and a half and get 18 beeps oh it is 18 pips or possibly 20 pips close to that 20 pips so when I enter position and place my stop 20 pips above my entry point but when I capture a pullback my stop-loss has to be more distant because a pullback trade is by definition account a trend trade is by definition a counter trend trade well I will show you one example from yesterday it is a pullback trade yet the stop-loss here was very small as well market has broken out a level 65 point 57 it is it is our American dollar versus Russian ruble it is a currency pair that I also follow among other currency pairs and I had missed the first entry but later on market has come back to to this area so I was able to enter this position and a place is top right above right above it was pretty small stop-loss here Britta small stop-loss and my target my target was located here at sixty-four point point a 48 for the Aged right why do I place such a target because I use here the symmetrical principal the measured move here is a move I use this volatility the wattage of this move I add this move to a rotational center and I get my and I get my target it is a measured mob right and notice that market is not moving anywhere from this point it has reached the target and it's not moving down any longer it doesn't mean that it cannot go down later but for the present moment it is a good exit point how can trailing stop loss be effective well trailing stop I'm very careful with trailing stops because when you place a tight trailing stop it will be hit in many cases and you will get rid of the good position so my approach to placing trailing stops is that first you have to you have to see that the market has has accepted levels that it has achieved for example I was trading gold here at April 19th I was trading gold at the bid was a breakout momentum trade that was executed early the day market has rallied well I know that I cannot place very tight trailing stop here yet I had placed a trailing stop based on double ATR on the 30-minute chart and my trailing stop eventually was was closed here it was hit well is it is a compromise right is compromise I cannot let the market take fifty percent of my paper profit that's why I have to choose what trailing stopped up to place but if I placed smaller trade and stopped well in some cases in some cases of course I would I would preserve preserve my position but in also in other cases market would gone would go to the target and let me earn more how will we get the replay of this weather well this weather I guess will be placed on a YouTube access channel so we will be able to watch the recording of this webinar now recording must be available now maybe in a few days also if you need the presentation you can write me in a mail directly to to stanislav burn-off at excellence calm I had placed it in a general chat any more questions well while you are thinking in thinking on your questions I will again pay you attention on pay your attention on very simple but not easy to execute principle we have to break our automatic response we have to develop a new habit of choosing our response of stopping power automatic thoughts automatic feelings and to get in ourself back to the resource and to choose our response it is a habit after all it is not a it is not a characteristic for added now for for 1% of of the population now it is a habit that can be developed over time it is emotional intelligence Atticus it is self-awareness it is a habit that can be developed over time what a lot size to use I don't know it depends on your risk it depends on your risk management for example if you have a non stop loss equal to 20 pips and your loss in a single trade is equal to one percent on your account so do the math you have to calculate the Desai's or the cost of one pip you can use a calculator on accidents for example on excellence website they have a calculator you can choose choose a currency pair choose a trading volume and calculate its average cost of the tick let's demonstrate how to place trailing stop loss all right for example the the very simple principle very simple principle is to use double ATR it is a principle to places trailing stop inside of the day inside of the day when market rallies and you are inside of your position for example HR here is equal to two point eight two point eight points so you'll have to multiply it at least by one and a half and get four or four four and a half points for your trailing stop retraining stop so in market achieves this level of twenty fifty six to twelve fifty six sorry 12:56 you have to place your stop ad let me calculate one more time six right around six fifty six it is your trailing stop will be equal to is to six points well when you keep your position when you hold your position overnight of course you cannot rely on on a 30-minute a tra any longer you will have to go on a daily chart because when you hold your position overnight you start accepting risks of higher time frames for example this example this example from gold shows us that ATR here was already fifteen fifteen points right fifteen points if you multiply this number of this value by one and a half you get possibly possibly twenty one twenty two and that is your trend stop if you want to hold this position 22 points from extreme will will be okay 12:57 1237 right that should be your trailing stop 37 right but it doesn't mean that you will let your let the market breathe in such in such wide in such wide trading range you have to have target you have to have some target but to reach this target market of course we would breathe and it would correct it will pull back and you will have to rely on a daily ATR if you hold your position overnight thank you for this presentation all right Thank You Dennis I appreciate your coming and your attention also in this webinar yes working on mistakes is is really really the habit that makes a trader no one is perfect here we come to the market without knowing really anything right we are we don't know anything we unconsciously incompetent then we slowly come to the face of conscious incompetence right we understand that we don't know anything but we're not so dumped to maybe do to learn something and after that we come to conscious competence it is pretty it is pretty pretty tough to read because we have to pay our attention to many things and to do it consciously but we we do 1 2 3 4 5 I don't know we we do some certain steps and we learn to make small amount of money in the market and only after we learn to do those things we come to the face of in conscious competence it is really in the face that makes professional trader so guys I suggest you to work in a trading to to be consciously competent at least at least unconsciously competent or if you feel if you are new to the market and if you think that your you are already a good trader possibly you are denying and you're in consciously incompetent yet and I guess that the earlier you recognize that you don't know anything the better will be for your trading alright guys I appreciate you coming to this
