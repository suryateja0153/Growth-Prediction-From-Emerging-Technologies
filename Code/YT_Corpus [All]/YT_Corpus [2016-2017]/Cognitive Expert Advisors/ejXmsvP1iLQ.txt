 so emotions are important that's the first thing so which we shouldn't think as emotion as something that gets in that getting the way that impede us to do stuff especially professionally talking emotions are something that we use every day and they help us come up with environment if we wouldn't have had emotions probably with a much more problem in the coping with the society we live in second emotional intelligence matters that's also the title of my talk and in this way I want to convince you that the idea that these are there are skills that you basically do not learn at school you do not learn explicitly but they make up most of your life I mean we spend the whole days talking to people interacting with people but nobody I think ever told you beside your parents may be a little bit how you should do that how you should behave with others how you can understand how the others are feeling all these is something that we learn by doing but actually I am not the only one now we're saying that is very important to trade disabilities in the u.s. there is a program is called a ruler which is supported by the Obama administration and it's delivered by the Yale Center for emotional intelligence on yourself year in which they train students and adolescents in developing their emotional intelligence abilities and that's something something that is spreading out its many thousands of several thousands of schools across the u.s. then have used this program now and this is something extremely you because so far when we went to school or what we want to do with this learning stuff but we learn hard skills let's say so we learn how to count count we learn how to write we learn how to build stuff but and the learning is not doesn't teach you understanding and one of the key points of our lives is understanding others and being understood by others and that's really important it really something that is relevant for a personal life but also professionally because we have colleagues we have supervisor we have subordinates and in all these cases there are emotions that inevitably happens and we shouldn't think that these are elements that give us issues but actually they should be used in a way they make working together better and more effective because now I would have shown you that if you want to become James Bond now what you need to do is develop your emotional intelligence indeed there is a new movie of James Bond which is out these days I think ur is going to come out in the next week's and this is about an announcement the job posting that the mi6 so the secret services in the UK posted online and what they look for is not something which is a knight who is 90 expert or somebody who is an expert in them at the no army or whatever or engineering they look for people who can I would really like to show it to you but trust me it is like this people who understand beliefs thoughts and others basically what they want is basically is emotional intelligent people they don't write this way but that's all that is about and I think that this kind of already starts to clarify why these sort of abilities can matter but if we want to turn to scientific evidence to some of the studies that link conducted I can mention to you one very interesting actually to where it is in correlational studies that they found that stock market returns so talking about stock exchange drop after a national team of football is eliminated from an important tournament like the workout or the European Cup so what happens last two years ago it'll hacia Italy was kicked out at the first round unfortunately for me and the day after you would see that there was a drop in the stock market but why is that I mean it has nothing to do right I mean the football team with stock market I mean there's really no reason why this should happen well the reason is that people we're a bit more sad or unhappy because of what happened the day before and they brought it to work the day after and when they were seeing how things were going for companies they would use their emotional state to make judgments about what they should do and that's the problem because they were using emotional information that was not related to the action and the current situation but something that happened the day before and that's the first thing emotional intelligence helps you is the idea that you can if you are emotional intelligence understand why you're feeling a certain way in specific moment and being able to identify the causes for your state a second group of studies researchers called people and home and ask them okay just please tell us how you how satisfied are you in your life how healthy are you how is your financial situation and then when they started looking at the data they realized there was something funny because people who were interviewed on average of course people who were interred in the days in sunny days they would be more satisfied with their lives better health and better financial situation well if that's true why are we here should we go to Africa all over the south of Europe and just be happier healthier and Richard truth is of course what happens is that people were lightly better mood because of the Sun outside and why don't we ask about something else they would use this information to answer that question indeed it was enough that when they did a rerun of the study pointing out right before these questions about the weather so how is the weather today that people would somehow become aware of the fact that it's sandy outside and I went sunny so I'm as neither a better mood than average and this would be enough to take away the effect of the weather on their responses about life satisfaction health and financial status so these are important evidence because it really tells you that there's a lot of information that we gather from our emotions and we use the important important thing is to use it in the right way another example there is a paradigm a protocol a task that it's used in psychology and economics which is called the UT mating game the if the mating game is you basically ask two people to come to the lab or to the room where you want to do this parameter and you give an amount of money to the first person let's say 15 friends like this and you say okay this money is yours now you have you can you have to split between you and the other person you can decide to keep as much money as you want up this pot and give some of to lick some to the other person the second person though will have the chance to accept your offer and in that case everybody goes home with the money that has been a split or will have the tree to reject your offer and this means that you both go home with no money what do you think it happens if you give somebody if the first ones flits between 14 and one only to the second person do you think that the second person would still accept it no actually I can tell you that most cases people will not but why is that me in the end you would still go home with one instead of 0 so from an economics perspective if you just follow the basic of economics or if we're a perfect rational person you would always have to accept as long as you get this one Frank out of those 15 because one Frank is way better than zero facts but people know people don't accept it they prefer to punish a little bit themselves in order to punish more somebody else who they think has been unfair and so they feel angry from now against this person the femoral disgusted is the term we use in psychology against these people so these emotions basically motivates their decision and they decide not to let him go get away with it so now we both go home empty-handed because you were really these are clear examples of how which we are because if we even reach the point that we want to punish shall we decide to punish ourselves in order to punish somebody else more Wow I mean if the other person goes home with 14 and you go home with one I mean you both go home in principle with something more so what's the point of that the point is that emotions are really part of our daily interaction our daily lives and one of the most important thing to understand is that emotions and cognition do not work separately they work together you cannot separate emotions and cognition because every motion includes cognitive elements as we just saw and cognition is part of our emotional experience so it depends a lot on how we appraise the word that we have certain emotions for example I always make the same example about a snake if most of us would see a snake would be extremely a fad scared we try to run away on a hike let's let's mention that we are working we are hiking on the mountains and we see snake most about with fries or we start to step back but if you really are into snake you really like them you will probably approach at a certain distance in order to be able to admire the snake that you like in a complete free environment and that's because the way we appraise the situation is the same situation is completely different so these are some of the cognitive elements that make up the emotions that we experience and that's also why emotional intelligence is part it's something that can pain and is actually a skill that merits as much attention as IQ or other sorts of intelligence that bin already studied the most important thing about emotional intelligence is that it is something that matters personally and professionally indeed if you would be able to read or listen to people or talk about successful businessman for example you would see the most of the reasons why they praise these people are emotional related abilities I would have read with you now a passage from the biography of Steve Jobs in which i don't remember who's talks about him probably one with a company with some colleagues that would say that Steve Jobs was great because he could delight people he could find interface that were pleasant he could find messages that were enticing and all the description that he provides of Steve Jobs goes around the idea of him as being somebody emotional intelligence somebody could use this information but this is just anecdotal what does science tell us well I reviewed a bit of the literature on this team and what you see is that the people who have higher emotional intelligence they are better at managing stress at work this is a you thing we all are bombarded by email messages we all have demands people to interact with meetings all the time and the number of tasks that we have to accomplish every day in our professional but also private life it's terrible so imagine how good is the ability to manage stress in those conditions second people who are hiring emotional intelligence have also better relationships with their colleagues and supervisors and subordinates we all go to work places we all have colleagues and we all know how bad would be to go to work in a place where you have basically no relationships with others I hope nobody of you experience is this but just try to imagine it would go to word to a place where there's nobody you can work with that's terrible and imagine that this can be solved because sometimes it's an issue of being able to relate and this is something that one can learn third studies about sales force people go about say lycée selling stuff they found out that if they get training in emotional intelligence they can grow the sales up between ten and twenty percent which is huge of course this depends on the job is depend on the clients but there are jobs in which there is a lot of emotions attached the topics of discussion such think about insurances when you're talking about health insurances you're talking about that it should life insurances so you're talking about death of your death of on one of your relatives what's going to happen to my sons after and guns so in all these elements there's a lot of a personal experience that is emotional that needs to be accounted for and this is something that if you're better at relating at managing other people's emotion this can become good for your job but all in all the studies just point in one direction if you are better if you're higher in emotional intelligence you simply are more productive because you basically are better and managing tasks you know how to interact with people so when somebody gets to you asking for something you know how to basically let's put it this way accommodate is needs without letting him or she'd interrupt your flow of work all these things put together in n t5 one of the main application to save the emotional ties which is the work environment even more importantly for that I've been studies in which they showed that the success of executives comes it can be predicted sorry by the combination of experience and emotional intelligence it's not just experience and it's not just emotional tensions of course but if you have both then you have the key for an exact go to get probably a good executive so if you want to hire somebody with indirection position you should look at its at this CV or personally and see whether he has be good qualification and experience but that may be not enough because what happens that is not capable of managing these groups is not capable of handling his clients these are both competencies that are very important for success executive leaves one off so I hope that all these somehow convince you of the fact that emotions are relevant and important one side on the other side that emotional intelligence matters for the workplace but there is one thing that I haven't done so far which is quite and what you spoke about emotional intelligence but what is emotional intelligence the definition of emotional intelligence is actually a complex one in the sense that we used to define emotional intelligence or we define emotional intelligence as the combination of different abilities and in the rest of my talk I will try to guide you through each of these abilities and give you some ideas of how they apply and I will tell to give you some little tips for each of them that you can take with yourself and if you want you can try to see whether they apply to your personal or professional life because they both are relevant and important for well being so emotional intelligence is made of four abilities first one is emotional what we call emotion understanding and emotion understanding means being able to understand others in terms of based on the context I will say more about this late not all sorry I said others what others and oneself so it's actually split in two in the idea of emotional intelligence then we have emotion recognition which is the ability to recognize the motion of somebody else from his behavior from his facial expression from his gestures from his voice service extremely important emotion regulation so the capacity that I have to regulate my own emotion and I'm going to talk a little bit about this but the talk that we follow mine will be much more you dig much more deep into this domain finally which is basically the sum of the old or they are all the other competencies is emotion management emotional management is basically the ability to manage other people's emotions you shouldn't think it has a limp in a bad way because it's what we do all the time it's just we need to we need to find the term and we use management the idea is that people come to you with their own emotion experience and you have to cope with that help them go through or just account for the Fed that I have any motion and recognize it and do something about it because that's the point if they have any motions it means that something important happened to them this is some of the things I really find important poor competencies the fur there is also different studies and these are the four competencies that I was talking about the last one being emotion management and I was saying that there is something that I didn't said before I really want to point out so if someone is having an emotion probably means that the thing about which he or she is emoting is an emotion Israel for him that's one of the way to see emotions emotions are relevant actors so if we have it in motion it's only because the thing that caused it it's important for us so never disregard the motion of somebody let's start with emotion understanding so emotional standing as a brief introduced before is the ability to understand the motion of oneself or somebody else's from contextual information so something happens and we are capable of understanding that of guessing basically what's the emotion that this person might x and experience let's do this together so just try to see how good we are in understanding ourselves we call it's made of two dimensions on the horizontal axis you have the Laplace Ernest so pleasant and pleasant on the vertical axis you have the level of energy so high or low this is basically one of the instruments that is using psychology to ask people how they feel so one so the quadrant up on the right would be positive high energies like joy penis to would be positive low in energy and this would be something like being cars real 3 is a negative and low energy something like a bit like sadness social mood a bit like gloomy sadness and 4 is a negative so very impressed and I feel very impress on now and but I'm very energetic so something like anger or very strong discussed so let's do it together so if I would ask you who of you is in quadrant number one raise your hands ok so how many of you are included number two good and number 31 good and the number for good very happy about that actually if it happens that somebody would have raised the hands that would have been quite worried about what I was going to say just by information just a little information actually two and three especially three is considered one of the best States to learn new things to study so being is mildly negative but not really sad like depressed but a little bit and not too much energetic is considered one of the best days to learn new abilities and new concepts I think it was sort of easy to answer this question but if I would have asked you how do you feel now without giving you a map and just asking you to choose a word to describe it would have been much more we don't have time to do it but it would have been much more difficult think about when people ask you how do you feel or when you ask people how are you today think about the answers that you get I am pretty sure that eighty percent of the times the answers are good but so and so okay that's it that's all the emotion literacy that we use in most of our dead interactions I mean it's very different if you are proud of something that just happened if you're happy if your call so these are all positive you can all say that they're good but they are very different they imply very different behaviors they imply a very different appraisers about something that happens and the thing is that nobody teaches us this we don't know these words we just learned by interacting with other people there is no literacy about this you can learn about how to scientifically define plants or animals the filament species but we don't know how to define emotions which words to use when it's appropriate unless this is one of the directions of the roulette project i mentioned before is going teaching people the emotional words they can use to describe their own periods the thing is that if you are able to understand your emotion to label them to understand what why they are the causes of your emotion you can basically identify the correct source of the motion and then know when this is the relevant or relevant for a decision you have to make that's exactly the cases I mentioned at the beginning so if you do that this nice the better mood you are is actually due to the weather you won't use the information to say that you're happier with your life or in that you're richer or that you're healthier because this is not exactly how you would evaluate it in this in a rainy day and using the information in the wrong way that's very important and you see this we don't have time to go through this was another study showing is that the same principle I just as played so if you have the correct information you have a different behavior so you don't take you take less risky choices if you are afraid about something that's in general so if you try to something that is not even related to the task you may have a different behavior while if you are made aware of this you will probably take the risky choice more now know if it's good or bad the thing is that they be behavior changes based on emotion that you have that does nothing to do with the task you're doing as i promised i want to give you little very simple tips that one can see whether they apply to their own life and whether they can you one can use them so if you want to better understand your emotions and remember it's the first step to manage them and to regulate them you need to identify their I it causes so probably it's not that the person who just didn't let you in while you're driving that is so terrible and you will need to shout in him and look after him in order to beat him up but probably the you had something better that worse that happen it works before and now you're just basically using at the anger that you have for something else against this event pay attention to your behaviors thats related to what i said before emotions tell us that the thing about which we emote is important so if you behave in a certain way it probably means something pay attention to this sometimes suddenly we start speaking with a different voice we start getting away why is that am I am comfortable in the situation why is that try to do this label your emotions that links to what we said before if you can label your emotion you can communicate them and people actually I can do something with you if they don't know if you just said or angry or generally unhappy about something they cannot really help you concretely unless they know exactly why this is about last but not least adult get feedback people can give you very nice insights about yourself you cannot even realize how something pisses you off until somebody else's tell you and I have a colleague and trees were together quite a lot and while we were having meetings she would sometimes when other people were talking she would make a disgusted face the most disgusted face I've ever seen in my life I remember I was talking and she was doing that I said oh my what I might say and actually and I saw that she was doing also to others and I was asking myself oh wow that's really bad I mean that's your boss he shouldn't do this right and then I'd confronted her I spoke to her now so but what was that and maybe she didn't realize a lot that she was having his behavior and she didn't mean it to be so negative about the thing of course he didn't like it as she want to say something but there was nothing that she wanted to communicate and this feedback that i gave her helped her to change this behavior because she didn't realize about it and people were making inferences about how bad she thought of them so feedback can be very important but emotional defending is not just about one's own emotion it was about others emotion and when we talk about understanding the motion of others we talk about the ability to understand the emotion from the context in which these things happen and it is very different if you have to interact with somebody who has just been through a very tender experience like holding his son or her daughter in the arms all someone who just had a loss or Z to the crania you know this intuitively that you have to behave differently but sometimes we basically ignore these elements and this is very important because then leads to problems in the communication in the interaction try to understand the emotions in which others are because maybe it's not the same one you think they should be and this is more important for leaders if you need to guide a team you need to be empathic with your team you need to lead them understand them and respond to their needs because what you want is the diaper from well and if they are having a reaction on emotional reaction on something first of all it means if it's if it's work-related it needs a dead thing matters to them so if they're even getting into an emotional reaction into a mistake they made it still need that they care about the stuff that we're doing otherwise they wouldn't have cared basically of the criticism these are two tips for emotion understanding in others that I would like to share with you the first one what we call empathic active listening if you want to get a better understanding of others maybe I'll you are said today oh you are happy today that's not the best way to get know if the person is really happy or not what we call it check in try to say you look like you seem this way you basically open up the possibility for a discussion about it and the other person can confirm or disconfirm what to say and accept to be wrong there's no problem the other thing which is very important consider what the ad that the person you're talking to and attracted to find important not what you find important if your husband wants to watch the TV game of football in the evening don't be mad at him it's not silly necessarily maybe for him in method something maybe it's a way he uses this to connect with friends were not there at the same time so try to understand why the thing is important for him and the ref has two individuals here is absolutely random and and I think this make it for emotion understanding in oneself and in others let me turn to emotion regulation which is basically the same what comes next once you have in motion you need to regulate your own emotion so emotional regulation as a definition is the ability to regulate one's own emotions and critical circumstances okay isn't that you all right here's the deal marshmallow for you you can either wait and i'll give you another one if you wait or you can eat it now when I come back I'll give you another one so then you have to but stay in here and stay in the chair till I come back okay all right I'm gonna go do something and then I'll come back alright so it's up to you you can have an hour you can wait okay i'll be back stay in the chair okay okay I alright so I'm going to leave and then I'll come back okay so you can even eat it right now or you can wait either way okay okay how'd you do did you do good you did you want to eat it in me yeah so I'll tell you and give you another one okay I can have both you need thank you so you saw these men cognitive non cognitive emotional regulation strategies the movie in the tactics and this is actually what we are adults also do sometimes we try to regulate our emotions with nonverbal behavior but we also have cognitive emerge regulation strategies I will just give you a brief idea of what I'm talking about in terms of no cognitive and cognitive again under the forms of tips these are strategy that may seem very simple very basic but they actually work quite well you see more about meditation and breathing when we will do the mindfulness when we will hear the talk of my colleague will talk right after me but this is really powerful it is known that it has effects on the body it's not just something that psychological its physiological this word just breathing physical activity you are in the travel during some some of us do it or I would like to do it just stop for a minute ago for a walk five minutes ten minutes doesn't need to be very intense it's enough to do something you just regulate your emotion because you make a space a moment between what's happening now and your reaction you basically try to make a little bubble of empty space that doesn't that goes beyond in between the the causes of your emotion and your behavior talk to someone same principle as before talking to somebody is very important you get a lot of I mean we all do that right we all have our friends houses partners friends and we go to them and we asked them emotional support bisque even if not explicitly that's what we do all the time and the simple thing that parents told kids since decades count to ten the same principle put a space between the event and your reaction of course we are cognitive people as well so we can use cognitive strategy especially in the context of work we may be no not have the time to go and run five minutes so we have to face the situation and try to elaborate a way to cope with what's happening in May these things name is amor may all about the same principle think about the positive side this may sound easy but actually something that we do sometimes it's just a matter of learning how to do it more often lower the importance sometimes what happens is not that as important as you think it doesn't really deserve your emotional reaction try to see it in a different perspective think about something else take a break go do with another task lift a task for later or simply sometimes accept the reality I mean there's no point in keep thinking about the event you can do nothing about this is one of the most problematic issues in terms of health rumination so you keep thinking about the same event over and over again it doesn't help you my spouse left in my spouse left me mouse mouse left in my spouse best in my spouse left me doesn't get you any better actually brain forces every time the loss it doesn't need you anywhere the only solution is to accept the reality but all these things together we normally label them under the terms reappraise reevaluate what happens to you you have this power it's very simple how you can reevaluate what happens and this is proven by many scientific studies that this will make you healthier your well-being will go up the third competence I want to talk about which is the adamant one of the elements of emotional intelligence it's emotional recognition emotional recognition the way we define the ability to understand somebody else's emotion from his or her nonverbal behavior and this is also a video can we try awesome good perfect so please tell me which emoji can we pre plate once please so how many of you think is joy good how many of you think is fear how many of you think is irritation well how many of you think is anger okay very nice of course this is a very simple example and I'm happy because if somebody would have told me this looks like joy I don't know about how we could handle that but in any case I'm very happy you all recognize this an expression of anger of course it's staged of course disciples all the elements of the prototypical anger expression because it moves the face in a certain way the movement gestures device but actually it's not so easy all the time so what do we look at what shall we look at this is part of the idea of sharing with you some of the scientific knowledge about emotion expression well we all look at the face first and just to make it clear we infer a lot of stuff from nonverbal behavior even if we are not aware of this because we learned through many changes to read read only how people express their emotional state by the face and this sometimes goes against their words I sometimes it seems like it's in face so they go well together but still these are channels that we analyze somehow separately and when we look at the face of course the key elements are eyes the gays the eyebrows it's very different frown from a surprised face with the raised eyebrows and the mouth this is also very interesting because status shows for example that Westerners so people like most of us you think look more at certain facial features while I'm like the mouth while the agent tend to look more at the eyes to read the emotions of others and actually a very anecdotal evidence about this is the emotional Giamatti considered faces that we also put in messages we change emotions by changing the shape of the mouth as mine or a sad expression in Japan most emojis change the shape of the eyes that's a part of this but sometimes we simply don't know why we make some judgments so if I show you these two faces you know it's the same person of course Julia Roberts which of these two pictures you consider more spontaneous so who think is the one on the Left who think is the one on the right okay exactly that is a tree my point so we all most of us perceive the one on the right as being more spontaneous more authentic but what is that I mean the mouth okay she's mines a bit more if you want but it's not that actually what makes the difference is this little wrinkles on the corner of the eyes we use them to infer the spontaneity of the expression and this is the weird it was actually we have to find out afterwards that this is a movement that both people basically almost nobody can do it voluntarily it's very difficult to move this muscle on earth will we I mean you can train that I can actually do it but that's my job that's my job but general it's something that even train people have issues at problems in doing that and that's interesting to see how we during the evolution we picked up this little cube and even though we didn't know about it we used it as an element to infer the authenticity of somebody's reaction and that's really the one of the key points to think about how we do get about the emotions of others but sometimes the face does not tell the whole truth so this is a study that were published in science and it's about the recognition of emotion from facial expression these are two real pictures of two tennis players maybe you recognize a one of the two lists and they've been taken after a very important point and one was a winning point and the other one was a losing point if I would ask you which of these two pictures was taken after a winning point who among you would say number one who would say number two it's basically split in half more or less and which is a sensitive point because sometimes the face does not have the whole story if I show you the body is it clear now it is need we mean not we but we like we showed that in this case it's very easy then if it's a winning time or a losing point but past just by looking at the face it's basically impossible this is an extremely positive reaction you see it from the body and the other one is negative but if you look at the face alone you missed this information so pay attention to the body sometimes it tells you something different something else than the face but the most important thing is that any behavior meet something in the contest when it's not and by the person that is that performs it I was talking about my colleague in the strange movement of the face for her it was something that she would do regularly it wasn't really meaning something but somebody could likely would have interpreters discussed as anger this gesture like food clapping can be bad night somebody may do it all the time somebody can be a sign of impatience which is means that it helped that it ends soon discomfort or it can be also an happy feet as you remember from movies so the idea that the same movement may have different meanings according to the context and to the specific person this is the main thing to remember when we talk about recognizing emotions from the nonverbal expression think about the context and the person who is expressing emotion emotion management is the last of the four competences and this is the ability to manage other people's emotion in an effective way as I said this is nothing bad this is something we do all the time your child comes to you kind and you try to cope with this sadness or fear or anger whatever is the reason why he or she is crying that's what we do all the time and to do this I would like to use one of the items of the test that we created we in Geneva and we in collaboration with none this with Sebastian totally is going to talk about this a little bit later she's the Jayco some of you probably have done it already online before coming here and that is one of the cases one item actually this was built as all the items on the real world scenario so we interviewed people like you and ask them about emotional situations and what to do in the about them so the item would read like this one of your employees made us a very mistake by accidentally sending confidential documents the wrong person you know that this happened because she was not paying attention enough attention actually was hey while confronting him he starts crying click flag and claims that your demands are too high what do you tell him first possibility from now on every time you have to send an important document it should come to me and we will check it together I know you can perform better such a mistake cannot happen again think about it we will discuss it another time I'm sorry my mistake please come down I always appreciated your work it can happen sorry ma'am this is an employee of yours you're responsible of him and he made a mistake the mistake is made it's nothing you can move on it and he comes to you any stats crime it says that you really have to hide meds I have to say that in the actual test there is another option that is wrong of course I didn't include but I also expect that we will ever quite a consensus here because of the reason I that's why I chose this item also because of the audience or a professional audience so who among you would choose option number one okay who among you will choose option number two okay who would say number three think about it we will discuss it another time who would choose number 4 i'm sorry my mistake countdown okay actually each of these options is based on a different way to handing in the conflict that is behind the situation each of these subtends one of those in the first case you try to collaborate with the person in the second case you try to compete with the mistakes so you clearly say the point that this is a mistake so you go against person somehow avoided you say we talking about we'll talk about it another time you avoid the issue accommodation you just take the blade scale say where it's not very important and just take enough in this case the correct answer is number two to compete because it's really a severe mistake you don't want it to happen again and you need to be sure that this person has understood that his mistake was extremely severe on the same time the mistake has been made and this person is not going to be fired because of this cannot so you need to somehow motivating manage his emotion so the first thing you do is say I know you can perform better you try to put it in a more positive immediately you give him something but then you stayed immediately that the mistake is severe and it cannot happen again otherwise it will have consequences of course that's implicit in the same and the thing the main point is that we all should be able to choose which we do this all the time just we don't know exactly what they are but that's what we do all the time we need to know which one to use in which situation and that's part of the ability to manage other people's emotion to know when to use a specific strategy in response to other people's emotion this I will briefly go through the idea is that you can actually get to a better understanding of the other person or you can relate better with the other person if you very well mirror the other person on non verbal memory these are very simple strategies and you see very important people do this all the time to get a line so then it's easier to deal with each other but let me conclude basically my talk just by trying to give you an idea of what these all millions for you we spoke about the relevance of emotion we spoke about why emotional intelligence matters why science tells us that emotional intelligence can actually have a big impact on your personal and professional life the first thing that I would like you to take home with you is the idea that whenever you are about to experience emotion you're about to act about it think get control before you must know mean your emotion before you can manage or regulated these works both ways so other people's emotions as yours you need to understand and then you act you may act without having understood correct the situation especially about yourself try to label your state try to understand why you're angry or sad or upset none and then what does it all mean for your work I try to highlight four elements that I think for keywords and I think are most relevant for you I hope at least so I put the word client but that's basically a proxy for many other things it can be your colleagues it can be your supervisor it can be your spouse it can be your friend the idea is that if you really want to have better relationships with others personally and professionally first thing you need to do is develop your empathy try to put yourself in your kind shoes and to do this it's very important to do the second part which is focus on what he finds him for it understand what are the needs I mean if this person is gonna get angry further because there is something is very important for him you what you're going to tell about so try to focus on this point third positive move that's an le we saw it before I mean I gave you scientific example scientific evidence that tells the behavior of people changes the even the answers change when is in the persons are in different moods so for positive or non-negative and if you can put your partner interaction partners in a more positive mood is really going to have better interaction most of us know this is still intuitively or we studied about it but it's really important it changes a lot finally last but extremely important language if you really want to be successful in man in the relationship try to understand try to imagine how he interprets what you tell him mean we are not I mean I'm not even a financial expert if i go to look for financial advisors advice i meet some pop somebody at the bank when i have my money i say okay yeah i would like to put some place when some fans what can we do I of course have a lot at stake I mean I'm still sort of young I have not so much money as I have a care life in front of me my my daughter is gonna grow at some point so there's a lot at stake for me and this is kind of an investment for me it's important it's something I really want to do right and I'm afraid of losing my money or losing the possibility to take care of my family so if you start if if the adviser starts talking to me in a way that I don't understand the thing my fear my anxiety will just grow up and will grow up and I will not know exactly how to behave at this william p my judgment because it will make a decision even more difficult to be made than it was at the beginning because I will feel like I'm not really in control of the situation whatever we choose I wonder showzen the thing just because I thought it was better but just because maybe I understood it better and i'll finish with this if you have to take the responsibility of others these are just three little things that you can always keep in mind if you are in leadership position be assertive so you should give clear tasks to people because this avoids the misunderstandings that can lead to anger frustration fear if the people don't understand what you ask them to do they met yet anxious okay maybe I do this our baby it wasn't this case I have to do this but so be clear be assertive and understand what your colleagues think so ask them if you're not sure and i'd like to conclude by saying that emotional intelligence is something that we all have and we all have since we are kids children I see my daughter she's my daughter medida she's two years and a half when she sees a friend at the kindergarten at the clash crying she goes and looks for the pet that the teddy bear did to do as we say in French to give to him or to her in order to make her feel better she already knows that she can help other people to feel better and at the same time she knows exactly how to manage the emotions of your parents because when she comes in Christ she always gets what she wants thank you
