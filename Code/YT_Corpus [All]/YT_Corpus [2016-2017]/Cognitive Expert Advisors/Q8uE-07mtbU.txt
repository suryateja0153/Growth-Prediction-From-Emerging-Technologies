 thanks darlin that's wonderful and it has been really good to work with you two again especially getting opening all options up and going and getting some really current information out there for the disability practitioners and the academics across the sector's I guess we just want to start with saying you know we I guess a really privileged to be a part of this we've both done our research around specific learning disabilities so to be a part of the opening all options package is some quite exciting for us and we've been able to apply quite a lot of knowledge that's come to us through the voice of practitioners and the voice of students Joe did you want to add to that yeah I just just appreciating the student perspective has been really fascinating in ensuring that their voices are heard and that this hidden disability groups that's often misunderstood is understood a little bit at us through today's conversation yeah so to start off we'll just run you through a Content page which is on the next slide Darlene so for people who are new I guess to the disability role in education you won't have that historical context of opening all options and for me when I was a new diello many many years ago it was like a bible when i came across opening all options it just opened my eyes and my knowledge to what students with specific learning disabilities were experiencing but having moved through many years of experience I realize now that there were still some shortcomings and what we've done as a project team with Darlene and Jane and Joe and myself is is look at what disability practitioners are saying other gaps in knowledge when they come into tertiary Edd and also as you know even for some who are more experienced what's missing in the knowledge that we're providing across our sector so opening all options will provide information about what sld is it provides information about a framework to work with students with sld really places emphasis on the relationship between the practice practitioner and the student we also included a screening and referral process delos are not diagonals but they do need to be really smart about picking indicators for specific learning disabilities and I guess understanding the range of profiles that come with that diagnosis of specific learning disability so that screening and referral process has been built quite explicitly for the new disability practitioner to use and for the more experienced practitioner to review and and utilize we also talked about what is involved in assessment for sld that's really important that was one of the gaps I found when I started many years ago I could identify that a person wasn't comprehending what they are reading but I didn't understand what was happening for them at a cognitive level so understanding what a psychologist will assess for assists us to determine exactly what adjustments we need to be putting in place for them so a little bit more explicit information about the different profiles of FLD and the importance of collaborating with academics and working with them to develop reasonable adjustments on behalf of the student there's also a tips for new practitioners and that's come through Joe and my research we spoke directly with practitioners who are experiencing success in the approach they have with sylvie so quite a lot of tips for new practitioners that I think will be really valuable the range of profiles aligning our adjustments and teaching strategies Joe has a particular bent on universal design strategies which is critically important to I guess including all students with disabilities but but creating an environment for students with sld to not be on the fringe to be genuinely included and participating in their learning and lastly we included academic skills support which was in a component of the last opening all options and that's a critical factor that Joe can talk more too because it came through her research with students so Joe what we know about specific learning disability yes so I guess you should have in front of you the definition through the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual but more importantly I guess just recognizing that specific learning disability is a specific and not global impairment so it affects specific areas of functioning and importantly it can impact each individual quite differently so we might find that one person will have strengths in may be communicating information verbally but may have weaknesses and processing the vision word whereas somebody else might have completely the opposite profile so we always encourage to get to know each individual student and what their processing preferences are what their strengths are and what their weaknesses are that's best determined through a formal specific learning disability assessment with a psychologist and and once we know that information we can work really closely with students on determining the best supports for them and dyslexia is the most common of all specific learning disabilities impacting eighty to eighty-five percent of people with an sld and an SLDS is in fact one of the most common if not the most common disability that we would encounter in in society across any culture or any language so it impacts approximately ten percent of the population we don't have consistently accurate statistics in Australia because it's not well supported or not well understood and in every context but we know from international research in America and the UK that it impacts approximately ten percent of the population thank you Joe and I think Darlene did you move to the next slide what we know the second slide on what we know yeah I went yeah excellent dot points on what Joe had just covered I guess so I guess the key points in there is that people with sld have a range of abilities as well as a range of difficulties in the area of academic learning and the key for us is to actually harness abilities to build strength to overcome those barriers in the academic environment and that's what this whole opening all options resource has been designed to to do to support disability practitioners now the education context in Australia I'm not sure we won't go into this in great detail but Australia is so far behind the rest of the english-speaking world we are yet to formally recognize specific learning disabilities such as dyslexia in our primary and secondary systems we're only just now seeing a really strong federal push down to the states to start to embed awareness and this is occurring in our compulsory education sector regardless of disability discrimination legislation at a federal level so what's happening for the the post secondary sector is that people are arriving I guess at TAFE and universities and other providers having very little knowledge about their learning difficulties and having received very little support or academic accommodations around their learning disabilities Joe you wanted to add to that I know because of the work you've done with students you had some really quite powerful stories yes oh thanks chilli and I guess the work that Julie and I have both done and along with my research has shown that students often get quite angry when they suddenly exposed to a whole range of amazing support in tertiary education to do with their specific learning disability and are often first day no at university or TAFE and then in their reflections back on primary and secondary schooling they often feel quite frustrated students will say well I was always excused from difficult tasks rather than empowered in developing techniques to manage those tasks so they'll get quite angry that they never learned to write well until starting University and connecting with disability supports and with the learning skills advisors and so many students will come with may be inappropriate strategies or undeveloped strategies from secondary schools so that transition is even more important in developing the right skills and awareness and support and working through with students some of their frustrations and anger as well when they reflect back on their primary schooling and secondary schooling yeah and I think Joe one of the stories or a few of the stories I listened to when you were running your focus groups with students I guess what you just touched on but the anger that was so deeply entrenched in some of those students I was so angry at being ripped off through their compulsory education system and while they appreciated the DL oh and academics in their new environment actually sitting down and listening to them it made them even more aware of what they had lost the opportunities I'd lost in the past so that was though there were really powerful stories and they've really influenced how Joe and I have designed opening all options in partnership with Joe and with Darlene and Jane really having the students voice coming through the recommendations for our practice so if you move on to the disability practitioners in tertiary education slide Darlene see the other thing that's coming through quite strongly for us is that disability practitioners in tertiary education are pioneers in Australia we we're doing research at the moment across the primary and compulsory education sector and we have teachers who are trying their hearts out but have not been equipped with the knowledge they need to support students with sld they haven't received the training in their in their pre-service teacher education they're actually seeking it on their own what we have in the tertiary education sector is 20 years of practice wisdom that our delos have shared and passed down to new diello through their very structured networks state by state so you know it's it's a shame that we don't have more research coming out of the tertiary education sector about our practice because our research has revealed that we have quite sophisticated practice coming through our dealer services in tastes and universities across Australia and I guess we really want to emphasize that quite strongly through our presentation for for us to be sharing what we have we can influence at the compulsory education sector as well the model of practice that's coming through our disability services that are experiencing success with students with specific learning disabilities and especially through Joe's research where she's worked with students who have experienced success through tertiary education Joe and I have found very strong synergies between the practitioners perspective on what what facilitates success and the students experience of what facilitates success and that can be really wrapped up quite nicely in the framework of personalized learning which is on the next slide there darling the Delos that are working really well with students with specific learning disabilities they position the learner at the center they build really strong relationships with those students from the very very early days and students who say they have developed really strong positive relationships with de ellos will also say that this is the first time somebody has sat down with me and genuinely asked what is my lived experience of dyslexia they really ask the questions but a that are meaningful for the student and want to know the nuts and bolts of how their life has worked their educational history where they have succeeded where they have had difficulties and really understand the strength and the deficits I guess of each individual student the research around personalized learning reflects beautifully i guess the model of practice that we've come across as we interview the tloz that are working successfully with students with specific learning disability they in bed Universal Design in their process they work with academics to talk about Universal Design they have a human right approach to access and genuine participation they personalize and understand every student uniquely and what their profile they understand their profile of SLV they are looking for sustainable solutions and and I guess the key to that is we can have support women in tertiary education but how do those solutions travel with that students into their world of employment so our focus is not on on um I guess expensive and commercial interventions while they're in tertiary education we have to focus on interventions that become portable and can move with students or that can be implemented in different environments so the DL O's working really well have this mindset and I have this framework that they're working to Joe did you want to add anything around that personalized learning framework yes I saw I guess just a really nice it sound given by one of my research participants found it very impressive when she met with her diello for the first time at TAFE and she said look the deal though just asked me do I prefer to listen to things or have information written down do I need to take my own notes I'll have somebody else summarize notes for me and she said it was just such a lovely conversation about her processing preferences what were her barriers and what were the supports to match her barriers and how to harness her strengths as well within her sld profile and she was so impressed with that approach so that she said it was just so simple and straightforward but something had never had at primary school or high school but just it stems from that conversation personal practice and then creating solutions based on individual needs yeah thank you and what we've done with the opening all options resource has embedded elements of the personalized learning that's critical to building the relationship with the student and to explore and assess for the students strengths and for the students difficulties and I guess to explore within the environment how with barriers to genuine participation for the individual students so that the resource has been been designed to step a new dl oh I guess through the stages of understanding personalized learning building the relationship asking specific questions and it goes so far as to actually give examples of some of those questions and if you look at the next slide Darlene learner-centered practice I guess the whole framework of opening all options is around building relationships and becoming the person that really understands the lived experience of slc for that student and exploring with that student what their strengths are so strengths based practice is integral to this model of practice and within that is solution and future future oriented interventions so solution-focused practice the Delos that we spoke to you across Victoria though very solution-focused they were able to harness the strengths of students and look to their past where they had success and it didn't have to be in an education environment but where the student could identify I feel strong competent and capable in this environment they could break that down with the student and actually pull out the the unique skills and knowledge of that student and then start to apply those strengths to a future in education applying every unique individual strengths of the student to solutions to removing barriers in the education environment and that was that's the sophisticated practice that we were coming across in our research it was mind-blowing I I must say I was in awe of some of the the Delos that we talk to you through our research and and to hear the students story behind that through Jareth research that really reinforce they actually identified some of the the Delos that we were interviewing in the other research and it really reinforced the power of the practice and the empowerment I guess that was imposed and supported for the student Joe I'm the other doc signs on safari there was building self awareness and advocacy and I think that strength that comes out of your research yeah for sure and just a couple of other things to look thinking of some of the students who said at primary school in high school they were just given a whole lot of different ways to avoid doing tasks yet just drawing on your point around building strengths and getting to know the student they mentioned many times at at TAFE and university that would then empowered with different technology or skills or strategies to actually undertake tasks and experience success for the first time and so many many participants in my research the very first opportunity to experience success was in tertiary education and those students were the same students that said I became the go-to student or the smart student in class at a full Union on however they said you know I was always in the dumbass class but that they called it at high risk or local school and almost felt left behind and unable to show their potential in secondary school so it's really interesting to see that putting into practice this mirna centered approach and building on strengths and also developing strategies to build on weaknesses as well and is actually incredibly powerful for the students that you know many of them broke down and cried when they said yeah this is my first time I've actually felt like I'm intelligent and capable so it's been quite a powerful story that we hear from these students and and in terms of building self-awareness and really the diagnosis was the most powerful factor for these students in my study m and and and I know a lot of these students have come from a context where they say don't label don't label it's going to damage them but you know what these students are labeling themselves in the playground the labels that they shared with me before their diagnosis where you know I was the dumb kid I was the stupid kid I was always told us lazy and not trying hard enough so we know these children and parents and adults are labeling and regardless of a diagnosis the difference is once students gain a diagnosis they'll saying wow okay I'm Dyslexic that's okay and say that I'm really good at this this and this and I need some assistance in these areas and they understand this profile and so many of the participants in my study said finally or not stupid you know after their diagnosis and said this is what's going on for me and gained a lot more confidence once they had their diagnosis one of the factors prior to the diagnosis was that students would globalize their self-identity to say oh I find this difficult therefore I'm stupid and would globalize that rather than after their diagnosis they would compartmentalised SAT as part of who they were and would say ah i'm actually not stupid i'm really smart but i have some difficulty and need assistance in these areas so their wholesome identity shifted once they gains their diagnosis yep and Joe that leads really nicely into the next screen on the screening process and and this is this is the first phase I guess is supporting students to start to understand what might be going on for them and also assess the dello in in determining whether a referral for a formal diagnosis of dyslexia or other sld is required and I think this is where I know when I was in the DL a role I would struggle with with making that referral because of the cost to people it's not it's not a funded support that we see for people with disability with sld so it can often cost up to eleven or twelve hundred dollars for a really really good diagnosis and report for someone with SLDS so one of the areas that I needed support in when i was at elo with understanding the screening process understanding what am i looking for before i make that recommendation i don't want to send them off and let the recommendation tell me whether they have it or not because that's a burden i'm placing on the student so the screening process is really important and in the original opening all options there was a lovely little flow chart that that could help you differentiate between whether the person had english as a second language issues or whether the person had an sld and and that was great as a starting point for me and we talked about putting that back into the new package but we actually haven't we've actually encompassed it differently by giving the diello a series of questions if we go if we're going to align this with personalized learning we need more than a flowchart to to tick off we need to actually start building the relationship so we took that flow chart and broke it down into a screening process where the diello has has I guess a sample question to ask around particular areas of difficulty that will assess the DLO to determine whether this is an indicator of dyslexia or another sld or whether this is an indicator of perhaps gaps informative education or you know impact from comprehension through medication you know there's a whole range of issues that could impact learning that are not FLD so we've developed a screening process and we've actually researched quite broadly to ensure that the questions are asking are those that would be endorsed through any sld assessment process so do you want to move to the next slide Darlene which goes into the formal assessment so from from the the screening process at the end of a screening process with a student you will have a very clear indication through the through the tool we've provided whether you need to then move on to formal assessment and that's a really important point because that's where you have some deeper level conversations with the student about I guess what they're going to face when they go into a formal assessment what it entails what unlabeled might mean to them it's where you need to contextualize like Joe was talking you've been carrying a label of stupid or dumb or not competent an assessment will give you identification of where your learning deficits are but it will also determine whether you have average to higher intelligence and that's the discrepancy we see for people with sld Joe did you want to add a little bit before we go into the formal assessment here the profiling for example yeah look certainly for for students to really understand like are typically learning disability people have average to above-average intelligence and and certainly developing a specific learning disability profile occurs through a formal assessment and once people know their strengths and often they fall within the top 5% in certain areas of processing and so will identify their strengths and how they can actually use those to improve their ability to study and what strategies are going to use and then identifying the areas where they might be quite low and for students to then develop the support strategies to help address those weaknesses as well as developing independent learning strategies so it could be using assistive technology or developing other techniques to build on their weaknesses is quite critical when we're looking at the assessments and how what that assessment means in terms of academic supports yeah it also endorses intervention it validates what we can do inside the education organization and I guess we need to do that for any person with a disability we need to have that evidence but a formal assessment will actually specify and target the intervention for us and and I can't reinforce enough how inadequate I used to feel as a new diello because I didn't understand sometimes what the profiling of an sld meant I didn't understand the terminology I didn't understand what a cognitive processing deficits really meant back then we were still in visual processing what does that mean to dyslexia but now we know you know vision vision is not connected to dyslexia and surround sound and hearing so so there's so much that an elo needs to get their head around and I think the formal assessment is critical when we have strong indicators of an SLP we need to move forward to that formal assessment because it is actually our map for intervention it if we get a good assessment back and we've actually included in the opening all options resource a referral letter that guides at the yellow on how to identify the strengths of a student the difficulties of student is experiencing and what to ask from that formal assessment and if you go to the next slide Darlene what we need from an assessment we can talk to that a little bit more but that next slide will will actually give us evidence that the FLD excess but it will profile that at sld and what we didn't have before in opening all options for understanding the various profiles that occur for individuals with a specific learning disability and even for the diagnosis of dyslexia there are so many different profiles and make up you know for that disability so what is happening for the individual I know I was guilty of applying standard interventions because dyslexia means difficulty with the written word okay well we'll have a note taker some people don't need a note taker some people need a very different intervention so so it's understanding what that might be and a very good assessment will actually break down your interventions and recommendations back in their report to you so the way we've designed your referral process in opening all options demands of the psychologist doing the assessment to give you back very explicit guidance and instructions on what will be the most meaningful and effectual interventions for the individual students profile the other the other elements of that internationally we're moving away from the discrepancy what all four sld we we no longer see discrepancy in the formal diagnostic processes but there was a recent research across Australia last year that shows that Australian psychologists are still assessing against I too so we've maintained that because eighty-five percent of the psychologists across Australia still believes that the I to assessment it's one of their strongest indicators in the discrepancy model for dyslexia so and we actually agree with that to the power of diagnosis that has come through Joe's research around I have average intelligence but I was labeled slow and dumb and put in special education classes the power of learning the capability that I have in the potential I have can slip a person's world and just open up all the opportunities there are for them and I remember one of the Delos telling me that it took quite a while for them to work through the process of referral for an adult woman who believed she was intellectually incapacitated and when she finally got her diagnosis assessment and saw that our IQ was actually above average she chief explained it to me that the woman was almost doing cartwheels down the hallway with her assessment to show her and that woman had gone on to graduate and move overseas to to work in a dream job that she'd had but prior to that she had limited it herself because of her label have done so we believe assessment is critical where the indicators show up in your screening process but we've also included all of those guidance notes and and I guess referral steps inside the let our guidance for you you can adapt and change into what you need with those but they will guide you on what you need to ask the psychologist so that you get a clear understanding of what profile of sld is occurring for that student then that leads us into reasonable adjustments I guess and Joe did you want to to introduce some the reasonable adjustments yeah sure and I guess just launching back from the diet and perceptions that others have of people with a specific learning disability that often there is no discrepancy as well and in that space where people with a specific learning disability especially once I've achieved their diagnosis will realize hey I'm actually really capable and will have quite high aspirations yet others may still have quite low expectations of people with a specific learning disability and that came through very strongly in my research in the secondary education sector where students would consistently put in the special education class which the students in my study or seemed to call the dumbass class which is pretty common language and they would just feel as though people didn't think they could achieve much so when people then applied to get into tertiary education and have been for it's really shaken that thinking around expectations we still know that many of the external exam processes that enable people to get into further education are quite a significant hurdle for people with an sld because adjustments won't be made during that exam process so many of our tertiary students at university level often will come through teeth experience success for the first time at teeth and then go on to university and so we know that's quite a typical transition pathway for people who've come from its face where they've had low expectations and then start to return into education through TAFE and then go on to university so we often find that identifying what adjustments are made can take a while and and take a little bit of trial and error and using the assessment as a founder fantastic foundation and some students have reported to me that they they don't feel entitled to adjustments so it's important to work through with the student to say these adjustments are in place to create a level playing field for you and because in their past education experiences they've either been denied adjustments or been told look it's not fair on the others not realising this is actually a legitimate disability the others don't need it that people with the specific learning disability will need specific adjustments to demonstrate their capacity so really thinking through what adjustments match the learning profile of students have a harness their strengths but also support their weaknesses so the unesco yeah that often worked out through that conversation with the student and reference to their learning profile in their assessment yeah and I guess the other point with reasonable adjustments Joey's the the DL oath that were I guess facilitating whole of organization awareness and were very good at universal design strategies across the organization had had come to understand that while they may understand the specific learning disabilities through the assessment that comes back and have a more enhanced I guess awareness of what conceptual processing is and what processing speed is and you know understand what's happening through for the profile of the student they also understood that they can't get inside every training package and every University course and understand the academic requirements the assessment requirements the inherent requirement that students are actually assessed as they work through those those units of competency or units in higher education so these d ellos work very closely with the academic and and I think the creative stories that we we got through our research about sometimes the reasonable adjustment didn't report didn't actually happen because sitting down with the student the DL oh and the academic the academic could identify a universal design approach I could do this for all students I could alter this just slightly and it would make it different for you but it would benefit all students so they started to work much more on a universal design approach that moves a student away from special and different things to just having I guess participation opened up to them through an awareness by the academic and and that was facilitated through the DL Oh having that very strong self-awareness that while they can be an expert on on knowledge about a disability with the student they need the expert knowledge of the academic to work on building adjustments that don't water down courses and our students have told us very clearly that at a time are darling as genocide is very sorry zens is ok what are the strong messages that came through from our students and and was that if you order the course down or if you if the adjustments are extreme I might qualify from this course but I never believed that I have justly deserved my award so the more that we could turn things into Universal Design and open up participation and students felt that they were actually achieving at the same level as their peers through the course the power for that student on completion was magnified you know enormously they believed they had the same skills as they're peeled peers they believed they could apply for the same employment opportunities or advance their study so how we put reasonable adjustments in place is critical and not always about having a support worker sitting beside that person with a disability one of the be i guess most powerful strategies is assistive technology and that on the next slide there darlene and what we included in opening all options was a sett framework that was has been developed and used internationally across a number of universities and vocational education sectors and set is a model for determining the appropriate I guess inclusive assistive technology that will work to the profile of a student I know that a cross education in Australia in you know years gone by we've tried our hardest but I know that we we bought expensive commercial products and because we had them rolled out across the Institute we almost all the University we almost tried to fit people into around people into square boxes to use this technology and we didn't have a really good understanding of when is voice-to-text important when is text-to-voice important when is a graphic organizer more important than any of the speech technologies so understanding our profile of sld which comes through our screening and our formal assessment process on opening all options we then begin to apply asset framework that looks at the most appropriate inclusive technologies assistive technology that we can use for that student but what we've done also really poorly in Australia is we've assumed ICT skills and we know that the latest research coming out and this is not just in Australia in english-speaking countries that this assumption around ICT skills have actually watered down and depleted skills because we've removed IT courses from a number of organizations we know that while seventy percent of households might have a computer only forty percent of our population understand how to use a computer for anything more than social media so a lot of people returning to study who have a specific learning disability are people that are a second chance learners and they don't have fundamental ICT skills so teaching how to use technology alongside teaching someone how to use assistive technology is a key ingredient that we sometimes overlooked and that's that's some really really important when we determine whether assistive technology is the right way to go forward they need to have fundamental skills in computing we for we start to introduce them to complex software programs on the other hand we also have very simple programs on our iPhone dragon dictation so you know introducing them to mainstream software solutions that can be much more Universal than commercial products where they have to come to the tafe to use that or come to the University to use it so the sett framework has been stepped out in the opening all options resource and at each point of student environment tasker tools there's guidance notes to support the downlow to work through that assessment with student the next slide moves us into another really important some area which is academic and study skills and Joe and know you had some really key points you wanted to to present here yeah sure and and just on that technology point as well suddenly from my research it was the mainstream inclusive technologies you know really following a universal design principle that the students with the specific learning disabilities embraced far more than any adaptive technology and and they just it just normalized how they used equipment that really targeted their learning profile so they would use things like word prediction or text prediction and applications or things like dragon on their iPhone or audio record lectures in a way that was quite acceptable for any student to do and so certainly using some of the mainstream herbal technology has been really beneficial for students with an SLT in terms of the academic study skills not only using technology but developing a whole range of study skills techniques and it could be around mind mapping or reading strategies writing strategies there's a whole range of techniques that students with an sld develop and often those techniques were really well developed when students met with the learning skills advisors at the universities so that often occurred through a referral from the disability adviser across to the learning skills advisor and they were able to gain some really targeted one-on-one tuition around what skills they needed to build on and the learning skills advisors were absolute experts for these students in empowering them on skills that they may have never had the opportunity to develop in the past yeah and under you you mentioned earlier about your students being excused I guess through the secondary school system and allowed not to participate in some of the academic requirements and and that's the story that we hear through the diello office often the the students that they're already failing in primary school with nfld and if they very quickly fall behind their peers and by the time they get to secondary school there they are almost excused or not expected to be able to participate at the academic level that others their age and year level are doing so so when we get them in in the church and environment they often have never really constructed an essay they don't understand the organization of constructing you know a paragraph from topic and liberating authenticating and linking to the next paragraph so some very fundamental academic skills and the success that was coming through from the disability research was the the Delos are actually doing what you said Joe and linking with learning support and working collaboratively so so they were supporting students to develop fundamental academic skills at the same time as getting their head around the content in their course and sometimes simultaneously introducing some of that mainstream software like dictating your thoughts to Dragon Rick going back over it later and not losing those thoughts my working memories getting in the way of of maintaining my thoughts so so there was this quite sophisticated model of intervention and so we have included in opening all options I guess these strategies and and the importance of embedding every element of it depending on the student and the strength and the difficulties that they're presenting with sorry Julie I just interrupt for a minute we're just getting a lot of background Julie or Joey did somebody talking in the background of your your place but we're getting a lot of male voices talking and and so forth coming through my headset to do yeah or try to they're in my home yet to hear yeah we've been trying to mute Joe it's I don't know if it's her environment but anyway so just to let you know that we've got um probably only 10 minutes to go so excellent and we've we've only really got two key points Joe around the teaching and universal design and then we wanted to talk about the communities of practice so ok actually I might let you talk to that and I'll see if I can class and that noise will mute you for the moment ok and I might I might just touch on this lightly because we've sort of included right across the presentation but but we have emphasized throughout mingle option to the power of universal design strategies and one of the I guess our findings is that power for the academic delos have knowledge the academics don't over and academics have knowledge the downlow don't have and when you come together and can I guess come up with solutions that a universal in design and can support everybody who's studying in that course that that's quite a powerful approach it also is quite empowering for the academic because it's enhancing their teaching practice as well so teaching and universal design strategies are a core to the whole process it it guides academics to become much more explicit if we support our academics to understand how to break tasks down and give explicit instructions to do that for every student is really important so instead of changing it up just for one or two change it up for everybody and make your instructions extremely explicit so that there's no confusion that can happen to break an assessment task down and be very explicit for a person with an flv that means they can look at part one and work on that and what they tell us is to look at the whole whole assessment task and everything that's required can be so overwhelming for them that they give up before they start so working on small parts of assessment tasks as they work through is really really important teachers giving practical examples and once again being explained extremely explicit it's a learning curve for them so some de ellos actually worked with their department that did the teacher or academic professional development and got inside there too and started to deliver around practical examples explicit teaching explicit development of assessment tasks and the change that came out of that was with quite powerful when you ask an academic to assess their assessment question and and hand that out to other peers and have it interrogated and brought back that's quite a powerful process and a vulnerable process for many but for the students the outcome of that was really really powerful because the assessment question became very very clear for everybody so you know the DL oh really does need and we know this is the allure to work comprehensively and collaboratively across the organisation to embed Universal Design wherever possible and I guess assistive technology in learning centers it's critical as well we've put different tips up on opening all options for you to to look at on how to do that but instead of working with one person for text-to-speech having having you know information around the organization that says if you require ticket to read text to speech or headphones for text-to-speech please contact the help desk so you know like just making it very normal to have information like that available for students and the last point that we wanted to talk about was I guess the the Delos that were evidencing really sophisticated practice for students with specific learning disabilities belonged to a community of practice and it you know in Victoria was the TD and the tape disability Network they share together they learn together they trusted each other they talked openly about when they thought they might have made a mistake when they had an assist deeply enough when they had imposed an intervention without really understanding the profile of the student and through their sharing and honesty they had developed a place where they could really build professional develop development collaboratively collaboratively so we can't reinforce enough how important that community of practices I know as a as a diello many years ago I went to tdn and I was overwhelmed by the knowledge that was sitting around the table and I was too scared to say I thought I'd stuffed up and it took me I guess 12 months before i had that level of comfort and could really draw on the expertise around the table i used to go every month or six weeks and suck up all the information and take it away but I didn't really openly give off myself and get enough information and guidance back the Delos that are at that sophisticated level they are calling on each other constantly they don't have to wait for a meeting they've made their networks they're really developing themselves and they are practicing through a professional framework which is that personalized learning model Darlene we might need to leave it I think our timing is yeah definitely I don't know Joe if you just want to make the last final statement them now I think Matt we're pretty close to it with something five minutes to go so if people have any question though there was one one question is what percentage of students in the focus group that you had Joe were from killed or Aboriginal backgrounds none of them from Aboriginal backgrounds but probably only a very small percentage three or four from other cultural backgrounds yep and the only other question we've got actually is around the opening or options resource and so just to let you know it actually is on ads its website so that's a dc-8 dot edu au /o oh but it's also in the side button of the website and so there's different pages with different content so if you are wanting to share information with teachers or academics you can certainly copy the URL and send it to them you can print pages from that website I'm from from Adsit and from those pages in particular and as Julie and Joe I'm showcasing their presentation there are you know tools in there such as the letter out to your DSS the person doing assessment and so forth so hopefully will you find it very useful it's been fantastic to work with Julia and Joe on this project and to revamp opening all options so no other questions any final remarks Julian Joe before we finish no thank you darlin it was great to be able to share it today yeah and thank everybody for your patience we've had a lot of technical difficulties in Judy's end and then we've had Joe's lovely he'll probably talking in the background so it's been a challenging and webinar so I think everybody for their patient they probably haven't seen the distress that Jane and I've been feeling this back in hopefully but I'm once again we're really excited to have brought you another webinar and I hope you've enjoyed it and look forward to getting your feedback around opening all options so take care and thank everybody you
