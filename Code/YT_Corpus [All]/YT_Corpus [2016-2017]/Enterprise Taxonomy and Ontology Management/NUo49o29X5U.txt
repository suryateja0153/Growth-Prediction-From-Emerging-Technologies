your website discussing today's topic will be Eric ogren senior security analyst 451 research and rami asad CEO and co-founder of distill networks Eric Ogren senior security analyst in the enterprise security practice hit 451 research is the industry's thought leader behind web behavior analytics prior to joining 451 research Eric held marketing leadership positions with security vendors such as RSA security situation ties or and ocana Eric holds a BS in mathematics from the University of Massachusetts and an MS in computer science from Boston University you can follow him on Twitter at Eric Algren Rami Assad is the CEO and co-founder of distill networks the first easy and accurate way to identify and police malicious website traffic blocking 99.9 percent of bad BOTS without impacting legitimate users with over 12 years in telecommunications network security and cloud infrastructure management rummy continues to advise enterprise companies around the world helping them embrace the cloud to improve their scalability and reliability while maintaining a high level of security follow Romney on twitter at Rami Assad now before we begin the presentations we have the first of two poll questions we'd like to ask the question is what was your first hint that your website has a bot problem now your options are we saw performance spiking at odd times our service desk received a high number of website complaints we noticed logon attempts like increasing big time we started finding our web content all over the place our our website fraud metrics are too high now please make your selection by picking one of these responses click in the radio button to the left of the text and then be sure to click on the submit button at the bottom now this is the first of two poll questions we'll be asking and we also will invite your participation in the live Q&A session that will be after the presentations now to participate in the QA remember you can type your question at any time please be sure to click that big submit button when you're ready well let's see what our audience has to say about their website bought problem according to our audience a bit over a quarter say that they saw performance spiking at odd times the same number noticed log on attempts increasing big time slightly fewer said they started finding their web content all over the place and finally about ten percent each said that their service desk received a high number of website complaints and the website frog metrics were too high now we thank you for participating in this first poll question Rami I believe it's time to hand things over to you yeah you know it's it's interesting I almost wish that we had an other or I don't know category just because we find that oftentimes people don't understand what's happening with bots and I think that's really why we're here today the agenda is to talk about the new landscape of bots the advanced persistent bots that that we've categorized what impact that they have on your security and fraud and how your existing toolset might be able to help might not be able to fill the gaps a hundred percent and what applied web behavioral analytics can mean for your business now the very foundation before we get started I think it's important to define what is a bot to help the audience understand exactly what we're talking about here and a bot is just any kind of automated computer program across the web it's mimicking a transaction that a human would make but it's done so in a programmatic way there's a lot of good and bad BOTS that exist out on the web you create your website but what we found is that fifty fifty percent of the traffic that's accessing your website is automated of that you have the good BOTS like search engines and and third-party tools that are aggregating content for the purposes of social media or search engine results but then you have a lot of nefarious spots and that's what we want to concentrate on today that makes up about twenty percent of your web traffic so one in five users us your site is some sort of malicious bot these automated bad BOTS have gotten to be more and more sophisticated over time whereas ten years ago it might have been pretty easy to catch and identify a bad actor what we found in our latest bought report is that eighty-eight percent of bad BOTS that access your website are categorized in this advanced persistent bot category and what advanced bot means is that it's mimicking human behavior it supports cookies it's it's some sort of browser automation or persistent means that it's hard to get rid of it whether it's rotating through IPS or hiding behind proxies or across the residential networks they are very very difficult to identify at the IP level and so when we break down this taxonomy of what are these bad BOTS really like what we found is fifty three percent of the malicious bots that we've identified can actually load an execute JavaScript they can interact with your site like a true browser whether that's using a tool like selenium or phantom or automating a true web browser through malware the majority of bots are real web browsers and that can execute JavaScript even higher of them a majority of those bots are mimicking true human behavior that means they're pausing in between requests that means that they are supporting cookies and and spoofing true user identities when you look at that number you find that it becomes harder and harder to set up simple checks to block these spots another really key differentiator with how bots have started acting nowadays is that BOTS have started distributing their footprint across a wider swath of IPs in the past you bots were pinned to one IP at a time and in doing so you could set up an access control list to block the malicious requests but what we found is that seventy-three percent of bots now using multiple IP addresses twenty percent of those use over a hundred IP addresses in their attack so if you're trying to block a bot based on an IP you're ending up playing a game of IP whack Amole because they're just too dynamic to be able to block using one IP another way that BOTS obfuscates their their identity is to randomize the user agents that they're using so we find that in conjunction with accessing the specific resource or coming in from a specific IP a lot of bots in thirty six percent of which or using multiple user agents in their attack now these user agents aren't random made up user agents they're actually correlated to the most popular browsers so it's almost impossible to differentiate between a legitimate browser requests and a bot spoofing their user agent in fact in 2015 the the breakdown is listed above with twenty-six percent being from chrome seventeen percent being from spoofing Firefox twelve percent spoofing Internet Explorer and five percent spoofing Safari and that breakdown correlates with what true web traffic actually looks like that's an overview of how these bad bots are made up now let's talk a little bit about what these bad bots are doing why has anybody building BOTS to begin with so we address that nineteen percent of your web traffic is made up of these bad BOTS and these bad bots are doing a number of different things whether it's committing fraud stealing information trying to brute force their way into your web applications or bringing your servers to their knees there's a number of different ways that bad BOTS can hurt you so let's talk a little bit about some of the more prevalent ways the first is web scraping scraping comes in a couple of forms but it's the collection of application content or data it's using BOTS to harvest information and one of the ways that BOTS do this or one of the reasons BOTS do this is to steal unique content or data think about a scenario in which Yelp or white pages has publicly made available a plethora of information that's proprietary to them the business listings that they have are their bread and butter and they want to protect that from somebody harvesting that in mass and so you would want to stop web scrapers from being able to siphon off all of that information another thing that web scrapers do is specific to the e-commerce vertical and that's price scraping price scraping is when a competitor indexes your entire inventory identifies what you have in stock what you don't how much are you selling it for and then can create an automated strategy to adjust their pricing based on your inventory and prices this makes you less competitive and gives them a competitive advantage another very important way that hackers and bad guys leverage box is vulnerability scanning and that's when they crawl and fuzz your application to find weaknesses and possible vulnerabilities in your web app this is the first step in how hackers identify vulnerabilities in a web application and they can hone in on the attack giving hackers an advantage because they don't have to test every individual field in fact they can crawl your entire site in minutes and find the areas in which they can concentrate to penetrate your application as quickly as possible another thing that allows a hacker to achieve scale is the credential cracking credential stuffing or all around account takeover that are leveraged by bot attacks this is where a hacker can either try to brute force their way in to a known login or take a list of usernames and passwords such as the LinkedIn breach or the Ashley Madison breach and upload them into a bot and find where the overlaps exists in your login page as the ones that have been breached this allows them to compromise your user accounts without ever actually penetrating your system somebody else's breach all of a sudden becomes your problem and again this gives the hacker a lot of leverage because they can do this in mass very very quickly leverage and automation is the key here behind bots and the next the next threat is exactly that as well carding card cracking and cashing out fraudulent credit cards is another way that bad guys leverage BOTS they can either use box to validate fake credentials such as finding a taking a stolen credit card number and figuring out the correct CID in zip code associated with it or taking a list of known credit card stolen credit card information and seeing where which credit cards are still valid and which ones aren't then they can even automate the next step and take those stolen credentials those valid credit cards at work and automating the cashing out across your site that's going to result in fraudulent charge backs back to your business things that you should have been able to stop from the get-go another bada tak that we see very very often is spamming where BOTS plant malicious links and comments or just try to spam your forms in general spam can be annoying to very very dangerous and it can impact your user experience and cost you a lot of legitimate users now the one key thing to remember is bot attacks don't just attack your web application bot attacks can also target the api's that power your web apps or native mobile when you block box across your web application immediately the bad guys look for other entry points into your site or into your database in app and back end and one of the easiest ways to do that is to target the API endpoints directly so it's important to not just put a strong protection against your web app but also look at your security posture holistically and include us it include a security strategy for your api's as well so I think that that gives us a pretty good understanding of what BOTS look like and what types of attacks these BOTS can be leveraged for I think that leads us into a the next poll question that it does and it's time to ask our audience to join us in this poll question the question is what action is most appropriate when detecting an undesirable malignant bot your options are drop the connection ASAP redirect to a corporate service page issue a secondary authentication request that only a human can answer delay responses maybe the bot will go away or don't make them mad log the bot information now please select one of these responses by clicking on the radio button to the left of the question and then be sure to click the submit button at the bottom right of your screen now while you're taking this I want to remind everyone that in just a bit we will have the interactive Q&A portion of today's webinar now to participate in this you can ask your question at any time by typing your question into the Q&A box then be sure to click on that submit button the answers are coming in so let's take a look at what you had to say according to more than half of you the correct answer is issue a secondary authentication request that only a human can answer the second most frequent response dropped the connection ASAP with the other responses getting lesser marks from our audience now we thank you for participating in both of our polls so far keep that interactive Q&A in mind and with that it's time to turn things over to Eric Oh Graham Eric it's all yours thank you so much Curtis and first of all let me apologize because Robbie was the star and he's a tough act to follow I should have insisted I go first but appreciate your tanning and let me just talk a little bit about the business side and what's happening in the market some of what I'm seeing it at 451 and we'll be talking about web behavior analytic sins and cops of reports as well and actually quite interested in your feedback on all of this it's cool stuff and and I can't tell actually from the last poll questions it was pretty interesting more than half going for the secondary authentication request and and that actually is a strong thing because it means you just don't want alerts and have worked for security teams to do or get people in the way you want you want your users to self-help and to be able to determine you know whether it was a human or a bot and get along with your business so i think that's that's a really really nice sign anyway let me start with what i got here i was going to look for a report i did when i was an early analyst back at the yankee group and the web has changed a lot and i just couldn't find the report but it did see something that were as quoted by bob really know who is us I think rights would you know still active in the security space and he says today's well connected applications newborns of firewalls and they saying that application security gateways you know ass can't grow up fast enough so that's a direct quote I thought it was beautiful one of the cool things about it what Bob road is that he did this on may first 2004 it's over ten years ago which which just blew me away it's amazing sometimes you know the need to innovate and the need to keep up the attackers change all the time and it's just dramatic and you kind of got census Roberts going through his stuff is it got great tools they have great distribution mediums they have an economic business model that works is a staggering how good they are and here we are you know 10 12 years later and we're just catching on to the fact that the most dangerous attacks your websites you are taking advantage of vulnerabilities and using exploit code to take advantage of business logic they're just using the website functionality against itself in automated ways that allow them to Tromp through your site and you know help themselves the confidential data or fraudulent transactions and other ways of disrupting the business so this is a little bit of background as we get through go through this i started with pci actually the payment card industry specification i don't know how to slide doesn't look right but it's you should see the PCI security status council logo on top and I chose how to some two thousand eight and the version 1.2 the spec and section 6.6 is the section that really refers to web app security and the main thing there is even in 2008 is all about software defects and pci actually gave you a choice of off of how you wanted to respond to the requirements you can't could do vulnerability assessments ie scan your websites fix the code integrate with the dev ops and treat it that way or you could put a web app firewall in front in the hopes that you could do some virtual patching and some recognition of some of the most common vulnerabilities but the thing is none of it really talked about business logic it was is totally vulnerability and an exploit it will send some of the some of the specifics so with Olaf which is you know similar similar vendors do the same type of project you can see in 2010-2013 not a lot of change going on in the in the world of big big problems out of that there's a bot at the browser and you know not too many humans are entering sequel code and you can see over the course of three years the big big worrisome owasp and pci a sequel and sequel injection your cross site scripting you know you can see the list there but but it's pretty common the one thing that struck me was the fact that like i said everything begins with a piece of code at the other end so i'm not suggesting some what's that web behaving analytics replace whereas because they said many of you have west now and you need them for compliance you probably have them in passive mode and as an auditing capability but you're also probably at the point where you realize from a security standpoint you know you need something that's looking at the logic and looking at automated actions not so much looking at the software defects and I mean honestly one of the reasons the RAF the market have gotten the way it has is because if you're going to fix something you fix it in the code and that makes sense the attacks of Romeo's talking about you know can't fix in a code it means people look logging you need to login you need to be able to navigate through your websites and that's just that's just that but we are seeing some attractions I don't want to beat up we're outside in the state of his body's too much you know standards tend to follow the market anyway but but here we are the new pc I specification came out in April just just just not quite two months ago and there's a little softening in the language you still have a choice you can you can scan and tweet vulnerabilities and and and do the DevOps thing only now instead of saying laughs it kind of says well for example laughs it's starting to be a bit broader and looking at for technical solutions to prevent web based attacks so I think that's actually pretty strong statement and then and it's you know to PCI's credit you know it's how to change direction like that I mean you're basically a meeting that you've got to do a bit more and that the standard has to be a bit broader base to be able to reflect what's happening in the real world and we've seen Assam all lost as well which is uh it's got a big acronym but it's a like open web application security project i think is what it stands for but it is pretty easy to find your documents online and yeah I've given you links here they've actually moved on as well with what they call em ontology so basically they needed a common set of definitions for many of the tax that Romney was talking about you know for me I tend to look at the blue circles because it needs details and gets a little close you know what some of them some of them can be but the biggest one group beans you see our anti automation ie botched and abuse of functionality which can be also bought driven really it's an abuse of functionality is when you're following the rules just doing too much or so if you look at those and can think of your own websites and you'll need for security think of the impact of automation think of people you know if a bot actually was able to get into an authenticated account and take it over it can do anything you want in your website because it has permissions to do it so how do you detect that you'll never get it from looking for viability is your only chance only chance is to have a behavioral approach and to be able to look at things and correlate them over time to be able to get a good model going for us what's happening with your websites the other nice thing about WBA is that you know this is a 4 314 we do such called voice of the enterprise we ask and do quantitative research in this case it was just fascinating to me the difference between vendor perception in user perception of what's really important in security product it's and it is actually kind of funny that the users say hey I need to support mission critical processes and the vendors don't even have that their responses don't even don't even show in the list you know the users talk about working with a background with don't involved users integrate with other products the vendors tend to talk about who out of the box keep it experiences and usability and ease of deployment so it's very much of your security teams on the enterprises such as yourself and looking in one direction and vendors in the tip in the traditional security markets you know looking in other directions cool thing about WBA web behavior analytics is there's no place we're security lines with the business and needs to align of the business more than 10 websites because that is the face of your business to your supply chain to your employees to your customers and being able to separate you know users from box is an absolutely critical for a step to be able to you know support the business so what makes web behaving analytics special you know first of all it takes dead aim on how to mated box it really is the it all starts with is this a human or is this a software automation at the other end Rami was great I mean if you see you know browsers running on Linux machines or you know different patterns of access it just sort of is a red flag that they just can't be people that has to be a machine probing away at my website let's figure out how we want to deal with it in a lot of cases as you guys picked up on asking for like a capture or some other type of authentication really a way of sorting the bots they get an unexpected response and they don't quite know what to do with it how to deal with it and away they go but it's the only practical way of detecting abuses of business logic you just have to be able to look and see who's using the system and what the tab usage patterns alike and be able to detect anomalies and act on those technically so technically what we see is there is a the time dimension is very important so there's an element of del of time of you know have we seen this machine before are we looking at things and building the right kind of emphasis as to what's happening with the user and those are things that security products that look for exploits tend not to have you know those those types of approaches are very performance you know hit or miss is like okay the skin let's look make a decision you know either recognize it or don't and move on but you need a little bit of time to be able to figure out if it's a human if the bot if if you've got some web behavior that's not acceptable for you oh I don't see at this point you know I don't see wda they don't recommend that its replacement for web app firewalls at all I mean you need laughs for compliance you have them they're doing good things for you they just do different things and I think w might retain WBA's move past them by looking at the bigger problem of automated user users but that's that so this is a sweet I like when I talk about business logic sometimes it gets it gets pretty simple and it starts with just a login password is it's a great example of how you can abuse business logic and if you think about it every website that you with indicate a user tells you if you're in a knot and they have to yeah you put in a credential I'll username a password and it tells you you're in use your page and you where it tells you you're not and so if you are an attacker it's a beautiful thing all you do is this newest custom credentials in there and let the website tell you yea or nay now you do need to have research available with your your WBA vendor because you know the attackers aren't stupid they change so they know what counts might get shut down so as they make your list and farming out to the bach community you might say okay you only try try once or try it twice so don't lock the accounts don't leave tracks but statistically because we'll have tens of thousands of bots you know probing away we're going to cover every user name give you create sure we have and we're going to have a good chance of finding something that works you know they only need you know three percent hit rate when you're starting with like a hundred thousand or a million credentials is if you a lot to work with so so bottom line is this is the type of thing we think about you know so it's web scraping you you know the bots just follows the links they follow what the website gives them once they log in with with that and find a valid username then they just here at all permissions and all the capabilities of that user off they go it's not a bad thing and they never have to write exploit codes so it's pcs and there are some neat tool kits so actually want to get a pretty good job of running through these so I'm I give an example here they're the credential stuffing an account takeover your to me are related you know the credential stuffing is using a tool maybe like a century NBA where you buy a big list of usernames and passwords or credentials that have been stolen somewhere and you launch them out of sight you give it to the bot farm and you say you try to use these you in the bots provo egg and the other copy do some sort of you know randomization to make sure that they're hard to track and harder for the website to determine that it's being subjected to a credential stopping attack and really obviously it's just a sheer arithmetic in economics the the attacker is looking for three to four percent return and if they find it then they have a list of valid user names and passwords that they can then use to enter this inter privileged areas of the sites to scrape confidential data to purchase things or be able to copy your sensitive data and you sell it on the market they basically do anything anything they want so those two are very much related and Robbie had a good point and tennis took away one of my examples is one of the things about duplicate credentials most most users use the same passwords and usernames I mean the username might be their email address and they'll use look you know the name is a cat or something but some a lot of times what I'm seeing in the market is if one company gets breached in their passwords get exposed those passes a valid at you know competitive organizations so if you pick your favorite store and use it against breach is probably good chance that those credentials will be used at a similar type of store and and so probably comes yours even though it was some other vendors other enterprises security incident but you stay on the problem so I go ahead yeah I was going to say that the latest example is Mark Zuckerberg he had his linkedin password was the same as his twitter password and as same as his pinterest password and when the linkedin breach happened a couple months back somebody discovered that through automation that he they could use the same password on twitter and pinterest and it was something as simple as da da da i think but it they were able to hijack his public twitter and pinterest accounts a Harvard guy use da da da but but actually it's a good point it's just human nature right to because who can remember different passwords and you know funny characters and all that kind of stuff if they get reused and you know what's one place gets hacked you may not even know it as your business and your cats are going to be taken over and then all sudden you're on the hook for whatever evil things that attacker does you know one of my favorites was and I'm not sure this is what are your customs not Robbie but it was the web scraping try scraping scenario and yet same idea it just uses an applications designed for humans that what's a bot gets in there it just causes havoc in this case it's a hospitality mysterious actually was cruise line and the way their website worked is it was built for humans you know demand pricing so what a human would click on a cabin it would put a reservation hold on it for 15 minutes because it knows it takes time for the human to make a decision maybe they have to run and get their wallet they have to fumble through the wallet to find a credit card that's not maxed out and then they have to you know do the bookings so the website would actually reserve that qavvik for 15 minutes as soon as as the user clicked on it well what would what happened what this company found was that one spot started crawling through it because the demand pricing they wanted to be able to competitors and aggregators who wanted to know what the latest price was you know for their own business you should just picture you know picture a ship basically all the links for each deck in each cabin the bot would automatically click on the cabins to look at the price and it would initiate a 15 minute reservation hold so basically that company's whole shift and then fleet was was being taken offline for reservations by bots that were were going through scraping prices I just it just I just love that thing it's designed to humans they didn't check for Bible they check for BOTS now and I think the our digital customer but it has a very very serious business impact and it was something that they had to address it and they dressed it with with the anti by capability and this one is another example of unintended side effects it's you know the titles is my mistake and apologized for that but what it is is this shows two lines its credit card fraud rates in the UK and I put this in here because we're going to be seen this same phenomenon in the US so if 10 DS if you have an e-commerce site know that your card-not-present fraud ie fraud through websites is going to start escalating so what this shows is in the UK pink introduced in 2002 2003 and this I was shifting the liability but as became more difficult to duplicate credit cards because of the pins you see that line of card present fraud you're dropping dropping way down to about looks like asymptotic to about ten percent now but the card-not-present fraud websites which had been kind of low before the chip and pin now skyrockets you know it's probably low before because you know to do substitute website you have to put in a shipping address and there's a bit more risk to the attacker but now that you can't replicate a card it you know it's a lot usually go through websites and you know do a CNP type of fraud so if you're in the US expect to see this very same curve it is happening UK it's there's a similar curve in Canada that's that's a little bit more recent and we're going to Anya up knife there's no doubt in my mind we're going to see the same thing happening here here in the US all right let me just wrap up I guess we quick words I want to leave time for questions and in respect your times the web behavior analyst market is moving and I'm writing about it now I actually give it to my copy editors tomorrow so it will be out in about a week but a lot of vendors most of young because it is a new phenomenon it is actually looking at the web security problem in a much healthier way much more scalable way you our vendors are healthy they're finding solutions to finding big strategic corporate wide deals and you know I'm Santino a new vendor every other month so it's a it's a pretty lively space and it reflects it and you know my opinion overall trend towards more probabilistic models you know it's not and you saw that too is a sin occasion than your responses it's not a matter of block or allow it's a matter of hey this looks like a human just looks like a bot let's make a decision that is best for our business and our sensitivity and and move on and that I think that's where security should be actually so a couple wrecked few recommendations the first one sounds pretty basic but it is something that very to not be very very difficult for security teams is build a cross-functional proof-of-concept team it and this is this probably the biggest one you know I see I talk to vendors I talked to CSOs as proud of my job and what I find is a lot of times security people are in their own little world you know then we have our own language but we don't really know how to deal with lines of business the fraud people the head of fraud might have you looking at money and they don't really you look at technologies in operations people are you know yet yet again a different view of the same things it turns out a lot of us has the same issues and the same types of problems and we want to agree on us and we have success metrics but we have different ways of measuring that because I think it's really really key that you build a cross-functional team for pocs and and make sure it covers the line of business and you know some of the vendors start with lie the business even more than security but include the operations IT ops and networking teams and the anti-fraud units as well because it all going to have a piece of this and with that you'll you'll find some agreement on success metrics again probably saying you know the easy one is number bots as a good at a dad in my cruise line example of the case of web scraping but it's a hard problems also illustrative of how hard the problem is if you want good lots search engines to come through and give you good rankings good ratings now you want to apply chain partners to come through and get the latest information and help you with your business but you want to be able to chop off you the unauthorized attacks so it's a tricky thing so what you want any success metrics is start thinking of bots you know how many good how many authorized how many unauthorized what the percentages of overall traffic include help desk calls include logon aborts if you happen to be an econ type of application you'll think of the shopping basket you know think of the deal sizes just a lot of times you know BOTS or if users are having a tough time then then they they only grab one or two things but and we've seen that the deal sizes go up certainly the completion percentage just go up because a lot of times a bot will come in until it gets to the point of shopping cart and then it might you know what it has the prices it needs and has the information needs it just sort of drops off and what you don't realize what your business managers may not realize is once you strip the bots away there's a real opportunity to do more business with with customers because they've got better intelligence and the Frog percentage which generally might take a little bit longer time to get but that's a was in peace and measure it gets a control side and I I've seen this done very very successfully in the past with with web applications so if you have multiple instances of your site you put your web behavior analytics in front of you know one instance and not in front of the other but have the same metrics and compare the traffic compare the results and you'll be really impressed with in like a week of what the WBA will do for you and then you can be able to be in a better position to predict the impact it's going to have on your business a really important thing there and lastly this is my you know pat on the back you know I think you guys are doing the right things the fact that you here listening and learning about web behavior analytics and what distilled networks can do is a good thing but this is keep in mind that you know I'd like to talk about ROI and alignment with the business but it turns out when selling security you know for whatever reason ROI is still very low on the list I mean security first and foremost is preventing damage from attacks reducing the risk to the business so as you talk about web behavior at looks as you talk about you know so anti-bot capability is an anti-fraud capability you my recommendation is approach it first through from a risk standpoint and requirements where it says reputation of brand risk here is number five to me that's really the user experience and protecting user experience so that's probably the best thing if you get power I out of it you know from the fraud side of things or from your fewer servers because your performance is going to go up that's all well and good but you know we're still security people so my suggestion is keep the security stuff front and center as you you work cross-functionally to promote this so with that yeah I thank you so much and I'm going to turn it back to Curtis and Ronnie and I think what QA is not far away for us thanks Eric I I think that was a fantastic overview from a business perspective of what it means how how it's impacting the business and some of the things we should consider when buying a product and know in the space so before we turn it completely over to Q&A wanted to just do a quick plug along the lines of the premise that you were talking about in making a buying decision so this still is the first easy and accurate way to detect bots versus real people we focus our business solely around bought detection and mitigation and if you have a bot problem we think that where you uniquely position to help there's a lot of a lot of different types of tools as you alluded to in this category but of the tools were the focused one on bot detection and we use inline fingerprints to detect malicious spots and fingerprint them as opposed to relying on playing IP whack Amole we aggregate that knowledge across our entire data our entire customer base having been in business for five years we have amassed a a wealth of knowledge on what malicious spots already exist out there and we leverage machine learning to be able to predict when behavior is going to be malicious not waiting for malicious behavior to occur and then react to it we instead analyze your web traffic find anomalies and print when somebody is going to be malicious and then we have that feedback mechanism you talk about the the poll results that we had in one of the things that we do when we suspect that it's a bot coming in we challenge it with a test the second second test that only a human can answer whether it's a email validation or randomized types of captcha which we alternate the types of challenges that we present but we do so to get feedback on whether or not this is a legitimate user and that feeds the machine learning algorithm but allows us to be more aggressive in how we intercept traffic and we do this to help businesses get an understanding of what bad bot traffic exists across their site what are they doing and we've reached a ninety-nine percent affectivity on identifying and blocking malicious BOTS but the most important part is that we want to do this as you said Eric in a way that is easy for the IT team to deploy and doesn't have a huge overhead for the team on managing it once you set up the business rules the business logic of what you want to do with these odds it's our platform our software that's going to automatically catch the latest spots without you going in and tweaking it every single day and on that note you mentioned earlier that not only should you have cross-organizational understanding of what a POC should look like and agree on success metrics you should try it you should measure and test and understand what's happening and validate your assumptions well we want to give everybody on this webinar an opportunity to do that and to do that we're giving two months of free service along with a free traffic analysis so that you can sit down and at least have a better understanding of what your web traffic looks like what the bad bots are doing and make an informed decision about whether or not the bad bots are impacting you in a way that you should invest in a solution like this still how cool is that I didn't I didn't know you're going to do that Romulus that's pretty good so I think we have a few questions and a little bit of time to take them so I'll hand it back to the moderator to see if there's a couple choice questions that might be applicable all right Thank You Ronnie we appreciate that and before we get started with today's Q&A we'd like to ask our audience members to please fill out the feedback form that's just opened on your computer if your popup blockers have prevented the form from launching on your computer you can click the red survey icon at the bottom of the screen to complete the form please press the submit answer button at the bottom of the page we thank you in advance for taking the time to fill out the feedback form your participation in the survey will allow us to better serve you and now on to the question-and-answer portion of our of em as a reminder to participate in the QA just type your question into the text box located to the right of the presentation window or click the Q&A icon on the bottom of your screen then be sure to click the submit button now we're going to begin with a general question that's come in um and roaming i'm going to ask this to you first but the audience member says can you tell us a little more about botnets themselves what they are precisely and how they can hurt you so botnets that's a great question botnets are a group of bots that have been created through malware are taking over end-user computers so there's a number of ways in which bad guys can deploy bots it can they can deploy them in the cloud infrastructures they can create them on local machines oftentimes so what they do is they use some sort of malware to install bots on end-user computers that makes them harder to detect and botnets are just a grouping of that it's not effective to have one bought at a time instead it's the bad guys like to disturb trib you dare attack and so they created cluster of bots together and that's what a botnet is yeah and there's a bit of economy there so you know botnets really enable low and slow attacks and this is this is why you know the vendors are responsive to what's going on so they could be you know 10,000 you know members of the botnet each doing two or three you request at a time that that translates to like a 30,000 requested a new website but it looks like is thirty thousand users and it's very very difficult for your website to be able to determine hey is this it these users or not so it's uh that's kind of what makes botnet special as you you know the attackers rent out time they download code and off they go and get get the results very good and I've got to like any malware answer that involves a term out of BBQ that's a good step forward the next question is one about a term that was used in running I believe that was you that was using this term you mentioned it browser validation or spoofing by validating each incoming requests as self-reported and the question is self reporting what is self reporting in this context so in any sort of web transaction the web server is in the incoming infrastructure gets a data set from the user that the user sends back about what it is so it identifies the type of browser it says that this is mobile or a desktop it says these are the languages I I understand and these are the this is an operating system that I'm running on and there's a list of different headers that get passed back to the web infrastructure from the user now a lot of times BOTS don't are lying about who they are they don't come in and raise they hang their hand and say I'm a bot instead they spoof these headers and say I'm just chrome running on a Windows machine but this information is voluntarily given up it's easy to spoof for the bots and so it's important to not take that at face value the self-reporting aspect is that they can set it to be whatever they want they can say on the teacup coming in on a Windows machine and oftentimes the web infrastructure doesn't do anything with that so whether it says something legitimate or illegitimate it's important to interrogate that and validate that it truly is exactly what they say they are that they're not lying about their identity all right very good now Rami this one's coming back to you because it's someone who says that they really would have liked to understand more about exactly what it is your system is doing I are there tracking codes you know is there a dns change required can you give just a brief look at how your system works and what the customer has to do to make it work on their system so we have a number of different deployment options we don't we want to make this as easy as possible and often times it's a security team or the infrastructure team that's deploying the technology so we didn't want to burden them with code that they had to integrate it into their web app that way you don't have to go back to your engineers or your developers instead we sit in line with your web traffic and there's a number of ways you can do that you can either use our cloud option using a dns change to route your traffic through us we can scrub the best about traffic and then send the remainder of the good traffic back to you or you can deploy us in a private an instance behind your firewall as an inline device within your infrastructure so a physical or virtual appliance that we give you that lets us to plug and play and detect the bots within your DMZ we appreciate that detail and Eric with our next question I want to come to you first we'll get raw me to answer it as well but the question is sort of a belt and suspenders approach do you recommend having both a WAF and a dedicated anti-bot solution like distilled aha well i definitely recommend if you have a laugh now keep using it you know don't get rid of it I think you definitely need a WB a solution like this till I think there's no in my opinion is no question about that at all and if you have a new company you have to choose you know I would definitely look at the w it be a first and then think of you know vulnerability scanning of my web app code because most of the issues with it with a laugh and this is why they're they're placed in auto mode most of the things that laughs finds are going to be fixed in the software you know it's going to generate a request back to engineering and to be fixing the code so they kind of do different things Curtis so i don't i don't see WBA's replacing whereas least not yet you know it may happen but not today so they go if your new company then i would say yeah go web behavior because that actually is going to protect more if your business and more of your website and and and then look at the code for some of the detailed of vulnerability and exploit issues your website might have kind of good avani somehow good yeah i would absolutely agree with eric i think the the use cases are different between a wife and one of the vendor in the web behavior analytic space and oftentimes i think we've talked about this the web behavior analytic space of detecting bots there's usually a meaningful business reason behind this and that's why you know as you alluded to eric you should have multiple stakeholders at the table because it's not just an infrastructure issue or a security issue it also can have really important business implications and so oftentimes laughs are just for compliance or they're there passively detecting vulnerabilities in in the web application that you can patch within the application itself whereas the the web behavior analytics no matter what you write your application to do you're not going to be able to address some of the concerns that are brought up there very good well we have time for one more very quick question this is another question of definition and Eric will come to you first on this arm what is fingerprinting oh is that all a fingerprinting is sensing the configuration it's actually probing and building a profile of the device and the browser and the software that that is accessing the system so its operating systems as its you know some of the network configurations if the premise is you know that computers you know no two machines look like you know we all have different applications we run adults at different levels and fingerprinting might be I seen 256 a nice even number type of attributes that get collected and so the intersection of those in union of those you know really represents the fingerprints of that device and allows the the web behavior analytics a little bit more information in determining if it's a repeat visitor and if that repeat visitor has a history of fraud or history of a bad activity because it just helps in that type of layered approach yeah you nailed it on the head Eric I think you know when you think about it this is the evolution of tracking users is it for the longest time we we've been tracking users based on IPS but unfortunately that that's not granular enough it's too easy to manipulate your IP and that makes it very difficult for security professionals to do their job and that's that's where the advent of fingerprinting came in let's get more unique in identifying a user in a way that they can't hide from us as easily and that allows us to identify who's good who's bad in a better way oh all right and we've just heard from the officials that we're in the spirit of the Copa America's in stoppage time so we have we're going to do one more question before we have to say goodbye today and this is really a good forward-looking question um how do we protect ourselves from mass attacks when we migrate to ipv6 will access control lists be able to keep up will the entire mechanism have to change rummy let's go let's go to you first on this what is ipv6 due to the whole bought threat landscape you know it makes it that much harder to identify malicious actors ipv6 is going to exponentially increase the amount of IP space that exists meaning that there is more places for the bots to hide and unfortunately access control just don't work having the the I'm going to block this set of people when there's so many other places that they can come in from is it is not an effective tool it's not an effective tool in ipv4 and it's going to get worse in ipv6 so our recommendation is you should not be relying on unnels for blocking bots now and it's definitely going to become more and more ineffective as we move to ipv6 yeah you're absolutely spot-on but the size of the problem of static structures just gets worse I mean the number of IP addresses could just up handed and be able to administer access control list is going to be hugely hugely difficult you need to be able to stop and that was actually the time to start getting educated getting used to technologies that you know a bit more automated and how they scale and how they how they deliver their security services yes spot on around me well I'm afraid with that we have hit the end of our time for this webinar but i would like to let our audience know that for more information related to today's webinar you can visit any of the resource links that are now opening before you in additional in addition within the next 24
