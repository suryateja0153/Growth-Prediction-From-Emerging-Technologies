 thanks everybody my name is Nancy silver and I'm a solutions architect with mark logic and this is my colleague Michael Mel Jerry who is a principal technologist and lean engineer for MarkLogic today Michael and I are going to talk to you all about the impact of smart content marklogic is a database platform company we essentially help organizations manage and distribute their content we've been doing this for close to 15 years we specialize in all verticals but the area of our expertise is in publishing media and entertainment I don't know has anybody here were attended the smart content summit last last month awesome event really great event and it was really exciting for me to be there to kind of hear all of the great stories about what folks are doing with metadata and it really became apparent how important and how valuable metadata is throughout the production lifecycle and for the media and entertainment industry and as metadata is moving to the front and everybody is realizing how important it is for content personalization and content monetization there still are several barriers that organizations are facing when integrating their data but new technologies are coming to place and successful applications like the SNL 40th anniversary app have embraced smart content and we're going to discuss this a little bit more in our presentation so smart content is throughout the whole production lifecycle and Michael and I are going to discuss how using and embracing no sequel technologies to integrate your data will help your organization as well as implementing semantics for linking data increasing data governance and data curation just like green button there yeah okay am I on yes doesn't sound like yeah so whether its concept to camera to consumer in media and entertainment or art depart to Mart in manufacturing data is created in every stage of the product cycle and when you want to deliver great content as you do in media and entertainment you have to have access to all this data and that data lives in specific categories there's the content itself there's various forms of metadata descriptive technical and then there are semantic technologies like taxonomies and ontology and every stage of the supply chain needs access to these various categories so for instance in distribution you need access to the production data like wardrobes and props if you want to take advantage of new market opportunities archiving archiving is not just about maintaining the assets you might want production data about backgrounds and in clips for for for reuse and then in various stages of production you need access to the title information and the other metadata in order to ensure that it's not replicated or duplicated also we're seeing a very big trend of using customer consumer data throughout the lifecycle so it's very important when you're designing new products and distributing them to end-users all this information resides throughout the product lifecycle and every process within each of these stages needs access to that data so how have organizations tried to provide that universal access well traditionally it's been with relational technology this was actually a video where the piston was going up and down but we didn't get it to work here maybe some other time but um relational technology has its limitations you have to design your model upfront you need to know what your model is going to look like and you often need to know the queries the questions that you're going to ask of that data this is good if it's single purpose but it has limitations when you have multiple things that you want to do like many of the initiatives that are going on customer 360 product 360 supplier 360 and then when you want to change the data it's very difficult it typically has a ripple effect up and down the technology stack and this new data is required for making decisions to to find new opportunities folks here that might be in the technology area that have tried to do this know that it's very very complex so we're back to this like here because one of the major problems is that there are many systems in each stage of this cycle so for instance in production you know you have not only different software systems but you have smart cameras you have drones you have IOT devices you have wearable devices and each of those types of data belongs in these different categories and they have different technical formats and different purposes in which they interact so getting access to that information is more than just bringing it together in a single place you have to form relationships among the data and the prior speaker Aaron alluded to that it's a variety of data that you have to worry about but try to make sense of it so it's just not smart to think that if you're going to consolidate this information you've solved your problem you really have it now what people are doing is looking for new platforms they're looking for a platform where data is easy to bring in where it's easy to bring in the data they want to ingest data without having to do these expensive transformations the etl want to be able to handle structured unstructured semi-structured kind of data bring meta data and data together they also want to be able to get the data out as quickly as possible so index it if you can rapidly in real time and then provide access through ad-hoc queries and then being able to handle these different types of data JSON XML unstructured text binary and surrounding met data the other important aspect of a platform that gives you this type of capability is that you don't want to give up the enterprise features that are found in traditional relational technology so things like acid transactions when you're updating multiple documents you want to maintain that data consistency high availability disaster recovery security is very very important and I know everyone is probably dealing with that particularly privacy concerns with the content and the user information so one of the technologies the folks are looking at you've probably heard of it is no sequel this is different than relational database it allows you to move away from designing your entire data model upfront bring data in as is search discover and then do something called schema on read whereas you create the data model for the different purpose or application in which you want to use it it also makes it very very easy to handle new data as we mentioned with relational technology you have to do a lot of rebuilds and re-indexing with no sequel technology it comes in a lot smoother and there's less of an impedance match between the data and the object relational layer and the application layer some of you developers probably know this is an example of a document model and no sequel so it's hierarchical in nature but when you want to get even more value out of your data you'll combine this with a semantic model so over on the right you see kind of a graph structure which relates characters to movies to actors this gives you the context that you need to combine that information that's characteristics of big data the variety okay and it makes it much more powerful when you want to enrich your application or to create more enhanced user experiences now the big win and this is a marklogic thing is when you're able to combine document stores which you see on the left here and semantic models which you see on the right if a user can search the document and the text and then leverage the inferences the semantic engine then they can get relevant content that they didn't even ask for because the user knows the kind I'm sorry the engine knows the content that they're looking for and they know something about the user so this is the value and we see examples in Homeland Security where analysts are searching suspicious activity reports they find the name in the document itself but then through the semantic relationships they can find accomplices associated with other events or locations and and catch the bad guys inigo montoya can catch six-fingered man you guys are familiar with that reference I can't do anything without reference to Princess Bride easy my favorite movie but in other areas like financial services that's very document based in the operations lots of contracts so they need to search through that for compliance fraud detection in insurance and in media and entertainment it's all about matching the content through the tagging that we talked about with something known about the user and this is a good example answer you mentioned SNL you guys familiar with the 40th anniversary that they had last year at this time must be some Saturday Night Live fans they created this mobile app and they wanted to have a very enriched user experience and they pulled through all these different categories of information there were roughly 6,000 skits over the 40-plus years when the 41st year and they were able to deliver an application tap into this content one of the key things that they did was a recommendation engine so they asked users couple questions on download pinpointed the error that they were interested in 70s 80s 90s and then started delivering up content and as users swiped through the videos forward and back recommended to Facebook shared with friends looked for information the recommendation engine was constantly tuned so this was very very successful they felt they had phenomenal engagement and this is Michael Martin speaking out last year's a Hollywood IT summon I think that's his court way said they made a meal out of snacks this is this is a another industry automotive and industry Mitchell one there a division of SAP snap-on they fix cars they have an application called Pro demand and they take information from various so this is directly from the customer from the diagnostic engine from the parts catalog from the repair shop and from the billing they combine this all together to reduce the cost and fixing your vehicle's quality and take these silos of information into the semantic Confederation they use semantics heavily now this is an application I don't know if you can see that but these are product not product codes they are diagnostic code so you go in and they stick your car into a computer you tell them the system symptoms and these these codes are related to the various systems from the information that came from text that was typed in by the repair person the person that took the service call and they're able to deliver an optimum service experience when I say optimum not only reduces the cost but it finds thing it does things like preventive maintenance so to avoid the costly recalls which are death in the manufacturing industry and again they rely on all these different systems so I'm going to pass it back to Nancy she's going to talk about something very exciting that's happening in industry today related to our partner serie TC thanks Michael yep really excited to be working with the et Cie on the suitcase for those of you who don't know what the suitcase is it is a short film and technical test that is evaluating network-based workflows and focusing on metadata and high dynamic range so the core goals of the project our next generation cloud-based workflow c4 framework metadata and high dynamic range for the proper parts of the project that focus on metadata that marklogic is working on and we're targeting descriptive upstream metadata so we're extracting metadata Greymon through grape meta is doing the extraction of the metadata and where ingesting it into MarkLogic and automating that descriptive metadata process upstream so that it doesn't have to be recreated downstream and typically this is what happens with most motion pictures this will not only be a cost savings but it also help with metadata loss and we're doing this through the use of no sequel technologies and semantics implementing relationships amongst the descriptive metadata and in using technologies and ontologies as well to do this so some key deliverables of this project we're creating a white paper that's going to talk about all the technologies that are used and lessons learn but we're also on marklogic is working with disney to create a front-end application for viewing the suitcase and it's going to essentially operate similar to like amazon x-ray you can view the suitcase movie and that just what's really cool is that descriptive metadata that's been automated already will be viewed you can see that through the use of semantics the relationship so you can view over a character and find information about that character and again it's that linking metadata that's able to create this great user experience so as you can tell we've talked about a lot of really great projects that people are using smart content for and one of the things that's clear is that people are now focusing on the importance of metadata throughout the entire production cycle and being able to link that for successful content personalization and user experiences which then in turn provides for content monetization so if you want to learn more about what other organizations are doing not only in media and entertainment marklogic world is in next in May and it's a free completely free event in companies like Disney NBCUniversal Warner Brothers and other verticals we'll be talking about some of the projects that they're doing with smart content and their success stories thanks so much
