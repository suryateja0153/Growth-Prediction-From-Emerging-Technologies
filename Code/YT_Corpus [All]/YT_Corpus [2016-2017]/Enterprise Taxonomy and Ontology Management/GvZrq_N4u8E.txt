 my name is Leah green oh and i'm heading the initiative or open AG funding and welcome you to this webinar on supply and demand improving the AG funding data landscape our goal with this webinar is to present some of the findings of the research we've been doing both into the availability of agricultural investment data and into the demand for that data so here is our agenda for the day as we shared in the invitation we're going to break this webinar into two sections in part one we are going to be presenting our research so I'll begin with an overview of the project first for those who may not already have spoken to us as part of that research we will try to unmute everyone for the second agenda item to have you all introduce yourselves and just looking for your name and the organization that that you're working with then we'll move on to our two presentations one on the supply of agricultural investment data and that will be with open data services who conducted that research and then we'll move on to demand where each of the partners of the open AG funding initiative will present on the research findings of their consultations on that and we'll do about 10-15 minutes for each of these presentations and then break for questions after each of them so that will be the first hour of the webinar and then we'll take a quick break for those that need to step away or who need to get coffee before we move into part two of the webinar which is a discussion on how we can move forward with the findings based on the findings of the landscape analysis and consultations on data me so just to give you an idea of who's working with us on this open AG funding initiative this is a project led by interaction but we are working with development gateway foundation center the cgiar like I if pre open data services and publish what you fund so before we we jump into the discussions like I said I wanted to give you a quick overview of the project and overall what the open AG funding initiative is trying to do too is to big picture and hunger and reduce food and security and the way that we want to go about this is to make sure that the effect that the investments were making in this sector are more effective so we believe that access to comprehensive comparable timely information is essential to improving decision-making around investment and to increasing accountability for resources spent in this sector however we know from our own experience and research through this project that there's a few issues either the data doesn't exist or if the data does exist people either don't have access to the available information or aren't aware that it exists or the data that is available isn't good enough quality or isn't relevant to their needs so what we hope to do with this project which is the last piece there is to ensure that the information that information is published and that whatever is published meets the needs of those funding or implementing food security and agriculture projects I know there are a vast amount of needs related to data in this sector so I wanted to take a moment to explain what kind of data we're focusing on as part of this project so first where we're focusing on international assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors foundation NGOs and research institutes that belong to the cgiar and the the simplest way to to put what type of data were trying to make available is that are related to who's doing what where or to the investments that were we're making in this sector so things like which organizations are involved how much funding was provided where do activities take place what are they meant to accomplish etc and I just included a snapshot of tif its death tracker so you can see the type of data where we're trying to make available this is just one example I also wanted to tell you about the ways that you can participate in this project we've to help us meet our goal of making data available and relevant we've established to working groups or two groups one a community of practice and the second and agriculture working group under the International a transparency initiatives technical advisory group so I just wanted to take a moment to explain what the purpose and the difference between each of them is and then a bit about membership so the purpose of the community of practice as you see on your screen is to promote improvements in the availability quality and use of Ag investment data so that includes doing things like helping us increase awareness of demand for this type of data to inform the development of the standards and tools will be developing it's part of this project from a user perspective and to advocate for the publication of better data by all actors and also promoting use of the data and decision-making either within your own organization or in other organizations the AG working group on the other hand is to the purpose is to ensure that yadi data meets the needs of agricultural development and food security practitioners so this group will play a more technical role in developing our proposals for making the international transfers the initiative standard more relevant to agriculture and food security practitioners and then also will be helping us develop tools to improve either the quality or the use of yachty data and as you'll be hearing when Tim and Steven present on the supply of data we've come to the conclusion that the international aid transparency initiative provides the best way to meet the needs of a practitioners in the sector so in terms of membership membership is open to anyone to either individuals or organizations your you can participate in both groups or just one it depends on your interest I'd say that the community of practice is probably better for agriculture and food security practitioners who really are looking to use this data as part of their work while the yachty AG working group might be more suitable for those responsible for publishing yadi data at their organizations or for sector data specialists so we are going to go ahead and see if we can unmute folks to do the introductions and i think i'm just going to unmute people as from the top of the list so let's see how this cope like i said we're just looking for your name and organization hi I'm France from an a I'm a data scientist that expand the am costa rica and catherine wine with mcc and i'm looking to learn for gender data also my name is marco Vandenberg am but the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines I'm I'm Ralph cliff i'm working with dutch ngos on ERT implementations how come hello I'm mark ok with Eunice fira in montreal canada you others on the line hi liya i'm wendy rogers and i'm the senior business analyst on the IRT technical support team so obviously very joined up with this piece of work great great to have you when you thank you any others what Mutis know we're going hi I'm a Duffy on a high I'm we've opened its services wonderful hi this is chelsea miller and with Lutheran World Relief how does this Martine Obama from smart result to see I think I muted I don't know now we can hear you thank you oh okay yeah Duncan G host also with open data services great anyone else on the line ok then I will Moo everyone again if you didn't get a chance to introduce yourself feel free to use the chat function to do that but for now I am going to turn it over to Tim and steven with open data services to present on the supply of agricultural investment data those times turning over the presenter function to you now great i will start sharing my screen in just a moment and thanks all for joining us for this session it's really good to have you always muted so uh let's let's take your food and and so for the difficulty getting this on screen um so essentially we set out with a brief to look at who's collecting data on our investments how it's being shared what's the nature of that data how it's being structured and where the gaps always areas of duplication are in that and in that we found there's this three board kind of data we're talking about in ag investments firstly we're looking at the aggregate level what's the country or region level daytron investments and we're finding that's coming from national statistics from national budgets or from regular or even ad hoc survey so something like the agricultural science and technology indicators give a view drawing on survey methods and other methods of aggregate level investments going into a country or or sector across those sources many different classifications and data structures and being used by giving that that high level picture and then we get down to the project level looking at projects that are being funded or implemented and again those might be drawn from donor systems from country aid management platforms and also from crowdsourcing or from the portfolio's of projects that companies are engaged in and key here was looking not only at projects from traditional donors but also trying to get a view of what data is out there on private sector investments in at the agriculture world also and lastly we can get down to the output level what's the results data what's the research outputs for the indicators on what a project has achieved and there we're finding that's held in all sorts of different platforms very patchy coverage of data available and often not being shared often only in internal systems or in research repositories which don't necessarily link between a particular funding investment in a particular I'll put in any tremendously clear way and obviously that data on investments funding resources is part of a wider landscape of data that we need to be conscious of and many people on this call will work on this wider landscape as well things like geo data or agriculture data on infrastructure taxonomy zor data from agricultural extension survey so when we've been looking at the the AG investment data landscape we've been particularly focusing on these aggregate projects and output data i'm particularly on projects and outputs but cognizant that it needs to connect up with this wider landscape so no research we try to dig into the different data sources and in the report you'll find a link to that the database of of databases that we essentially built trying to understand is the data public is it a restricted access what's it covering what's the temporal coverage what's the sectoral coverage we find a real breadth of different sources there they positively we find a lot that is public a lot that is being shared and lots of people very willing to share but we find great variation in the quality the breadth and the depth of that data so we identify ten broad categories of source that can be found things like the oecd DAC reporting backwards looking but but but be comprehensive data on our traditional donors aid projects we looked at data available through the international aid transparency initiative through a diminishment platforms and other datasets right through to some of the really granular data that exists in our platforms like a Crow's a platform for water projects aid projects and where the platform is transactional it's it's it's a reporting platform as well as a project information platform very low coverage of the number of projects but but very in-depth data so that analysis led us to this graph you should see where we've tried to plot these types of data sources on a rough spectrum between whether they give us forward-looking data or historic data and whether they can give us comprehensive information or only very basic and headline information and the size of the bubble roughly equates to the kind of coverage that source has of the kinds of information we think people are looking for and that led us to understanding that the source with the best prospect of improving the AG data landscape is there in the international aid transparency initiative and so that led us to doing a deeper dive into understanding what the data in the 80s company like what's the atty data landscape here and put that on hand over to Steven thank you Tim so we took a took em says we took a look into the existing data shared with the international agents but and we found across the board there's something around about 550,000 half a million ayati activities published 5 over 450 different organizations when we actually undertook this analysis there are just about 400 organizations that were publishing data in the Attic format and in the past couple months that's increased by by 50 or so mainly Dutch NGOs so I atty really is a dynamic and growing set of organisations opening sharing data in a standardized way and from that we could really see that their agricultural investment data is really open and available particularly through the different data sets and the interfaces that are available around around betting that I'll talk a bit more about those in a moment and we also could summarize that nearly all the major bilateral and multilateral donors active in agricultural investments publish share data and they oughtta format so there's very encouraging to see that there was a real match between the active all that the larger and active organizations and those that are already open opening data using our atty standard the atty standard and that the last point really is though we we also found it very encouraging to talk directly joined during the landscape analysis talk directly with some of those publishers and in other cases get data changed and updated one on the way at the next slide based in okay and our methodology to to look at the AIT corpus that the set of data that that's really quite large was to focus in on the on in this piece of work the sector code lists the organization's skews within their ayati activities and and we took the view that there around about 40 of these codes that organizations could use to describe their activities and for example 3119 one describes agricultural services and in the reporters that there's a list of all those codes so we looked across the half a million activities to find those share and describe their work using these these relevant these codes irrelevant agriculture investments and we noticed that there were there was a greater take up of of the more in-depth codes rather than the generic codes that might be very broad so that was quite encouraging to see that the organization's publishing data using the Attic standard that already started to get to some detail using those sector codes and and we also observed a small there's a small set of those codes that have the most traction just at the moment that's probably indicative of the nature of funding and the nature of activities taking place and we could also find that the amongst this there's a small number of publishers accounting for most of the irt data that we could see in other words there the larger organizations were publishing lots of data and continue to do so and the other hand that's a very interesting what we might call a long tail of organizations pushing a small small amount of data book equally quite detailed in it in this nature but at the volume level it's a small number of ayati publishers right now and and these are these are these publishers tend to be the larger institutions the existing publishers of receiving duck reports for example okay on to the next slide placed him one thing we think and I think it's important to highlight just just in this journey is that and it's probably not it's probably not helpful to think of ayati as a single database is it's certainly a whole corpus of data put through which we can analyze them and query but it's really interesting to look at look at ayati in the different interfaces that publishers and organizations make available so that there's a screenshot here of the Swedish interface to their ayati data and on the right hand side the Dutch Ministry again around around their own data so so as just an interesting context we think about when you're when you usually go at e data to consider it as at the moment 450 different data sets that share this common standard platform over there a common standard way of described their work and it's just that the caution against thinking about that as a single unitary database and unless like to meet him yet thank you and so if we understand that there's a there's a wide number of organizations talking about an agricultural investments and there are a lot of those are using the the sector codes to do so but the other thing that we looked at that I'd to draw out from the port is that broadly speaking the activities that we can find out of general quality so they took about the who where when and what into particularly to those sector codes I mentioned a much smaller subset of those activities that we looked at and detail things such as sub-national geography and results data and I think that's probably reflective of the wider the wider pattern amongst the whole the whole of the ayati and publishes themselves so and just to highlight really that the activities we found could begin to take us on this journey of them of who's who's working with whom where and and on what back over to you I think Tim yeah so what you really see there is we've got a framework that has the potential to give us quite rich data for the reality of what we're seeing right now is we get that high level what's provided whether the project and so on been getting down to the detailed information is is a gap right now and it'll be useful when we hear about some of the user needs to see how far the data that's commonly available meets those needs as Stephen says this is often though made available to people not as data but through tooling and another you Steven mentioned those detailed categorizations that we see in some files rely on a tool being able to produce detail classified later so we've got creation tools out there but we need some modification to improve the landscape we've got mapping tools out there's quite a mature set of mapping tools in terms of the platforms running open aid map another tool sort of aware of different levels of geography perhaps not yet connecting up to all of the Geo information systems there are for agriculture that why the geo data path the landscape we've got tooling emerging and lots of learning about that tooling we see a range of visualization tools available and query platforms where we see this perhaps some some gaps or tools that are not being used heavily right now a tools for enriching the data that's already published so there have been some experiments with auto-tagging research outputs against vocabularies such as anchor bach are quite widely used in that context and work on geo coding projects from the project documents and very little data is being enriched after its published right now and tools for helping do that quality assurance to make sure the data that's published is up to scratch also an area with some gaps so looking across that whole landscape and looking at are the supply side only we looked at seven recommendations and these are things we really want to test in the company you and that framework needs to be accompanied by quality assurance tools tools that can validate data and help publishers know that they're producing data that's up to scratch and we know tools on their own and not enough there needs to be support for those publishers to do that and to do that well and the Steven mentioned during this research process there are a couple of times where we contacted publishers of data to say we can't quite understand this that air is where you could tweak that improve that in people were very quick to update and improve data sets but it needs had active conversation and to recognize that this is in the process of building one big database it's a process of working with a distributed community of data providers and secondly we need to look at how that data is going to be collected and brought together and to recognize what we're talking a lot about iotti here that's not the only source of data out there there are surveys that go on at the national level their age management platforms there's private sector actors who manage their own systems who won't necessarily produce that a deity data so any process we need to be cognizant of different entry points to providing data and have some simplified standards and processes for that um and lastly we can't forget the need for curation the need to assemble and quality ashore corpus of agricul- atta that's ready for use if we rely on users just going to that distributed set of data sets and I'm finding their own way through it it's going to remain very challenging to pick away through this landscape an answer key questions so we need better tools to enrich the data and to bring it together in a corpus I'm really the census if we've been doing this a couple of years ago we'd have been saying it's almost impossible to find out anything at all now we're able to say there are sources of data out there there's people publishing there's flows of data being updated regularly and but we need to really focus very heavily on getting them up to the quality that can answer the kinds of questions and user needs that are our next set of presentations will touch on soil pause that as less so they're not tire you questions which can either happen to people are raising their hand in the attendee list or typing their questions in the chat and Stephen I will try and respond to any questions or thanks Tim thanks Stephen for that presentation and also you got in your chat box the link to the full report including a link where if you'd like you can provide comments on the report which we will be looking at as we take this project forward to the next stage I see a question from Matthew Matthew I'm going to unmute you can you hear me yeah go ahead that's fantastic um oh well I'm intrigued by the very last thing that that you said which is um taking this project to the next phase which which phase it is that and what what are the plans that's an excellent question and that's actually what we will be what we're hoping to discuss with all of you in the second part of this webinar so basically you know we've we've addressed both the supply and demand side and so we based on the findings of that of what's available and what's actually needed we're trying to bring those two into closer alignment and so we're going to be taking a close look at the yachty standard which covers the type of information we've talked about this morning and then seeing whether it meets the the needs and it's just an issue of needing to improve the quality of the data that's being made available or if there are certain things that need to be added or modified according to that standard in order to make it more suitable for practitioners in this sector in particular for the agriculture and food security sector so that is our next major piece of work and obviously we don't want to just throw out random ideas we really want to test this with the people who would be using that information to make decisions or hold organizations accountable for the funding they're providing in the sector right any other questions can I ask a follow-up question yes go ahead and then we'll we'll go to Rolf I see your hand up go ahead and Anya it's so you have a data standard do you also have an ontology standard or a taxonomy of vocabularies that you're using for those specific data standards and tipped to ease the curation problem so maybe I can come in a bit there so the one section of the report that I didn't include in the slides there is a section on taxonomy 'he's and classification as Steven mentioned the existing data published through the international aid transparency initiative tends to use mostly the oecd development systems committees classification of sectors which goes not terribly deep in the kinds of categories that maybe egg specialists would be interested in so we have been doing some work thinking about how taxonomy is like egg rock and so on might be used within the context and egg investment projects I think that's very much an open question for the next phase of this work is to understand the balance of effort of getting publishers of data to tag against those texana means versus getting tools downstream to enrich data auto tag or classify data against some of those tanks on the reason to really understand the right taxonomy and to use there's been some interesting work as well recently looking at an OECD DAC sector codes and sustainable development goals and kind of what classification makes most sense for for decision-makers a lot of that's going to need to come out of the user research to understand what what users need to work out what we wash we put bit if you've got experience of kind of working with particular tax money to be really keen to hear about that Oh terrific um great well I'm not sure if it's appropriate to say it but but right now but we're actually putting on a conference about the ontologies of food and egg in November here at UC Davis and of course we would love to have you guys come and participate because I wasn't aware of this particular effort I didn't hear you mention godan are a couple of other efforts that are out there is that it going to be in the report I haven't seen the report yet we've we've joined Godin and and consider our work to control butan our goal of making data in this sector more more open so fall under that umbrella for taking forward a very specific piece of the open data are seeking to make available right right right right this is great it's very exciting well thank you and I think we have a couple more questions so I'm going to turn it over to to roll roll fun gonna in mutti so you can pose your question and I think you probably have to unmute yourself I like in a trapping just very quickly on this these questions on the internal trees I'm sure go ahead mouth yeah and if you could introduce yourself so people know who you are oh yes sorry so many beku am senior program manager at e3 I've I've been working the past two years on my ping some of the cgiar investment portfolio so that's i'm here i am wearing that hat today and I just wanted to say yeah there is a desert island initiate is called the gaps I think it's the global global agricultural concept scheme which i think is also receiving some salvation and that there was a little big effort to try to reconcile a number of the AG and nutrition ontology so starting with a grove walk in ames and some other libraries and i think it's it's own currently led but it by feel so i just posted a link and i think if you google gap you can find more on the web as well egg smell I think they have a working robux a try but I'm not completely up to date on what's the status the effort I mean last last I saw there was a this kind of manage to in holding like half of the main vocabulary isn't I I don't know if day that's something you you'll be discussing in to that event just a great thanks Mel and Mel dropped a link to to information about that effort in the chat box and which I'll i'll share with everyone shortly but Rolf and go ahead and ask your question ok thanks I am thanks Tim and Steven for your presentation uh yeah I don't see a chat box oh I'm missing probably on some of the rings uh I have a question about the the coverage of the data you mentioned that it's a lot of the bigger fusions that seem to be well represented and as as we know in the eart community does this bit of me she trying to get basically the next step in the chain I'm covered as well and I would be really interested to know if you if you find out like found out what coverage there is in that sense it was an institution and maybe also where would be the biggest win in getting more organizations on board please both i ah and you're talking about a RT data i think specifically i guess you yeah yeah in the report i put a link in to section 5 of the I a tease so we'll follow that up with the direct link just in case you and to get you can't find it right now and I think what I've shown reflect on there really was that the volume of data when you look at the whole when we said this approach first of all we look at I atty data we we filter that by the sector codes to give us a heads to give us some analysis and then when we look at that you can you can clearly see that the United States the EU Japan Sweden Spain UK for example are in volume that the biggest publishers of data using those sector codes and that's not reflective perhaps of the quality of that data I'm just trying to hire the publishers isn't it the trend seems to be the publishers with the most data are also in line with those sharing most around their agricultural investments down at the that there's a real long tail the firm of publishers I think we found about 120 publishers and you know there are 83 that have less than less than five hundred counts of AG sector and let that tables in the in the Indian role as well so I think it's more of a broad sweep of the data at the moment just to understand who where and what and but as you know from your work in IIT you know the real interest in parts could clean in the long tail all those organizations that they're publishing very in-depth theta so i think that the next point I'd make is that when I began to look at the the activities in detail I could look at every single activity but some of the smaller publishers in volume we're also publishing quite interesting data with results and geolocation as well so what quantity doesn't always equal quality is the message and I guess maybe just to pick up on I think when the other issues you're alluding into there around following the chain down so certainly to preempt some of the kind of user need presentations that would come up I think a big gap still is going to be around getting to the the implementing partners on the ground getting beyond the kind of million dollar project to the delivery partners one of the things we do touch one in the report is the emergence of a contracting data as another potential data source that helps get there because was project level often is kind of a a first-tier implementing partner getting down to the who are the organizations at that very very local level working on things maybe contracts and spend a tech inc and get us there further and those are at a much earlier stage of kind of walking out in standardized forms in the atty's being but but certainly areas we should and keep an eye on to have these multiple entry points of kind of bringing data together Thanks until further questions and this is a perfect transition to the next part of our of our presentation which is looking at the demand so just one moment while I at switch back to my screen ok so we've looked at this apply now we're going to look at the demand so I'm hearing some typing so here if you can meet yourself if you're not speaking that would be great oh so we are just going to like I said at the beginning we're going to have each partner present on the findings of the consultations they've done into the data demand or the data needs of different groups and just an advanced warning that we only have two minutes for each person to present so this is going to be very high level but just wanted to give you a sense of what we're finding and so first up is tar and Davis with development gateway go ahead Thanks hi it's this jaron davis and i'm here at Danny Walker my colleague at development gateway and so quickly we just wanted to talk about what we did so we went with so far five different donors who work in agriculture to really understand what data they need about projects that others are doing a country when they are implementing their projects so and on the left column of this slide you'll see these are some of the things that came up most often and a lot of them are ones that that can already be found in different sources and but maybe people aren't as familiar with them so we talked about yadi and some that information like locations budget data and expenditure data project dates and results information and this was really important for them to know you know what type of projects have been successful so far in agriculture and learning from those and knowing also what what hasn't been successful so far and to make sure that they don't fall to that same pitfall and one of the things though that that you won't find so easily is specific value chains that we found everyone was saying would be really important and this would be knowing specifically what type of crops people are working one and have people give examples of if everyone else's is working in maize will want to focus on another crops such as a soy to make sure that the nutrition is balanced out or make sure that and we aren't too heavily focused on on one crop and another big example we saw was wanting to know who the local implementers other organizations are working with and this was listed as important and because it would a help them know who what organizations they could and maybe we should work with as well and also just during the initial project planning to know who they should talk to during during their consultations to get and a good idea of the lay of the land on the ground and so knowing this information up hand and really important for them in knowing that well and then there's also a lot of talk about knowing demographic socio-economic data and and even some baseline data so this is going down specifically to soil data was brought up a lot of knowing specifics and information like that so this is kind of the things that thought came up a lot and and the data needs and and a lot of this information some of this information especially as value changes is something that can be a little bit harder to find and so again don't have too much time to go into deficit these are some of the the biggest things that come up during our conversations thanks hard and so next up is ska beef it's from the Foundation Center hi everybody um can you hear me guys you could talk a little louder than usual that would be great okay great um so we actually spoke or have spoken with a number of private foundations on the donor side and talk to them about what their data needs are and what their process really is for when and how they use data and external knowledge sources in their investment decisions and so a lot of this resonates with what Tim and Steven and development gateway found as well donors are really at the program level trying to understand what others are doing and funding where the gaps are in current funding whether that's at a specific crop level or at a regional level and really where they could make the greatest difference so all kinds of different data types and data sources go into helping to answer those questions an interesting thing that we did talk with a number of foundations about sort of when they were looking for data and I think it's something to keep in mind as we build this project moving forward that there was really the need for data and external knowledge sources at the strategy setting moment and then data for monitoring and impact measurement and then the 360 degrees really came when they tried to translate that the results data or outcome data back into informing the strategy and setting strategy so I think different they have different kinds of data needs at different kinds of moments largely the Foundation's we were speaking with we're not actually aware of the ADI and we're relying almost exclusively on relationships with other funders and affinity groups on their own in country staff and then because they had the resources they were really commissioning research their own research in order to get at some of the aggregate level data that they were struggling to find so they are looking at landscape analyses market analyses demographic analyses I'm a lot of what we just heard from the last presenter but we're going out and commissioning that research feeling like their questions were quite unique and then getting researchers to to answer them directly some of the challenges are ones that are going to be familiar to a lot of people on this call that there were differing definitions of what they even meant by agriculture in the agricultural field and then some of the difficulties but also the richness in this work really comes from the fact that they're working at the intersections of different issues and fields so many of them yes they're working on agriculture but they're working on agriculture as it relates to land rights or land sovereignty or as it relates to food and nutrition and so really trying to find data that also answers questions at those intersections continues to be a challenge and then lastly just and this kind of gets to some of the needs they a lot of them spoke to around the granularity of the data which is really the data needs that are associated with movement building initiatives or partnership driven initiatives where they really were looking for data at the very local level about who's working on projects you know what are they finding what are they learning what are their needs on the ground in a way that that they're really relying heavily on in-country staff to answer those questions um so that's a quick very quick summary of some of what we've been hearing from that group of stakeholders thanks very much Bobby ah and next I'm going to turn it over to my colleague mike castro at interaction thanks live well we've gone ahead and had consultations with over ten organizations or ten I NGOs and within those I NGOs we spoken to up multiple individuals ranging from senior leadership within the organization to resource development officers to policies that have been those who are most interested in implementing these agricultural food security related programs to get a wide variety of perspectives and data needs and so the main two points that we want to highlight is that at the broader level NGOs particularly I NGOs wants of what do location and to leverage the expertise of other organizations that are implementing aquaculture food security programs so the type of data that they need to avoid those pitfalls is information on what's been a mentioned before on implementers on who is implementing the program particularly those in countries that are implementing the program so identify potential partners as well as to leverage what others have done and avoid duplication so they also need information on sub-national location as to where in-country these interventions are being implemented the sort of investments of that amounts are just have a general sense of the scope of the programs and who are the intended beneficiaries in these programs now if we go into the sort of the last of parts of wipe NGOs need this data of determining what works and frankly what doesn't work and to actually assess the performance of these interventions they really need information on results on goals and objectives and in sectors and the specific value chain said really learn from what other organizations have been doing and that's something that that was a key takeaway in these consultations that's something that essentially everyone who we've consulted with mention that did this is imperative that they need to make smarter investment in the agriculture and food security sector great thanks Mike and if I can change the slide I will turn it over to Mel Mel go ahead Mel we can't hear you I'm sorry oh there you go yeah just spinkle ugly okay so on the CGI are so the cgiar is not a member of yet here right now and but there's been some push under yeah can you hear me if you can try to speak even louder we're getting a request for that okay okay yeah i was saying so we're not a member of a Yeti but there's been some activities especially over the last two years in trying to collect information from hundred yes sorry entities can you hear yes go ahead okay so the situation is the reform is organizing to 15 large research programs and also 15 research centers so those are the sort of funding mechanisms for the cgiar and you know we are present in over more than 70 countries and this over four to five thousand terminal test of my permanent locations so in the early consultations and stakeholders meeting and interviews we had and the key requests where for the number of locations and activities but a lot of the CRP program directors are people making decisions on strategies really want this information overlaid with the key key geographies of interests so depend depending on the research programs it could be different types of dry land areas or different focus areas for wheat and maize or the wheat and maize mega environments so there's a lot of a AG specific definitions and when when strategy makers look at you know number of activities a number of partners number of locations and they also they want this information usually cross cross reference across geographies so that's maybe something that didn't come from didn't quite come back from the previous the previous slides so that was a big big ask the other one was to come up with very simple indicators on the numbers of so potentially the number of farmers reach the number of farmers trained across activities also the socio-economic characteristics of the of those farmers and the number of porn on pole or beneficiaries and yeah and then some other indicators have to do with rich and then some about impacts so which was the number of partners and institutions that we're working with of the receive training or receive institutional support and and then measure of measure of impact and that's a that's an axe that's coming quite strong 90 the next round of a firm of research program proposals is about diffusion trying to track the diffusion of the cultural technologies so when we mean technologies usually improved improved technologies improved seeds improve management practices on the farm and then what sort of the adoption of those technologies so we want to be able to track activities and then on the impact sighs what's the diffusion adoption of different technologies and another kind of data and needs so in addition to what the other speakers have mentioned is well because we are evasive institutions we usually want a pretty high level of detail of what the activity is about so not not only the value chain and the commodity but also the type of of research and improved technologies and and so what one of the activities will engage nice building this ontology of eigen nutrition technology and they're divided up into different branches from from germplasm 22 no irrigation and manage management practices so that's something we're looking at maybe potentially integrating into into an auger yucky standard as well right thanks very much Mel and and our other presenters so we're a little bit over time but want to make sure that you all have a chance to ask questions about the the demand side as well so if you have any questions as you did before feel free to type it into the question box or raise your hand and we'll mute you so you could pose your question in the in the meantime is is you think of those i just want to mention that we're currently working on writing up the findings of these consultations on the different groups and we'll be making those available in june so next month and so if you've signed up for our project newsletter or which will drop the the link to so you have access to that and we'll also send out an email afterwards with the presentation and information on how to get involved in the project if you you are part of our lists already but we'll we'll announce the the reports there as well so any any questions on on user data needs matthew go ahead well I have a question for for anybody in the audience in general I heard our last speaker and I I guess I'm not seeing a chat window or a report somewhere i was hoping to get I didn't get every speaker's name so i can't really address anybody by name but um our last speaker just mentioned that they were looking at developing ontology for nutrition and food technologies which is really interesting to me and and I've heard some other things about vocabularies in there I'm wondering to what extent the speakers in general who who are interested in this are coordinating the international community for biological ontology 'he's if anybody has anything to speak about that and the conference coming up in in august for that icbo there are any relationships developing there okay no I might let you yes go ahead and so there is some coordination so inside the Sierra we were coordinating this work on autologous with bio versity mostly that and also the consortium office in Montpelier so at x 0 versity with working with the crop ontology team disunity that's probably the main link for you to the bio to the bio ontology work so we had so yeah we were trying to fit in one specific gaps so we're not going into some of the existing kind of biotechnology and other electrum germplasm religions ontologies the ontology we're developing was really for decision-making on investment so it's a bit more higher level and it's being reviewed now so we have a number of we have a small working group and it's been kind of security didn't review that with a big input from diversity ontology team it's great and like agriculture and nutrition technology ontology yeah but it's not I mean we're planning maybe a publication or something about it but it's not happen yet thanks Mel and we do have another question from Catherine bonnet MCC who's asking whether we've seen demand for gender disaggregated data and I can comment on that but if some of the I'll turn to my colleagues first I'm this is taruna development get one yes that's definitely come up especially for a lot of those data sets that they listed as expecting them to be disaggregated by gender it's something that's really important for them especially knowing the beneficiaries of the project may know if that's like mothers or children it definitely should be gender disaggregated yeah up for some of the I NGOs working in this sector they're sort of specific interventions that they implement are sort of gender specific so that type of information is very keen to what they're planning to do and what they're do currently doing so yes that sort of the general lens is very much needed in from the NGO of prospective yeah and just to add to what my excited it's both on the implementing side so organizations are focused on on targeting women and so they're interested in in the efforts of other organizations ongoing who's targeting women as well but also from an advocacy perspective there's groups that are you know who's Coral sound making sure that that women also see benefits from from international assistance and in this sector in particular and so there they also need gender disaggregated data to assess the extent to which that's happening any other question sorry this is Matthew again I have one more question um you mentioned the report in the chat window I still not seeing it are you making that available the report on this on the data needs our public yet or aren't ready yet we're in the process of writing those and they'll be available next month um and sorry I it says that what we're typing in the chat box is going to the entire audience but clearly that is not the case so we'll make sure to send anything that's been spent in the chat and in a follow-up email to everyone and is the session itself being recorded it is and so we'll make that available as well yes great great great so we are going to take a break now for two minutes um so if you need to grab coffee and go ahead or bathroom break and we'll be back at let's say 908 to start our next part of the webinar of the discussion on how to take this work forward wonderfully person just to give a quick sense of what we're doing that for those of you who want to stay with us is out of the conversation we've been trying to draw some themes that are coming up that we're going to have to address in taking this project forward and we just want to get your thoughts and reflections on those so things around taxonomy is results data organization data location data so we'll just take each of those give each five minutes to sota to draw on your insights and wisdom just as aids as we start into the next phase of kind of responding to the supply and demand challenges highlighted so social in a few rows great thanks okay um think we're we're ready to get started hopefully we we will have a good discussion and i think what i'm going to do for this part is just unmute everyone and you have the option of muting yourself but obviously since this is a discussion and we want you to be able to speak so i will turn it over to Tim nail to get us started on on this discussion fantastic claims layer so um yeah we this is very much chance to get people more general bottom feedback I've identified a couple of different themes I think came out of our discussion so far um maybe we'll jump into each of those for a few min each and the first of the questions I want to pose which i think is a tension that's coming up is between whether we want complete information so we want complete coverage do we want to know in any given country or sector every single activity that is taking place is that the most important thing or setting up a bit of a false dichotomy but you can't always have everything is comprehensive information on a smaller number of projects more important so obviously we like both we'd like complete coverage and really comprehensive information but these people sense the one is more important than the other and also that one is more challenging to achieve than the other so so maybe I compose that's the first question for discussion and I did you know this dispersion here absolutely kiss this is Danny Walker from development gateway and on our discussions Audrey I think that's a really good between and on a crosshead a computer will think in terms of the discussions we've had it would probably be more helpful to have more you know data for every project I think it does depend on the goal whether it's coordination between donors or you know the quality and sickness of individual products and I think in our discussions donors and partners really prioritized knowing each other's initiatives and especially the locations of different initiatives and so I think a more broad cross-cutting data set would be helpful for the coordination of donor activities and even though a comprehensive more detailed data on a few projects perhaps be helpful in terms of projects individual project quality if that makes sense that makes a little sense it does that fit with other people's experience and kind of reflections or their other thoughts on that particular question something some of the discussions that we've had is that finding this data is really resource intensive both financially and staffs time so essentially if you were able to have a sort of a broad data set of what everyone is doing by default you you're reducing the cost of operations for a lot of these particularly I NGOs and one would think that they could use those resources more useful is total amount of funding that they have for specific agriculture and food security program so I in that case I think getting the complete information and then going on and having sort of different steps on the how do you improve the comprehensiveness of information would be a sort of a wiser strategy thanks Michael I wonder if any of our attendees them on the call her particular experience of sectors that have managed to get things comprehensive because i think yes getting broad coverage and comprehensive is it for everything is tricky but there's particular communities of practice i'm sure out there who've done a good job of being more comprehensive either in in people's kind of an engagement research did that come up or aqua 10 DS on the call of it and they're good examples we should be looking out for learning from my point to the recent the work the iata community have been doing around comprehensiveness and coverage of datasets which is available by the atty dashboard so i don't know when the wendys are with us still but that's an interesting part to look at iotic on those two perspectives of her broad and depth of the data sets around what's your point nice with the turn no Wendy if you are trying to say something i think you you're on mute yourself I so if you and mute yourself you should be able to comment there you go I'm here now I'll just get a cup of cheese so thanks for that um yes just try to what Stephen saying from an IT perspective we do we look at some essentially four aspects of data quality in terms of piety data which coverage is the most recent one that we started looking at in terms of seeing how much information and organization that's publishing to at is actually providing to us so the amount that effectively that they have just ended on their operations and their projects and programs you know we're actually looking to see how much of that is also being reported to iata as well to start getting some idea of the the real width of information that we're carrying in within the uart datasets but as stephen says we also look at comprehensiveness so you know looking at the various different fields that are available in the artist and Adam and which publishers are providing information in which fields so again we have a good sort of appreciation for against wedding to a slightly separate I mention of width in terms of the data that we have and we also because I actually was originally can see primarily to provide forward-looking data we look at how much sort of them budgetary information is published in order to you know basically trying to look three years ahead to have some idea of spin profiles cash flow where money is basically going to be because plan to be invested in the next coming years and then obviously to find meanness as well because again the point of IIT data is it's as up-to-date as possible so we do so monitor how frequently publishers are providing data and that's something you know that is available for anyone you can go and look at any time any donor and go to the arathi dashboard I put it in the chap and I'm finish speaking if you don't know and don't have a look see how good or whether a particular publisher maybe need some improvement i'm good i would certainly advocate just picking up something that i think Tim umut you said earlier we would always say you know if you are finding my atty data if you do happen to use it in any aspects of your work and you do can't come across data quality issues or information that's missing I would certainly as well as private okay that you know if you can contact that publisher directly to tell them because certainly in my experience if data user goes to a publisher and says look I need this data this is really useful can you give it to us they will react much more quickly than if say you were to come through to us and on the IT tech team centrally to have that conversation so it slightly something that I would say it's always worth bearing in mind if you want the data it's and was asking for it thanks Wendy that's a really really useful point to maybe maybe we can start segwaying into the the next theme i wants to pick up on which was this I come over which presenter mentioned this but the exempt which some organizations will go out and Commission their own studies and it's something we found in the landscape analysis as well that you've got lots of ad hoc data collection exercises taking place including where people are sending out spreadsheets collecting kind of project Neville information but the Deveaux your headline level of can you give us a name of the project how much is being spent um where there seems to be another missed opportunity there for for collaboration on bill and data sets rather than people gathering lots of data to write a report and then for that data to live in Excel spreadsheets on analytical machines so I just wanted to explore that theme a bit more with if there's something that this project should pursue are not through a tee but through those kinds of other data collection exercise is what could be done to to make that an entry point to a better investment later landscape yeah really did you want to say something you've just got your webcam though you're muted I believe okay hi can you hear me now oh yes yeah I know it's like you can either see people are here but you can't do both um so I just wanted to say this is sort of a simple-minded answer in some ways but i think you know we heard from so many people about so many donors about them doing their own landscape analyses and i think there's a real lost opportunity to at least gather those and share them um you know I think historically those kinds of strategy documents are kept as internal work products at foundations and I think we could avoid a lot of duplication actually by just making sure that those are captured and shared and openly disseminated I think that's fantastic point it would be really useful for this project think about how that fits within its scope and maybe links as well a bit too I think Matthew earlier mentioned go down as an initiative trying to just encourage organizations to commit to more open data and opening up there there there there there there publications generally outside of outside of their kind of investment date sets I see Marcos raising a hand do you want to meet Marc Cohn um everyone should be and you did at this point you just have to unmute yourself in order to speak go ahead and Marco you're a little quiet if you could speak loudly that would be great working as do so as it lets organizations and as long as to be setting these standards up between us so that I noticed in some of the background material that there are some tools to extract data from ERP systems and then to map them to the RT standards etc I would say that the opportunity is in making the yapping standards embedded in our ERP system I think that's a really key point of how do we make sure some of these standards are are there at source because every time we're asking them to do extra work of classifying data later on or or converting data we reduce the chance of it happening so find a good place to do that's a challenge let's really key point this is Matthew I wanted to comment on that as well like that you know the more that we can get folks to have those data standards embedded whether you know in reporting techniques in software in devices and you know whether your bar coding you know relief food you know in any way shape or form having those systems and that to me would be a priority would be developing systems that can be deployed in multiple places but for which the data standards are already invited thanks Matthew and just a reminder that if you're not speaking if you could please mute yourself that puppy that would be great this is taryn um I shouldn't want to talk about some of your feedback that we got on this Oh so a lot of the bilaterals and multi larger scope did do their own landscape and often would contract other organizations or other companies to do these landscapes and research for them as well it talked also about the need to share this more broadly so everyone was not collecting think it repeatedly but I'm a view of the difficulties in doing this included a just the policy and process in place but also some of those companies restricted them from sharing the data and they could you know say US aid could share it within the government but couldn't share it outside of that and then other times they would get the data from local governments who had cut you themselves and again they didn't quite have the power authority to share that more broadly so this is well I think there are ways and that they were thinking about you know creating better practices around sharing its data there are still some of these political bottlenecks and it will fall nexon and doing that so it's also something to consider that will be difficult i'm looking to happen but that's a really interesting point about how to help you out whether it's the contracts the agreement people have with those people doing the research what norms monthly searches any other thoughts on this question of how do we capture data outside of the atty data from other sources I think mark on a jump and again I saw you raise your hand Marco not sure if you wanted to make another point and perhaps Matthew as well I was trying to go over my head ok no worries yes so I'll just jump in and say yeah that map's directly with this conference we're planning in November and if I if I get your guys as the email addresses or if there's a participant list I'd be happy to send out the the preparations slide we're putting the international organization committee together right now but but the way we have it's lighted so far is there's basically two tracks for the conference one is essentially LC ethical legal social interoperability issues for African operability between data sets and the other is technical interoperability issues and so we see those is really in essence two separate workflows and tracks that need to be people need to be in communication with each other you know essentially to build this you know information superhighway and of foods and health and to figure out which are the toll roads essentially in which are the roads where you know that are free to travel on contesting people to really useful things to the debate that maybe we can again open up safely while let's pick up on one around the the ethics here and thinking carefully about these their data that shouldn't be disclosed and when that came up in anyone's kind of engagements and conversations I'm certainly in some of the transcripts I've where people are concerned about kind of competitive angles to not sharing data but I'm curious if ethics came up at all and secondly you've raised the issue of what what might be free or what of this ecosystem of of data enrichment and curation might need funding in different ways and even commercial funding models so to be really keen if anyone's got thoughts on that and particularly say from the experience of the atty world where intermediaries of needed hunting and i just want to point out that that catherine and from mcc just shared a lessons learned document from their data to x initiative which just makes my rights and her to segregated data available and we were releasing it to yadi so it's the addy specific thanks Catherine that's fantastic what made it with a 10 or 15 minutes left I can take us into some of the very substantive kind of data field issues we're going to encounter in the coming weeks and again after school and the next few weeks will share with everyone a a collaboration space where we'll be discussing these things in depth but one two three or four where is that have come up taxonomy is results organizations and location maybe I can start on location as I see we've got a few location experts I think on that on the call and what are the you know right now the ERT standard has quite a sophisticated way of saying where a project is located and without a gap so people seeing other things we need to be able to do around location or what's what's the most important bit of location information that to have available and this is liya and i'll i'll just say that for our part in our consultations this came out is a very strong need as well um there's differing opinions about what level of granularity you need in terms of location information and so some people want very very detailed sort of exact locations but there seemed the second administrative level seems to be sort of a consensus point of that that would be a good level to try to hit yes I in the city we came to the same conclusion as well so just to do level with trying to work against my admin level to the other thing we're trying to implement is to have to have a little bit of taxonomy attached to its location token of having people what type of describe what type of location disease because you know the range of activities is quite large sometime it so he could be the location of a of a you know an experimental farm or nurseries as far as he is concerned or you know a location that's more permanent sometimes it's just a project location sometime its application of a training event and in front of a television on a partner so and we tend to receive those those maps you know it's problem very difficult to to aggregate this information so oh I mean after some discussion the level two I mean music is rooted also having a little bit of extra the description of what the activity actually represent I mean what the location sorry actually represents thanks for letting every veteran useful the other point out there was also discussions cuz you know I'd mean level two there's a lot of administrative maps so i get is encouraging the use of young and one version of the gal but I mean you have to help users with typically because you know between the UN the girl and the gather and other administrative systems and national systems it gets confusing so that's something my kid I'm sorry I was just going to say that as part of interactions NGO 8 initiative we we also which gathers information on the work of our members at the project level we're also trying to move to edmonton in something that we're finding it's just that a lot of the Gaza tears don't have very up-to-date information on what the current admin to levels or boundaries are so that's another area from improvement and then making some of those sources that may be more up-to-date open so that anyone can use them some of them are limited to UN agencies for example I think that's another area for us to work on as well and testing any other thoughts on location before we move on so the other way of you I've got down here is is organizations understanding the kind of organization partners I think a big theme coming up is knowing who are the partners working in a given area an organization data is is notoriously difficult as well of getting identifies for things other than companies and understanding not only kind of where their head offices but God where they're working on on the ground I'm so I'm curious if people have particular experience of working with organization data again kind of user needs or pitfalls of things we should I'm consider and certainly there's a theme here Stephen I think when we looked at the atty data we were finding there's not much in terms of say contact details and bloody user needs are saying we want to know who the person is and I think missing mainly its its organizational level kind of contact details of that right yeah I think I think we found those major generic contact details across the organization rather than specific color activity typically we haven't looked so far into the quality of the identifier of organizations in the RT data sets but again i'd imagine that's quite reflective of where the wider IT data since too it's a big challenge to try and for the first of all identifying and secondly uniquely identify organizations in common with others so yeah we did with a also pick that up from the user research i've read as well about having that clear and sent as to who who's doing what hey I think sort of as a reference is something that I heard a lot is that it would be useful to understand the participating organizations throughout the whole value chain and it's not just one endpoint on another it's just really useful to understand who is doing one throughout the whole value chain and not something that really came across and I think that that's like a bare minimum that's gay that's a good challenging bare minimum to enforce its last so it's great um maybe i'll use that segues to the same value chains of understanding and classifying value chain so i think across the landscape analysis of existing data i started in our dataset to create a column for you know a structured data column for what sector classifications of the data use and i realized it might as well have been a free text field because everyone was using slightly different classifications of crops and crop types and so on in their investment data and so that's big challenge ahead of us is is what kind of classification schemes might be needed for understanding value chains crops technologies and so answer a question for the taxonomy sea monsters and another dick solemnise by any means but when you spoke about organizations you mentioned context I would like to point out that there's often a dilemma in making contact information available versus privacy and ethical issues that's a really good point not sure exactly what you're looking for here in terms of talking about taxonomy um I do think it's important to to move beyond taxonomy zand into essentially computable ontology where we can start leveraging you know artificial intelligence for you know ontology enabled case based reasoning we can do various you know first order logic reasoning and so so I think it's essential for organizations to look at how they can transform their taxonomy Xin to you no formal tractable ontology and then and then actually you know build systems using these these ontologies I think and in fact you know there's there's nothing keeping us from building ontology around privacy so that we can you know compute when it's appropriate to share data and when it's not in privacy is just one example you know it could be a paywall it could be other other issues to prevent people from having access to data but I think that that's an essential piece to moving forward with increasing the valorisation of the data and the data collection process thanks monkey is a quick point I mean I doesn't agree with the previous speaker me and and in fact it was I mean within this dissidia we would spend quite a bit of amount of resources on on tracking actually a mining text document because a lot of this information on our technologies is to be found in in both publication and some of the research programs proposals and then document from part from partners like USA it actually did a big exercise trying to repertory technologies in Africa I think it was or specific technologies that came with smart technologies so we did spend like you know mom's actually mining these documents to try to come up with a more structured ontology and it's not an easy exercise it's usually I mean this this the sort of skills are really hard to get by and it's you know we have a few ontology special is that is pretty and if you at bio versity but I mean it it's usually not what our organizations have or do so it is a barrier and then when you have an ontology the other big barrier is people don't know how to use them at all and we don't have tools to make it really easy so that was that's barrier number two thanks well maybe if I didn't just ask for luck to you or anyone with experience of that kind of text mining of how effective it is using that's the approach to automatically classify or in Accords based on associated documents is that is that an avenue we should be exploring or is that kind of an area where unless we have you no access to many many experts we're going to struggle with and this is gabby from foundation sand and the work that we've been doing that issue lab as well as auto coatings from the grand static foundation center on a larger scale I think text mining piece it's been easier for us to do it for instance on grants was shorter just where the text is less idiosyncratic and constrained in terms of length when we've been trying to do it on and I think this is maybe similar to what you were just describing now trying to do it on larger reports and on research pieces we can certainly get part of the way and have had some success with that we would love to have a separate discussion with people about that if they're interested but still getting back to the quality issues it's still at some point is requiring that we have human attention to it so it gets as part of the way but it's not the magic box that I think we need it to be but I do think it's something that is worth a kind of collective investment rather than it being kind of one offset different organizations so maybe that's a kind of separate order king group in a way because I think there's a ton of value in a ton of data buried in these long-form idiosyncratic reports this is matthew um III I think that that partnering with with experts is absolutely the way to go and you just hit on I'm started I don't know your name you just spoke and text mining is only one application of ontology and and it's it's a little bit like I think talking about you know how much money maybe we're spending on you know a new transportation system and when it's only partially built you know we haven't really seen the return on investment because nobody's using it and so I think what what we need to consider is is all of the various things that can utilize you know the innocence a new transportation system where where we can query know across scientific domains where we can query across industry or or nonprofit or governmental resources you know in facebook I can ask the question in the search box i can say show me which of my friends graduated from harvard and went to disneyland in between 2013 and 2016 i can ask that question and it will show me the answer and pictures you know and if I can ask that question of face book certainly I should be able to ask questions about the relative nutrition and health improvement of the population based on a variety of different inputs and none of that is going to happen until we start codifying vocabulary into into you know computable vocabularies and and that's that's what I'm interested in doing it and text mining is just just a very small part of that that's that's that's how we sort of gather the initial you know vocabularies to begin with and then and then you know building them out is a whole nother process that there's a really interesting vision in that as you say if it can that ability to answer those questions as I user needs research came up with so much I think in that user needs reset we brought often asking for a map or for a kind of query interface but when you describe what the facebook search is we're familiar with using often you know a vision that we should be able to do that for egg investment is really useful vision and for us to think what would what would it take to get there um so we've got maybe two or three minutes left the last thing my head on my list was around results and goals information and but but I think maybe given time we should just leave open for any closing thoughts people have on kind of key issues that need to be addressed in there the coming weeks and then we can just recap where we go from here hi it's Wendy can I just add something to what was it Matthew just spoke actually about so am I completely agree obviously one of the things I at E is trying to do is some of that codifying effectively of data we have a whole series of vocabularies to obviously standardized you know what are allowed values and what data can be included in content and the point I was just going to make though was of course the biggest challenge we find with that is obviously working with publishers every organization will have its own internal set of vocabularies or taxonomy or whatever which its whole operation tends to be sort of loaded around so I just really wanted to flag up that you know as obviously getting to the data and getting it all sort of into a good shareable formats you know it does go further back into the organizations themselves will have to look at how they are generating that data at source you know quite often it does require changes to internal systems you know not just IT systems but business processes around so it certainly can be done it's perfectly achievable but I think it's worth of flagging that up really the term you know the stand there having the standardization of data is obviously just part of the solution and you know it's slightly larger than that right that that speaks to my point of the fact that that these these ontologies can't be built in isolation they can't be built by one organization they they have to be built in concert and in concert with people across disciplines in concert with people across economic sectors if if we truly want to to to have in essence the query interface that I just spoke of great so any any last words I'm particularly from also the the kind of analysts if then I'll say massive thanks certainly from myself and Stephen on the services side and with the rest of the project team will be getting together in a few weeks to really kind of carry on putting together these these challenges that we have ahead and then to certainly the egg working group that was mentioned will be sharing a number of issue discussions to dig deeper into identifying ways we can go forward and over the course of June working towards a proposal for a range of tools and data standard changes that can deal with these areas of kind of quality collection and curation of data as layers put up on the screen I'll let you talk to me to those final next steps yeah I just wanted to mention that so as Tim said the the project team is going to be getting together in a few weeks on jun 9th and as part of that we'd like to invite others to sort of react to our latest thinking in terms of how to take this work forward so we will send information around to everyone about the full details for that but just know that it's scheduled for jun 9th and then finally if you would like to be involved we've had great input just on this call so if you would like to continue being involved in in our work as we develop the standards and the tools and the support needed to make the data of high quality and relevant to AG and food security practitioners invite you to sign up for the community of practice that yadi AG
