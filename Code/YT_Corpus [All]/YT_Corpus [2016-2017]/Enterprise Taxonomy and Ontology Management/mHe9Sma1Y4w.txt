 after our first opening keynote which was already mentioned by jakub he's the senior vice president of talent strategy and innovation that's a very big job title at kforce but what's nice to know is also my personal hero when it comes to candidate sourcing I've learned so much from this particular person especially by looking at his blog because under sources and recruiters he's well known under the name of boolean black belt so ladies and gentlemen I want to invite to the stage mr. Glen Kathy so here's your clicker so what what do you think are going to be the T key takeaways of your story today for the people in the room can you reveal a little bit I would say I'll go with two one would be that I think semantics search solutions and artificial intelligence are actually a really good way to automate the human algorithm the things that really good people already do it's figuring out how to automate that and then you can replicate that across people who may not have those skills I'd say that's one of the big takeaways and the other is that in today's day and age a lot of recruiters are actually loaded down with a number of requisitions that they've have to work on a monthly basis or a weekly basis and technology is a really good way to enable people to be able to handle a heavy workload and still do the proactive recruitment which so many recruiters unfortunately can't do if they don't have the right tools because they're focused so much on the inbound okay well looking forward to your talk yeah thank you all right thanks all right so we are gonna well first I want to say I'm honored to be here I'm just as excited to see the rest of the program but looked at the lineup it was fantastic so again thank you very much for inviting me out here to speak on something I'm incredibly passionate about I wanted to actually set the stage for the challenge because my talk is on you know how semantic search changes and impacts recruitment and I think it before we jump into that we have to talk about what what are the current challenges that recruitment the recruitment industry faces to figure out how semantic search actually addresses those challenges so I can start advancing here alright so people would probably agree with these quotes I just like to throw them up because we're going to set the stage and say that most executives would tell you that people are their greatest assets right they may disagree with such a statement okay this is also one of my favorite quotes too because I do believe that the end of the day you do bet on people you don't bet on strategies people create the strategies people create products they invent patents they create solutions they provide value to people but if you start off with these premises right companies say that people are a greatest asset there's nothing more important than finding and hiring great people what we're what I'm seeing today is a shift towards inbound recruitment this is actually a really good ebook that indeed put out recently and it talks about it focuses heavily on inbound recruiting which you would expect because it's indeed and there's nothing wrong with that necessarily but if you if you look at this slide you'll see something very interesting it's that line and this is straight from that ebook it's obviously hey go free inbound and inbound is basically posting jobs posting vacancies and having people come to you the inbound aspect and you'll see well maybe you try it for free and it works a lot in fact my own company for a while until that got shut down for Staffing Agencies was making a lot of hires for free using inbound and you'll see then it goes to paid in Bound before it even goes out to outbound if needed and that's what we're gonna talk about quite a bit is the if needed part this is an interesting post that came up on LinkedIn the other day that got a lot of traction I'm not sure if any of you guys saw it I'm sure that it's got more than 55,000 views now it's a guy from homedepot.com basically saying the recruiting industry is dead and obviously we've heard a lot of things have died over the years like job boards we're gonna kill staffing firms and all kinds of things and of course robots are gonna replace us but in this case he's talking about the fact that recruitment is dying and that we just need to evolve to digital marketing and I don't disagree with the fact that digital marketing has to evolve and in down inbound recruiting is something that we need to master and get better and better at but the thing that I like to do too it's the counterpoint so if you start looking at any kind of breakdown of the job seeking status of the average person you know whatever the stats you use and depending on your source the reality is the majority of people are not looking the minority of people are looking and so I really like to drive the point home that digital marketing and your inbound recruiting strategies really only work on the minority of the talent pool and I think that's important if you care about going back to you know Sir Richard Branson and other people saying well people are a greatest asset so what are we doing are we focusing on the small minority of the people who happen to be looking to me that may not be the best talent acquisition strategy and there was an article that Lou Adler actually posted online on LinkedIn recently and he said that the recruiting industry is facing an existential threat which sounds like a really kind of scary thing right but essentially what he's saying is look right now we're not in a surplus of talent model so why are we using that and if the majority of people are not actively looking to make jobs why are companies spending so much time trying to focus on the other 10 to 20 percent that are easy to get these are things that I think about on a daily basis so really an executive might say that people are a greatest asset there's nothing more important than you know finding hiring and retaining great people but the reality is a lot of companies whether they admit it or not they're focusing mostly on the low-hanging fruit so it's essentially going to the orchard and actually stooping down and picking up the apples that have already fallen off the tree and I'm not saying those aren't bad apples but the reality is when you think of a fruit tree and this is something that I think will always stick with me I've used it in many of my talks is the fact that there's a lot of fruit that you can't reach that's not that's not on the ground it's not within arm's reach in fact volumetrically just like the talent pool there's more people that you have to break a ladder out and actually climb up to get them but the problem with that is today many companies low down the recruiters with I can't say it's an unreasonable amount of rx2 work but you know sometimes I hear twenty thirty some companies I hear forty five jobs that a single recruiter is responsible for and really can't blame them from the fact that well why are they not relying 100% on inbound because they really don't have time to proactively go out and perform the product of recruiting which is the outbound recruiting and another thing that people like to write about online and and I have nice debates with people is that well aren't there more people that you can find online now than ever before it's true you have online resume CD databases for the job boards you have LinkedIn unprecedent access to tons of people Facebook other social networks but I always like to have a counterpoint here is that just because you have more access to more people it doesn't make it any easier to find the right person in that crowd in fact I've argued that the bigger the crowd the harder it is to find a single person in the crowd right so I can't get away from this either and I don't know I'm guilty of using the haystack analogy all the time the reality is is if the haystack gets bigger it's not any easier to find the needle in the haystack and that's what we're getting every single day there's more information available about more people which makes it seem on the surface like it's easier to find people but you guys aren't looking just for people you're not looking for hay you're looking for specific strands or in this case we'll talk about needles and if you're like me you actually just want to get a big giant magnet out and kind of suck out all the best people of the haystack and be done with it right and that's what we're talking about is how do we automate things like this not the manual sifting through the the haystack but actually pulling out all the needles systematically using something like technology so this is something I also like to drive home is that the value of data really is it's zero unless you can retrieve it and it's it's it's not really that valuable unless you can quickly easily and precisely retrieve and when it comes to human capital data like Stevie's and social profiles people that have a high probability of being the right match for what you're looking for now I talked about this before and I didn't put it in the deck but I'll just mention is I feel like I've broken it down to a number of key variables when you're trying to recruit somebody or you're really trying to predictably control variables like what skills they have what job they would like to take next what's the next step in their career where they would like to work in terms of location compensation that they're looking for are they even available these are things that are all variables that you can apply and with technology you can actually to exert more predictive control over it so if you're familiar with gambling it's kinda like counting cards and if you're really good with with data you can actually count the cards so that you can find fewer people quickly who are more likely to respond to you be the right match and hire them and it's kind of a good scenario so I had to pull this offline this was recently posted in a Facebook group and the guy basically says how is it possible that about 70% of people in a roomful of recruiters have never heard of boolean which is kind of sad right I'm sure George Boole was probably rolling over his grave right father of computer science in many ways right but the challenges that is shocking I've worked with a lot of people and if they don't if the recruiter doesn't know boolean then what kind of searches do you think they're running single term searches one title plus a skill incredibly unrefined to basics but the reality is it's actually never been about boolean the boolean logic just happens to be the easiest way to to syntactically put together a query and a query is just a formal statement of what you need but the reality is so many recruiters struggle with just basic boolean and we're only talking about three operators primarily your ands or ORS in your nots it is pretty simple but it really isn't about the boolean operators because I was chatting with someone earlier in today before we started kicked off the conference it's not even about the operators that's just the glute it sticks it together it's actually more about the words that you put between the operators and then this is another funny thing that I always like to say it's that all searches work if I type in a title it's gonna work it's gonna return results if I type in three keywords the search is going to work but the question is how good is the search how good are the results and then how quickly can they identify the right match which goes back to what I was saying before the value of the data is directly proportional to how quickly and easily and precisely you can find people have a high probability being the right match I don't think many recruiters actually say it that way that's what they want but when they're putting in really basic searches and not even using boolean logic they're actually not exerting any predictive control over the qualifications of people and so we're gonna I'm going to kick into a video that some of you may have seen if you haven't it's gonna be a real treat I hope this is a brilliant quote by Deming if you don't follow Deming I highly recommend that you go start looking at some of his works this is such a brilliant quote you know if you don't know how to ask the right question you discover nothing this is so true about data analytics reporting business intelligence but also it's also very relevant when it comes to recruiting because when you go to a database that's essentially what you're trying to do is ask a question do you have somebody with these skills with this experience who's likely to want the job that I'm thinking of them for that will probably take the commute and the money will probably be in the range that's acceptable that's really what you're saying but if you only put in a title and a keyword you're really not doing a good job of translating that query into the system so let's see the good di I think is a good example of what's really going on for most recruiters today hello just after semi-skimmed milk your search for semi skimmed milk return zero results you don't fill milk your search for milk returned fifty two thousand two hundred and fifty six results the top hip milk of magnesia no milk floats of yesteryear no this milk seemed family will planner no sorry I'm um I'm just looking for you know normal milk couldn't find what you're looking for that's what I'm saying I couldn't find it so I'm asking you if you could search all right let's do this key what no go uh yeah okay milk please narrow your search by using one of the following Phil talks kayaks Packard twelve self-cleaning breakfast in condom that one breakfast one result milk skim semi semi skim milk that's why first toasty for its milk skim semi so that's from Google Analytics that's right off of YouTube I thought that was brilliant because many people are running a search and if it's a literal search and it's not semantic it only returns exactly what you're looking for but what if you're looking for is actually not mentioned in the same way this person was looking for a semi skim milk and I didn't even know that there was milk skim semi or you could say it that way but I like to point out that a lot of recruiters on unwittingly are running searches like this and that's the kind of experience they're having when they run searches in CB databases and even on social networks and then I like to point this out this is actually a local search for people that have a title to software engineer and just happen to mention Java it's really simple search one title one keyword and you'll notice this is local to your area you know she's got a 50-mile range that's kind of ranging out there but that's 7,000 results all right what do you think recruiters do with that do they look at all 7,000 results no it's impractical where do you think they start they start at the top who is at the top are the best people at the top know why are the people at the top that are at the top keyword matches and it's not even semantic so if they have the title of software engineer they match but what about programmer or developer consultant things like that so getting a lot of results some people were like yeah that's great but the reality is getting a lot of results in many cases actually causes lots of problems for recruiters and they don't realize it and this is something that I always like to explain to folks when I train recruiters on how to search I say look look what you're up against you're looking at you know you Ju sir generated content that's one of the primary challenges of recruiters face today is the fact that the things you're searching are created by people and people vary widely and they have problems when they write their CVS the best one on here I think is the fact that some people believe that a one-page CV is still the best and here's a really big aha moment for you if someone with three to five years of experience or even more is trying to limit their experience to one page what are they doing anyway tell me there's they're leaving things out so they're actually doing things and have skills and experience that they're consciously removing which means you can't search for it anymore so you may be searching for skills and experience people have you simply can't retrieve them but they're there that's the kind of stuff that drives me crazy all the time is that I'm worried I don't really care about the results I get I'm actually really more concerned about the results I don't get because some of those people could be better candidates than the ones that are easy to find okay well the second to last bullet is that most people don't sit down and say I'm gonna create this CV the social profile for recruiters to find me some do and that's okay some do and they're the ones that you don't want to find I'm sure if we have staffing folks in the room you see that you're like how does this guy show up and every single one of my searches whether it's a software engineer a project manager a business analyst a network engineer it's like how does this person do that because they keyword loaded their resume so I've talked about this for many years and I like to cut the concept of dark matter you know so I'm not an astronomer but if you understand dark matter is something that we know theoretically existed you can't perceive it directly when it comes to human capital data you encounter large volumes of dark matter that you're not even you have no clue that it's there if I run a search for a software engineer I can't pull up a program without semantic search I'm literally excluding that person and I have no clue that they're me maybe hundreds sometimes thousands of results available to me but because I asked the wrong question or asked a good a good question it was too simple it only returned it like the milk skim semi semi skimmed milk situation unbeknownst to a lot of recruiters I research they run actually excludes people that they won't even know exists again this is something for many years that maybe it's just to think maybe I'm just different I don't know I'm always worried about Who am I excluding who's good I can't return with this search that I could change it but most people don't think about that that's why I like to bring this up because semantic search is gonna put a big big fat dent into dark matter so I'd be talking about this for many years is that so to combat this before I had any kind of technology to be able to tackle these things I tried to classify the different levels of manual text mining right using boolean or maybe even some extended boolean depending on the search engine using to be able to get more value out of human capital so level one is basic keyword search software in Java you saw the kind of results that come up there level two is conceptual search and I'll show you some examples of texts kernel actually and as many of the solutions that show you how to do that is if I look for programmer it's smart enough to know that those are also called software engineers and many other titles so that's grouping a concept one one one word expands to multiple words that mean the same thing synonymous terms number three gets a little tricky that's implicit search that's where recruiters have to know that well if somebody works here and they're an accountant they probably have si P even if they don't mention si P on their CV so I met actually strategically exclude si P from my search and just look for accountants at that company and call them and ask them do you have sa P and nine times out of ten they will so I'm searching for things that imply the right experience they may not be directly represented and then I'm talking about manual natural language search I'll show you I think one of li example later in the deck on how you can combine nouns and verbs through proximity just using straight boolean and number five is indirect search which is well if I'm looking for a software engineer maybe I want to actually talk to testers because testers work with software engineers so who can I find quickly that will lead me to the right person even if the first person that contact isn't my direct target but the problem with all that is for many years I've tried to create more people like me I wanted to clone me and say how can I create all these other awesome search experts and I think probably less than five percent of the time I've been successful so the reality is I can't clone I can't clone me there's a few people that get this kind of stuff and they get really excited about it and it really makes them more productive so I know we have a lot of staffing folks I used an old Lotus Notes base see past database early in my career and by my fourth month I was a virgin a placement since then an IT staffing agency a place in Vermont consistently so that was very high in fact it was record-setting at my company and I tell people that only to say the only reason why I could do that is guy got really good with data I got really good queries I could find people in our database of 80,000 CVS or so that other people couldn't find that they were there it's like being a good fisherman we all have access to the same ocean but some of us catch more fish sometimes you just can't teach everybody to be an awesome fisherman so that's where we start to get into technology so obviously the desire is you want systems to know what you mean and this is a brilliant quote from someone who definitely knows what they're talking about when it comes to search I love this it's like we're trying to move away from give me what I said right that's the milk's you know semi skim milk to give me what I want even if it's called milk skim semi you know what I want it needs to understand what I'm looking for so when you are using a semantic search solution such as text kernels you know I wanted to break down what I think are the primary impacts positive impacts to recruitment today on what it does and I'd say the number one is definitely the automation of what it's like the automation of the human algorithm so you realize a really good person who's got really good sourcing skills when they sit down they talk to the hiring manager they get the requirements they can translate the requirements in their brain and they can translate that into a query into the system that the system understands that returns really good results very precise results of people are highly probable I mean in many cases you can sit down with someone who's really good at this and they run a search and within the first five calls they're finding the best candidate that's not replicable from person to person that's kind of the art I've tried to turn it to a science and some people pick it up but the reality is we should leverage technology to figure out how do we take the human algorithm and automate it so we don't have to have a whole bunch of search experts some people are very good at the recruitment aspect the human element and we shouldn't expect everybody to be a search expert increased inclusion is a huge thing what I mean by inclusion it ties into the next detail which is the exploitation and exploration of dark matter so if I didn't do a good job of explaining it before any time I'm looking for something if I don't explicitly ask for it let's say I'm looking for a business analyst I type in the title business analyst I'm actually excluding people with the title business systems analyst or requirements analyst or just functional analysts because my query didn't ask for it I can't retrieve people who don't say it and I call that dark matter because it gets excluded but with semantic search if it knows that a business analyst it's the same thing as a business systems analyst or requirements analyst or analyst it starts to include more people and inclusion is very important when it comes to search and that also allows you to start digging into the dark matter of results that previously were excluded you had no idea were there and it starts to surface them for the user without them having to even be aware they was there in the first place and then speed of relevant can identification is not something that can be understated and I'll show you a graph in a second but first I wanted to show you something because we have implemented text kernel you know if you if you look at this search it's three words right but each word has a number of synonyms you know seventeen twenty forty so essentially a user could type in three queries and I apologize if there's non IT recruiters in here it doesn't matter what the terms are really it's the fact that a user can say well I need people with these skills well that three word query becomes over seventy term query which is what you know if you look at some of the searches that the recruiters that I trained have their giant boolean search strings with these giant or statements of twenty and forty and seventeen terms this essentially automates that and no one ever has to do that again so what if somebody doesn't know all forty terms that are related to cloud they don't have to that's the brilliance of semantic search it understands what cloud means whether the person says cloud or not and I think I have a yeah so it pulls out and I talked about this in a moment about the fact that it starts to give people more insight it's like well I love a white box semantic search solutions which text kernel is there's some really good semantic search solutions on the market today that are more what I call black box which it doesn't tell you what it's thinking it just you type a keyword and you get what you get you have to trust it I love being able to look at it and saying well what do you think is synonymous with the dupe and I may agree or disagree and I can start to provide feedback which is incredible part incredibly powerful part of search today is it's not just press a button get results ago it's press a button what's coming back and why and is there something I can do to intelligently change the results to make more relevant to me and so when I talk about inclusion and semantic search is it you want systems to know what sales means what is a substation mean if I look for a substation engineer what are all the terms that mean that someone might have substation experience or Hadoop or what if I'm looking for a top performer what is what is a top performer mean well you can start building out these synonym lists for semantic search so that as a recruiter only has to type in sales top performer and you get people with sales experience regardless of the title you get top performers regardless of how they talk about being a top performer so again two words can easily become a 50 word query which is a huge huge benefit for recruiters and the speed of identification I'm not exaggerating you know I've sat down my own I've kind of time myself I work with some people that have trained that are really good when you're working with a good database that has semantic search technology you can identify at least a person a minute and if you compare that to posting a job or asking for referrals it's not a matter of do you get people it's do you get people who are closely matched and when you when you search for people you have a control over those variables and if I can find up to a person a minute or even if I'm only half that half as good as that if I can find a person every two minutes if I can source 30 people in an hour that are closely matched that is a huge impact of semantic search on productivity per associate which is something anybody in the recruitment industry is wants to be able to impact positively so the final things I want to talk about here is that if you are using a white box solution when it comes to semantic search the recruiters can learn so if I have a new recruiter that's new to IT and they say well I don't even know what Hadoop is if I go back a couple slides you open up and can say oh well HDFS is do big is Hadoop hive is Hadoop MapReduce is Hadoop it actually tells you by the way you search for Hadoop but Hadoop is related to all these other technologies so recruiters actually learn along the way it's it again kind of brings to the surface where the average recruiter would have to do by looking at hundreds of resumes and trying to do the pattern recognition manually so big big big impact there obviously we don't need to have search experts and again I used to be for many years the guy who wanted to convert all recruiters into search experts and I realize that's an exercise in futility it's not going to happen maybe 10 percent of all people that in recruiting really have the propensity and the interest in the and the capability to get really good at search we shouldn't expect them to be that let's use people to do what they're good at which is the people element the human element of recruiting you know the engagement aspect the there were the relationship building the understanding what's next in your career that's where the people should be doing more and they can rely on technology to surface people where they can have more of those conversations with on a daily basis and probably one of the most important things is that when you have a heavy req load and you're posting your vacancies and you're dealing with all of your applicants and many of them are not qualified when you have a good semantic search technology solution that enables you to perform that outbound recruiting in a very short period of time it doesn't take you eight hours to find thirty people in fact sometimes it can take you 30 minutes to find 20 people to call 20 well matched people not just applicants who may or may not be qualified so this is a man I love to quote for those who don't know he used to be the former data scientist and head of query understanding at LinkedIn which is pretty interesting title right but he basically look search engines really can't figure out what you're looking for in a single search and that's something that I want to make everyone aware of I'm gonna start talking a little bit about where I think the the future of semantic search needs to go in the near term you know we need to use our brains because there's a big difference between related and relevant and you know the name is actually on there but I wanted so we're really interesting it's like a word cloud so if I'm a recruiter I'm looking for c-sharp and you look at this word cloud and if you've done IT recruitment you know that all of these words are related to c-sharp it's fair but if I'm looking for a c-sharp developer who's to say that WPF or even WCF are even relevant to what I'm looking for what if that's not even a requirement I don't want the search engine to start saying well I see people that have all these other things in its they even yeah but it's great that it's related but it's not relevant to me and that's where I you know I sometimes I just have to go back to the dictionary if you look at the second definition of relevance it's the ability and this is straight out of Webster's dictionary the ability as of an information retrieval system to retrieve material that satisfies the needs of the user people creating these systems need to think it's not just so much about related terms it's also about what's relevant but if you don't have a feedback mechanism you really can't have the user tell the system hey I like your results but they're not really relevant to me you have to have some kind of interaction with the systems which ties me into the future so what do I think needs to come next when it comes to semantic search to even accelerate some of the benefits I've been talking about how it positively impacts recruitment today so one of them is this concept that I stumbled across years ago and I hopefully I'm gonna pronounce his name right Gary Marcio Nene he talks about this hcir so it's human human computer information retrieval and he his whole point is that you have to involve humans in the process and it's not just because we don't want to be fully automated and lose jobs and I don't think we will be losing jobs I think it's just gonna evolve our industry but his he makes a brilliant point is that the user has to expend some mental energy and participating with the given the give and take in the dialog that Jakub was talking about it's you have to have a dialogue with systems and say well here's what I want and the system should say well here's what I think you said and then you should be able to say well that's not exactly what I said let's make a let's refine the search that's a much better interaction than what most recruiters do today which is put in a couple of key words and they literally just go right into the results they're not asking why am I getting those results why are there some false positives how can I improve this search this jump in so it's to be a it needs to be an input mechanism where people can actually be responsible for you know expending some cognitive energy and taking responsibility for the results because it is just a machine and it's trying to understand your query so if you were looking for and again I apologize if you're not an IT recruitment that's what I've been doing all my life so I the examples make sense to me the reality is whatever the keywords are for the types of things you recruit if you look at a Seabee result like this you can kind of say well this person probably could be a good match right and it's not just because they're a bunch of highlighted keywords it says that they're actually relevant keywords so you're like this person is doing a lot of work with EMC storage area networking what I want to see come next from semantic search is something like this and I used I've been using this example for years because this is an actual candidate that I recruited so if you compare the number of keyword hits on the previous slide with the number of keyword hits on this slide there's only two but if everybody wants to take a quick second and just read that first sentence what does that tell you what does that say about that person this is very good right this goes back to the user-generated content issue some people explain their experience in this way and they don't necessarily have to barf out a bunch of keywords like this to look really good with the technology they may mention it once or twice and they may be 10 times better than the previous candidate what I want to highlight there of course is this part so if I'm designing solutions with this product line for the largest network in the world I'm going to be using all the technologies that are on the previous person CV but I may not be explicitly mentioning it because maybe it didn't even occur to me to put it on there and I don't want to use a system that excludes someone this to the dark matter where I'll never return them because as soon as I type in a keyword like s RDF or V block this person can't come up because it's simply don't even mention the term yet this is probably one of the best candidates as you could potentially recruit for this position so I want systems to start to understand beyond the keyword match and look at the grammatical aspect of what does it mean to work on the largest network in the world as humans we immediately figure that out but machines right now have a hard time figuring out I think that's one of the next frontiers that people need to move into and it might be small and you might have a hard time and I was gonna have fun with this example can you guys tell me what types of things this this product development engineer is actually engineering so right now you're human algorithms are running we got some pharmacy pharmaceutical we're gonna have a winner in here so I'll tell you what I jump into so let's just look at what are they doing so okay implants bone screws pelvic fixation things what do you think those are the medical devices right I want I want solutions to be able to automatically read that and say this person doesn't say the word medical to anywhere on their LinkedIn profile but I want it to automatically say I see these words this person is designing medical devices so recruiters don't have to read this and say bone screws oh that must be a medical device this is a very good candidate that if you type in medical device this person doesn't come up you can't find them there in the dark matter world this is something I'm really excited about is searching for nouns and verbs I want semantic search solutions to move into the territory of going to true powerful sentence level semantics because hiring managers are looking for people that do things that have responsibilities not just bags of keywords with titles and here's the skills that I have so in this case I'm going to use I'm gonna call this a natural language query but you can perform this in some databases today I'm gonna do a boolean - English translation can you find me somebody who has implemented or configured si P sales and distribution module that's what I want that's my query I have to type it like this and then I get results like like like this that was on purpose right for dramatic effect if you read the sentences you can see that it works brilliantly it's finding people who says I have been responsible for configuring implementing si PSD it doesn't get more relevant than that that's what I need and I simply said well what do they do well they need to be configuring implementing or configuring implementing what well si PSD module so that's semantic search you can actually do manually today and I'd love to see more automation of noun verb combinations because that's finding people what they do not just words they mention on their CV and winding down here is natural language queries and I think we're gonna hear more about that today and I know that's something that external is working on I had the honor and privilege of having some pretty good access to Watson's analytics and if anybody's seen that you can use natural language queries so that's actually my account with some data and I typed in what is the relationship between profits and discounts and Watson immediately said well you know what most relevant is how do the values of profit and discount compare it immediately understood my natural language query and said what do you think about these other queries is what you which is a dialogue I was really sad to see this go does anybody remember Facebook Graph search you had to use English USA English but you could do that anywhere and you could literally type in German speakers who live near Amsterdam that are software engineers and you could say who speak French and you could just type in natural language query like that and even better I got excited because I'm a mobile phone I could just literally click the microphone and I could say that query and it understood what I was looking for and it found me German speaking software engineers that worked at Google and live near near places it understood those things so I'd like to see more of that in fact one of my dream scenarios if you guys are familiar with Ironman is I'd love to have a Jarvis type of heads-up display where I could just say find me Hadoop engineers that live near here that speak this language and are tinkering around with mahute whatever it is right so that's my dream but until we get there I think that we're moving into the realm of self-service business intelligence that people are familiar with that it's basically getting the average business user the ability to dive into things and instead of using a really poor interface and Excel is very powerful I don't know when Excel will ever go away if it'll ever die because it's very powerful but that's like you're straight boolean search interface if you're familiar with self-service business intelligence platforms like a tableau this is the future of how we're going to explore data and I'd like to see more interfaces and move in this direction when it comes to semantic search for exploring CV databases if you haven't played around with tableau you can download it for free it's fabulous and then last but certainly not least is this is a glimpse of what I believe the future will bring I took this karma sphere this diagram and I said here's how we could apply big data analytics and semantic search and what I think the future will be there will be a lot of automation and it will change some of the roles and I think that will have sorcerer's or sourcing recruiters that are wielding these systems and using the data and saying you know what we're going to build tools of people that hiring managers can dip into directly to do self-service because if you say if you were to tell your source or your data analyst you know put together a group people that fit these types of skills that work for these companies and that person will get the data and put it together and then recruiters and hiring managers can go right into that collection into that talent pool and start to leverage it and I honestly do believe and I hope this is part of the future where we go and it's all actually empowered by technology and of course data which continues to grow every day so that kind of wraps up my presentation a little glimpse of the future just I guess to the main takeaways is that right now semantic search I think is the two main impacts is the fact that it automates what really good sources do that most recruiters can't do and in fact I don't think we should be able to expect them to become search wizards but it really drastically increases their performance and that's a huge thing and that goes back to the fact that if you're still going to work in an environment where a company says I need you to work 20 30 45 open requisitions at a time you really do need technology that makes it simpler for you to quickly identify people who are ever going to be a good match most importantly in the deep end of the talent pool that inbound recruiting will never bring you and if you're going to say if your executives are gonna say Talent you're the number-one priority you can't only be fishing in the pool of inbound recruiting of the people who come to you is it's only the minority and as we all know some of the best people already employed somewhere else doing a good job and we have to have to have tools that enable people to go out and take the time to go find them to fish in the deep end there you go thank you very much ladies and gentlemen Kathy we have time for one or two questions is there anybody with an urgent question for Glen that he wants to ask him otherwise I have one I see bill bills where's bill no bill is gonna hit me earth one I'm keeping this quick question for you Glen and I've got believe that there's a talent tipping point that companies are reaching which is when they're connected with enough people that they have enough data in their wide network maybe their lead team followers all the rest of it together find everyone they want first of all do you believe that and secondly how do you actually source from the data that you have rather than external data well there kind of goes back to that last slide is I believe that you have the opportunity to to go out there and source and then create it whether you call it a talent community or a data Lake if you were to use a more technical term even within that you just basically you're putting fish in a particular area and then you fish within that area I think there are some companies that are already in that situation I know to some extent even our company is that way because that's the vision we're trying to do the reality is though you I think you always have to be worried about who you don't know because you never know everybody but here's the brilliant part about the data that you do have access to if you just have a thousand people of a particular type or multiple types having good access to those people allows you to access their network which goes back to the human element and to me the technology aspect is how can you get how can you quickly identify people who might not only be the right match but also have a high probability of knowing other people the right match so let our people get in touch with them develop a relationship and start networking and that takes a thousand people and that could turn it to 8,000 people that you may not even have a digital footprint for so that's another way of looking at the data is it's not just the data and the pool that you have it's the access that those people give you if it's leveraged properly just with the human element it actually makes it easier right so if I'm relocating some fish from the Pacific Ocean and I put them into this pond and becomes much easier to fish in that pond but even then it's still coming down to sorting intelligently who is the person is the highest ability being the right match for this particular position and not just being the right match but someone who regardless of their situation would say you know what that's something that would interest me because that's something people forget about just because the CV matches and their experience matches it doesn't mean they'd be interested in doing your job there's two big variables there are they qualified would they be interested and that's something you can't start to control with data but it makes it a lot easier if you've looked at the known universe of people and you've done your best job of collating them into one place and it makes your job a lot easier to fish in a pond than it is in the ocean as long as you have a process by which they're still going out to the ocean and making sure that your pond is well stocked okay well given the time are you available for questions later on in today absolutely so Glen is around for the shy people who don't want ask questions in a big room he's around to to ask him questions so a big hand again for Glen Kathy ladies and gentlemen
