 welcome to this introduction airy pool party product session before we start our first hands-on tutorials I will introduce you to some basic concepts you need to know when building a taxonomy with pool party pool parties based on the Scott standard we will see how this relates to other standards and the Semantic Web technology stack and then I will introduce you to the basic element of a taxonomy a concept we will see how different kind of labels relate to concepts and then we dive deeper into the anatomy of a scarce taxonomy and see how concepts top concepts and concept schemes build up to a knowledge madam we will also address which kind of relations we can use for developing the taxonomy yes and with this figure at acknowledge we are good to go in the following learning session you will use this knowledge to build a taxonomy with pool party and we will guide you step by step through this process pool party applies discuss standard a standard recommended by the w3c consortium Scott stands for simple knowledge organization system and is a simple ontology that allows all the beginners to start building Chris or I after a short training Scott is a widespread standard and is also compliant with the eyes of the service standard so they're learning pool party he also learns cross there are many organizations who are using Scott's and who provide taxonomies so for many knowledge domains you can reuse existing knowledge models and adapt it for your applications how discussed relate to the Semantic Web it is based on the RDF scheme as many other ontology x' as well when you model your data with pool party your data will be based on the RDF format because there's only one knowledge model you can use in pool party you can also model your data based on other industry ontology and standards which apply the RDF scheme for example fiber for the financial industry or schema.org or vCard and you can also model yeah owl ontology in pool party in model 3 you will also learn about the query language Sparky what I basically want to indicate here is that when you base your application on the Scots standard it is fully compliant with the whole Semantic Web when you structure your knowledge in a model as for example it has been done in this case with cocktails within pool party the system creates for every concept a URI so that it gets recognized in the applications that rely on this knowledge model and the data which is structure here is based on the IDS model this means a concept is described in the form of subject predicate abstract expressions which is also synonymously code tripping the semantics expressiveness relies on the data explicit e which is given through a URI and its mayor data enrichment apricot brandy is a triple as it is ask us concept the concept apricot brand is annotated with the metadata Scots concept by the system so every concept you create will be described by several triples in a database and when you start building relations this become additional triples here is an example apricot brandy is part of Brandy's what you have to keep in mind is that the query language sparker relies on RDF and your eyes through RDF and your eyes your data becomes machine readable and can be exchanged across applications mmm that use discuss standard your data represented in triples at a semantic layer that increases the preciseness of meaning and applications or scores you can build taxonomies but you can also progress towards more sophisticated knowledge models as schemes and ontology and when you have a knowledge model in place you can run very precise text mining and data analytics operations pool party covers all of these free domains and you will learn how to work with them in this eLearning now I want to introduce you to the main elements of a taxonomy in Moore death let's start with concepts I already mentioned concepts and I think you can intuitively grasp what it is you see here the concept Manhattan if it would be a term a word a label it would not implicitly state if this is the cocktail Manhattan or the city Manhattan but as a concept that is embedded in a broader context which the economy provides synonyms or somehow related terms to the concept which we call ins cross alt labels are all attached to the same concept ins cross which makes meaning very precise and as the foundational idea behind the Semantic Web but adding a multitude of terms to a concept also requires to decide for a preferred label in this case the concept Manhattan also corresponds with the preferred label Manhattan and although language tags correspond with the same concept in this case we added the Chinese equivalent for Manhattan in crocodile please get used to this terminology concept preferred flavor alternative label language tag as we we will use it continuously for this course when you take a look at the taxonomy about cocktails on from before you see here is cost - but for the concept Manhattan here you would define your preference and alternative flavors among others and when you take a look at the taxonomy tree you acknowledge instantly that Manhattan is included in a broader context first of all it is part of a project dedicated to the domain around cocktails and second it is part of the concept scheme cocktails and this taxonomy structures this domain even more precisely and introduces the structuring elements operatives and digestifs women had nothing to did in Scotts you can work with free hierarchy levels in pool party this loosely looks like that the first blue tab is the project which is called cocktail taxonomies San shots the purple tabs are the concepts teams you can think of them as categories so we have beverages cocktails garnishes and other ingredients glassware the dark green tabs a so-called top concept and these are structuring elements for the taxonomy it provides a further hierarchical structure but top concepts are by nature all the concepts so when you take a look at the concept scheme cocktails we have differentiated a couple of top concepts as a purgatives and digestifs duo cocktails IBA official cocktail and so on and below the top concept you have a list of concepts as Americana blue balls you can add as many teriyaki levels you need you can also add within concepts higher key levels as you see it here with pizza which pocket Silvana Tiano was related to spritzer in a narrower relation but usually working with concept schemes top concepts and concepts provides you with a map flexibility to build your knowledge model as you need it take a look at these two taxonomies about cocktails it is about the same domain but completely different in its knowledge modeling approach the project is called the same smoke octane taxonomy but the concept schemes have been differently chosen an option one we decided to differentiate alcoholic beverages and non alcoholic beverages at the concept scheme level an option two the taxonomy obviously suits a different purpose at the concept scheme level we differentiate cocktails and wine an option one we have included the top concept cocktails an option two we differentiate two top concepts alcoholic cocktails and non-alcoholic cocktails the small example demonstrates how much a conceptual approach can vary and is actually supported by the software you saw how to come text for a concept is given within a taxonomy through hierarchical structure but we started out with a concept as our focal point indeed what we described through concepts top concepts and concept schemes is actually a graph when splits events Yano is related to the concept spitzer which we describe and scuzz as a broader relation it is actually through this relation of korzos and a purgative and the chess stuff and we described this as a broader transitive and a broader relation works in the different direction as well she splits Veneziano is a narrower concept of spritzen and spitzer is a narrower concept of a purgative with pool-party you manage your knowledge graph in a hierarchical manner that gradually increases in complexity and keeping the graph structure in mind is essential for your knowledge modeling process so how does your thesaurus evolved through labels attributes and relations let's have a closer look at this cross - button pool party you see here this goes - but for a concept the cocktail margarita on the right side you see the labels and attributes and on the left side you see the relations you can manage broader and narrower relations follow a hierarchical structure and you can go beyond broader narrower relations which is basically the taxonomy tree through using related concept let's assume you want to indicate that margaritas served in a margarita glass margarita is part of the concept scheme cocktails and margarita glass is part of the concept scheme glassware by using related concepts you can relate concepts out of different concept schemes remember screws allows you to build economies in an easy way with custom schemes and ontology we create much more specific relations as we will need it for more sophisticated knowledge graphs and more expressive knowledge domains when you go to options you can extend this cost you to advanced and then you have even more relations and attributes for your disposal we will introduce more of this during the course but if you want to have a detailed view on how to use this cross taxonomy elements we recommend you this cost primer a document that describes the theory behind cost knowledge engineer now you know how discuss standard relates to the Semantic Web you know that you create data triples that are essential for the semantic expressivity and that you create single your eyes for your concepts you know that based on scores you can extend your knowledge model towards custom schemes and ontology and that this knowledge graphs are the basis for text mining analytics and we went into media stress and talked about this cross anatomy with its most important elements concepts top concepts and concept schemes you know that concepts can be related for broad and narrow relations as well as related concepts and you are aware that you can enrich your concept for labels and attributes where we spoke about the basics but there are advanced possibilities to extend the scarf you on a concept now you have everything you need to know to start building your first exon imme I wish you fun with my colleague in the first hands-on session she will guide you step by step from building I'm your first exon Amim you
