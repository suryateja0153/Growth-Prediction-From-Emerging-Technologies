 I ask you please help me welcome Thomas download I'm obviously very honored to talk today in front of such an expert audience I'm neither an open date the specialist nor an expert in matters of public administration just a simple business guy and and instead of presenting are there for yet another aspect of open data I'm showing you what we are diving belief is happening in the fascinating world of theta and I show that publicly available beta will certainly play has to play a key role in it let me start with the very first slide of our own strategy presentation to our investors we see here three major shifts which impact all industries they all happen in parallel and they all influence each other the first shift deals with transformational power of data and you wouldn't sit here if you wouldn't know that already the second shift deals with the way how this is being delivered every more flexible and dynamic which leads to none president that need for scalability of many of those new emerging business models shift number three then addresses the way how we engage with individuals giving them consistent experience across every interaction they do it's obvious achieve number two and number three are also driven and supported ultimately jada so cognitive computing is our new paradigm we see this as a new era it's not a single product IBM Watson you may have heard about this already is the poster child for this but cognitive is overall much bigger concept it's around learning versus programming solution conferring thinking like bility this is also about augmenting human intelligence as opposed to replacing it one question you may have is what the hell makes a cognitive system different than the types of systems that exist today or what makes a cognitive system than just simply advanced analytics optimal systems have been programmed this means their outcome is designed by the person and programmed it these systems by design a predetermined based on a rigid set of parameters defined for specific items these systems are of course will be considered deterministic cognitive system is different as it is not programmed it strained this means they learn and reason from their interactions with us from their experiences with their environment they do not give predetermined responses but are probabilistic this means they generate hypotheses reasoned arguments and recommendations because of this cognitive systems can make sense much of the instruction paper that exists in the world and they can to keep pace with the complexity down predictability of information in the modern world in this new era we need to look at to a system that has the ability to consume data from a breath of 1000 times this means relying on programmable systems for back office efforts but cognitive systems to engage humans differently creatively advance our combined inside through social and physical interaction let me show you an example from the mergers and acquisitions so they will now speak obviously very so now so just use your imagination they talk now through some hockey republics is it not working I found three companies similar to the loan you specified let's see what we think of this dive a little deeper let's compare these things sure Watson show me a decision table here's a decision table that will enable you to compare companies side by side wat simplistic companies named Wolfram Alpha and Kawasaki robotics and comics and Rayfield BBN technologies and decisive analytics in the decision table okay okay but I think we need a little more than that we need some other attributes Watson place the attribute standing revenue and employees and corporate structure in the decision table okay alright so now we've got this side-by-side comparison what do you think yep that's right Watson give me a suggestion I have a suggestion so the technology for this exists and while this is obviously has been built by Mark tears and the system similar type of system they're already building also in a project here in Switzerland Watson is actually already being used many different industries an early on education has been in the era of healthcare a simplified example here shows its key characteristics such as understanding natural language being able to go through large volumes of unstructured paper and generating hypotheses from there those are Penn that and the resulting confidence level state presented the system is built on a towel which allows to refine the results the system presents possible answers to the physician but then it takes decision the physician takes a decision this is fed back to Watson Lawrence from those decisions over time you can already see here those system drive and data large amounts from a variety of sources structured and unstructured and also probing over time Watson's first public appearance took place in 2011 to win the American quiz game jeopardy back then five capabilities are being used natural language understanding machine learning question analysis featured engineering and ontology analysis since then we've broken this one system up into number of all accessory services and we've added a large number of additional capabilities to the mix this large number of different services different cognitive services is the reason why we claim to be at this point the leader in cognitive technology the single API you can provide significant value to an application but often multiple api's are combined in an app for more powerful results for example speech to text and text to speech without the natural language classifier can be combined for an engagement pattern adding language translation to the same app to expand your user ratings for example we are expanding our tooling to help developers scrape applications with the api's more rapidly customization features are available some of the areas now some AP is are ready to apply without additional training others allow you to train Watson on your own I mentioned already that Watson consumes various sources of data and typical application uses data from the public domain but also very specific and also personal data domain specific information such as apologists or specific patterns are being introduced to from their system is trained with the subject matter experts the result belongs to the entity the firm which build the system if for example system for insurance underwriting explained this will be done with insurance experts of that company any other insurance firm has to train the system from scratch but we're using the basic structures and pathologies which are in the public domain but without a specific knowledge from the other firm so far you're very strict with this cincy content and over knowledge which may provide a competitive advantage from one firm to the other one can imagine though that over time a final line can be drawn between what type of subject matter expertise is in the open domain and what is specific to a company let me come to another example how we work with Nate them both public and proprietary I've been required about a year ago the weather company they deliver the information for a number of widely used weather application you see some examples here in the slide weather information is used of course many industries for example insurance farming repelling but also in public services we believe that the vet the use of this data predictive capabilities and combining it with company relevant information will be a source of value from any firms operating such a network of data on a global basis delivering data in real time is also critical capability in today's world to give you an idea about the scale and complexity many different data sources both prepared and public as an engine provide the data which is then processed in distribute at massive scale and near real-time globally about 26 million requests are handled every day besides the open data company's own data stations also private weather stations delivered their beta into the network this data and the analytics are made available NS services on the same platform we call it bluemix as the cognitive services which i mentioned earlier this allows persuade already moment a shin of drones services on the basis of whether they attack for most of today's cognitive solutions Melissa scopes data is being collected from numerous sources sinuses or other data points that can be structured or unstructured or something in between that data comes in large quantities possibly at the high speed the confidence is the sum of the data in Mary's in a subsequent step this data is then processed and turned into information this will include various types of analytics data cleansing and various models to create and derive only what seems to be relevant lastly this information is then fed into a cognitive system to create new insights which then turns information into something which could be called knowledge well the state before it can be done without much interest in domain expertise comes clear that this expertise plays critical now in this last step an interesting aspect which is still a topic of research is there and common sense knowledge this is the collection of facts and information that the northerly person is expected to know the goal would be to create common sense knowledge base database containing all the general knowledge that most people possess represented in a way that is available to artificial intelligence programs that use natural language or making inferences about the ordinary world such a databases type of ontology the Semantic Web semantic analysis related to natural language secy are relevant part of it standards and technologies such as rdf / Brielle ontologies and taxonomies a very relevant in cognitive computing discussion one may think of cognitive computing a structured data and decision alternation of structured data like standard business applications but allowed or most of the new applications of cognitive computing are completely unstructured sources and saints needs to be extracted from the content and met the semantic categories of one sort or another and managed to repositories for cognitive computing to jesus promised we need a thick metadata layer that incorporates semantic tagging formats the linked open data models can deliver very valuable intelligence that kind of need to be used for cognitive computing today some of those models can be done by groups or individuals or crowd-sourced this is in my point of view a very relevant aspect for the open date a community for the near future at IBM we are supporting open date and various different aspects it is to be honest Syl topic which is very much on the development and while the topic itself is developed me also our approach to it does so we don't have all the answers IBM is making those significant investment in a wide range and for example of cloud data services that build an open source database and analytic services we also provide the service which allows access into most of the source databases we provide openframeworks such as for example tool and platform for graph analytics based on training graph specific query language and we provide self service can I be blooming space platform tape to mark a place for easy access plan quality data sets that are ready to use again for incorporation into machine learning bonds analytics and other applications we also announced new and advanced IBM Watson application programming interfaces on the cloud to accelerate the emotional and image recognition capabilities of cognitive systems in addition to the services which are shown you already on an early flight this cognitive api's enable developers to tap into all sins emotional and visual senses further extending capabilities and if those technologies IBM and github also announces to teach a partnership to offer to get top enterprise service dedicated and local hybrid clouds ivan is also giving regularly called in to open source such as for example parks framework which is innovative copy in IOT infinite things development tool but also called for example for hyper lecture and old walk Jane initiative we are also membered the number of groups projects such as the state college in the US city forward number of local initiatives like Coke in mini up is public knowledge in transportation apprently though I don't know where this is primarily due to local initiative where this follows a bigger strategy non company probably in a bit of both I wonder if we and where we will also contribute finally to the development of semantic web and other areas such dimension commonly used economies ontology see linked open data to further support development of the cognitive aspects of a mention on the column under common sense for several decades now the information technology industry has relied on technologies and compute infrastructures at work designed and optimized for transaction processing advanced advancing by the trains captured moore's law that increased computation speed density of compute elements and also the speed of interconnects two major shifts point out to an opportunity to disrupt this trajectory over the next decade the first is a shift in work clothes from transaction transaction arranged it once to those that expect insights and understanding from us quantities of data while transactional and traditional transaction processing very close will probably continue to grow only modestly over the next decade the computing requirements of cognitive wear clothes are growing exponentially at the same time many of the technologies and architectures on which computers are built today are providing diminishing returns both in performance in economics they are becoming expensively to hell even littering right now let alone keep pace with exponential scaling that there are lots of the cognitive era neurons the state of the art to address these cognitive era requirements exemplified the machine learning graph analytics video analytics and other software clothes is to run them on the traditional systems and Dolph log certain portions of the workflow to specialized execution units for those he bronze standing all them under FPGAs and graphical processing units gpus and so forth but there are still built based on traditional architectures and devices however there is an opportunity to build an entire family of systems and data centers that are redesigned from the ground up to these for these cognitive error or clothes with the aim of providing orders of magnitude improved performance frame foundational to this roadmap is the revisiting many of these options on which the business systems design is based and tailoring the new system to be correctly consistent with the attributes these cognitive error codes instead of systems optimized for highly reliable operation and accurate and structured data to produce deterministic results the path forward envisions systems that are resilient capable of operating nosy and unstructured data and produce results in terms of probabilities examples of computational fabrics that represent this evolution include neuromorphic and quantum Systems an example of an emergent compute fabric is the synapse neuromorphic chip picture 22 visible you have on the on the left hand side this brain inspired chick enables sensory perception in mobile and Internet of Things applications by implementing low-power scalable architecture the most recent version of this is the IBM true north chip which contains of 1 million neurons and 256 synopsis implemented using 5.4 billion transistors and consuming only 73 belief world which is about 10,000 times less and conventional architecture would require as part of cognitive audit software ecosystem this technology creates new possibilities transformative applications and devices with sensory perception these include applications in robotics health care public safety environment environmental protection and many others on the right hand side is another example of an emerging compute fabric the quantum computer quantum computers promise exponential leaps in speed and power by exploiting the quantum superposition to represent multiple states simultaneously unless no question about quantum computing objects so of the advantages are obvious speed plan to process intensive workloads and power to scale out depending on the business need but the real different here is that these benefits compound quantum computing through strength with which is an entirely new way to tackle problems harnessing such capabilities would provide extra ordinary business advantages by accelerating innovation and solving problems that are unsolvable today in areas as diverse as firms because encryption and material discovery I try to show you that the fascinating world of data are still emerging availability of data but also what can be done with it is growing at massive speed new technologies new models new discoveries not so new applications paved away from massive opportunities the rules the do's and don'ts still have to be shaved but we don't want to hinder developments and the opportunities we have we have also to be mindful of the responsibilities which come with it I showed you what we are doing at I am of course we want to earn money from it but still with the aspiration to ultimately providing those solutions for a better planet thank you for your attention many nice indeed for this presentation so about quantum computing let's not do that and so we got plenty of questions from from Twitter and many going to the direction of how do you what open data do you contribute because I understand very well also the examples of how when Watson needs to win jeopardy it needs to ingest tons and tons and tons of data in order to build up body of knowledge but then again that's public data that has been put on the internet by by people and by governments and so on man but you you're at a scale where you also have so much data and where of course the first question that's going to come for the community what they taught you share back we are primarily and have to say that consumer of data and consumer and the gift that we may be providing that form of services again to our uses we are not interested in keeping that date just for ourselves because that's not our business model they are specifically not interested in keeping personal data which is also very quick which aims to be very clear that's not our business model be trying to work in partnerships or obviously and power with companies where we would deliver the primarily d analysis so however the exam all of the whether they are very talk about the combination ultimately what we want to do is provide analysis which goes to cognition to the discovery of patterns but it's it's it's not the idea and not our our our strategy to build our own data driven business models out of this an old it's fine line with this also we will not become a sec we r / also need to say we are the business-to-business company we will not go into consumer market than Hansel's again not being interested in those type of business models where we would ultimately provide data to the end consumer hmm so when Martha holiday at the beginning said that who owns the data best control of data is going to be more and more important in that age of intelligent machines you say yes that's true but from your point of view you're building the tools you take building the machinery and actually you don't want to be that kind of data owner and be part of those those those power places you work with anybody who has data to extract the best of it exactly now obviously there are borderline case is there you can say again way to think so so but that's it it's ultimately our clients will then owned date sure okay then you had one example where you talked about a data marketplace for data data scientists and for developers and so on so that's interesting because when we're talking about open data platforms we're talking about a platforms where stuff is made available and we're not talking about marketplaces so how does that work together what is the supply and demand function there neither does that mark at work that you have it I mean obviously we will not be able there to charge for data or for means I'm anali evil I think that you need to make let me go back one step I think there is a distinction between the services between the AAPI and what value do we contribute this part of providing an egg and service and depending on that we would obviously be able to charge money different commercial models existing and what we come to obviously we cannot just provide data which we get from the public domain through a marketplace cell this cell is forward and instantly evaluate our mean why would you access after market place so for us I think more important than what we want probably it is that platform with those services and some of the services even now even today some of the services come for free other services and we charge money for them and then obviously everything in between okay and so another thing I was wondering when when listening to your talk is that I mean you're a you're a huge corporation publicly traded and so on and usually in that context people tend to sing from quarter to quarter right because their financials that's how we measure it and that's how it goes and when you talk about open data in many cases it's about the long-term you want to build an ecosystem you want to build a sustainable community like like we're trying to do here and there seems to be there seems to be a conflict that that you are somehow managing rather well because we always see those long-term thing like you know what's another quantum computing and all that those are long investing how you guys did it I mean first of all I mean given that in the in the final two weeks of the quarter I just come here should show you that you can draw so how can I make the balance and no I think we still we still found our force of our research team quite generously and then we also see this as a major part of our future success that is certainly one aspect and obviously our bed we are making into cognitive computing our belief there is really something you were emerging here is certainly a core of our strategy hence I also the need to make investments there but then finally there is a lot of also short-term decisions and especially preparation also of the speech I tried to figure out what is now really our planet our long-term strategy in terms of open data and I need to tell you the lock is also from there the short term as part of a certain project of an idea working together with a city government and see what can be done so it's a bit of both so maybe as last question let's pull things back together when it comes to the relation between communities governments and the handbook technology does more data does right and so one of the topics that we were reactive is the idea of a smart city right and that context we always have the idea that ok for a smart city you do need there's kind of Internet of Things things and on the other hand you need some sort of open data in order to make sure that citizen actually can have a part and i would say can have a role analysis of what's going on in smart city so i know that's a huge topic for you guys so I think you even came up with the determinism all right so smart city and open data do you what's your agenda there I think I mean it's this is exactly one area where we will be absolutely stands for the need for all integra because without this something it's it nobody can really develop reasonable applications and reasonable approach is to deal with many different topics and if I say nobody then the same would be true for us and and hence yes if if I mean especially public public institution which are essentially founded taxpayers money I think this is a very essential and very critical and discussion with which helps us what helps everyone else who wants to participate and services in that ecosystem so that's why my but if you ask me do is for an open data in that space yes how cool would that be if I would say no it's okay sure okay and I think it comes back to common sense which you haven't you're very title that for open data them becoming a topic that is not something that we hack your types like talk about and always we want to have all that data to build funny things that are half days but it really becomes a be a common sense concept for governments but also for for corporations like IBM I for me that is it that's a great development to see that somebody like you comes here not with a title open data the future ? below the data it's common sense I think as part of a reliable and highly developed data infrastructure and open they die certainly a key element in in test as there are many other topics and questions and what I also try to show I think we are it is still it will twist around around theta we start to see possibilities and what emerges here and a prank I myself I still marvel at what what we see is coming up here and that deliberately include the last kind of lost i'm talking about technology to show you this is only beginning now in order to really grow and in order to really be able to develop on those things and needs to be certain things which are relying on certain things you can can build upon and hence yes but don't think that there will be many people out there who would question the value of the needs or open data ultimately questions always go out and that's obviously better discussions really starved of course and i think that is a question that we can continue to discuss at the our pillow so in that sense i would say many things in the thomas for your share of common sense thank you very much
