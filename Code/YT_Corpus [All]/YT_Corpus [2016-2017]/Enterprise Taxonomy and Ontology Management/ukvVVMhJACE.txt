 hello everybody and thank you very much for coming I hope you had a great lunch I'm it inaudible hour and I'm research at european institute for systems biology in lyon france and today on behalf of our force whose names already here i will try to introduce the way we use now for j approaches for data management in systems biology and medicine so first of all the european institute for systems biology and medicine in france aims to speed up a transfer of results obtained through systems biology approaches to industry and to routine pay our patients by studying life complexity through transdisciplinary approaches and other is BM but team is composed of biologists contagion biologists physicians mathematicians and engineers and we were together on different long-term joins project also at 8pm we work on systems before machine which means participatory predictive personalized and preventive and we work we have partners from both academia and Industry domains and we work together on a european project in order to boost bust global public ross health the website of aids vm is this one so www is bein da twerk sum of a recent project at ACM or include a custom project called Cosima Europe which is coordinating actions systems magazine sis club Claude or metal or you by oak red which is unbiased biomarkers own introduction of respiratory disease outcomes and II tricks for European translation information and knowledge management system services the project i'm currently working on first of all will translate about translational medicine recently there was the perspective paper in the a New England Journal of Medicine about an initiative of 215 millions of dollars spent for involving a voluntary cohort of 1 million people and connect and collecting multi omics data in UK but genomics England or have had started already a project which refers to collect multimix data from and to sequence 1100 genomes or with a focus on cancer and rare diseases these initiatives basically are motivated by the need for by the requirement of developing a new tax on taxonomy of diseases and basically diseases are different diseases are seen as a collection of single control conditions while actually they represent a group of diseases of subtype diseases and the new taxonomy proposes looking to disease from molecular features and not based on the clinical symptoms a new taxonomy is available it's possible due to the a cheaper collection of muji omics data and basically this new taxonomy will move medicine from a reactive to proactive perspective and the focus will be to identify the transition between wellness and disease while it's very important to have translation rights in informatics there also some some challenges we have to be aware of the first of all this integration of for mutti mutti omics data or multi types which could help four subtypes disease subtypes discovery so basically we are of hundreds of subtypes of asthma for example then it's moving from understanding molecular patterns basically to the disease mekinese make is so we want Explorer or sub ties and guides therapeutic intervention and treatment or pathways which will basically aim to to give a more individualized or health care or pathways and finally you know challenge for Translational Medicine informatics is to develop a platform to be able to facilitate storage meaning you're mining analyzes visualization exploration of a large patient data set so what we can say now these days is kind of like the sequencing of a genome is quite affordable however but data analysis and interpretation is very expensive so error is develop of platform for Translational Medicine informatics we need to have a data warehouse where to store and to query or clinical and molecular data and then we have to provide a framework or ecosystem for data analytics we're in translation medicine is defined basically to to come closer to the clinicians so we are computation apologies or rare apologies but we want to talk to clinicians and then data analytics which could go which could give us more insights on the disease to type discovery and a component a major component of translational in informatics consists of know developing a knowledge base and which could give more information on work the disease context and also to make Association like hidden association between different concepts I was mentioning each weeks and it works is a large collaborative European project where severe is a collaboration between research accademia and also pharma companies we can see a satanic advisers and off a by erosion bothers one website is Imperial center is in France with us EIS p.m. Silicon Valley's so I was saying we have large so we are in big data air ages let's say war era however we tility of bio data set is practically given by the appropriate methods to investigate this data or to explore you to basically to give a relative of a 20 to the data and make a main components of a atrix is consist of having a repository for created data sets and also an ecosystem for data analytics which focuses on disease and target identification another major component is that each expense attention to ethical and legal issues related to patient involvement so on the left side we can see the etrex architecture I was speaking about speaking about a framework of framework which is we are using trans Mart and this study centric so basically we have clinical and multi omics data when is vehicle system and it's open access for data analytics with different tools and then Vistula home these tools communicate with a knowledge-based representation and come back and so on with coming from external resources so the question was if we can use here now for Jay will grab data based approach to represent information in the biosynthetic data or knowledge database which would give us information about which biological context of a diseases and also facilitates a hypothesis generation advantages of graph databases have been disgusted or doing these days but just to mention briefly so why we use gravity basis approaches for biomedical data we know that our biomedical data are highly connected so if we imagine like proteins having thousands of protein interactions or sequence similarities among other proteins or involvement in different pathways are in predicting nuclear unpredictable so it's basically we are now working with multi onyx data but who knows in two years or even next month what what type of data we can we can collect and we also need to infer associations between different concepts so to move a little bit further over towards disease mechanisms this is a slide that gives an overview of how we arranged and we use we're basically developed ecosystem i would say for systems biology and medicine so we follow a multiscale approach starting with welcome two metabolites proteins epigenetics and i'll describe immediately up to two disease context pathways until all patient information we integrate data from major international resources like cracked on human protein at last drop bank and others and the knowledge representation base is for this we are using on l4j and cipher queries when I i'm referring to data management i'm referring not only to data integration it's also about the exploration it's also about data visualization so either we use so we use now for Jane combination with Java we are with net or eggs and we also have possibility to share networks or using index which is a platform for network community sharing and we work with both standards for biology and clean so biological and clinical standard says BML NC disk for now so now I'm starting a first component of our framework let's say so it so we call it a protein framework which is a protein centric framework so what are represented by by circles are different concepts so we have basically this protein which is a biomarker for this disease or this protein is belongs to this pathway where is the drug or drug target or has the protein-protein interaction with another protein or health sequence similarities so this is an example of how we use for protein framework for contextual information so basically we wanted to query and pull to explore which are with drugs associated with proteins that have Queen similarity with asthma biomarkers and here are very different resources integrated saw repositories so it's data from drug bank for example and from disease gene and so on so what is represented with here is the node represents asthma and this protein from here is a biomarker reported as a biomarker for asthma this protein from here has a sequence similarity with another protein which is a drug target for these drugs let's say so someone now can in fair of course so it's not saying we feel so we are saying with a level of certain predictability let's say so I don't say but one hundred percent both those drugs will target asthma it's inferring so it's hypothesis generation however the cyber query here is very declarative so people can understand it where is a small what type of relationships I'm looking for and what concepts are basically involved further we we look we use the protein framework for link discovery and I I'll read here out loud for from march two thousand thirteen so many of the most recent jewish studies have identified logie associated with asthma containing genes that have ever known no known function or no known function that is easily correlated with disease phenotype so we spoke with our colleagues with clinicians that are experts in respiratory diseases and some of them were interested to see the relationships associations between clock genes which control with circadian rate and asthma so again if we are looking here is asthma with biomarkers or highly well replicated proteins and this helped a protein-protein us association with clock gene neighbors within this way so now if we can do more if we want we can infer more more information so only looking like 22 protein-protein interaction and to asthma related proteins and another case so I was saying that graph database accommodates well new types of of data so basically we have developed relative of protein framework when we serve Cornish 2013 paper we which contains information on cell specific interactions so what we did we added that information to a broad database so for example here I have a generic PPI in protein-protein interaction while here for example i had more information taken from this paper about what is the protein-protein interaction in a specific cell inaudible epithelial or a macrophage Orion Bauer's now just technical details so i am using java to develop to import and to integrate data in alpha j framework and just quickly about light we have 20,000 nodes of proteins and relationships similarity the sequence similarity proteins are like 92,000 and so on it works really well from from what we need I'll go to the second component and as I was saying so now we have we had already of a protein in centric framework now we move to you to go metabolic metabolic framework and we integrated information from reckon eggs which is the most comprehensive human metabolism reconstruction or published by TL in 2013 nature biotechnology and basically we took this information so it's the human metabolism construction which is available in flat files in stored in SB ml standard format it in an XML format file however is difficult to expo if someone with instances for example to identify sub networks around a specific metabolites like here we some of our colleagues were interested about our katonic acid which is again involved in respiratory diseases and we model in this way so arcade nanak is is a metabolite and consumption of a metabolic reaction and then is a production and so on this is a small example like limited to 40 nodes of course we had we have 9700 species which means proteins and metabolites seven more than different thousand metabolic reactions and so on so basically we had a information in HTML we imported in on l4j and some of our colleagues were very happy and because they were happy they wanted to share among the community and to use it and to share with colleagues to share at conferences and so on and for example sell designer is a well-established frame working for biology community so what i did i developed a parts are java-based parser to take with jason out output from now for jay translated back to SB ml and from SB ml to it is easily to be imported in sell designer and display the best way so basically the network you assume networking so it previously is now in this represented in this way and some of our colleagues clinicians and biologists were happier i would say and about sharing so we are using index from here while for ndex accepts for example see format so it's another parcel where it's another component of the same parser which translates to see format and ventura and extend to cytoscape which again is well established in systems biology i was saying at the beginning that we also include data on epigenetics and first of all so i'll move to a third component of our work and first of all for i know i imagine that many of people of you already know what is the epigenetics but just briefly mention the epigenetics can be defined as alteration in chromatin structure but effect by gene expression but not the DNA sequence so it's basically DNA methylation histone modification and non-coding rnas we took we knew about 30 p general database which lose the conditional probabilities between or genetic and epigenetic interdependencies in bayesian network format so it's basically saying but ABC hypermethylated given emulate one or methylated is a problem with the 0.89 for example where I could look here sir in carcinoma stage of a colon cancer so this is it's not causality is conditionality so we wanted to model and to to see what we can do more kind of like to infer in future computational modeling so yes this is a small sub Network showing for example as well as I saying like mlh1 hypermethylated is I've given this one very easy probably to have a clear as mutation the type of age or gives information and uncle genesis stage while the probability value is an attribute over edge and epigenetic framework can be used to identify highly connected the molecular events so for example we know that our mlh1 cages a pcr key genes in cancer development in colon cancer development but what about our our genes and we also can do exploration of a most plausible or pathway connected to two major events so for example if we look to mlh1 hypermethylation and ncc hypermethylation is either in this way or can be also in this way as i'm saying this is conditionality so it's bathing can bathe in formula can be switched it's not causality we want extend this this framework we with data on causality if if such data becomes available so some such a representation can can inform forever probability competition modeling so network-based bayesian network based let's say approaches and now i'll need to for component of our work which basically aims to apply a graph database approach to clinical to represent clinical data in clean standard format and in order to facilitate visualization but also exploration of clinical and biomarker data and we are looking for therapeutic area of asthma and forgive is such a component will be used to generate hypotheses for development of analyzes data models so other model who is familiar with see disco approaches there is the big challenges let's say here because clinical data are represented by many or large set of parameters and this gives this makes the model graph model to be not trivial let's say in this way however we use an integrative approach so we started with different with several domains and we plan to include more domains like demographic laboratory medical history and so on parts of this presentation is given basically these days you know cities European interchange borrow colleagues Regina and Paul in Vienna and this is just a small biz visualization of a laboratory tests let's say in this way so you can see here 10 labels are CD's for turns so for example e AE cut refers to adverse event category but is ver SI discs learn and we prefer to keep it in this way in order to be in compliance with see this call the presentation while for relationships we had to define so for example this is a patient which participating in a study and then with patient has some different demographic data or this patient has screening where in the screening they they take some samples analyzed it they return with with results for both analyzes with the data and so on so yes for for patients for example we keep information about aging and bother or other characteristics which goes for rotation so yes in conclusion today I was presenting multiscale approach for using graph database in systems biology and medicine and i started with translation medicine and I I will go so we phrase from be back in two thousand twelve which explains that the goal of translational medicine with respect to the worse amies data is to allow a scientist a clinician with limited computational skills to connect multiple layers of patient specific information to arrive to a more informed prognosis so I was saying from epigenetics from metabolites up to the patient level and we use when l4j basic integration and we use cipher which we found expressive as I said extends and extensible and I was speaking about adding new data types visual visual has also visual nice visual data exploration however developing would graph database is not trivial and basically it's not trivial also because of connecting different layers of of information about between among systems volatility and another challenge is to make these tools more accessible for for clinicians and for biomedical scientists I'll take one couple of seconds to introduce a special interest group meeting in translation as in informatics which will be held in in orlando in during why I asain be 2016 and if you are interested you can access the you realize where you can also write to us an email we are looking for your applications would say I would like to thank my colleagues from from 8pm our colleagues from central de calcul in young ron and chris for their help and also to acknowledge access you now / j & databases that we use to intergate so it's busy gene drug bank human protein applause Rican eggs started genuinely pro tidy and powers and finally I have to acknowledge and I would like to acknowledge financial support to each fix our project and thank you all for your attention and if you have questions I'd be happy to answer
