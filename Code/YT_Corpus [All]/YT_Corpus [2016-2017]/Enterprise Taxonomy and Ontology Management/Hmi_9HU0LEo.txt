 you you welcome to the workshop where I can have over the next few days good good to see lots of old friends and hopefully we'll make some new ones one of the things that i want to emphasize for this workshop we have some big questions lots of questions lots of big questions lots of deep questions and so in addition to the various formal presentations that will have over the next couple days we have lots of time for discussion during the sessions and also between the sessions so i hope we'll take advantage of that so for instance this evening there is a reception 430 26 should be lots of nice food and drink for that and also tomorrow a poster session in the afternoon that also doubles as a reception and a poster blitz starting at four forty the poster blitz being the opportunity for each of the post presenters to talk about their poster for what did we tell you a minute minute and a half something like this but basically get up and to say hey this is my poster it's awesome come see it those are always fun so please show up for that on Sunday there are breakout sessions where will be assigning you questions to discuss and then you'll report back in a plenary session will say more about that when we get to it on Sunday but notice on your badge you have a colored dot that sorts you into breakout session rooms right so there'll be a whatever a blue room a yellow room in a something else room good so that's what I want to say just in terms of introduction for the events over the next couple of days introductions of me i'm mike anderson i'm at least partially responsible for this event for better for worse also assisted by tim bane we want to wave Tim Jackie Sullivan over here and then various students Daniel booth where is Daniel say hi if I met some of the mental reception I guess Tracy de Bourgh is over here Jacqueline lengthy a here and Mary Stephenson and then staff Deborah Fox is she here ok and Rob I didn't see Rob here and Carol Souter is but okay well so yeah those are work anyway those are the folks where the folks that if you have any issues or questions come grab one of us and we'll do what we can to help out okay on to more substantive things one of the first things that I want to say about this notion of rethinking the taxonomy of psychology is that it's not whether we should do it or whether we are doing it but why we should be doing it we should think about why we're doing it what the purpose of doing it is and how we should do it because every time for instance we went from revising the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in psychiatry that was an exercise in rethinking the taxonomy of psychology and rethinking the way that we we categorize mental disorders mental disease and normal functioning and it's gotten sort of more interesting lately oh if that's controversial enough right you probably are aware it's gotten more interesting lately because now with the dsm-5 we've got that versus something called our doc this is the initiative of the US National Institute of Mental Health they don't like DSM for various reasons and so they are proposing their own different way of thinking about mental function mentals and mental disorder one of the distinctive features of our doc and I'll say more about this and I thought I know we're going to hear a lot more about this over the next few days is that it's explicitly meant to be integrative at multiple scales right so genetic neural behavioral right social which is not the case with DSM for instance right and so there are issues then that arise in thinking about what kind of taxonomy are going to get you know framework like our dock which is explicitly I mean it's fairly actually fairly neuro centric even though they deny that well again we'll hear more about that over the next few days and it's different from the kind of thing you get in a DSM style formalism and of course what happens in psychiatry or clinical psychology also happens of course in experimental psychology it's been happening over the past 100 or more years as we've gone through various kinds of thinking about what the mind is how to understand behavior each of those changes was accompanied by or had as part of it a change in the taxonomy of psychology the underlying vocabulary or set of concepts we use to understand mind brain and behavior this is one of my favorite exercises in ridicule this comes from Russ pulled rack you'll he's coming tomorrow you'll you'll hear more about this kind of thing from him I believe but what he eats did what he said hey look what if I fmri what were invented in the time of phrenology and what if we put people in the scanner and asked them within experimental settings that use the concepts of phrenology he says guess what we would see differential function because that's what the brain does it responds differentially to no matter what you do to it so he says look look we have impulse to propagation or tenderness for the offspring of parental love friendly attachment or fidelity valor in self-defense and then because Russ is this way he actually Maps those on to actual fMRI experiments no doubt pissing off their authors but I think making a very interesting and potentially even deep point which is really how different is activation for judgment self versus others from the category of ambition or vanity that we get out of the front illogical literature and if they are different on what basis can we say they're different it's also clearly a fairly corrosive thought right do we really know what the underlying basis for our psychological distinctions is have we hit on the right set of those categories and wouldn't it be kind of miraculous if we had and so in that kind of context the question is so where do we go from there and I hope we'll hear some good answers to that question over the next few days there's also something very important that I think has happened is happening right now over the last decade or maybe slightly more it's something at the Rotman acidic we start we've taken to calling the brain boom and by then pause to point out for those of you who are local this is one but there were going to be several events over the next year on this theme sponsored by the rotman institute of philosophy so keep an eye out for that so the brain boom being basically the notion that neuroscience has not only gotten a lot more attention has made a lot of progress but has now started to affect the lives of our lives in many many many many different ways and in many many many different venues right so we have not just cognitive neuroscience but we've got neuro philosophy we've got neuro economics we've got people wondering if you can use fMRI for lie detectors you can't don't worry we've got people wandering about in general though the use of fMRI and other neuroimaging techniques in the courtroom we've got obviously also as I already mentioned neuroscience really making a push to change psychology in various ways so this is the criteria for inclusion as a category of mental disorder in the rdoc classification right evidence for a functional behavioral psychological construct evidence for a neural system or circuit that plays a major role in implementing that function and a putative relationship is some clinically significant problem or symptom so if you don't have a brain mapping for your category it doesn't count and you can't get funding for it that's a big stick to be using to push the tax automated psychology around right there are enough huge number of questions that arise as a result of that not just scientific but also social and again that's in clinical psychology but there's also been kind of a neuro centric turn in experimental psychology and I think a very interesting run because generally up till now octo recently we think we've thought of psychological experiments as a way to get a window onto the brain right to understand brain function but recently we've flipped that and now we're using of the brain as a window onto our psychological constructs it's a very interesting new development that deserves some attention and reflection I want to give you just one example this is a study from a few years ago by Leonardo wicks and others needed a meta-analysis of hundreds of neuroimaging experiment purporting to investigate the components of cognitive control so that's things like working memory response selection response inhibition task switching etc etc right so what are all the sub functions that go under the heading of cognitive control and they said is there a neural signature for each of these things they did that by performing a so-called discriminability analysis the details of which don't really matter but the idea was in each of these conditions let's look at the patterns of brain activation that we can that we observe and we'll see if they're actually different from one another here's again the details don't much matter here but here's roughly speaking what that looks like so each of these things is a pattern of brain activation under these various constructs right so that's working memory task switching response selection response inhibition cognitive control in general and then bilingualism just as a control condition on the bottom there and these numbers represent the ability to tell the difference between each of these constructs based on the pattern of brain activity the one you'll think you'll want you to pay attention to are the two under TS you see a point for nine and a point for seven other words you're at 50-50 discriminating a task switching from response selection response inhibition right so you can't tell there is not a brain signature according to this analysis there's not a brain signature for task switching so there's so they asked provocatively and increasingly is there such a thing as task switching now that we don't switch tasks right clearly we switch tasks but there's no psychological no there's no underlying psychological sameness between all the different instances of us switching tasks or at least that's one way to understand what it is that they show when you see that you can't tell the difference between the brain patterns observed under these various conditions right so here again this this is a cognitive psychology as many people will be aware which has its roots in the so called cognitive revolution driven by computational theories in the in the 50s cognitive psychology was born to explicitly be independent from neuroscience it was intended to be an autonomous science with its own methods and own grounding this is clearly a pretty significant encroachment on that autonomy and again the question is is that a good thing should we keep doing that is go is this likely to likely to lead to actual scientific progress and there's probably many more many more questions besides there are even more radical possibilities i'm not going to show you those because i think we're going to hear about them over the next few days but in it me just say in addition to doing things like saying hey is there a neural reality underneath our various constructs it's possible using these techniques to also come up with new constructs and we have to ask again what utility that's going to be and so on we can talk lots more about that as we get as we see more of the presentations one example of this we're going to hear about in you know about a half an hour from Kristen lindquist and others who are indeed thinking in their case about emotion and how to use the brain to re understand the nature of emotion all right which I I like this because emotion seems like such a phenomenological thing you better be getting at it phenomenologically right motions are feelings after all but here they're saying no actually you're mistaken about that and the brain can do a much better job sorting these things out then you can and they they position themselves I hope I'm not you're not going to be showing the same stuff good that they position themselves as part of an evolution in psychology and in the relationship between psychology and neuroscience where you have these nice neat one-to-one mappings between psychological constructs and parts of the brain where you have dead if simple dedication of parts of the brain two very distinct psychological constructs and they say instead we want to do something a lot way more complicated than that right where we have various networks of the brain again we're going to hear quite a bit about that from Randy Macintosh in a little bit and those networks the brain have particular functions but those various kinds of functions get used and reused across multiple different kinds of behaviors and the suggestion is that means we will have to understand differently than we do now the nature of those behaviors so the point of this very very brief and simple introduction is to make the point that there are many interesting developments but especially many many many open questions right what is the status of our current psychological concepts how confident should we be in them right under what circumstances can we be confident and sub question under there is our categories or faculties even appropriate in psychology right should we be making categorical distinctions between things or should we think about things I don't know in a different way along psychological dimensions for instance if we do come up over the next decades with a new set of concepts a new set of psychological primitives what should they look like right how phenomenologically based should they be how semantically interpreta bellini to be I mean we can do maybe dynamic modeling is a better way to understand this even though the inners of the dynamic model wouldn't necessarily be semantically interpretive all but they might still be really useful for doing things like predicting behavior it might be really useful for doing things like designing work spaces that are effective even if we didn't really understand how the dynamical model mapped on to a phenomenology how different will or could any new concept to come up with be from current notions or sort of that is in other words how trap do we think we are right in our current way of thinking and how far away from that could we possibly get is there going to be on unified set or will there be multiple overlapping or even incompatible sets that are useful in various circumstances what would the criteria for inclusion in any taxonomy be how it how could it be evaluated what would be a good verte one versus a less good one well one of the things that I really like about working at the intersection of neuroscience and psychology and philosophy at this juncture in history is that everything is up in the air which is either awesome or terrible depending on how you write to hang on your your attitude towards it i think it's awesome i think it's a very exciting time to be working in this area and this is only one of the ways of understanding the kind of potential that we have for for moving forward and reshaping the sciences of the mind in light of findings and neuroscience in light of new techniques in computer science in light of better ways of understanding and measuring behavior and more besides more questions if we come up with some new set of primitives what's going to be the mapping the nature of the mapping between those primitives in the brain there's going to be one to one there's always going to be many to many do we want one or over the other is one better what again is the proper relationship between neuroscience and psychology should they be autonomous right do they have their own spheres with in science and right so that they wouldn't necessarily need to be incompatible but maybe they also shouldn't necessarily be put to be as it we're pushing one another around and finally for just this set of questions what's the likely effect of all this on folk psychology right on our self understanding one example one simple example that I I like to use this comes out of work from my own lab in we tend to think of humor as an emotional experience and in fact in the brain mapp taxonomy which is a big repository of neuroimaging experiments categorized in various ways in the in that repository humor is indeed a subcategory of emotion however when you do one of those analyses discriminability analyses on the activations that you can find a meta-analysis of activations and patterns of brain activity you can find in beta databases like brain map what you find is that the patterns of brain activity during a motion task during them during humor tasks look virtually nothing like the other ones and the rest of the emotional categories and they look a lot more like this patterned you see under semantics and this is true even though the stimuli aren't just jokes which would make sense right that's clearly semantic involvement but even things like funny cat videos right so yes humor is an emotional experience I guess but according to the brain it's a lot more like language and should that lead us to question our own categorization of humor as an emotional process I don't know the answer to that question but I think it's an interesting question to be asking and you can sort of repeat that question for other kinds of folks psychological categories and as I think we're going to hear a little bit about in Kristen linguists talk for things that are phenomena gical II as it were very close to us like a motion and all think I want to point out is in I don't know everybody in this room but I know a number of people in this room we have we are bringing to this question over next few days many different perspectives and that's really important and I want us to be aware of that and I want us to take advantage of that so that we have philosophers psychologists psychiatrists neuroscientist sociologists historians and others in this room we all know a lot of things and we are not a lot of different things and I'm really very much looking forward to learning from you all and I hope that you all are looking forward to learning from one another as I say this has been a brief introduction I've written some stuff on this topic if you're interested in my more detailed perspectives here are two two possible places to look a book that I had come out of about a year and a half ago and then art of recent article in philosophy compass about this very issue called mining the brain for a new taxonomy of the mind so if interested please look those things up and that's pretty much all i have to say we have christian lindquist coming up at eleven o'clock so if you have any questions right now i'm happy to entertain them otherwise you can get a top up on your coffee have a chat and come back here in about 20 minutes you
