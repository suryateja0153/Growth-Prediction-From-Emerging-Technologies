 I alright excited to the introduction and also for organizing this event it's really cool event it's a pleasure to be here and an honor to give the first talk today my talk is going to be a whirlwind tour of memories of technology past and present I'll try to give a wide general overview well also diving deep into some details especially the specific stuff that I'm working on here's the agenda today first I'm going to talk about Who am I a lot of you don't know me yet who is Nome the company that I that i co-founded and I'm the CTO of then I'll start off with a memristor what it is explain it go into members to history talk about our memory stirs that that we have followed by members remodels memristor applications general member steph computing and finally to end it with a call to action okay so the first section is going to be about me and about know who we are okay so this is me i'm the co-founder and CTO at no Hank I grew up in Wisconsin I know a lot of Europeans don't know where that is but so it's circled there that's Wisconsin have I jewel majored in physics and electrical engineering and i went up to to the University of Washington in Seattle for a masters of electrical engineering while I was studying at the university I studied abroad once in Hong Kong and once in Norway and in Norway and met my then future wife who's German she was also studying abroad there and to make a long story short I now live in germany since 2008 because of those reasons so as CTO my main responsibility is that is mostly technical texture so what that means is I make sure all the pieces hardware and software work together on a normal day I'm writing code and technical documents and making sure progress is being made across the team we're based out of Santa Fe New Mexico and the company was founded in mid-2015 s only about six months ago although over a decade of work has already been put into this and our main purpose is to commercialize neuro members of chips here's the rest of the team the CEO is Alex Nugent out of Santa Fe he came up with a theory that all this is based on Hilary rates is an early angel investor is also co-founder and she's also the chief administrative officer in the lower lap there is Sam barakat he's the most recent angel investor and the co-founder as well in the upper left there is Chris Campbell many of you may know her she's at Boise State University and she's our members guru guru and on the right there is Jerusha at Rochester Institute of Technology and she helped us validate our circuit designs and simulations with spice and she's also helping us support our chip emulators over to fpga and GPU platforms as well as adept Eva epiphanies okay here's the timeline over the last decade or so back in 2002 while Alex was studying physics as an undergraduate he decided one day when he was he got inspired in one of his physics classes that he wanted to build a brain on a chip he got really passionate about this and thought about it and had some really good ideas and before he went further like he decided you know what let me start an IP company I start patenting these ideas because I think this is going to be a very bright exciting field soon so in 2002 we started at IP company fast forward a few years he patented a lot of stuff and in 2008 he was a co advisor to the DARPA synapse program it's a little known fact what the program was based on a lot of his ideas that he presented in Washington DC in 2007 the US government load decided they didn't want to fund just some random person so they started the program and funded bigger companies like IBM and hlr and HP so what finally in 2012 Alex got the funding from the US government that he that he always wanted in the form of SBIR and STTR funding and that's when I came on i was able to work at home and i'm still doing that based on this funding and later subsequent angel funding into gnome in 2013 Alex and I together define katie ram which is short for thermo dynamic ram which is the name of our neural members do artificial intelligence until intelligence chip in 2014 we've published a paper in the public library of science open access journal which outlined what haha computer it's the theory it's over 40 pages there's also accompanying open source code which people can run to validate all the benchmarks and like I said in 2015 we created known to commercialize neural memory sir chips okay so this is the current status of Nome right now we're selling memristors and we also are offering a CMOS plus memristor back end of line service we're currently forming academic and commercial partnerships we're seeking angel investment and we're going to do a crowdfunding thing soon and we also are starting very soon what we call the gnome developer community where application developers can contribute code they can create applications or cook or contribute to our lower level gnome API and in the future when we sell these applications profits will come back to the developers based on their amount of contribution the final piece of the puzzle and the one we're working on now is to replace the emulated katie ram with real kitchen made out of memory stirs okay so what is a memristor well to start off this members or workshop I thought it'd be good to cover and make sure everyone in this room knows autumn and mr. is people know most of you probably already do there could be a few people who are here today based on curiosity but before I get into what a memristor is let's take a step back and define what a resistor is resistor is a passive to terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element resistors act to reduce current flow common analogy for Ohm's law which is shown below with conductance voltage and current is the water pipe analogy so on the Left we have water pipe water tower with a with a certain type if you let it drain say it will take three hours it has a certain conductance if you do experiment over giving a water tower on the right with a pipe that's three times as big we say the conductance is three times bigger which means the current is three times bigger and the water will drain in one-third the time compared to the left this is the basic idea behind Ohm's law the current is proportional to the conductance like I said the more conductance a resistor has the higher the current flow will be just like in the case of water and water pipes a memristor is a resistor that has variable conductance the memory stirs electrical resistance is not constant what depends on the history of current that has previously flowed through the device what that's saying is that the conductance of a memorizer changes as current flows through it so if you apply a voltage in one direction the current will or the conductance will say increase and if you flip the voltage and apply it in the other direction the conductance will decrease pinched hysteresis the main defining signature of a memristor is a pinched hysteresis response in current when driven by a sinusoidal voltage hysteresis is typically typically noticed in systems and devices that possess certain inertia causing the valley of a physical property to lake behind changes in the mechanism causing it manifesting memory the physical properties mentioned is what mainly distinguishes different members der types from one another and also notice the lobes on the pinched hysteresis response and as the theoretical discoverer of the memristor dr. Leon chua said if it's if it's pinched it's a memristor if you see this in the response to an AC signal it's most likely a memristor on the left is the original master simble introduced by chua and on the right is a symbol we use internally at Nome both are fine but we think we're drawing large circuits the one on the left is quite difficult to draw Ashley and this one's really quick you can draw much faster circuits so feel free to use it you guys want so that was very brief quick intro to what a memristor is I left out a lot of details but more or less covered the basics in the next part of my talk I want to give a very quick overview of members to history including the president and a glimpse into the future ok so memory stirs have been around for millions of years already in the last few years people have been taking a look at memristors found in nature besides slime mold pictured here members Dib hysteresis has also been found in human skin and human blood I'm sure a lot more discoveries will be made in early 2015 Dr Chua and co-authors reported on their findings after searching through scientific literature archives to see if they could find the earliest report of a man-made memory what they were looking for was the tell-tale sign of the memristor that hysteresis loop after looking the town a carbon arc lamp from 1801 that exhibited this behavior the relevant part of the abstract says the carbon arc discharge exhibits the three fingerprints of investors including the pinch hysteresis loops the low area changing with operating frequency and such lobe area approaching zero as the operating frequency increases in 1970 during a Lee published a paper describing what he thought were interesting electrical properties and here we see again the pinched hysteresis loops the fingerprint of the members here at this point though no official name or recognition of a unique device was defined that I'll change in 1971 one year later when circuit theorists dr. Leon chua described the memristor as the missing nonlinear passive to terminal electrical component relating electric charge and flux linkage what I've highlighted there up in red is a more general definition of a memristor called a memory subsystem in real-world devices memristors may be made up of not only purim residents but a combination of mem capacitance and or amendment duct ins after 1971 there was a long period of time without many new reports of materials exhibiting hysteresis loops one pretty significant publication however was in 2002 when mikogo published a paper about their silver help kalkaji Ned memristor devices this device in particular is the great great grandfather of later kalkaji net-based memristors used to develop memristor bass Graham at Arizona State University micron opinion and even it's rumored to be the basis of a micron in Intel's crosspoint Ram that's being developed today in fact this member is also previous generation device which led up to the silver hi Jeanette devices that we have so not only am I Mercer has been found in scientific literature development labs when I came across this interesting fine wandering research for this presentation where a person investigated the current voltage response of black crud or corrosion found a brass rifle casing he found in the ditch next to a gravel road and again here we see the pinch hysteresis loop by the early 2000s that were quite a lot of members reported but no one thought about the connection to chua's memristor no one yet called their device a memristor I've always see 3 more reported devices to in two thousand six and one in 2004 and in 2008 HP claims to have found the missing memory sir well as we've just seen memristors have been around for over 200 years to the author's credit they'll write an abstract they reference about 17 earlier devices previously showing the classic hysteresis loop behavior I think it was HP's marketing team however not the not the authors that decided to go with the sensationalist title but however in any case to HP's credit I think they did a wonderful job at popularizing the memristor and getting people excited about it and and for that we should all be grateful after two thousand eight tons of memory stirs started coming out of the woodwork and they even they were even started they even started to be referred to as memristors above we see a small sampling of the memristor different types of memory serves published since HP titanium oxide mr. publication so before this talk i did a search on Google Scholar where the term man mr. and this is what I found exponential growth this plot shows that after two thousand eight the number of memory store papers has consistently doubled every 18 to 24 months I believe this trend is going to continue and the future of memory stir technology is very exciting so let's continue the historical review for millions of years ago up to very recent history including today in late 2015 norm decided to offer memristors that we developed for our own jerome immersive chip prototypes to the general public the motivation to do this was mainly driven by our excitement for the potential that memristors offer we didn't want to keep it behind locked doors the memory stirs came in 16 pin dip packages and are optimized for bi-directional incremental learning applications like neuromorphic it should also be good for other applications though such as digital switching Graham now starting today at this very moment I'd like to announce that gnome is offering a total of three different devices tungsten tin and chromium available in in two formats one is the classic 16 pin dip package but the second is a raw diet probable format with 180 devices ranging from size 12 30 microns so what are the differences between these three members you may ask well of course there is the physical differences and the corresponding electrical differences the physical differences are the doping material in the active kalkaji 09 later so either tin chromium or tungsten and the other difference main difference is the phase transition temperature it's somewhere between 250 and 350 degrees Celsius theoretically there is 350 but when we did the tests the test equipment accidentally melted at 250 so we have to redo those tests the electrical difference is our the switching speed tin a slower for example because there's a bit more capacitance in the active layer the endurance which is how many times it can be cycled the data retention meaning how firmly it stays in this program state and the on/off resistance dates there's slightly different we believe these three memristors can be applied to a lot of different architectures and applications the possibilities include learning systems and on by non-volatile ram and with our backend of lighted service members just can be in grade integrated into your CMOS wafers and we can also create custom memristors to order based on specific needs and I talked to Chris about how theoretically small they could be and she said 50 angstroms it's theoretically possible whether we can actually make those that small is another question of course here's an overview of our back in the blind service starting at the left the way it would work is you would send us CMOS wafers we would work together to make masks the layers would be deposited and the stuff that isn't needed etched away at that point we could shift the raw way for back non packaged or we could package them further and send back chips and this would all take place at Boise State University so another thing we're offering as of today is raw memristor data due to popular demand from labs that don't have the specialized equipment or know how they can now access the raw data in order to develop test and validate their models without even needing the memory stirs or the data collection capabilities besides the raw data we include a java application which shows which plots the data nicely the raw data includes ac/dc and pulse driving conditions and data retention tests okay so next part is memristor models remember sir modeling is extremely important because if you want to develop reliable circuit simulations you need to accurately model your components while resistors inductors capacitors transistors etc have been around for a long long time memristors are relatively new and the models are not quite yet perfectly developed in this next section I'll talk about existing models and the model that we've developed and used at known there are many models out there but still none capture all the behaviors of all the different types of memories a lot of active research is going on in this area to improve the state of the models I think the two main goals should be the model should accurately fit real device data and the model should read econ efficient in accurate model should capture all the important properties of a memory including but not limited to hysteresis pulse response temperature effects diode effects acid inductance data retention and endurance here's here's a sampling of current device models that I found in the literature a few years ago you can see that the numbers and diversity is similar to the number and diversity of members to devices themselves what else are when I was searching for an active model back then I really didn't find a convincing one either the model wasn't computationally efficient or it didn't really model the behavior good enough so under that frustration Alex developed a new models which we call the metastable switch model it's very computationally efficient and as shown above can quite accurately model a very wide range of different memories of devices the above figure shows the metastable switch model fit to two different pinched hysteresis responses for four different memristors here we show additional lotto behaviors and that it can be used only to model the hysteresis loops but also pulse response resistance and multiple devices connected together and here we show a limb metastable switch model used on some of our first primitive tractor state experiments on simple Katie Ram synapses this model is also used in our gnome API to modeled underlying thermodynamic RAM which is just network topologies made a made up of neurons made up of members repairs representing synapses with a weight and a magnitude the metastable switch model represents a memristor as a collection of metastable switches in parallel with two opposing Schottky diodes which you sometimes get in memory stirs made of layers of material bounded by two metal layers the total current I is made up of the memory component I am and the diode component is the weight fire represents how much current is contributed from each component so a 5-1 would mean all the current through the device is coming from the metastable switch component of the model and 0 from the Schottky diode not part of it what I'll talk about now is the metastable switch component of the model at any given time in your simulation each metastable switch and imagine there's maybe a million or billion of them is either in a time or off conductance date and that those numbers are represented by GA and GV when writing your simulation and a certain time step interval with a certain voltage drop across the device the current through the device can be calculated current is a function of temperature the time characteristic of the device and the both the voltage drop we at each time step the question is stated how many metastable switch and state B will transition to a how many will instead a will transition to be and the probability of that happening is PA and PB note that the logistic function is similar to the hyperbolic sine function used in a lot of other members of models our views of the logistic function Apollo simply from the requirement that probabilities must be bounded between zero and one ok so back to the question of how many metastable switches will transition from B to a and HB well that's just a binomial distribution to be represented by that where n is the number of switches in state what's a a k is the number that are going to transition out of the state from A to B and P is the probability given above by PA you'd also set up that that situation for for the switches in state B going to a now when n is large the binomial distribution can be represented as a Gaussian distribution where the mean is NP and variances NP x 1 minus p so each time step two gaussian distributions are defined with the mean and standard deviation based on the current state of the circuit and the number of the metastable switches in each state is updated the current the total current is then simply the number of metastable switches in Peach State x their intrinsic conductance contributions with it to the total current here we show that the parameters in code and we can see that it's quite simple setting the parameters given a hysteresis loop shown on the right is also quite simple so given a hysteresis plat we can read off the on and off conducted States alliance meeting in the middle and we can read off the on and off threshold voltages from the plot point 3 volt minus 14 volts the time constant in the model is usually all it needs to be tweaked this model is closed form closed form and very simple here's a look at the fit parameters from a diverse range of different members two types the model is simple but also has enough degrees of freedom to be quite flexible if you want to use this model or further develop it feel free to do so the code is already open source and it's included in our memory store data sheet and white paper available at the link above so the next major topic to cover is memristor applications I must admit I'm not an expert in all of the members members for applications across the entire field so please forgive me I'll just be giving a quick overview and then I'll be diving down into the area that I'm most familiar with which is neuromorphic sand in particular thermo dynamic Ram with memristors before this topic I also looked into the major area the major area members to applications and this is what i found the top one being near morphix followed by modeling and memory and then analog logic and oscillators digital memory was the first application of memory search that seemed like the obvious low-hanging fruit to bring to market as we know a memristor compete can be putting in on an off state and this can represent a 140 and digital computing the advantages over traditional static dynamic static and dynamic Ram include denser memory pastor read and write lower power and non-volatile which means you can turn off the computer and the states see where they are the bits popular temp set this include these current projects the machine by HP 3d cross point by micron and Intel reran by crossfire soloist by global honorees and others gb ram also known as PCM by infineon technologies and then a desktop technologies analog computing which was mostly abandoned in the 1960s can i'll be revisited due to the availability of memory stirs it's not like analog computers are suddenly going to replace digital computers though it's just that for some sort of applications analog computing can be much more efficient take for example adding numbers if you want to add numbers analog lee all i need to do is measure the current on some wire that connects to the current of a bunch of other wires the problem before members crucibles around though is that the resistors are set you can't change the values but with memory serves now you can change the they can change their states and the currents can can change as well this plays a key role in neuro morphix which I'll get into next okay so let's talk about the mode of the motivation for neuro morphix how do you go from a cpu or GPU running artificial intelligence applications at the level of the human brain all the way down to the level of biology which in the case of the human brain is about 100 watts in the cubic foot of matter well the answer to that is don't simulate a brain build a brain what we think that that means is that we need to merge memory and processor some synaptic weights analog ly reduce operating voltage embrace and capitalize on volatility don't try to fight it and of course use my erasers to do this so back to this flat notice a billion order a billion times difference what does a billion times difference in power consumption look like well here's an illustration to make the point clear imagine putting one liter of fuel into two cars one representing biology and the other one representing digital given that liter of fuel if you let those cars drive the biology one could go around the entire Earth and the digital one would go one inch that's the difference but you don't have to take our word for it the White House grin challenge for future computing has just been announced and it fits exactly the mode of it motivations for developing a new type of computer similar challenges are appearing in Europe and other parts of the world as well first call to proposals just came out and is co-sponsored by SRC and the NSF and note that the two main points it highlights severely limited by the energy dissipation involved in processing storing and moving data constrained by physical and associated economic limits that says what we've been saying for a long time now you need to build a brain where the distance is zero between memory and processor and stop trying to simulate a brain on a digital platform to illustrate the difference between digital and analog power consumption for adding numbers which is an important operation in neuro morphix I've put together a simple and fun demonstration we'll start with digital and ask how much energy is one cup is required to add up all 64 numbers each number is represented in this case by pate bits in a ram array the energy to add up all the numbers is proportional to the total communication distance required in pushing the numbers from Ram to the CPU x the voltage squared will first just consider the total wire distance D keep in mind that energy is proportional to D here I've added the CPU to the side and in order to add up all the numbers the cpu first has to get the numbers this involves charging the wires to communicate the bits from each Ram cell to the CPU what I'm going to do next is just keep track of the distance of wire being charged for each number for the first number we have eight wires communicating a bit so if we'll hit wires together for our two numbers we're going to have 16 wires for 3 24 48 64 and for all 64 numbers we have this many ways since the energy is required since the energy required is proportional to the total distance the total energy can be represented roughly by the square of red now we take a look at adding up the numbers analog leaf here we have a bunch of memory stirs connected in parallel and we want to sum of the currents to get the representation of the sum of resistance values given the same cell sizes we connect the memory stirs in parallel with 2h tree fractal wires at each cell we have a memory sir and additionally we have a controller which applies the voltage across the network and reads the current some let's remove everything except the wires mixing blue and we start adding up all the wires to get the total wire distance and here's what we end up with the 464 numbers we have this many wires since the energy required is proportional to the total distance the total energy can be represented roughly by this patch of blue you can see the relative amount of wire distance needed to communicate the numbers to be added what this show is clearly is that for the case of adding numbers analog has a significant advantage note that I didn't even include the power of that the CPU needed to do the adding and add an analog the addition was free but what about the voltage there can be even more of an advantage gleaned from analog computing if you can reduce the voltage as well if we look again at the equation for energy we see it's proportional to voltage squared which will affect the energy budget even more than the distance of the wires if we look at the difference in voltage between modern digital computers and biology we see an 18 x difference squaring this is 324 x difference if we represent the energy difference by right into areas again this is what we have this way looks like combined effect of reducing both the communication distance and voltage for this simple example results in an energy difference that looks like this now I've left out a few details and oversimplify things a bit but the main take-home message should be this digital architectures are vastly vastly less efficient for certain computations only by combining memory and processor making the communication distance between data and processor 0 and reducing the voltage and we hope to span the 1 billion fold discrepancy between current machine learning platforms and biological brains enter a thermo dynamic Ram normal solution to the grand challenge of creating a new type of computer for artificial intelligence applications that can operate at the level of biological power consumption speed and size thermo dynamic Ram is no mynx neuroma restive coprocessor designed based on the theory of AHA computing it's deceptively simple and it's essentially a static Ram with the sets it with the sensing circuitry removed and I members repair added at each address location all the members repairs a couple via three fractal h3 wires which connect to additional circuitry called the AHA controller the chip is designed to plug into existing digital computers and be interacted with via a simple instruction set with this architecture we reduce the sum of synaptic weights to an analog operation we can operate at very low voltages because of the read and write faces that constantly repair relevant state today we have shown capabilities across the spectrum of machine learning with Kate erm emulators and the norm API including supervised and unsupervised classification combinatorial optimization clustering unsupervised feature learning robotic actuation temporal prediction and anomaly detection as mentioned already we've designed and developed the entire tech tech stack from memristors to applications and now all that's left to do is build the chips call to action I'm just going to summarize quickly with a call to action to all my mystery technology developers whether you're working on members remodeling digital members to base dram or other members to applications we have no more here to help and cooperate together with you we're a small start-up and we're working on our own thing but we're also very interested and actively pursuing collaborations across the entire tech stack if you need my oysters even custom application specific ones we have those available if you have your own see wats designs and you want to merge that with memristors we have a back end of line service set up and waiting for action if you're developing testing and validating memristor models we have wrong i'm mr. data available and we can also probably collect any other data that you may need if you're looking for a better memory store model or perhaps want to further develop the model we've so far created we're happy to share the code with you and have a meeting and explain anything that may be confusing and finally if you're looking and to get if you're looking to get into neuromorphic but don't really have the entire theory and tech stack worked out yet but you can help us replace our emulators with actual hits you RAM ships via either angel investment or being a fabrication partner or via the no developer community please let us know as well and we can collaborate to introduce the world's first truly adaptive ultra-low-power neural memories of chips thank you very much for attention
