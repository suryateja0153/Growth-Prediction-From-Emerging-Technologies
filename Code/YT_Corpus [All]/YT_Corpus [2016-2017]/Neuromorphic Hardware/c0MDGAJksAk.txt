 okay good morning everybody my name is Collins Meyer i am from the human brain project i'm and i'm in charge of the neuromorphic computing activity i have been at this workshop from the beginning it's a it's a very nice event and before i give my presentation here i would like to point to those two microphones in the middle there and they are very important in the previous work crops we had extremely good discussions panel discussions which were really steered by contributions from the audience so when the real talk start later when the science starts and the technology please make good use of these microphones and contribute to the discussions and I have to say something else we are always running out of time at this workshop so to all the speakers please stick to your time otherwise we have to enforce it we really need the time to get into this discussion sessions which are the real important parts of this workshop so this is a round of funding agencies in a way okay or program managers I'm neither a program manager Nora funding agency I'm using funds I'm not distributing them okay so I'm the wrong person to be here in this programmatic panel on the other hand Europe is far away so Brussels didn't send a person so I have to do it I'll do my best but it's not what i like to do but in any case so this is about European funding for neuromorphic computing in related areas let me also from the beginning say that this is far far far from being complete me Europe is a very complex structure as you know and there is a lot of national funding regional funding local funding I mean it would require several workshops to really explain to a full extent where the money for research and technology comes from particulars of a neuromorphic computing so I'm only giving you the European perspective here the human brain project of course is kind of very visible to the good end to the bad and it's also very present here the good part is present here the neuromorphic computing so there are what how many a thing eight contributions which I would advertise here and they can describe many things like for example the hardware development which I find quite impressive so there are talks by Steve phurba and Johannes channel on the two hardware development lines which will also be described in other talks here and also for the brain scale system there will be demonstrated out there so please go and have a look this is reality I mean these things really are existing now on a relatively large scale in another aspect of neuromorphic computing is of course not only to build machines but to give them something to do that is relevant for cognitive computing for example and so there's a lot of theory activity going on and there are several contributions on theory from Wolfgang mass me I petrova jitters posted from roots availing and the other thing is benchmarking of course we always said that I mean is neuromorphic computing battery is the brain better than a computer not always try to multiply 25 digit numbers you are much much worse than your computer definitely even worse than your cell phone so the brain is not always better I mean there are certain tasks that the brain can do for example finding structure spatial temporal structure and data that's what the brain can do and so we need specific benchmark that that really tell us how good these neuromorphic architectures are and that's far from being trivial and Thomas Novotny would I think you will actually be the first speaker at this web drop so these are this is the president of HPP at the conference coming to the bureaucracy aspect of the funding aspect which at the end was important of course this is how Europe spends money in in horizon 2020 which is the name of what people call the framework programme i started in 2014 very recently and will run until 2020 that's project start date so effectively it will run until 2023 like HPP for example there is an area and so that's 80 billion euros basically that's being spent there is what's called excellence in science which is 24 billion euros most of this actually goes to individual researchers support which is also important very relatively little goes into to collaborate effort like a human brain project for example so it's all good erc grants a 13 billion for this for this period which is quite substantial future emerging technologies those are the collaborative efforts were HPP is part of it but only one part of it that's 2.7 then fed has several schemes like an open scheme a proactive scheme and the flagship activity open means you can submit proposals for whatever you like as long as it somehow technology-related a proactive Means committees make proposals on which areas are important and the flagships are what they are I mean they are the big units so there are two of them graphene at the human brain project you see the numbers and getting smaller now and from your morphic computing this is these are approximate numbers there is about 30 million euros for C which is not huge but it is substantial and we can do interesting things these are the three schemes open proactive and flagships I don't have to go into details there but I mean just to tell you it's not only the HPP where novel computing can be done I mean there is for example these proactive schemes where they have work areas and you see for example cognitive neurotic knowledge ease and your computing paradigms and their technologies i explicitly mentioned there so for those who are northern HPP in europe there is still funding to come up with new ideas which is a very important that you not focus everything on just one project which may fail or be less successful than you hope for and so they always has to be alternative solutions alternative ways they wrote to the human brain project very shortly I mean the project hasn't been invented just within a day or so or not even within a year but it's really a rather well coordinated effort that it has been running since 2005 and there were several projects funded by the european commission like facets and brain skates which led into this large-scale project and in addition there were national projects like the Blue Brain Project or the spinnaker project in the UK and they all contributed to this coordinated effort now which is the human brain project which is really important it has really grown from knowledge and from capabilities from technological capability it has not just been invented like that so funding and contractual structure that's a bit complicated but i think i'm supposed to say this very shortly there are several phases there's a was a pilot phase we on the ramp up phase now which has a funding only i had a funding of 54 million euros it will end at the end of this month in a couple of days actually and I was still funded through the previous framework programme and now we are entering in the face where they have so-called specific grant agreements where we have unfortunately very short periods of 24 months that are being funded was typically a hundred million euros of course that's for the entire project not only for neuromorphic computing that's funded in the new program and there is a very very important thing which people often underestimate the importance which is what's called a framework partnership agreement there all these horrible abbreviations I really hate them but but this is an important one okay there's a book which looks like this you can look at it on the web it's called the framework partnership agreement what is this this is a research and technology plan for HBP reaching until 2023 so this is our roadmap okay it doesn't come with any funding but that's not so important at the moment it means that the European Commission commits itself to support this kind of research as it is described in this book alright and this is sign this is signed by the blood of European Commission so this is a relatively stable thing and and this is really what we can point to until 2020 3 and this is the first time ever I have seen a document like that for this field of research so it's it's extremely important and it says an emphasis on building infrastructures and operate them make them available to users and identifying in supporting users that may also be your paths into the project if you are interested what do I mean by that very concretely this is what exists today if you go to Europe today to Manchester and heidelberg you find these two monsters these are two machines that have been constructed over the last 30 months actually of course they weren't developed out of nothing I will come to that in my later talk and also in the presentations that you will see but these machines are available now and on the twenty-second of March which is very very soon we will have a web-based workshop where you can dial in and learn what these machines do how they work and what kind of applications you can you can run on them so this is sort of one of the first very concrete output of the human brain pressure and to operate this machine so they make use of those machines is one of the main work we are going to do for the next year's of course and in parallel we are developing the upgrades the next generation ships and here will be many talks as I said in this workshop if you want to see where this is there is a very obvious URL which is neuromorphic but you just go there and you will find everything about this work that's what I had to say thank you very much
