 our first speak or who was nominated by President Obama by the Senate to serve as the a secretary for science and energy under under secretary dr. or and all sorry under sink ductor or is a principal adviser to the Secretary of Energy on energy technologies and fundamental research initiatives including Dewey's programs in scientific computing and so it will be very so it's very good to have him here on our conference I was surprised when i read about dr. horse background so he's extremely well prepared actually for red roll so prior to joining the department of energy doctor or held academic and leadership appointment at stanford university he was the Dean of Earth Sciences the founding director of a Precourt Institute for energy and the founding director of a Stanford global climate and energy project not only bad but he's also a member of a National Academy of Engineering and he's an chemical engineer in training so please join me in welcoming dr. or under stage for his talk well thanks burn for the introduction I have to say that I'm sort of astonished and pleased that the two speakers this morning both have deep earth sciences connections that shows a lot of good judgment on the part of the the computing community but my job today is not so much to talk about Earth Sciences instead it's to talk about energy and energy of course is woven through the fabric of modern lives it's pretty hard to imagine doing what we do today without access to electricity without a sort of endless weaving together of the forms of energy and the ways we use them so supplying that to the world in the future but at the same time making it deal with the realities of the planet is something that we really all have to take on now we start with some primary energy resource and then we convert it into energy services like electricity and lights and heat and and so on so the question is how do we do that and how can we make all of that work better we have done a couple of important reports this year won a quadrennial energy review that looks at the energy infrastructure for the company the country and then we have a report that I'm going to talk about today the quadrennial Technology Review which looks at the state of energy technologies and asks what the opportunities for research are in the future so today what I'll do is talk a little bit about what what we found what the research opportunities are and where we might go in the future and I'll try to weave that together with a few examples of computing that is such an important underlying component of everything we do it's worth noting that in the four years since the first quadrennial technology review a lot has changed in so it's actually a good time for another such review one such change is a big reduction in costs of renewable technologies like wind and a big increase in deployment for those wind is up to four and a half percent now of the electricity generation in this country and the costs have come down in the best resource places they're competitive now without a subsidy on this the solar side utility photovoltaics are now being deployed again this is the reason for this is a substantial reduction in costs and that's the result of lots of manufacturing experience a lot of investment in China a lot of research to reduce costs and you might say well great it's good that's all we don't have to do that anymore but the fact is that we can drive these costs down a lot more with additional research so I'll say more about that in a minute in those of us around the country who have installed pv systems that our home are also contributing there's been a big reduction here in price and also a big increase in deployment and something that you know I think is actually quite astonishing is that that LEDs now have declined about ninety percent in price over the last five years so so that reduction really is tells you something about the how costs can change with manufacturing experience but since these things use maybe fifteen percent of the energy that an incandescent bulb is that really is a big opportunity to save energy and do a do good things along the way and then in the the battery side electric vehicles are starting to take their place now this is again the result of reductions in battery costs and improvements and energy density and power density so the net result of all of this is that there's a lot of change underway in the in the energy landscape the United States is now the biggest producer of oil and gas in the world I think five years ago we wouldn't have anticipate that that would happen and then there's a lot of else going on so it's time to take another look at where we stand on all this so what do we want from an energy system the really three important components of this one is energy security every society wants to be able to operate without the potential for disruption of the energy systems that they depend on this means that it should be a diversified system it should be diversified both on the primary energy resource side and also on the supply side there's economic security which means cost efficient energy systems much of what we do in the research components on energy partment of energy is aimed at reducing costs of systems so that our economy can be more competitive and provide jobs and and be an efficient contributor to the economy and then there's the environmental side we know now that greenhouse gases and climate change are a substantial challenge that energy is a primary way that we humans interact with the global systems that we last take pretty much for granted and that means that we need to do a much better job of balancing our use of energy with with the climate challenge and with other emissions challenges that are associated with with energy use so those three things can go together and I think what we should remember is that we now have this opportunity to create manage and manage linked complex systems that deal with all three of these challenges simultaneously and it is pretty much impossible to imagine doing this without high performance computing underlying much of what we have to do so now I just emphasize again that this what we have here is a snapshot because cost change particularly with deployment so the LED example that I gave you ninety ninety percent reduction in cost since 2008 that's just because a lot of manufacturing experience has been gained but you see the cost curves here for the other technologies I've mentioned driving down costs makes it possible to do things in a competitive way that we can't couldn't do otherwise but we should remember that this will continue that this competition amongst energy resources and how they're deployed will continue in time so it's actually fun to think about where things will go but hard to predict so some of you have undoubtedly seen a diagram like this on the the left side here you see the energy resources solar nuclear hydro wind geothermal natural gas coal biomass and petroleum to first order petroleum is used for transportation and the other fuels go toward electric power generation and direct use of thermal energy so that the quadrennial technology review is kind of organized around here this the icons on the side power generation is one fuels is another on the right side there the uses and they're broadly distributed amongst buildings manufacturing and transportation and in between those the connective tissue is the grid and by that i mean the full transmission and distribution system so that that kind of knits all of this together so I'll march through a few of these with some computing examples on the way so let me start with the grid we historically we had a modest number of wells but a modest number of relatively big power plants sitting on a backbone with largely radial distribution of electric power through the the transmission and distribution system it was minimally censored in the sense that it had they had well to give you an example I in the early 2000s I spent a day at the California payment system operator and in those days it took him about a second to kep to acquire the data on the the state of voltage and and phase angle and such and then three seconds to compute the state of the system and then they could think about whether an adjustment was needed and and so the cycle time for modifying ringing generation assets on or turning then up and down was tens of seconds but nowadays especially with lots of intermittent renewables on the grid the time scale for things to go south if something happens is much shorter than that so that really was not an adequate control system now when the financial crisis came in 2008 one of the ways we invested funds to keep to kind of stimulate the economy was to install what are called phasor measurement units these give you voltage and frequency and phase angle and their time synchronized so that you can tell where things are going in a certain place and the the information is gathered this game visibility for what was happening on the grid and for example the 2003 blackout that did occur because a line was overloaded and said and hit a tree and cascaded that could could have been stopped had we had these assets in place so the message here is that we're partway through a big revamping a modernization of the grid that's very important to our future what we need to move to is the system that is flexible and resilient can tolerate lots of renewables has lots of sensors and data which means that we also have to deal effectively with all the data and it offers the process the possibility of automatic controls and optimization in ways that could only be dreamed about even just a few years ago that's a work in progress and we need to do much more you can imagine micro grids that our Island the bowl so that they they can operate even when hurricane sandy has knocked some pieces off line and they can recover much more quickly the millions of smart meters that have now been installed actually our sensors that tell you where things are operating or where they aren't you can nowadays so that when the tree fell on the distribution or the feeder line before the way that utilities found it was first of all they waited for somebody to call them and complain and then they sent the truck out with the flashlight to look at the at the wires until they found the one that the tree fell on you can actually do that in a communicating system you can do that automatically now go right to the to the spot where it happens so it's more resilient even now and can be much better in the future particularly as we begin to manage this much more complex system so in terms of the renewable side of things we actually have to pay attention to the fact that the resources not uniformly distributed in time if you these curves show the top to show the net load curve in the California Independent System Operator territory for 2012 and 2013 and starting with the the curve that's labeled 2014 this so-called duck curve shows you the effect of big solar generation daytime now that's great lots of solar power into the the system but a pretty big ramp rate 13 thousand megawatts in three hours as the Sun gets low on the horizon so managing deep penetration of renewables being able to operate complex systems of assets is going to be a challenge that we have to work on as well storage is another aspect of this it electrons for the most part our grid is one that's been balanced but with generation and load matched as closely as possible in a system with with much more intermittency involved storage would be Cuse full and storage on a variety of scales on the small scale for transportation batteries look like the right solution in the intermediate scale things like flow batteries offer some some grid scale storage and then there's pumped hydro and compressed air storage for larger scale systems lots of work going on in this area lots more to be done lots of research opportunities here so assuming that we now have set in motion the kinds of things that we will need to do for clean for a grid that can manage all this clean power now we better generate some of the clean power so let me say a few words about that the right now the coal and coal generates about I call it a third a little more than a third of the electricity that's actually down competition by low-cost natural gas has made it harder for the the older at least efficient coal plants to compete and the the new rules for the for carbon emissions and other things like mercury missions will change the landscape as well this is a picture of a of a plant where a large-scale carbon capture and storage project will be installed and it's it's pretty clear that we can separate co2 from combustion product streams or alternately we can separate oxygen from nitrogen and burn with pure oxygen so you make a co2 cost is the issue these things we separate commercial quantities of co2 from other gases every day in refining and and natural gas processing processing operations but we're talking about a much bigger scale and we need lower costs so the research opportunities include better better separation techniques and the ability to predict where these fluids will go in the subsurface if they're injected so computational opportunities there as well now one of the things that has to happen with a little luck this said no that that was supposed to be a video that started back there but since I can't go backwards there we go now if we well maybe the video will stop but start but in any case what happens they would go that's co2 they get separated in the power plant then needs to be compressed to shove it under ground and these these compressors that do this they consume lots of energy the it turns out that the details of how vortices shed at the tips of the blades those can be controlled with something like tip injection they offer some real opportunities for both better efficiency and technologies that can allow us to make better jet engines or gas turbines as well so it's a place where the combination of very high resolution computing high resolution both in time and space can help us manage the in this case the shocks the control angle of attack on the turbine blades which in turn controls efficiency and either delays or or helps produce minh blade stalls that can cause problems so a real opportunity for Hyper corns computing to make it it all work better in the future on the nuclear power side we have about almost twenty percent of the nuclear power in this twenty percent of the electricity in this country is generated by nuclear power now we have five new nuclear power plants under construction in the in the US so there's been a bit of a renaissance their cost is still an issue spent fuel storage is an issue and the future includes some possibilities for for small modular reactors a fast spectrum reactors that can change the the waste storage picture and and lots of materials questions that have to do with life extension of the existing power plant fleet this picture is one of a small modular reactor and the image on the right is a picture of results from a project that is looking at in detail and modeling a very fine scale the performance of a nuclear power plant this is an opportunity to to improve performance but with details simulations there the problems are fundamentally multiscale and ones that have lots of potential for approve minus fishin see and speaking of efficiency the termina about a minute ago was one that was for compressing co2 this one is runs the other way so the the turban on the left side and this is a steam turbine they are everywhere in the power generation system it's two-sided it has five big turban wheels and the the image of a person there is it gives you some sense of the scale that one's a 300 megawatt turban on the right side is a 300 megawatt turbines that uses supercritical high-pressure co2 as the working fluid so turbines are just wings and mass flow over the wing is what generates the thrust that either keeps the airplane in the sky or makes the turban turn if you have a denser fluid like super super critical fewer co2 then you can make the turban smaller now you say okay great I'm sold why don't we have these things everywhere well as you can imagine there are some technical issues to be to be sorted out many of them have to do with the material science of all of this so our ability to calculate and predict properties of materials in a in advance would help a lot here on the wind power side wind as i already said was has really come down and cost for the best areas and we we really have spent our lives modeling what happens at a single wind turbine but in fact people don't usually build single winters they put them in wind farms and depending on which way the wind is blowing the turbines can be partly shielded but what a very interesting computational exercise has shown is that with some combination of control over which way the turban angles and the blade pitches you can actually steer the wakes a little bit and even just a little bit of steer and can give you in this case a fourteen percent improvement in the energy capture from that wind turbine without rebuilding anything but it is it really demands the computational resources for a big system at fine scale to be able to do this appropriately on the solar side again big reductions in cost but lots more that we can do there's a host of new materials coming along that offer a potential for much lower costs and to be fair there's room to do better on the soft costs side of of what it costs the balance of system the permitting costs and those kinds of things it cost about twice as much to install a solar pv system in the US as it does in Germany for example so we can do we can do better so that's likely to be a resource that will contribute much more in the future so let me say a word about transportation and vehicles so vehicles are ubiquitous I mean we all think we we need to have multiple vehicles that we own which mostly sit around not being used 98 or so percent of the time so there's a whole host of opportunities to do better there now the one great thing about liquid fossil fuels is that they pack high energy density so you put gallons in the tank and go a long way you can imagine electrifying some of the urban transportation effort for example that will require better batteries and lower costs but still for the long-haul trucking and and probably for airplanes combustion is likely to continue to be an important component here so combustion efficiencies of research opportunity thinking about more carefully about co optimizing fuels and engines lightweighting reducing the weight of what you push around either through the sky on land offers a big opportunity there that's fundamentally again a materials problem can we can we make lightweight strong safe materials that that do the job various versions of electrification could be batteries could be fuel cells and so on lots of opportunities there and then we can think about the systems aspect of all this all of us get in our car and even even now you can look at at one of the mapping software systems and have a shot at figuring out where the traffic jams are you can imagine that our vehicles are going to help us do that more carefully in in the future and thinking about the system's aspect of how that works offers some opportunities as well on the advanced manufacturing side I have to say this was an area that I knew less about when we started working on this than I do now and I'm really quite excited about the opportunities here so this is a 3d printer making a car it's sort of a rudimentary car it that version turned into this and then that turned into this those of us who are from my area will recognize the Shelby Cobra had a 427 cubic-inch a piston engine in it but this version is electric and what's interesting about this is this vehicle went from drawings to that car in six weeks so it was a 3d printed car and it makes the point that by judicious use of a combination can't do this without lots of computing by the way judicious use of our ability to translate computing into making apart gives you the opportunity if one reducing cycle time so the cost of on designs is lower it also offers offers the opportunity to make parts that that are that way lists to do the same thing that use less of the primary material an example we like to use it has to do with an aircraft part so the traditional machining way of doing it takes eight times as much material as you actually end up with in the part if you assemble it from from a powder with electron beam heating to fuse things together then you you reduce the amount of material to one and a half times what you end up with and you reduce the energy use over the lifecycle of that product by a factor of three because when you fly that around in an airplane it takes fuel to fly weight so so they're just as a host of opportunities across the manufacturing spectrum for doing things like this for process intensification for making everything we do more efficient so there's a message there as well we should look across the energy systems and as systems as a whole and look for the opportunities to use energy efficiently making it efficient is a big step along the way to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as well so let me finish by just saying a word or two about the enabling science here we at the Department of Energy we run a host of of user facilities at the 13 national labs in the in the complex the science and energy complex and then the three labs in the national security complex Livermore Sandia and Los Alamos also do this as well these are x-ray sources they're used for materials characterization Neutron sources the example that's shown here that that little turban blade that's sitting in the middle there is shown next to the spallation neutron source at Oak Ridge it the blade itself was made by additive manufacturing so this is one of the efficient manufacturing techniques the image that shown there is the residual stresses that exist in that blade after its manufacturing now those of us that right around in airplanes would like those blades to hold together that's a good thing and being able to understand the state of stress within them is a way to to guarantee that the properties that you need are also there as well so I just will point out that virtually everything we do in the energy space at some point arose from the fundamental understanding of science so the combination of catalysis of nanostructured materials of being able to close the design loop around materials properties that we want computationally that is a huge opportunity going forward as well and then I'll close with the idea that that really advanced computing is is totally fundamental to to everything we do here we've we've made lots of progress that was if you think about the last two decades for example on the national security side once we stop testing nuclear weapons for real we began testing them in in computing facilities that demanded and led to a big advance in computing power that of course immediately once it was available immediately got adopted by the scientific community we're embarking on another version of that now and that offers many more opportunities for another big advance in performance and this will require us to understand a variety of new ideas quantum computing neuromorphic computing these are ideas that are being being explored with scientific discovery that might be based on quantum mechanics and the chemistry of materials and particle physics the neuromorphic computing mimics the neurological processes in the brain who knows we might actually begin to understand something about how our brains operate there's a there's a real potential there and all both of these really required development or kind of a decade scale of Ford this will involve both technology developments and systems developments and underpinnings and mathematics and science and so there is something for all of us to do in this world i would say that we're entering another period of really exciting potential performance in computing with great challenges that really do matter so it's a great time to be working in this area so in case you don't want to read all 500 pages of the quadrennial technology review though I do actually recommend it it really is quite fascinating reading let me give it to you in in four bullets and then I'll note also that in if you're a particular favorite technology area is not covered in enough detail in the main report there are many individuals technology assessments that are available on our website energy.gov / qtr so here's where we stand on the energy technology world we've made lots of progress it really is quite heartening to see the the progress we've made and the fact that greenhouse gas emissions have have gone down in this country in the last few years so that's exciting but there's lots more to do this is a multi-decade endeavor that we're embarked on and we need to work hard on it and stick with it over time there's a huge opportunity space both for individual technologies and for improved energy systems that use our ability to understand and compute our way through complex systems that that will allow us to make these systems work much better in the future we really do have to have a portfolio here research takes place in the spectrum of not knowing exactly which technologies in which approaches will mature the most quickly so that needs to be fully stocked across primary energy resources the ways we convert those into services with lots of different system scales and timescales for application and efficiency everywhere we really need to make that a primary metric that we use in addition to cost going forward and then to finish the enabling science and computing capabilities are absolutely fundamental to all of this and will we can't imagine going forward at the pace we need to without them as well so with that I'll close and say thank you very much and I'm happy to try to respond to questions if they're not too hard thank thank you very much for is really interesting talk under security or so we have microphones left and right please line up and if you want to have a question or you can submit it through the app if you are interested so perhaps like the first until the first people come up I ask a question yeah global warming and energy issues it's it's a global problem and um so you your ministry is I understand is also responsible for funding science and so on so why don't we have more international funding available for collaborative science across the world I know where was a g8 had like a few little things but it's not on a big scale it's big problem so yeah it is a big problem and we're slowly edging our way toward to making the commitments to do something I think the the approach to the cop21 meeting in Paris in a couple of weeks with more than 150 countries now announcing goals for their particular settings that's a start I think we can actually look to the science community for and is some examples of how to do this the CERN collaboration that produced the Large Hadron Collider and the eggs boson results is one example of a big international collaboration we're working on one now that involves neutrinos and there is lots of conversation among research groups around the world it's it's mostly funded in our individual places as of now but you're probably right that there's room for more collaboration okay actually some questions were submitted just my device didn't work what we need is better communicator okay so first question was very popular that's the need for a sustainable energy supply combined with climate change imply that nuclear energy use must increase well I think nuclear is a important component of the energy mix we having a base load source of electric power that that has very low greenhouse gas emissions really just from the steel and concrete in the in the plan is an important component but there are some problems we have to sort out we have to deal with the spent fuel problem and we and we have to deal with the cost challenges as well but I do think it needs to be an important component going forward and we need to work hard to make that happen ah do you see a role of in-home batteries now to lower carbon emissions today okay so that's a very good question the role of in-home batteries so the so the question is what service they are those battery is going to provide now for those that own an electric vehicle for example you can imagine that having a battery means that you could still be charged up to go to work even if the powers off in your neighborhood I live in a neighborhood in in California when I'm there that where the wiring was installed in the 1910s and if he at times so that would be a service that people might very well be willing to pay for and the ability to run your house with when the grids offline is something that some people have generators now so those are both services that have value there's talk of being able to use this as a balancing component on the grid as a whole but we'll need to figure out market valuation for the service that that person has paid for the capital cost for and provide and so all this is a long-winded way of saying that you know I don't really know for sure how that's going to play out I think it's a very interesting area and one that that has a lot of potential but much more to be thought about before we know for sure what happens ok so perhaps you also have time for like at least one question of a microphone so you spoke briefly about the department energy research is what barriers do you see in transitioning the technologies developed at the laboratories ended industry practice and making sure that industry needs are aligned with what's going on in the laboratories yeah it's a good question we have we actually have put a fair amount of effort into this area of late we've had several national Commission's that have looked at the labs and looked at ways to streamline the relationship with industry both ways with results coming out of the labs but also making possible for for industry to to work with the labs actually a quite significant component of the work that's done at the at the x-ray light sources for example is actually industry-sponsored as well including beam lines but we've also established in the science and energy part of deal we've we've established a new office of Technology transitions that's aimed at streamlining and coordinating and make it making it much more possible for to build those links between the labs and industries so we have more to do for sure but but you're right it's a the labs are this science and technology powerhouse and we should leverage that both ways okay perhaps one quick question on tegaki what is your estimate on the future amount of the fossil fuels a future trend of the price on how can we help with that so the question I think the question is what's the future trend for fossil fuels this is the time where i should say do not invest based on anything i'm about to say if you look at my track record of investing you would definitely not do what i say so fossil fuels because they provide an extremely valuable service in terms of the energy density they will be with us for an extended period so we need to make sure that we use them as efficiently as possible and then up to the extent for example that methane stays in the electric power generation mix over time we need to work on carbon capture and storage for that as well now it actually is because what comes out of a gas fired power plant cleaner than what comes out of a coal plant that that looks like it might even be a little less expensive there but so we'll need to balance those two and over time the fraction of fossil fuels is likely to decline but it will take a long time thank you very much undersecretary or so these interesting insights and and showing us a little bit that our work is like has some influence on the world's problem and then thank you very much Gordon thank you all
