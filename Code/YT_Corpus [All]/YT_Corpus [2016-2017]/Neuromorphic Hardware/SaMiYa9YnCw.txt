 right thanks everyone for coming my name is David Cox and I'm a co-organizer of this symposium together with Pablo sprout of Hoppus and Kathy choot and the amazing team at ICS we have an incredible lineup of scientists across the divide of neuroscience and computer science today but before I start I do have one bit of bad news because of the impending Snowmageddon in Washington DC one of our speakers actually the first speaker is unfortunate jacob Bogle seen from AI ARPA's unfortunately not going to be able to attend because he basically didn't want to get trapped and he absolutely would have gotten trapped it's very strange that the weather is colder there than it is here but such are these times so for the next little while I'm gonna do some tap dancing and tell some jokes to fill that time so off we go so if you'll indulge me for a bit I just want to take a step back a really big picture and think about what's exciting about neuroscience and computer science today and really what what drives us in our interest here at this intersection is that these are two of the the fastest moving fields in the world today and they're on a collision course increasingly with each other but if we take that step back why do we care about neuroscience particular in the context of computer science science itself is about understanding our world and if we're honest with ourselves there's a significant component of understanding where we fit in the world and they're standing why we're special in the world and this is a really interesting question why are we special how are we different from the rest of nature and it's it's tempting to think that we're some sort of culmination of evolution but actually if you if you look at if you study biology you'll learn that's not true there's a dizzying array of species on earth and all of them are exquisitely adapted to the niche that they occupy there's nothing special about us it's just we occupy a different niche but nonetheless we have the sense that there's something special about us but we're not the most numerous species we're not the largest species we're not the strongest or the we're not the longest-lived we're not the most resilient we're not many of these things so what is it if anything that makes us unique in the world and I would argue that it's our complexity and not complexity and some generic sense because nature is rife with complexity what's special about humans is the complexity of our brains and it's that complexity that's allowed us to conquer the earth to transmit information across generations to teach each other to learn to work together to pass on culture to occupy the basically every surface every place on the globe and to extend even beyond it and every work of art every edifice of of civilization all music are all products of the complexity of our brains at the same time this complexity where slaves to it so if we straight about a little from the sort of perfect plan we we are beset by mental disorders and disease and just as everything good that humanity has done comes from our complexity so to do all of the negative aspects in the world so when we say we want to study the brain at a deep level what we mean is that we want to study ourselves and study what's unique and special about ourselves now because we focus inward in our in our outlook on the outside world we have this curious tendency to describe ourselves into brick to reason about ourselves in terms of our own technology of the day so in the era of Descartes in the 17th century hydraulic technologies were the technology of the day so Descartes talked about movement of bodies as animating fluids moving through the body to cause motion and and to interact and move with the environment in the era of Sigmund Freud steam was was the technology of the day so started talking about pressure being released and built up and engines of the conscious and the subconscious move forward to the electronics era and suddenly radio metaphors start creeping into our discussion of the brain we talk about being on the same channel or being on the same wavelength or having crossed wires now fast-forward to the present day and computers are doubtedly the technology of the day has changed the way we live we walk around with super computers in our pockets that we look at all the time and you might be tempted to think that these computers are just another metaphor and in some ways they are a metaphor the same way that those other technologies we're just metaphors and these metaphors can lead you astray but the difference is that in this case computer science provides formal tools that make this more than a metaphor we not only do we can we think about and analogize - between brains and computers but we can actually understand a separation between algorithms what we're computing and implementations the hardware that we use and this powerful ability to reason about the brain as a computer makes this era very different than those that came before so why is this important so if if we look at our our pharmaceuticals our medical establishment many people when we say neuroscience the first thing you might think would be - firstly might come to mind is mental disorders or disease but today we're increasingly reaching an era where medical science is knocking down the the sort of the the major sort of diseases that that that harm humans one by one but the last sort of intransigent core that's been hardest to reach have been so-called chronic non-communicable disorders in particularly mental disorders things like schizophrenia and depression and the thing that's interesting about these disorders is that there's no anatomical or genetic smoking-gun for these things it something's wrong with the brain but it's not so much that something wrong with some particular structure that we can point to but rather something wrong with the software of the brain or something wrong with the wiring of the brain so this is a picture of prozac and this gives you a sense of perfect she a great example of what's wrong with our therapeutics today basically serotonin targets a particular receptor reuptake mechanism in in the brain for serotonin but it's a very blunt tool it affects every serotonin everywhere in the brain and elsewhere in the body there's lots of serotonin to your gut in your heart and Prozac all of these things so in many ways our current approaches to dealing with mental disease are very very blunt tools that result from us not fully understanding the actual inner workings of the computer that we have in our in our heads increasingly also to the extent that we can understand the software of the brain we can understand the language by which the brain communicates within and without itself we can start to interface with the brain so on the left is an example of a widely dispersed technology that's been mature for many years the cochlear implant basically it's a bionic ear so the way this works is you implant an electrode into the cochlea which is the organ in your ear that actually transduces sound and now what we can do is we can take those we can take electrical impulses from the outside and we can restore function where hearing might be lost on the right we have a more ambitious more recent development it's a technology called brain gate so the idea here is that we have a locked-in patient a quadriplegic patient you can put electrodes directly into their brain and then be able to communicate with the brain such that you can the the patient who's locked in can nonetheless say control a robot arm now these are very very early stage technologies but you can get a sense that as we understand more and more about computing and understand more and more about how that relates to the brain we can start to make these incredible advances but it actually goes quite a bit farther than that and what I'd like to convince you of and what many of the panelists and speakers today will be able to address is a sense that actually neuroscience and computational neuroscience in the intersection of computing and neuroscience goes to every corner of our life so as we understand how the brain works we we start to begin to be able to contemplate building systems that work the same way so here we have an assortment of different jobs that people do in the world so we have somebody on the top left who's sweeping we have some people building building cars in the factory we have people looking at poultry all sorts of jobs that people do today but increasingly machines are taking over these jobs so on the Left we have the iRobot Roomba which is a very simple replacement for somebody who might sweep the floor it doesn't have a very complicated brain and it perhaps a brain more like an insect brain but it's sort of the early advance guard of this revolution that's happening in robotics where increasingly robots are able to replace people on the right we have a car factory where industrial robots for many many years have been assisting in building and assembling cars but beyond that advanced guard we have a new generation of robotics that's arriving now so on the Left we have azimu which is a robot bipedal robot made by Honda it doesn't exactly have a purpose other than to showcase the technology that Honda has but it's an impressive piece of technology and on the right we have Baxter robots designed by a start-up coming out of MIT that not only can perform pre-programmed tasks but could actually work with with with people on a factory line to understand and learn how to do new tasks and it has rudimentary vision it has rudimentary arms and these are sort of the first forays into greatly expanding at the range of activities that machines can do and of course very much in the zeitgeist today increasingly tasks like driving cars are being taken over by computers so these are the Google cars so they use a combination of cameras for for vision and a laser scanner which is that sort of cylinder shape thing on the top and increasingly we're hearing many many different companies pouring money into this idea that humans really shouldn't be driving cars and maybe computers would be even better at driving cars than we are ourselves and of course this has led to a tectonic shift in artificial intelligence funding and the landscape of the field in the last couple years so these are all headlines taken from the last couple years google acquires artificial intelligence startup deepmind for about half a billion dollars Yahoo Twitter Baidu they're basically buying up large swaths of the academic field of artificial intelligence there are some estimates coming from people at Google saying that something like 10% of the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence now works for one of these companies it's a privatization of an academic field on a scale it's unprecedented so there's a lot of smart money on this idea that as we understand brains and we can build systems that work the same way we might be able to to do new things that we couldn't do before and largely this is driven by advances in compute and this is the second wave that's been kind of driving across this ability to have huge amounts of compute amounts of data huge amounts of storage to drive all these technologies forward now not everyone agrees that this is a good thing so some this is a Elon Musk he compares building artificial intelligence to summoning the demon a little bit flowery and in terms of language here's another another version of that Stephen Hawking in warrens artificial intelligence could end mankind so clearly some smart people think that the stakes here are very high and and that there's a possibility this can go in a negative direction but one thing that's clear is everybody that at least the zeitgeist of the world today suggests that you know really big shifts in how the world works going forward are close at hand now if we were to take a slightly more conservative approach I could show you this video this is the DARPA Grand Challenge for robotics in 2015 okay so the Robo apocalypse isn't quite upon us yet and you know there are so this is these are amazing robots it should be said does this this is they're funny to watch but the just the sheer technical ability has gone into these is incredible but there's clearly more that we need to be able to do I'm going to turn that off because that's a little bit distracting there are other places where in spite of the fact that we have computers and we have systems that can understand say images they still aren't good enough to do all the things we'd like them to do so this is an example literally close to home in the Boston Marathon bombing one of the sort of upshots sort of after in sort of in hindsight one of the analysis that came out was that basically our ability to look at images with computers was pretty much useless in capturing the the the actual bombers so in spite of the fact that they're basically cameras everywhere now every storefront was full of cameras people were taking pictures of the event and putting them on Flickr all that data was available but as the bombing was unfolding the aftermath of the bombing it wasn't possible to use computers to watch all that imagery understand it and provide actionable inputs here's an example of a very high res photo that somebody took and if you look carefully the guy in the white hat over on the left side of the screen is one of the Bombers this is something that computers haven't been able to help us with yet but we'd like to because we'd like to be able to respond more quickly we know humans can do this task because when these images were released after they had reconstructed that these were the people but they still hadn't identified them the Friends of the of the tsarnaev brothers recognize them in these photos and then proceeded to destroy evidence so we know humans can do these tasks but we can't yet deploy computers to do these tasks for us and the place where computers always win is in scale so what happened here is basically analysts humans sat down and looked at all these images and tried to make sense of them at the point at which we can recreate those abilities in a machine then it's just a matter of spinning up more servers and more computers so there's a huge possibility for both good and bad coming out of these new technologies so I would argue given the fact that brains are still so far ahead of computers there's a huge opportunity here to go back to the brain for inspiration so it's a little bit like a reverse engineering expedition if a rival company released a product and you didn't know how it worked but you wanted to know how it worked you would buy one and you'd open up the box in this case Nature has released the product and we're gonna go and we're going to reverse-engineer it and this is this wonderful nexus of computational neuroscience so here we have a brain an incredible parallel computer on the order of a hundred billion neurons each each of which is a tiny computer in two unto itself connecting between those order 100 hundred billion neurons are a hundred trillion connections between them enormous enormous parallelism and yet this this device this artifact this thing in our head only dissipates about 20 watts of energy so that's 220 watts of power so that's comparable to your laptop charger and yet it can do on the order depending on how you do your rough back-of-the-envelope calculation at least petaflop s-- of compute power so this is an amazing organ and if we could understand it we could build things that have never been built before so I study vision and I think vision is a great way to illustrate some of what's hard and what's exciting and interesting about machine learning and machine intelligence so if I show an image to all of you I flash that up and instantly everyone can recognize what the what the image is you may not have been to this place you may not be able to tell me where it is but you could probably tell me things like what time of year was it and which way is the wind blowing and you know what would it feel like if you touch the wall of that building likewise if I show you another image in this case this Camel even if you haven't been to the Gobi Desert and you haven't seen it back during camel you can instantly recognize what this is you didn't have to exert any effort and you could probably even tell me things like what it would sound like to walk on the ground what it would sound like under your feet as it crunched and what's so amazing about this is there's this enormous diversity of different objects in the world but there's a real problem a real hard problem in interpreting images so if we have a particular object in the world in this case an object I happen to care quite a bit about this is my daughter you can see her a presumably you haven't seen my daughter before but here she is her name is Teresa but if I show you another picture of her in a completely different view different lighting different position different pose you everyone can still recognize that this is the same person now at a pixel level those images have almost nothing to do with each other there's very little in common there's the histograms of the colors are different the lighting is different everything is different about these images and in fact we can even recognize these objects when there are highly unusual views and high levels of occlusion somehow our visual systems are allowing us to do this so even though any given object in the world can cast infinitely many different images we somehow know how to map the checked labels onto the objects we look at it turns out that the converse is true as well so I just said that any given object can cast infinitely many different images onto the retina but it's also true that any given image on that comes into your I can cat can correspond to infinitely many different objects so if we look at this object here it looks like some ramps and anyone have an idea what's going on here anyone say magnets magnets so it turns out that this is a optical illusion and what optical illusions are are cases where our visual system breaks down because of this hard ill-posed nature of the problem of interpreting the sensory world so it turns out that that's just one accidental view of a scene that looks like a ramp that goes up to the top but in fact it's relying on this sort of this property that that actually in real life any given image could be infinitely many different things that you're looking at so somehow your visual system has managed to figure out a way to get around this your brain has figured out how to get around these problems the other problem is that our sensory worlds incredibly complex now we generally don't feel like we have to work hard when we walk around and see we just see and it seems effortless but if you actually look at the images we have to deal with on a daily basis they're incredibly incredibly busy incredibly complicated and in many cases the information that's necessary for us to solve a task it doesn't actually even exist in the image so if we look across the street in this crowded street scene we're aware that there are people in that scene but if we zoom in a little bit and then just mask out one of those faces that you were able to see you can see actually there's no information in the pixels of the image to tell you that that was actually a person what's happening is your visual systems incorporating all of this contextual information and basically making you hallucinate the impression that you're seeing faces when in fact there's no real information there so this amazing ability to take this incredibly complicated incredibly cluttered incredibly busy world and integrate everything and and even build up things that aren't there is really what our brain excels at and this is what computers aren't yet good at so what we want to do is go to the brain and ask how can how does the brain solve this and one way to get very clear picture of how hard this problem is is to actually try and teach computers to do problems that brains know how to do so if we look at this picture of the Statue this is the second most photographed statue in the world John Harvard the first one is the Statue of Liberty and if we actually just zoom in on the face sorry zoom in on the face and then just rear nth as the the values the actual numerical values of the luminance at each pixel this is basically what a computer has to deal with so this gives you a little bit of a sense that we have to somehow teach a computer to treat this with the sort of facility that we are able to ingest information from the sensory world so how does the visual system work how can we draw inspiration from vision well so an image comes in photons reach the eye and then though their transducin to electrical activity by a tissue called the retina which is on the back of the eyeball goes through the optic nerve to the brain which is a massively parallel computer made up of on the order of a hundred billion elements so each neuron is itself basically a tiny little computer that takes in inputs integrates them and produces outputs and then within the brain there's actually an interesting structure of organization so if we look at the flow of visual information it first goes to the back of the brain to an area called v1 and then progressively is transformed again and again in hierarchical fashion throughout the brain and what we do when we try and build artificial systems that work the same way is to draw inspiration from the architecture and structure of the brain and then build our official systems that mimic that structure and just the same way that the natural brain has neurons which are tiny little computers the artificial brain then has mathematical functions that can then progressively transform and understand the image that they're looking at so there's a problem in that today's computers are much less computationally powerful than the brain so an easy solution to that today is instead of dealing with any single computer basically what we do is we assemble large clusters of computers so we and others build these these huge clusters of arrays of computers to try and tackle this problem and you may have heard occasionally stories like there's a group at IBM that claimed a few years ago that they had assembled enough computational power to simulate a cat but it turns out that the computational powers assembly in the computational power isn't really the problem we have in 2015 or 2016 I should say you know it's sort of like saying you have you know assemble aluminum and some bolts and you got an airplane if somebody told me that they had assembled enough aluminum and bolts to build an airplane and they wanted me to get in the airplane I don't think I would I don't think I would go for it until I at least saw the plane fly so really we're in the same boat with this this cat so until we see if we actually have a system that has comparable complexity to a brain they can actually do the things of rain does that's really the goal and that's where we need to go back to biology to actually understand the machine and understand how it works so the sort of third countervailing force which is really changing the way everything works now is that we actually for the first time in a long time have really powerful tools for interrogating biological systems to actually go in and reverse engineer that brain so I'm just gonna walk you through a few examples and then some of our speakers are gonna go into deep dives around their own techniques that they've pioneered so we can wiretap neurons increasingly so what you see on the left is an image of a sharp metal electrode that's been inserted into the brain and then the black sort of sort of tree-like structures are individual neurons and the tip of that electrode is on the order of 20 microns twenty thousandth of a millimeter and you can actually go and place the electrode close to the cell and listen to the activity of the cell and this has been bread-and-butter technique that we've had for many many decades in neuroscience but increasingly now driven by this confluence of different industrial technologies that are taking off like micro machining we can now build these intensely dense array so the middle image is a 17 micron thin silicon machined shank that has tiny iridium electrode pads on it and now we can shrink huge amounts of electrode contacts into very very small areas which lets us record from large numbers of neurons at one time on the on the right as an example of technology that when my students in my lab is working on with carbon fiber electrodes they're about five microns in diameter so five thousandths of a millimeter they're actually hard to see with the naked eye anymore and what we can do is we can snake tons and tons of these things into the brain and be able to sort of wiretap lots of neurons at the same time to give us clues about how the brain works in addition increasingly molecular technologies are also coming to the party so a technology called optogenetics it was developed by Karl Deisseroth and Stanford and ed Boyden here at MIT allows us to basically insert a genetic on/off switch into neurons so that when you shine light on the neuron it will either fire or stop firing and again these tools give us increased experimental access so that if we want to understand how a brain works we finally start to have the tools to make that happen and then finally we also have the ability to use optical and genetic technologies to listen to actually watch the brain in action so on the Left I have a picture of a two-photon microscope which is in my lab and in combination with the genetically engineered virus that has a protein that literally lights up when the cell is more active we can actually watch thoughts happening so this is sort of raw unfiltered data each one of those little light dots is a neuron in a rat's brain while it's awake and you're watching this rat have a thought so it's it's watching an object it's perceiving that object and that's what its brain is doing while this is happening so we have unprecedented access to the function of neurons for the first time you know you know since the dawn of neuroscience and increasing we also have access now to the anatomy so this is an image from Jeff Lichtman who will speak later today this is an electron microscope image so basically what happens here is you have an electron beam and you scan it across the tissue and you can image with very very small pixels so these are four nanometer pixels and what you can do then is take these giant you know many many slices of these very very high resolution images and then use those to reconstruct the wiring diagram and this is sonic labyrinth in is produced by a collaboration between Jeff and the hans-peter who you just just met so increasingly now we have the ability to interrogate function we have the ability to get the wiring diagram and now all we need to do is just put it together so this is an especially upper opportunity time as well because the government both industry and government are now stepping up to make this happen I think there's a recognition that the time is right now to drive forward a moonshot expedition to really move the needle on our understanding of the brain and in particular jacob vogelstein from i arpa who I'm filling in for at the moment if he were here he could have had a chance to tell you about this program that he's just launched which just started last week it's called microns machine intelligence from cortical networks and the goal of this project is to bring together an unprecedented array of scientist from machine learning experts data scientists high-performance computing experts together with neuroanatomists neurophysiologists and computational neuroscientists and modelers and bring them all together to do a large focused effort to really figure out once and for all how the brain works and we've been privileged to be a part of this program so we are launching our team at harvard and conduction with MIT andreas toliets who's also speaking the afternoon is on a rival team so he'll be able to tell you about what what they're up to and it's an incredibly exciting time to be at this intersection so with that we have an amazing group of people assembled we have John Leonard who's a roboticist who's going to tell you about navigation and self-driving cars from the perspective of a computer scientist and roboticist we have Francesco Rossi who is going to tell us about interactions between humans and artificial intelligences and then in the afternoon session we're going to hear for some neuroscientists who are on the leading edge of their respective fields Jeff Lichtman who is basically pioneering connectomics this idea that you can trace the wiring diagram of a neural circuit and really understand it Nancy kanwisher an expert on the human brain because while many of our early efforts have to do with animals ultimately we want to extend and think about the human as well and finally andreas toe leus who is a physiologist and very computationally savvy who is trying to understand the function of cortical networks so with that I will close and if anyone has any questions I can entertain those thank you somebody have a mic so there there are some mic runners who are around okay it's not our experience with computers but isn't there a significant chemical aspect to that to the to the workings and the end the function functioning and malfunctioning of the brain absolutely absolutely so brains operate over many timescales and they use lots of different tools to do their jobs so the the communication between neurons the firing of neurons is an electrical phenomenon but you're right there are many chemical processes both within the cell and between cells at synapses that are critically important you know cells can have memory they can change themselves this is how we learn is we remodel synapses and that's fundamentally a molecular process that's happening the great thing is that many of our technologies today and you'll hear about some of these also are able to target you know the chemical inner workings of these cells so as we move to a point where we can understand the brain at an algorithmic level we can start to parse apart which parts of the chemistry and molecular life of a cell are important to the sort of algorithm and which ones are so just important to the regular housekeeping of the cell but absolutely people are thinking about how the how to how to model how to think about those sort of chemical processes and brains yes we're warming up the mic runners so you gave a very nice analogy when you presented the statue of John Harvard and showed us what a machine looks at and and then I you went the next hierarchical level which is we have access to the physiology meaning on and off switches in the neurons so that leap that goes from you know identifying something like a picture an image you mentioned that was a great challenge and I assume the same could be said from the arrangement of you know the physiological correlates of thoughts and so on so how do you envision you know we see the same from a vision but also in the brain the the mechanical aspects and how they translate into thoughts or functionality right how do you envision that we will move from these very basic information which is numbers or on and off switches right in the sense that there may be multiple functions that have the same correlates in the rain as you have mentioned with images right yes so I just just wanted what you have where you envision as the pathway or the strategy to sort of go from but I just yeah so so I mean I think one of the things that you'll find in this symposium today is the the key to moving forward on the all of this is collaboration and multidisciplinarity so the process of understanding what's going on in the brain requires data science it requires high performance computing and requires computer scientists to help understand and to parse the data to even know what it means to look at a and understand how it maps to the external world but then meanwhile you also need the computer scientists come in and give you a model and give you hypotheses that you can test and you need physiologists and you need an animus to give you the data to sort of constrain that so I think it's these cyclical loops and my hope is by the end of today you'll have a much much richer sense of the kinds of things all these different ways where computer science can help neuroscience and neuroscience can help computer science and back and forth and around to to Freud to radios and now computers do you think that we're right to stick with computers now or do you think maybe that the technology you know a hundred years from now will be radically different from computers of today and that will be the more appropriate analogy yeah so if one of the things that people get tripped up I think with when they compare computers and brains is this idea that you need to make a literal analogy to physical parts of the computer so one common thing is you think oh I wish I could add more memory to my brain the way I add more RAM to my computer but it turns out that as you know the the brain is not organized that way actually memory is distributed and colo-colo all throughout the brain so it's a very different architecture so I think comparing brains to computers like comparing my brain to this laptop is not the right way to look at things but what's in common comes from this this other use of the word computer right so computer science is about computing it's about algorithms it's about computing machines it's about reasoning about systems that are able to perform computation and that transcends details of the of the hardware so you could imagine that we can build neuromorphic hardware hardware that looks like the brain that tries to copy the structure of the brain and that might be one way to build machines that are intelligent but that might not be necessary computing gives us a sort of a rosetta stone a key by which we can translate an algorithm on any computing platform to any other computing platform so today we don't build you know the most successful machine learning algorithms don't you neuromorphic hardware that looks like the brain they use traditional harbor in fact they use graphics cards which is a bit of a strange turn in the last five years - in a way they weren't originally intended to be used to simulate the important parts what we think the important parts of those algorithms are so I think the durable thing even if we're in the future and we have computers that we can't comprehend today the the actual theoretical formal connection between computers and brains is going to be something that's going to be durable for all time basically and at some point we start wondering what will computers look like and certainly there is one path where they start looking a lot more like us and then we start asking questions about how do we live in a world where our computers are comparable to us or work the same way as us or perhaps we start blending blurring the lines between us and our devices we already blur our lines between us and our devices at least at dinnertime with wit with our devices but I I think we can as we understand the brain more and more and more that lines gonna get blurrier and blurrier an analogy can be made between organisms and organizations so in an organism cells delegate some of the information processing through a central module of the brain and and subsidize the brain energetically but in social organizations like companies or State individual cells the people delegate some of the information processing but they also subsidize the virtual brain so the question is what can we learn from the brains of organizations and are we trying to learn yeah that's a fantastic question so one of the things that is remarkable about humans in particular but many other species as well if you've ever seen an ant colony at work a lot of simple brains that are coming together and producing amazing emergent behaviors that extend beyond what any single individual can do I think one of the things that's wonderful about neuroscience and also about computer science because computer science is savvy to this idea of multiple scales of analysis I think one of the most interesting things in neuroscience is the sense in which we have hierarchies of organizations of scale where we find the same problems coming up over and over and over again but being solved in different ways so the insides of a cell everything is small enough that molecules can move around on reasonable timescales by diffusion so there's no need to have bioelectrical signals moving around within a cell's close enough that you can just produce a molecule let it move over there and interact and if you look at the field of systems biology which has grown up around the science same time as systems neuroscience you see people talking about networks you see people talking about you know sort of the same sorts of dynamics and dynamical networks that we talked about one layer up in neuroscience and we're just on the edge now where I think we're starting to get to the point where we can start contemplating you know making those bridges even higher and people are so social psychologists but also people who work you know people who work at Twitter who are trying to understand network dynamics the very same algorithms the very same mathematical objects graphs are absolutely at work and the same tools can all sort of vibe off of each other and fundamentally what's happening is the same underlying problems in nature need to be solved and the solution comes at a different scale so so thinking more broadly like that I think that's a very interesting and I think it's a prescient question that in the future we're gonna start thinking more and more about how swarms of robots say and there are people here at Harvard who work on these kinds of problems can work together and how knowing what we know about the brain can help influence how we think about organizations and so on and so forth so I think that's yet another frontier which is incredibly exciting yes one more question yeah question I'm thinking about the brain-in-a-vat concept because brains and computers they're great analogy but brains do not exist in vacuum they're embedded in our bodies and I think bodies are very important to the brain function so I just wonder what are your thoughts about this yeah it's it's certainly like my body it's it's like having it ya know we exist in a context this gets a little bit into this question of you know we exist in a social context we exist computation is done by parts of our body that aren't our brains a muscle fiber averages impulses coming in and and can integrate you know so there's a lot more to computation in the brain and as a full organism than just our brains though the brain is the thing that's unlocked that that complexity that allows us to do very complicated things with our bodies an interesting thing to ask is if as we move into an era where you know Google and Facebook are making amazing strides and artificial intelligences what will their bodies look like do they have a body does that make sense you can't do anything to the world without some sort of a body but what does that look like it doesn't have to look like our bodies so those poor helpless falling robots which are so adorable and I feel so bad for them as they fall they they don't they have they they're mimicking our bipedal physiology but they don't have to you don't have to have eyes that see visible light the Google car has a laser scanner which is effectively an eye one of the things that's interesting about thinking about computing and neuroscience going forward is we aren't constrained by evolution anymore this body was evolved on the African savannah to do a very particular set of tasks one of the ways that compute artificial intelligences can win without even having to beat us in sort of capacity and compute ability is simply by just having different constraints I mean we have a hard time doing simple things like not eating too much but if you have an artificial intelligence you can set the rules for how it behaves and what effectors it has and what senses it has it can be adapted to entirely new environments you know you could have a artificial intelligence of machine intelligence that has MRI scanners for eyes and it just grew up learning how to read MRR images so we get to a very interesting and weird and and potentially wonderful potentially scary world where we can we can really change the course of of how things have evolved so with that I think I'm gonna let John take over thank you and John is talk about robotics and navigation and self-driving cars thank you
