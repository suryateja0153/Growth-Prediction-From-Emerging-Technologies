 we're here at Manchester university's computer science department with Professor Steve Ferber as Steve is the ICL professor of computer engineering but she was also one of the designers of the BBC micros hardware and the ARM chip after that which of course we have in our mobile phones and in the Raspberry Pi and chaired the Royal Society's shutdown or restart report on computing in schools which I think many see as one of the key documents in the curriculum change that we've seen over the last few years Steve thank you ever so much for bringing us down here into the spinnaker machine room so this machine uses our large number of these arm chips what is it what is it going to do spinnaker is a massively parallel computer and designed principally for modeling the brain in real time components of brain the whole brain is still much to make a job for any modern computer and the machine we see behind me here is the large spinning machine accessible on mar 22nd 2016 that this includes half a million ARM processor cores in each corner model several hundred euros up to a thousand of class so with this machine we can potentially model up to 500 million euros 500 billion and it runs in real time so we can interface it to robotic systems to give you an idea of scale and a mouse brain is about 100 million euros so one have here is cable modeling a network of the complexity of the mouse ray but the human brain is a thousand times so worried one of those cabinets to a little robotic mass how would that differ from an actual mass if we have a big mouse brain and we connected it mouse either probably a versatile robotic our scarce they're very difficult to make a practice then increase from what we expect is to be able to reproduce the behavior of aerial maps now that's a huge jump yeah there's a lot we don't know about the details mouse-brain and of course on spinnaker we're running somewhat simplified models so on your online is a simpler or detail pathology we don't know that's a patient with but the hope is that with you could begin to see some of the relationships between the gray we have this big computational thinking idea of abstraction where we went to one side some of the complexity of the problem what would you be done with that simplification from how a neuron works to how your modeling neurons in spinnaker the kind of abstraction we're implementing in spinnaker is we're abstracting away most of the physical structure most physical details and we're using what to call point your arms so we treat neuron is existing the single point in space all the inputs come in to that point then the output goes out to other neurons so it's quite a well except in abstraction but of course it is losing aspects of biological rivers now some of those we can put back in because I'm your own model is programming software it's very flexible and you don't have the right cute engine let's implement the fully detailed biological models of the sort of the Henry mark of my students the brain projects and we are wrong computer but we cannot end key bits of detail so for example if you wish to have a model that represented the different branches of the dendritic tree where the inputs connect you can do that on spinnaker the current model don't do that that's a possible extension so what can you do with spinnaker but you couldn't do with a more traditional sort of computer architecture spinnakers great advantage over conventional computers even lions very expensive supercomputers is in the way we implement communication neurons are highly connected and they communicate just by sending very simple messages they basically go ping to each other every so often and there's no information in the size or shape of the pain it's merely it's tiny and so effectively every time a new line goes pink in this machine we're sending about one bit of information around now a conventional machine has communication system that's optimized for sending quite a large package kilobytes of data but sending a single bitty the kilobyte packet is very so in spinnaker we've made the communications extremely lightweight and flexible and we send one bit I think many teachers struggle to understand how computers work at the hardware layer and perhaps struggle even more to explain those ideas to their students what model should have 14 year old have of how a computer actually works and what's the best way for a teacher to explain that I think it's useful for everybody to have a very basic understanding of the standard computer model which is the idea that you have a memory and you have an engine the process is the memory and you have a connection between the two of them and I think some some feeling for the level at which the engine the central processor unit operates is also useful what does an instruction do at the Machine level because most of the time you program computers in a high level language where you have quite abstract concepts which we know the computer grinds down into basic instructions and so to know that an instruction does something such as read a memory location and transfer the value to a register and then add two registers together and then store the register back I think everybody should have the least of conceptual understanding that that's what the machine is doing at its core I several times a year i give a school's lecture which is aimed at sixth formers on computers and brains and what I try and do there is in fact described the computer of that level and describe the brain at the level a neural network and try and contrast find the similarities but also the differences between the two information processing systems so thinking about spinnaker does the way we think about algorithms or the way we think about programming have to change when we're working with that sort of massively parallel architecture we have this event driven model which means that we write programs in a slightly different style but we use standard languages and the coding is standard but I think for most spinnaker users they don't want to think about the machine of that level at all and they want to think about the machine is basically a large graph solving engine the graph may be a neural network or it may be a Bayesian network or it may be some more abstract Network representation of a problem that you really want to think about your problem as a very large network of relatively simple processes that interact by passing simple messages to each other and if you can conceive of your program in that way then spinnaker can probably support it quite effectively yeah can you give you an example of something which where event-driven programming would would be an easy approach to take and event-driven programming is is the standard model for a lot of real-time systems so if you if you look at the engine management system in your car and it has very strict real time constraints it has to know the exact position of the crankshaft know when all the Pistons are coming to the appropriate point to emit a spark and then it has to look at the table so well it will receive information about the state of the engine as events and then you will have to Talam itself very carefully to produce the spike the smoke at the right time for that particular cylinder as on lots of real time systems are characteristically event-driven at that level and this this is perhaps a somewhat alien model for many conventional programmers who sit at a desk top writing out a long algorithm on the other hand if what you are doing on the desktop is writing a computer game again you've got to their real time in mind that you have to generate frames on the screen at a rate that's required to make the scene progress realistically and so there you've got to understand real time constraints as one if spinnaker or perhaps spinnaker successor manages to replicate to emulate that the structure of a brain do you think a mind will emerge will the machine be able to think would it become conscious these are very deep questions the philosophical nature to which we don't currently know answer I think the majority of neuro scientists that I talked to would say yes if you if you build a structure that's functionally equivalent in the brain then you'd expect those characteristics to emerge because this is controversial and for example Roger Penrose in his book the emperor's new mind argues that this kind of model that will never be sufficient to display consciousness and that you need something above and beyond the kind of Newtonian physics that we're modeling here he suggests that's something beyond maybe quantum effects in the neurons I don't know many neuroscientists who who accept his argument but there is at least room for debate and the way we'll find out is by building lease yes and seeing what happens do you have a viewed what right mind you expect we'll have my view is that the Newtonian model seems to seems to explain a surprising number of phenomena which look complex but when you build the right model they they kind of happen automatically as a result of the physics of the model and and that seems to work very well for simpler things so there are very nice simple models of how an insight walks the look and the insect motion looks complicated but actually the explanation is quite simple and my instinct is that that will probably continue to be true but of course consciousness is such a subjective phenomenon in such a mystery that the to extend insect walking to consciousness is an unreasonably large leave for our current state of knowledge for my generation the BBC micro had a huge impact on our appreciation of computing personally I use them in school I do have my own level in computer studies done on BBC micros I had one of these at home how could we best take the Hat legacy forward what should we be doing around can that sort of computing platform in schools these days well I think the the changes in curriculum that have been coming through since 2014 are important step in the right direction I think we need to encourage pupils of school to feel that they can be not only users of technology but also creators I mean that was almost the mission statement for the Royal Society report and that we need to feel we own the technology and we can influence it and we can create better technology and so I'd really like to see that movement continued and evolve perhaps for the future an important way were to take it would be to encourage pupils to think about programming multi-core devices because computers in the future are going to be similar to spin again they're going to have many many processes and and and that's a new way of thinking for all programmers and I think the best encouragement is to start an early and simple programming languages like scratch how that sort of event driven model they're available if teachers introduce those ideas and yes an approach programming in that sort of parenthetical scratches is a very good tool for introducing pupils very early to programming concepts without even realizing your programming I think that's great yes and and with the kind of work we're doing with spinnaker with neural networks I think they're going to be increased in the important industries getting very excited that's a deep networks and it will be really encouraging to find some ways to get school children involved in spinnaker perhaps programming the machine from the classroom finally talking about the Royal Society's report which you chaired I think most of us are pretty glad that the decisions shutdown or restart came down in favor of restart but over the last four years what surprised you about the way computing in school has moved on following your recommendations there well I'm stupid I'm always somewhat surprised that when that kind of report by the Royal Society does actually appear to carry influence and a change did happen as a result I was very pleased of course and and and to be balanced it wasn't simply the Royal Society report that instigated the change at very much the same time as there was the Livingston hope report that was sponsored by Nestor and possibly even more influential was the MacTaggart lecture by Eric Schmidt the chief of Google who was also quite critical of the stages of computing in British schools I think these three things together were sufficient persuade the government that the change was necessary I was quite encouraged that the ones the change got underway that the Royal Society of report was probably seen as the most authoritative reference to guide the way the change went and so that that really felt like the time we spent on the report was well spent yes I'm always surprised when things I have a role in how some carries an influence am I supposed to say that but the things that you've done have at such huge impact on what we did what's happened with computing education in school you know thinking back to the BBC micro dates and what's happened since then so one yes with a lot of us it's serendipities being in a right place at the right time I mean I think when we started on the BBC micro project in the BBC were confidently telling acorn that on the back of this series of programs they should expect to sell about 12,000 machine so now you know that was the estimate and across the 12,000 turned out to be a hundred times larger one to one-and-a-half million winners nobody anticipated the wave of interest and that emerged in the early 80s that the BBC micro was a part of but no again it wasn't the only machine and Sinclair sold even more machines and an acorn I like to think BBC micro was was quite influential in establishing a sort of quality baseline and a lot of people I've met since who cuts that program in teeth in that era hmm same as the BBC micro that was the machine that brought mint programming and influenced the rest of their careers that's asking most of these things you don't realize this is what you're doing at the time you're doing it it's just the machine just turned out to have this big influence firstly further thank you so much for your time this afternoon thank you thank you very much don't miss out on computing at schools great content here on youtube
