 hi I'm Chris and we're talking today about the work that we were doing a big collaboration between lbl easily ucsf using them deepen embracing no networks for neuroscience but for their analytic tools and as brain computer interfaces and so the generation in the vast array of speech sounds they all produce are accompanied by the precise and rapid coordination of the book craig articulate errs for example prediction of the soundbar it could is produced by the position of the lips dubbed by the front tons of the bath talk mouth and God by the back of the tongue through from the mouth to understand how the human brain produces these sounds we conducted studies in nurse surgical patients implanted with a mcgriddle electrode directly on the cortical surface this is a grid of about 88 electrodes on the part of the brain that controls the vocal tract here are some example directed neural recordings from the cortical surface don't da ba Ganga only thing I want you to pick away from this leathers am especially in town Poli kala kala parent of activity that are partially overlapping between these different sounds but also distinct between these different sounds now we wanted to invest a deep learning as a tool for understanding the nervous system the one why I think this is a good idea because you know neurol activations are nonlinear as are the processing always in these in these networks also deep net dddd panera's can learn you know by the detonation d presentations however we are in the room the regime a relatively small data we're scientists not machine learning guys so we don't have ten quadrillion examples of em next we have on the order of a thousand samples and that's that particular case in experimental science so i'm going to go over this list but the car who actually did this who just asked question jst we use every trick in the book to get these networks time to work and particularly used on building high provider organization to authorize all these properties of the network the basic results are as follows so with these networks were able to classify our speed sounds with very good actually impacts day of the art here we're looking at the raw a classically actly for constant it's bowled over chance the chance to be different in different categories and information transfer rate in bit in bits per second this is for con one of the 19 continents this is for the three vowels most interestingly we find that the our ability to classify speech sounds with largest or its greatest when we look at all 57 Causton valves ovals unproduced we were able to get up to a three times over chance for us we are we interpret this as that speech is not reached control is not just a concatenation of these indirect tokens but is instead of fact i smooth the trajectory to the phoneme sequence to gain more insight into the data we could look at the confusion matrices on that night that the network is making he was looking at the young completely the confusions with that between the targets of all that i was actually produced and what the network said was produced if it was perfect it just be a blast line along that diagonal here we see that net narath made errors but there's clear block diagonal structure to do this matrix indeed we will describe apply a hierarchical clustering to this data set we observed a rich hierarchical organization of phoning pictures that was a that was linguistically meaningful i go over the details of this mega of this hierarchy vapor time but suffice it to say say it kind of agrees with some of the results that syria on talk or do not quite yet trying to talk about in the sense that the features that would correspond to the largest eigen values of the beta matrix has the Lorelei I talk and you can kind of go down on the hierarchy in that way now moving forward we won't have move away from this categorical description of speech production and gold for a continuous replication here why we're doing is the sum of days I collected in the clinic this was a woman that was again implanted within our regular electrodes and we were very graciously allowed us to paint her lips and kind of do this high rocky horror picture private videos with this day and just got straight up dumbass Leonard decoders we can have be cold quite welcome mathematics update the lips so we'd like to kind of do is to use spiking around our common filters to college track the movement of those are dictators well in real time just a superficial that we can do this we have implemented just a very simple sweating real narrow common filter track a cannonball this is called following the work that was done that done it's done the down of Stanford a while back the long the shorter is that you see that all these lines are overlapping but I'm quite tightly spiritually the are spiking neural network common filter is tracking the Z trajectory of this bow cannibal quite well what we like to go and then do is use no more quick hardware such as the IBM true north ship toward a low-power real time normal rate computing system for being clear interfaces where the unload our is really critical right we can't be toting around as to a computer behind behind us everyone have a real break of your interface our strategy is to first do a classification across broad categories and then define specific trackers that will Kyle predict the movement of Arctic leaders with high resolution as it turns out the brain and Lord and the Large Hadron Collider are pretty similar in the following sense so one of the big challenges that that is proposed by this big machine is to track the you know what the the the the millions millions of particles that are that I will be produced by these various collaborations and basic strategy that we can imagine taking is I can do a classifier than track paper I'm going to approach a gig in with no power computing hardware and with that I'll conclude I like to think people that actually did the work Jessie Lavinia is a graduate student I'll use the beef with all the deep learning work and then I'm powerless refrigerator up at albina now who did spike known or color filter and every chain is the neurosurgeon and UCSF collect the data thank you thank you
