 [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] I'm going to start and just remind people a little bit and what DNA is DNA is the hard drive the memory in every cell of every living organism that has the instructions for how to make that self but it's a chemical molecule it's not magic it's not special it's it's in fact four different kinds of molecules that can be stuck together in a chain a larger molecule that is a chain and you can put those four in any order and if you can read that back you have a sequence of characters if you want to think of it like a digital code you can see on the right is a little representation of what those four molecules are in the middle of the famous double helix structure that nature uses to store a sequence of them stabili in every cell but if you read out the information that's there it's just like a ticker-tape of letters each one being one of the four possibilities and there's three billion of those and that mere 3 billion letters defines your genome and all the instructions to make a living human or a living ant or yeast or or any organism you can imagine it's sort of like this but it's incredibly small we have a big data revolution in genomics and this this next slide illustrates why that's happened 10 years ago the cost of sequencing a genome of one person or one living organism was about the same as the price of this which is famously the most expensive house in London and ten years later the cost of sequencing that one genome was the price of this which is a season ticket to see Arsenal Football Club which is one of the top UK clubs and in another 10 years you know the cost will be the cost of going to watch one terrible club play one game so the prices is plummeting and so scientists are very excited and they do more and more genome sequencing and then after they've done that and they've done their experiments they want to keep the data safe and unfortunately that's where my job comes into it because they send that data via Intuit Internet to my Institute the European of my informatics Institute and they ask us to store that information so we at my our PR people give me a picture of mountain and a graph and I don't even know which graph it is because all our graphs just go up exponentially so that that's one of the databases or maybe all of the databases we have a 60 petabyte storage system now that we're filling up it's it's nearly full and that gives us a bit of a headache under how we go about storing that data because our budget does not go up exponentially and but if you'd like to put pressure on someone you know to give us more funding please do so we buy more and more computer servers and more and more hard disk drives to store this information and we have headaches doing this how do you increase capture exponentially increasing data and serve it back to the whole world on a essentially flat budget why'd you store the data do people really care well people really do care and we just have a little live demo what we have here this is in real-time showing you the hits on our website we have about 100 times more hits on our website than CERN does on theirs this is the people in real-time using the website if anyone's got a smartphone in there quick hit this QR code or that URL there and if we're lucky we'll see Davos light up I don't know if that will work probably your phones might not be registered as appearing in Davos but we get you know thousands of hits a minute millions of hits a month one thing we realized is that all this information we're storing you know it's about DNA but the DNA we're storing information about is a digital storage medium it's a sequence of well not zeros and ones like in your computers and smartphones but a sequence of a discrete alphabet and for letters and if we could manipulate the some DNA we could put a message in there ourselves and we could use DNA to store it DNA is a really good way of storing information it's been used for hundreds of millions of years on life on earth evolving has used that as it's hard disk drive maybe we could use that so we devised an experiment to see if this was a feasible way of archiving and storing information one of the things we needed to do was decide what information to store and and what kind of code to use so we had to invent a code that would store information we didn't just want to store information about genes and processes in a living body we wanted to store any kind of digital information just as your computer and your phone your iPod can do there's various problem we had to overcome we can't make very long pieces of DNA as humans yet so we had to invent a code that could make a message out of many short fragments of DNA we had to devise a code that could store any information we have to be aware of problems that would come and errors that might occur in the writing or the reading of that information just like digital TV transmission or mobile phones have error correction in them so we devised the code that would do that we pick some bits of information some information to store we thought what would be high-value information you'd want to store a long time in a DNA format maybe the the poem the sonnets of William Shakespeare 154 sonnets as a text file we put as you're not the picture of Martin Luther King but a excerpt from his I have a dream speech which I hope [Applause] [Music] [Music] so I want to emphasize not not a transcript of what he said the actual recording of what he said in an mp3 format recorded into our DNA code written into pieces of DNA because we're molecular biologists at heart a PDF copy of the Watson and Crick paper from 1953 describing the the helix structure of DNA in living cells and we encoded those and we had that made into DNA by the Agilent company in California and it came in a test tube exactly like that one it wasn't nearly fully in fact when it arrived on my and my opened the box up and I held it up and I thought something had gone wrong because it was empty and my more skilled molecular biology friends had to explain to me that that tiny smudge of dry dust sticking to the bottom of the tube was the actual DNA and it was a tiny tiny speck if the whole thing was full we would have a petabyte of information in there and that's hard to imagine what's something the size of your finger with a petabyte of information is so in other terms I've just pasted out the size of the stage and by my calculations if you laid out cd-roms all over the stage you get about a thousand of them on here if you did that a thousand deep so it'd be up to about here somewhere this whole stage this deep in CDs right that's a petabyte so you can either have that much information stored in that format or something the size of your finger in DNA so it's really compact us way earlier on I reminded you that DNA is very small and we devise our entire experiment from information on the top left on my computer my laptop computer we sent that to Agilent in California they synthesized the DNA for us they sent it back by courier thank you FedEx came back it came back to us in Cambridge we did a bit of creation in fact it went over to our German laboratories because that's where we have our sequencing facility it was read in a DNA sequencing machine exactly the same as used for human genomics or or any genomics experiments around the world and we've recreated the computer files back on my laptop and it doesn't make for a very good image but they come out exactly the same they weren't just similar every single bit every single zero everyone was correctly reproduced so we have essentially a proof of principle that we don't just have to marvel at the way nature has evolved a system for storing information in DNA in every living being but we can use a very similar kind of system and use the same chemical molecule that's so good for storing information I have a few sciency bits but I'm always wound like Stephen Hawking said had have no equations and I should probably have no graphs but like I can't resist we did various studies in order to get our scientific paper published what I'm showing on the Left that I don't expect anyone to fully understand in the one minute I'm going to devote to it is the fact that for the size of our experiment our coding system is reasonably efficient and works quite well as you store more and more information there's some technical issues you have to deal with about how you reconstitute that information and it gets marginally less efficient and we were asked would it still be viable to larger amounts of data and what we showed is that from our experiment which is sort of on the left-hand side of the graph over to all the information on any device on the entirety of planet Earth we're still pretty efficient that's what the three zettabytes data point represents and we remain adequately efficient even up to many many orders of magnitude more information so basically it does scale up quite well but if you want an easier image to take home with you you could get all the information in the whole world encoded in a DNA format in the back of one and for Americans in one SUV and for the English in the back of one is state car so you don't need many many data centers all over the world all that much information in principle would fit in one vehicle can we get the information back out well we can do that that's pretty efficient that's what this this this revolution in DNA sequencing technology that's brought you the season ticket priced genome has brought I have actually the latest devices looked like that actually I have a slightly more up-to-date one here that can go around the room this device could sequence while they're sort of there in beta testing at the moment but within month people will be able to sequence a whole genome in in a day or so I'm very happy to go around the room but I do need it to come back to me at the end the one on the screen has a USB plug which would plug straight into your computer and they had admit they couldn't actually design that but it does come with the USB cable to plug it directly into your computer or maybe your smartphone we can read DNA sequences that pretty quickly that's not the problem we can make lots and lots of copies of them that's really easy it's it's actually better than a photocopy or a photocopier you have to run it once every time you want to wait one more copy copying DNA is really easy and it works exponentially quickly you start with one and you make two copies from those two you can make four and you don't need a different machine for every one of those it's just one very standard piece of laboratory equipment can very rapidly grow exponentially many copies of what you started with so copying it is not the problem once I have my message I can distribute it to all of you very easily but writing that in the first place is very difficult humans are not good yet at writing the first new copy of DNA once we have one we can make more copies of it but making that first one is difficult this is a 4 this is agilent's facility in in Palo Alto they need a cleanroom they need a very very complicated machine a bit like a laser an inkjet printer but more complicated and it's slow and it takes a while this is very much the rate-limiting step in the procedure we're working on with at the moment and it takes too long and it's very expensive so the idea of having all the information in the back of one vehicle if there isn't enough money on earth at the moment to do that so I want to finish off with some ideas about why this is a good thing to do and depending on your age you will recognize or not recognize some of these but what they illustrate is a whole bunch of digital media or potentially digital media that have been used I have used every single one of these if you've got any of these things lying around in your house or your office or in your garage or whatever you won't be able to read them anymore I'm pretty sure about that within a few years these things become obsolete and that's a problem if you're trying to do long-term archiving I would argue that no one on the earth is currently long-term archiving digital information yet most information is now being created digitally currently it's stored digitally it's it's observed looked at on your screen digitally but we can't archive the information some things only exist in a digital form movie companies do things entirely digitally now they shoot things digitally they mix it all up digitally they do different versions on the airplane or the 3d movie or the 2d version of the movie everything they show it in the movie cinema digitally when they want to make an archive copy then they make an analogue celluloid copy because they know how to do it that's not a good way to go but if we go through any you know how long will hard disk work how long will memory sticks work for how long will DNA work for it works a very long time how do we know that we've done the experiment we've looked at mammoth DNA that's 20,000 years old in the undertale' DNA is 40,000 years old the bison is 60,000 the current record is ancient horses seven hundred thousand year old DNA sequences have been successfully read from samples found that wasn't even a carefully done experiment that was a dead horse that that lay there somewhere cold if you do something careful with it you can make the DNA last much longer we have the facility already essentially you don't it's not difficult it's not complicated all you need is somewhere that's cold and dark and dry and even those are entirely necessary but they're the best conditions the global seed vault in Svalbard in Norway already exists what they actually store there is seeds but this is a facility it costs almost nothing to run there are no staff there it's in the Arctic Circle as long as you shut the door it's dark in there it's freezing cold it keeps it dry we're all ready it's very cheap to run a facility that can store this kind of information if you want to do it yourself your refrigerator is just perfect and if you're really conservative your freezer is just perfect well we have a technology to read it back well we will because it's DNA as long as we have humans who are technologically advanced we will be able to read DNA we're changing the Machine every year or two as the technology had proved so much but they can all do the same thing they can all read DNA long as there are people there will be DNA readers the same is not true of a floppy disk drive or probably a USB memory stick what are we going to store in the long term well it's very expensive so if it's very expensive and it's going to last a very long time you're going to start off with things that have a very high value maybe the presidential records in u.s. perhaps are considered to have very high high value or information about where nuclear waste has been dumped that's really important to keep that information safe for a long time in a format where anyone can read it back but as the technology gets cheaper what do you and I think when when it's down to a few dollars maybe your family photographs are something you would spend a little bit of money to have in a really safe format it's put somewhere out of harm's way where you know that future generations will for sure be able to read it back I'm just going to finish off by thinking on a little bit further money is is increases digital information these days this is this is actually not a real coin that's a pretend Bitcoin but bitcoin is a form of money that now really only exists on computers and with cryptography that's something we can easily store in DNA and I wanted everyone to be able to go home with a real reminder of what I've been talking about today my kind assistance are going to come amongst you now I'm going to finish speaking what we have done is we have bought a Bitcoin and we have encoded the information of that Bitcoin into DNA please take one home if you follow the link that's here and you can get a pointer to a webpage that describes our project it gives you a pointer to the technical description of the encoding method we've used a DNA sequencer at the moment you know you don't need to own your own though that you can send it off to commercial services to do the sequencing for you whoever gets there first and decodes it the Bitcoin is yours for the taking the first person can claim it for theirs once someone's suite swept it up then it's not available to anyone else so yes it is a race and good luck with that I'm going to finish there and thank you very much for listening [Applause] [Music] since the dawn of its discovery there has been a deadly disease that plagues our great YouTube universe no no not that disease but you're pretty damn close something far worse that no living creature on two legs can escape real-life time consuming symptoms such as completing college finding a job pursuing an acting career know where to put the layout because his dad turned the basement into a man cave but that just forgot about it and got a big-ass TV instead add some other fifth big but hello age
