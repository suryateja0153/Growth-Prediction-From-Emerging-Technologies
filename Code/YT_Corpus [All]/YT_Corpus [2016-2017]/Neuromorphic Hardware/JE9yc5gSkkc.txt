 hello I'm Dwight side or the floor bill called 2015 in Tampa Florida looking at some patients that some of our partners are implemented on Altara fpgas & associés and here with me today is tom pollock of i assign a low-tech first of all Tom thank you for being here with us Island thank you for having me actually could you tell us a little bit about what I signed out that does and what your demonstrate here sure so I sign all tech is first of all a u.s. manufacturer that does miniaturization we do dense manufacturing and the non tech portion of our company focuses on kind of two different areas of fpga acceleration we've taken advantage of altera's next generation area 10 silicon and some of the great features that are incorporated in it including hardware floating-point to do things like specifically compute acceleration so we have a card design to maximize external memory bandwidth and and leverage those features including opencl programmability same language that you would use to program any other kind of parallel technology in the world and a high-level language right to to really give our customers a way to accelerate their computational speeds ok what card is that that is our 5 10 T so it's a dual fpga card it's got hybrid memory cube on it it's got four banks of memory / FPGA and it is a it is a it is a monster card but very low power consumption so you're going to get a lot of speed and not pay a lot of price in terms of how much power you want to expend so I've higher performance per watt absolutely so the other area that we focus on is kind of in the pipe processing this streaming processing okay and that would be our 385 a and 325 CE cards now this in the pipe processing is enabled again by the area too silicon and I have today with me a partner of mine loose Lewis roads labs and David follett who has a disruptive new cybersecurity technology based on our 385 a card and so I'd like to introduce David here to talk about his technology on our guard thank you for us great David thank you pleasure to meet you PlayStation actually thank you for partner with nella tech and out ter here at the building 2015 could you first of all give us a little background on lewis rose labs sure Lois Oates laps is a high-tech Boston area startup and our expertise is in building neuromorphic processing systems these systems are generally applicable to a number of different problems in this particular application we're showing the use of cyber security type algorithms on top of this device and I see up here snore could you explain what that is yeah so snort is a is an open-source intrusion detection system that's fairly widely deployed and you find it in a number of government installations and what we've done here is we've ported some of the underlying algorithms for snort into the neuromorphic processor and then we execute that underneath the snort front end and as you can see from the demonstration it's almost two hundred times faster running on top of the neuromorphic processor as opposed to running on a state-of-the-art server so the neuromorphic technology is it extraordinarily efficient at executing these kinds of algorithms Dave actually looking on the screen here and see the performance gain about 200 x and snort here is it my understanding that this is the today's servers and this is your and it's the performance gains with your algorithm implanon and tell Tamela tech boards can't get it to describe them about this pencil so so what we have on the left hand side is we have the latest release of snort running on top of a high end server such as you would typically find deployed at a customer site and we're measuring the performance in real time coming off of that on the right hand side we have the exact same config except we've embedded an alle tech card that is programmed to implement the neuromorphic cyber algorithms the algorithms the security algorithms are identical on both sides the data sets are identical on both sides and what you're looking at is the performance difference which ranges from 150 up to 200 x for this particular demonstration it's important to note these are actually production production sets from a particular customer we're running so we haven't jend this up as a as a as a biased test if you will Dave thank you very much for an overview on the wonderful demonstration my pleasure doing I've joy slider of Altair corporation and thank you for watching
