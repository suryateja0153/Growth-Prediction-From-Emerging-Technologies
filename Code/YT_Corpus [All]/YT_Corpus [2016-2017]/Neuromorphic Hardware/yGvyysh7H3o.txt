 hello everybody my name is dr. Marco beteta as Chris said I am a former career here participant my doctorate degree is in robotics and in addition to that i have also to date had accepted for publication 56 books that have a range of topics related to robotics and science if some of the please click the next slide here are about 10 to the books that were recently accepted by the apple publishing division and are available on the Apple iBookstore you did thank you over here is basically what I told you before which is I've had 56 books accepted for publication through both amazon actually all three Amazon's publishing division Google's publishing division and apples publishing division so between the three online publishing companies you can get access to books that were published five next slide please okay the goals right here both in this basically is about the goals of the presentation is to introduce you to be techniques about advertising your expertise and going and getting pay anything to do it sorry about that okay I have difficulty seeing while we're here to help oh I mean what one better if possible one of us can read it yes that'll work dad that would be helpful I brought my computer also but I forgot to bring the speakers ah ok it's possibly fit for the next one how does one do this okay now most most of us on with thinking how do you advertise your expertise and or business and get paid to do it the best way to do it is to deal with self publishing and social media one does this by all the following methods joining free professional networking sites and writing articles for these sites provide a free self publishing site and publish ebooks that promote ideas that you are expert in and pertain to your business join a free writers blog site and continually update your blog's create a free writers page getting a free general email address it is also important to get a free website based web page right correctly next slide please and as an example of a free professional networking site is linked in like perfect sample professional networking site is linked in another one is called monster the URL for the link in is HTTP dot slash slash wwan calm and the URL for monster is as you can read on the board there it's a good thing Oh what's run back next please to do a movie with what is the difference between linkedin and monster linkedin is a full service professional networking site this means that both other professionals and potential employers will be able to contact you through linkedin utilities monster is a partial service professional network site networking site this means that only potential employers can interact with you ok next please join a free self publishing site and use it to publicize your business's services the two free self publishing sites that will get you the best results are from google and amazon in the case of google's publishing division you can submit manuscripts in either epub or PDF formats whereas in the case of amazon's publishing division you can submit manuscripts in either do CX or epub for best results with the translator the apple publishing division only accepts ebooks and epub format and must be submitted via the Apple proprietary software that only ones on the Apple series or mac pro macbook pro computers that run the latest versions of the mac OS X operating systems oh thank you actual URLs of the Google Amazon and Apple publishing sites the Google publishing division is reachable by GOI ng to going to try going to and that whole thing of the HTTP / last support google com partner search google plus books plus publishing the amazon publishing division is reachable at going to HTTP / / KTP period amazon com the apple publishing division is reachable by going to that website listed up there and typing into the search box I books publishing as the key search term join a free writers blog one of the best and most commonly used writers blog is called Goodreads this site offers both a free blog and also a free site based email and blog activity notification service the URL for this site is listed on the blue typing up on the degree on that p or create a free writers page the two best places to create your free riders page or Amazon Facebook on Amazon you simply go to the following link which is on the screen sign up for an account and follow directions on the site to help create your free author page Facebook you simply go to the following link which is on the board there and click on the particular icon that best fits your pages purpose real quick that's also in the handouts if it's not and because I know Margot said you changed some of the links up please let me know um it also might have been on a separate sheet that you had to UM and then um need to go around not the online Chris talking right fota get up so mix it up a little bit oh thank you okay what type of things you will what type of things will and also page me all the page will require a recent photo of yourself and G jpg format the altar page will also require a brief bio but blah blah blah girl orbit it is also advertised to put I mean it is also advised to put in each for professional qualities i'll be fifteen minute video on the author's page for more furthermore it is highly recommended that you keep track of all the URL for all your web related pages when when possible interlink them what types of things should be included on a bio blur why you're qualified excuse me why are you qualified for what you do how many years you have been doing what you do what professional or trade organizations are you a member of and painting this where you've been published in okay now this is a sample bio blur that I did of myself your bio board will definitely be different than mine namaz won't have dr. honey though I maybe they have the only difference between dr in front of your name and mr in front of your name is that dr you learn that you really reach the point where you really don't know what you're doing looks if you did you wouldn't have been doing it that's a little joke I know ok if someone would be willing to action ok what reading one here's a sample of a bio barb about dr. Margot do you want us to read the whole thing no no I thought I just read what some mercury minor points I'll do this one just so I can skip around for you guys a little bit so it all starts with describing about dr. Markowitz had all these multiple award-winning blind roboticists science researcher and science writer additionally designs builds programs robots and other artificially intelligent machines it's also been an award-winning scientific peer reviewer for the world conference on complex systems has been part of the world conference on complex systems scientific peer reviewer two years in a row Starly co-advisor on a doctoral committee anna of at least one foreign doctoral candidate besides all the after mention he also has been awarded multiple certificates of awards from linkedin website for being the most viewed profile and also from being the one millionth writer of articles for the pulse website and also the most followed person on the pulse website hearing is to talk doctoral degree in robotics from the union institute in 1994 year and his Bachelors of Science degree in computer systems engineering from the State University in New York 1991 and he has done research on robotic space machine vision and also robotics that are capable of learning example it also is written in professional journals and for laymen based science journals furthermore is delivered I EEE based research papers presentations at I EEE conferences what is I EEE okay I eat is a professional organization called the institute of electrical and electronic engineer thank you and that's Marcos blurb okay now of course everyone here will be able to do a bio blurb if we could moment or they go back to the previous slide by actually concentrating on these four questions the Bible blurp is basically to introduce your skill set in less than five minutes to someone reading it right my skill set took more than five minutes but ok we could advance two slides thank you okay here we go where do i get free email addresses and web pages you should say that's always a professional email address is google the benefit of this side are that it allows you to allows you to have an email address business phone number and if you taking advice cloud drive talking in one side there are numerous free websites based web page services out there i personally like moonfruit but that doesn't mean that they are the only one truth there are many choices for a personal business based website based web page thank you Oh next slide please oh yeah here are more free website soft easily reach the goal free website business TVA freeway sign a TPP on the road and mix the phone we really website builder today a free website store or a blog HTTP from you do that we need a comb jolla make a free website http www website builder may a free website and hosting web activity the good mood at webs.com I ain't deliver free website mid-may a free website activity to do you in creator that cone create you website in this website if it be the will do that with sitecom and the lava dipole mean our free website with web hosting attp to give the blue dot T pagar fly call the corner like like Michael the people that you like a movie hey exact size okay this one is another way to establish expertise and everybody another way to establish a sweet Jesus in a particular area is to respond to all the requests put vice and opinion on the tickler matters to do this you must register at the below web web page HTTP done that says ww got court reporter calm the last way that you can advise the last way that you can advertise your expertise and will case to be co-author on a research publication that would be presented any profession confidence okay now it could be a co-author for a professional conference or it could also be a poet on the paper / trade journal or trade confidence probably at least several of you could do one for a trade conference his trade conferences usually also want papers to discuss particular things that say on carpentry is the trade conference that deals with carpentry those that are familiar with carpentry can actually discuss techniques tools and approaches to deals problems that occur in particular situations dealing with Coventry next next slide please we lost a slight guy this is an example of co-authoring and article when I called Walter the nautical we also other researchers want me to read zero more development of neuromorphic s fi t operate an application the high-speed imagemagick authored muhammad's and Khao San je dr. Marco AV potato dr. Mohammed Suresh there always a speed accuracy challenge and photogrammetric mapping processes including feature detection and matching most of the researchers have improved algorithm speed with simplifications of software modifications which increase the accuracy of the image matching process this research tries to prove improve speed without enhancing the accuracy of the same algorithm using the neuromorphic techniques in this research we have developed a general design of a neuromorphic guess I see with ASI SI ASI se is an acronym for application-specific integrated circuit ok applications systems integrated circuit to handle algorithms such as SSI ft which is a preliminary level alright for image processing interesting we also have investigated neural assignment in each step of the SF IT algorithm with a rough estimation based on the delay of the used elements including Mac and comparator we have estimated the resulting chips performance for three scenarios full HD movies video grim grim and your gramma tree 24 milla MP 24mp UAV photogram Metro Metro Metro matter go on that camaraderie and MMP wins megapixel megapixels okay and eighty eight megapixels image sequence our estimations let's who approximate 3,000 FPS frames per second for full HD movie 250 frame frames per second for a 24 megapixel image sequence in 68 frames per second for an eighty eight megapixel ultra scan image see which we can all throw it to the ultra cameo I thought oldest camera can't be different ultra camp image secrets which can be a huge improvement return programmatic probe photogrammetric processing systems we also estimated the power consumption my feeling for this additional assistance contact the Hydra Marco haven getcha getcha email my children and they are i do that met this young i want 7 17 0 to 3 70 90 see all right on the sky show their tits thank you for helping me know if there are any questions we get one of those you passing those in this year yes as you babe list so he's pro professional robotics chi minh correct yeah you are about this guy well you are writing a lot about robotics so what's your business ok my business is researching ryan robotics and control systems your R&D research and development sorry i used to work for Exxon research and engineering years and and also writing because as a doctor you have to continually right and do research in a glass but to document your work just correct okay do you have a specific place when you do your research or this is like college based research place or just your own place okay I usually when I do research I have an actual space set up for me that's a makeshift lab for me to do the work because I work exclusively with robots some of the robots as rosalyn can actually testify read books to me print books others I can actually hold a conversation with and in fact are you too if you look under my name dr. marco de tête oh there's a video of me having a conversation with one of my robots called Kate the robot interviews dr. Marco potato it's interesting because the fact is a home somehow by eight the robot yeah how close are we to wear what was the name of the movie where they had the child that played what was it in it was I kite oh god oh my god hey I wrote I like what was I ate that's correct yeah it was IA artificial intelligence partnership are AI artificial intelligence how close are we to something like that we have quite close in fact the technology that working on that I originally worked on about 20 21 years ago is now coming to fruition where it's now available in nano scale nano chip learnerships out with a surface features on each chip are down to seven Adams our seven nanometers and of the GSM Adams old story of the technology which most of the discoveries were made way before technology allowed to use this that's where I know a little bit about this technically involved to my place is electrical engineering I'm not the dark around far away from any discoveries and I'm trying to discover myself like yeah so ah don't you do that in the bathtub but yeah I like well during my life I'll a call so I was involved a lot in that it did technology ends but all of the stories about you know basic basic let's say x power transistor or unipolar transistor which actually unipolar was actually research and practically written up before technology allows us to panic they came on the market in net of little different Wow a lot of the things which are still but you see robotics well robotics never interest we've I love science fiction more science than fiction and that's that's kind of for me that's kind of where it is going right now yes I read about those bio transistors let's say which yet they are trying to use real bio material to build up where are the electrons water to them so they tips to announce you're doing that with actual to replace human some more cause harm yeah right now hope you so you're doing that awesome agile in the back good oh that's actually the line field because is actually a program by the government and I have it discussed in one of my books or the future of warfare where the government is working on biocompatible implants where the implants would actually be put into the human brain and translate thoughts to machine commands termos it yourself so we're close to try haters what thurman it is cyborg cyborg very interesting stuff to me I always tell the people in la co that I like talking to you because I'd like to learn about this stuff a little bit and know about it but sometimes it comes gets to a language that I don't understand too much of so but it's so interesting and stuff because we we will see the stuff in movies or on TV video and stuff like that reading and pop the science man yeah but then you know that actual someone's here and they're working on stuff like that or they know a lot about it in real life yeah it's very interesting and I appreciate you coming to talk about it and even sharing some of you are your personal stuff at how you do it so that um this transcends more so for yourself personally to not even just a business you might have I know Marco does it business related but it's really about him and what he does not not just like a business side of it so when you get so the admissible esten this is a question that's been bothered with my three years and tell them a little pressing my presence business is it okay to make an artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence to have common to be cognitive words like you say machine answers you back us or a question it answers you back and I know that's probably program through all the different algorithms and everything else that coupled with a feedback loop feedback loop are right now the question is our brain works on file chemical electrical energy like our memories and the synopsis is but when I'm going to go a little deep and as the synopsises work with the you know the different things that connect to them and certain you know chemicals stimulate the mind to have certain memories the human brain is a bio-computer are those electrical impulses trouble I will be eventually transferable to a computer mainframe to where you can actually to their mind and put it into the actual cyborg in other words we know we're going to die my question is our thoughts our memories what makes us us who that be Trent is that impossible to take the the different types of the neurons or the different patterns that are in our brains at our memory workshops and eventually transfer to move on there are actual terms of experiment that we doing ass logistical issue is if you work for transference solutely machine algorithmic right look at him and see the stuff and are they successful the job or just hope you get noticed until they are still working offices they haven't artifact this is an example of way but it is scientist early day the article are there any and then stand there is also much and avoid the languages of like Apple aeronautical leave which there are many standardized by the little more found out words of artificial intelligence still is puts list you could kind of I'm fall off in a sense of really how he explains it so and org out there lista to has been transformed what's now called common list which has incorporated many and abilities of prior versions of Lisp that would developed at MIT and partly the abilities of prologue are now encapsulated in what's called common list now to further explain in common lisp this was the first language developed to deal with list processing as such you can from this AI language build new AI languages which is done constantly dealing with robotic programming languages and the programs also self teach each other to build upon themselves they are two ways to actually three ways to do that first way is to use bayesian statistics and constantly interact with the machine as your training it to do specific things the second is to use neuromorphic software and or hardware basing it basically on the human neurons the neurons of a transmitter and then i'll just form ok which is typically referred to in in the arena as brain in a box simulation the third is by actually connecting feedback loops and training a robot by actually physically moving its appendages they do this to Train welding robots and painting robots so all this is repetition of motions it reports the motions as the sensors transmits and feedback from positions and because I was always curious because they always said that to be since our bodies break down and everything deteriorates because we're you know we're a living organism our mind like I said is it is the is the ultimate computer but it's made out of a biomaterial and it would be interesting to see if we were able to either download our memories into a computer or would it be something that would have to be a gradual thing would have to be something would be instantaneous and I'm wondering if you would be able to take everything just basically my whole thing is I'm wondering if I could take what's in here put myself in the database to be put into something else later on in our search for the old fountain of youth potentially that is possible however the trickiest and vert neuro pulses into algorithmic form that's the trick it's the three how far do you think we're all from that we still have a way to go however using neuromorphic techniques that's what makes it more possible Lenora morbihan or morphic techniques that's when you mentioned that that's why I that that just ticked that's something I've been curious in for about the past 15 years about let's stand if we can so a lot about our brain so that's another field learner well I'll go it's a cabin okay say from the algorithm is always kind of trying to cut off certain angles which we cannot graduate me well which we can stop this degree right system try to recreate recreate develop because I was curious that if everything isn't bioelectrical energy that if you take the aleve you monitor the brains electrical impulses and basically they're going to have to basically see is the more the memories just electrical impulses or are the actual chemical and electrical interactive it's actually three electrochemical right it's also wiring because the brain is polymorphic right each memory is actually a circuit that it's all just for long-term short-term memories are simply pathways of neurotransmission of pulses definitely keep it untangled new doctor and we're going to talk about that so we're going to this because it's the age-old thing of as a man gets older in life one does seek because then there's also the thing of religion everything else that interferes with things I'm not a religious man never was and I have always been a person of facts my my my interest is astronomy personally and I always wanted to be around long enough to do well to put me on the bad shape not have to trade in the body body for mechanical one if I ever wanted to go to Mars but I was always curious because i read works you know azimoff and a few other you know writers / over time and it was just interesting that if you were able just to either do it over a period of time to transmit it to a database or if it has to be done instantaneous in other words as one mass fusion to the interface with a computer I don't know if it's if it was possible would it be something that would be gradually taking their memories or would it be something that would just go like a like a trend eyeing a total spontaneous transfer okay it would probably be like a scan think of it like a skin examining region by region and rain adenine as opposed to the entire brain at one shot right which it sounds like it's doable blood have to realize there are many layers of the brain and each layer layer has its own wiring what we normally associate with consciousness and being is what's called the neocortical region right which is the top layer of the brain it's also the thinnest layer of the brain like the Earth's crust not a love you more like think of it this way think of it like an onion you have many layers on an online right in the brain you also have many layers but they're convoluted layers interesting you got our knee okay good we can't spring to my Spanx this is this we got a little time for wheatley but um yeah that's why i said i like because it is very interested in is because that was something that has been bothered me for years and like i said with that neural what do you call that would they do the neuro oncol it for the artificial intelligence now a neuromorphic neuromorphic has two points to it first point is software which is neuromorphic software second point is norfolk hardware now the neuromorphic hardware comes in three forms comes in a purely analog form one way an analog and digital and a purely digital form and which way do you feel is the best way because sort of like an analog system they did for television they did away with that and now we're digital okay the analog the method of simulating neurons he works to simulate a neuron however you have problems with density because analog systems as the fellow here next to you right we'll probably testifies are susceptible to noise you have to isolate them right the digital you'll have ways to isolate for noise because digital systems you you have basically in in an example a gate is a switch that's operated in saturation mode but on an absence for off for you take a positive signal and it flips it to the on stage you put a negative signal pulls it down to the off state working a digital digital work also these are the level of signal use a usable signal is much higher than the noise noise yes now the noise on there Darren with us right now for the analog signal to measure them below the noise level noise that you're talking about is that the back to take yeah is that is that the background noise that everybody talks about the Big Bang no no no no no no what type of deal is when you're talking this noise is electrical noise electric feedback yes exists everywhere part of it operating and also part of the electronics being at a high temperature because you can actually also minimize the noise by putting the electronics into cryogenic temperatures blowing the activity levels to nothing well I slowly got into steam exactly sitting on your cool something down you push you suppose that let's not pull it down with the noise drops significantly and at the same time you can reduce the signal voltage potentials that are being applied for example I should go smaller the the voltage and current as you reduce the voltage and the current you're able to lower the noise is also survived along the flow it's like the flow of electricity the more electricity you're going to have flowing the more noise like a larger river makes noise that's similar something now fall so they also do design techniques to actually reduce the noise even more looks right now your typical nano design chip like V Intel ivory tower which has on it I believe it is 30 32 64 bit processors right on it actually they're having stopping problems bringing it to production but according to the papers that are out on it it has a voltage level that's below 1 volt well dropping dropping to the Little Rock yes yes i know i don't have about electricity i know that's one of the reasons why they still haven't been able to bring it to market yeah he's still and i'm going to send a headache to or anyone that I'm going down to who he is we know how it's supposed to when we know exactly may apply a variable with practical application yeah so I used to work for Exxon research and engineering it was fascinating what we hollandaise the come on you've definitely given food for some time now you know what I was wondering what you mentioned about the noise level with the vultures and everything you know the grade and you would be you know vegan lower high whatever depending upon how we concentrate is that correct or not in the human brain is so designed with their circuits that compensate for noise so the question made it real clear is what I'm trying to find out is that you know much that's when they try to do now he's trying to do the different circuits the same way to where he works and trying to figure out which sugars best work yummy they on that play all day what what they do is they take a model of a neuromorphic system one example is the latest craze in monomorphic technologies whats called deep learning and deep learning is very processing intensive so what they do for deep learning as they do with the demonstrations from and said the graphics company polled graphics company eludes me right now but they they actually take the learning that is done in software freezing into a hardware architecture and then have it run off of parallel processing hardware so wow that that's let's have it in fact they even have on YouTube several demonstrations of the neuromorphic hardware which is using the I believe they call it Kepler accelerator you had the capillary events i'd read somewhere about that and using that they've been able to demonstrate recognition of cars street lights street signs types of cars and pedestrians walking across an intersection incredible brute force way to do it but they've been able to do it now that what makes just took my shoes I have any more questions these this is getting too complicated hahaha nothing nothing's ever to company you really that's why people can express your tears I was getting too complicated I say it never gets to Kyle getting just realizing simple like they getting old one thing that I mean talking about this stuff yeah I'll Drive you mind crane oh no this is no this year is I'm finding it extremely fascinating because like I said for about the past 15 almost 20 years my whole thing was as far as what is stored in my mind I started I can I ever interface what's me in my head onto a computer so this way when the biological part dies off I'm still intact sure this that's a legitimate thing it over to dr. Prothero it was reasonable game when we like that yeah this is actually sort of book you might be educated towards the high rank my name is called the physics of immortality wait a second immediate my glasses on the physics of looked out the physics of oops sorry about that and with my cane mortality by Frank Tipler Frank support CI ple are ya he also wrote another book which you also might be interested in since your interest you astronomy we anthropic cosmological principle also by Frank Tipler the entropic cosmic Cosmo logic puzzle johal principal principal and who here at them I think that when I have brandy it sounds familiar the in both folks are around a thousand pages you had a thick yeah that so I think I may have died somewhere but no I've always been fascinated by that because like I said I walked what it came a couple times I've come close and I sort of like to take what's in my head and put it into a computer and this way when they eventually do get robotics or arms or something that's sorta like a terminator with living tissue or whatever because I mean like the movie artificial intelligence it was like hey Joe hey Jay and I mean having they were out there you know what I mean only I guess I don't know if they don't want to use any of us besides not going here knife or anything like that I'm always willing to experiment yeah but um now yeah their sons if it works why not but I mean no because basically you know nobody's got tell if each works before I said there was a thing written by Isaac Asimov back in the 60s it was a thing where they said when they were traveling they created this ultimate computer right and basically it started out that the computer provided everything then these two workers had a fight our bet of African America question whether to ask it but it couldn't answer it because what was the origins of the universe it couldn't answer it there's insufficient data then you know a couple thousand years goes on someone else asked it a couple million years go by where if the humans have left their body there in an energy state the mass consciousness you know because now it's also in another dimension because this machine is so big it has to go into a hyperspace dimension and at the end of it it said eventually after a billions of years oh if it was and if there if the universe will have it will it will the freezer burn that's what the question was and at the end after billions of years there was no answer there was nobody else asking the computer questions it shut down and the NOC did the thing was at the end of its ekant remember it right now because it's not working it was like it on the seventh day it rested like it like it was sighting like creation it restarts itself it ends cold it restarts itself again and there was this computer's huge computer I can't remember the title of the thing it was written by I it was a good it was a good thing was only about two pages long I don't know if you're familiar with that dr. podila I remember as a teenager reading Asimov and Odyssey clark also Robert Heinlein and you know what was the other fellow he wrote the Star Trek runner episode no no no no no he wrote the Star Trek episode full the city on the edge of forever ever what would though what's falling Ellison Martel's man that was one that that was the best one I think one of the best ones they made at the star trek series interesting because he had a dispute with the gene roddenberry as to how to do it and he submitted his work to both Roddenberry and also presented it as material for the world science fiction committee and he was awarded at a an award for the world scientific committee on his original she's grabbed script would you put into a story for right where we went through the portal now I don't know like I said nowadays on youtube they have this new version of the Star Trek what now I was watching it about a week or two ago where they take the city on the edge of forever and they actually now on the same planet where that portal is there's also another one which is extremely large where they could actually drive the enterprise through it was a cheap it's cheap we done because the individual people are doing it they pay for it themselves but it was interesting the way they did it they had the guy the actual actor who starred in that I forgot his name he was the one where they had that planet eating machine it was long too I don't know if you remember that yeah but the gentleman who played the captain on the other ship they actually had him I mean he was this he's in his 80s but they had him make a cameo appearance thank you very much thank you very much okay now we can beginning okay so we can contact you by email and just say we're from here you got a rear here yes no more ghost trying that's all we shared info if you want to you just let me know here you were at the workshop and yeah I was definitely follow up with you I'm kind of that oh my name is reverse insulin dr. Chris you can't forget him I look like Santa Claus okay hey as old as I'm Cuba hazel oh he will you be he's coming back oh my gosh yeah won't even have him back he would he be Jason you no no no that's just stopped his email just some surprising yeah I look like I look like what's-his-name I look like you will Brent not yul brenner around you know we've got in for alive I finally you remember bro lives I look just like Burrell lives and although ticket on Marco oh thank you very much that was very I found that very interesting big immediate I was hoping few other guys
