 the original AI researchers were very interested in games because they were extremely complex huge numbers of possible positions and games were available yet they're simple in a certain way they're simple in that the moves are well-defined the goals are well-defined and so you don't have to solve everything all at once with chess in particular and the work on deep blue at IBM what became apparent what computers could do on a problem like that was bringing a massive amount of a compute resource to do deeper searches to investigate more options of moves in chess that then was previously possible Watson defeating jeopardy so this was another crossover point in sort of the development of AI and cognitive computing the questions that IBM was was able to answer with jeopardy were questions that weren't simply looking up in the database and you know finding the answer somewhere rather it required information retrieval over lots of different information resources and then the combining of these together using machine learning that could arrive at answers that went beyond what was simply written somewhere now our technology is so much better and so much more advanced that we're really ready to move on and to tackle much more challenging problems that have this kind of ill-defined or kind of messy nature every industry from oil and gas to healthcare to media and entertainment to retail are just being swamped by a tsunami unstructured data that can be you know multimedia can be images it can be video it can be text and it's really the ability to understand that data that is becoming critical one of the most valuable applications of cognitive computing is in the health domain medical providers physicians nurses assistants face enormous challenges leveraging all of the available information that's out there the medical literature increases by about 700,000 articles every year and there's already millions of journal articles out there and today's imaging technologies produce very rich amounts of information in fact a particular scan might have five thousand images in it you combine the image analysis with natural language understanding and text analysis leveraging the medical literature leveraging the patient's medical history the physician has got a lot more information and knowledge at their disposal to help them make the best diagnosed as possible clearly there's this intersection of what the computer can do and you know what people are able to do that you know gives you something that's better than each of them individually what is going to be you know truly interesting is to see what is the best way for them to have you know really symbiotic type of interaction taking the advantage of each other's strengths to collectively solve a problem you
