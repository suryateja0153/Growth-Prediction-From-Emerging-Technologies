 good morning and thank you definitely appreciate everybody showing up not only here today but also for the week I know taking that time commitment in everything we do is is hard to do but I think it's important that we spend the time together meet up discuss learn from each other I'm going to walk through a presentation that Sam Ramsey and I did at EMC world and if any of you have gone to EMC world a little bit different audience you know predominantly focused on IT operators system administrators and many of you may know some of this material but I'm sure each and every day we have new technologies in this new world to choose from and so this is to give you additional insights into why you made the right decision about platforms and also to you know give you additional information and ammunition as you go about your daily business within your own organizations so the essence of the discussion was really around enterprise DevOps modern software technology Matt Gallagher who's here today from EMC he generated this new track to focus on code and modern operations and it was really about the DevOps movement and what we see across our enterprise customers is that this movement is accelerating enterprise innovation and as many of you know it's a different different world it's a different model in fact many things are different and Devon Ops trade-offs are made continually so the focus of this discussion was really about platforms that definitely this audience knows why you're making the right decision but again these decisions need a very holistic view about you know making decisions for that are appropriate for your business and making those right decisions can help you and your business make the following choices between innovation velocity and governance risk and compliance requirements so the the audience at EMC world again a little bit different you know a lot a lot of people understand DevOps in fact that F was supposed to be an H so it's what the heck is DevOps but it's important to note that DevOps is not a thing right it's not a job spec it's not a title it's not a process not I I can't like say you know can I have two scoops of DevOps and sprinkle in a little bit of hybrid cloud you can't buy it right what it is it's a movement and at EMC we're actually practicing this movement if you will each and every day at the EMC dojo and that movement is based and and built by practitioners for practitioners and it really incorporates a lot of the discussion you just heard about continuous integration and deployment allowing us to focus on the circle of software as onsie calls it to develop more reliable faster innovation for our businesses and it is very different you know I can drill down into a lot of the difference I spent most of my career on this side on the traditional side of development in fact I've been at two companies one startup one large company the startup I was the fifth engineer there was 50 people worldwide today that company is over 60 thousand people it's known as EMC Corporation and predominantly I've spent my entire career in in development and there are night and day differences it is a difference between black and white and color TV from everything there are some similarities between how we used to do development but you know as we kind of drill down into that what's important for EMC and what we built our our business around it's really around the bottom around infrastructure and reliability availability serviceability when we look at this new world that capability is built differently it's not necessarily provided by the infrastructure more around the platform the application but what's really different is the the principles of focusing on adoption by customers and that's the iteration of the build measure learn cycle and be able to iterate with passion and urgency but like prior movements in lean and agile if this doesn't take its course this movement doesn't take its course all across the business then we haven't made our mark right to do continuous integration and deployment to build MVP is a hard thing for businesses to do right it's a different concept everybody wants everything day one but that's not how we work today so I think it's important as we go forward to make sure that we're educational in each of our businesses about the whole business movement around DevOps as well and I'm sure many and oh there's a lot of statistics on this stuff right you know increased collaboration 35% increase in new software and services of 46% reduction in spending but it's really important that I remind you that exactly 94.1 percent of all statistics are inaccurate it's true it is I actually said that in a meeting in a guy goes what was that ninety four point one percent I said no it's ninety three point seven he goes okay ninety three point seven but the real benefit of a DevOps movement or practice is really about hitting customer engagement adoption and satisfaction and to be able to pivot faster that fast feedback cycle I have built many products with many different technologies and features that were not adopted right the traditional water scrum fall process where we've got 18 to 24 month development cycles and we get it out there and the customer says that's just not what I wanted right so you know getting that concept across to our business to say look MVP is good enough we will have enough to get early feedback on that and we can pivot instead of predictably hitting our target we can pivot to what the customer wants sooner so you know at EMC world you know and we kind of lever just study that was done by right scale the data came from clear path but you know across the industry as we look at DevOps adoption the good news is around two-thirds today or at least in 2015 are adopting a DevOps practice looking at using cloud today the numbers are higher which is great you know five six seven years ago people were you know cloud was kind of a dream today 93 percent of the respondents are using a cloud today and out of those respondents 82 percent are using a multi cloud alright weather and it's predominantly hybrid base so the bulk of that is a hybrid cloud but some are deploying a strategy around multi private multi public but you know when we look at the number of clouds it's not one cloud there are many clouds out there so here's a challenge and here's the challenge we face as users as an industry is what about platform right as we look at cloud computing architectures what percentage of people out there in the world are adopting platform 16% say they have a platform strategy and that's problematic you know when we look at the complexity and even the talk we just went through not having a platform to do what we need to do in terms of digital transformation is very very difficult and there are challenges you know when we look at the DevOps model this what by the way I call pair peddling if you practice pair peddling but when you know DevOps is not a panacea for everything right so you know having a DevOps practice there are there are constraints and different value systems between what developers value and what operators value right this model puts them closer together puts us closer together but we do have different value system for developers it's important for us to agility and speed and ease of use and you know new tools you know and to also have a have our customers have a love affair with the software that we produce but it's operators it gets back to you know traditional IT ops those value systems haven't changed right you know IT you know people still get paid on things related to governance risk compliance security cost availability predictability and then kind of looking forward I asked this question a lot you know to those that are implementing a DevOps practices if we run the movie five years forward what does it look like you know is DevOps going to be you know this movement going to be just restricted to new applications or will this take over in terms of bimodal IT what about rewriting applications is that going to be mode one or are we going to see mode 2 or you know kind of the DevOps movements start to move all across so will this green blue green picture in the future five years from now be much greener than it is for all applications not just not new but what about rewrite and reap platform right and and that's top of mind for CIOs across the industry is that many know that they need to invest in the BI model i T to capture this wave of innovation and disruption that software's occurring in the market but they know it's not forever right its temporal as we look at it so the benefits as many of you know you know in terms of Cloud Foundry is the the beauty of abstraction right as a developer simply CF push my app as an operator I can botch deploy my service so where the the the beauty is really in the abstraction layers of the platform it's also a challenge right as we look at the operational characteristics abstraction levels create less direct control of the infrastructure and the service level agreements underneath of it when I do a CF push of my app how do I know I'm going to get that predictability Wow am I going to know that my governance risk and compliance requirements are met so that's where the importance of platform comes in right and Cloud Foundry being in our collective opinion one of the most important so clear path did additional work around this to survey users and evaluators right so what's in blue is the people that are using technology today and it what's in red or people that are evaluating that technology and they ask those users a number of questions and what the findings were is that look in the future it's not just a container only world right a lot of people think containers are you know containers are great but virtual machines and other packaging concepts will exist coexist in the future trying to do this without a platform is next to impossible right so you look at the practitioners in this model they know you know trying to do it and go it alone in certain environments it may be easy to do you know smaller scale doing it mid to large enterprise scale it's it's a heck of a lot Hardware trying to control your own hardware without a platform is even more challenging and the container cluster managers and orchestrators are not good enough right so kubernetes chef puppet they do very good for certain environments but they're they don't cover the spectrum of what IT practitioners need in their environment so the good news is there's a lot of choices out there with platforms in fact there are over 70 platform vendors out there on the planet today and that community's been grown most of them are in production you know what a lot of the industry doesn't understand this they think platform technology is kind of nascent it's not you know many of them been out there for four years in production environments deploying production workloads you know most of them are polyglot and there's hundreds of services that are being offered on these platforms and that continue continues to grow so that's the good news the bad news is the same thing there's too many choices right and you will be faced with more and more of those each and every day in in the in this new world tec-9 gee the investment and you know even VCS and and you know equity is being poured into this community so we will see more of this a year from now two years from now there are too many choices and there's a lot of things that go into the choice of a platform it's not just hey who does it just best job of orchestrated orchestrating my containers right it gets into a number of things you know in terms of you know the backing services the packaging methodology the infrastructure characteristics locations of deployment and on and on and on and on and that's why that leads us to Cloud Foundry I took the red pill how many took the red pill all right good it should be all of you hopefully none of you took that red pill and then tried to throw it up but we are seeing you know a lot of benefits in terms of enterprise adoption so these are the things the attributes of the platform in terms of multi cloud in containers and VMs multi-language support what got kind of got me excited about the platform was really around the infrastructure automation and having been in mission critical systems for decades mission business life critical environments application environments these things are critically important you know in terms of the automation capabilities and you saw in the previous presentation the ability to restart without human intervention so these next three slides are what I presented at the summit last year it might have stalled this one from somebody that was very famous but you can tweet it out that I said it but this dream was really about hey what if you could deploy and manage all IT applications and services on any cloud easily and consistently with the confidence that it meets all of your business objectives and I went on to say hey you know what if we had the capability to deal with not just 12 factor applications but all workloads right 12 factor apps are great but what about applications with state you know what about other types of work and kind of thought about hey you know what if we had these capabilities around persistence and data protection you know maybe even some data optimization or mobility and access capabilities that were pluggable into the framework of the platform so we actually put our money where our mouth is and we've invested in a dojo it's in Cambridge Massachusetts the bulk of our developers and contributors are there and we've got five folks in the San Francisco office on Howard Street and so in a year so last year you know that was kind of our dream this year here's how we've done over that period of time we we actually have been doing great in terms of meetups and you know developing contributors first Ojo announced in March of last year and over 1900 contributions to the open source we went from nowhere nine months ago to number two in terms of open source contributions to the platform if you take the pivotal contributors out of that and our focus is what I talked about earlier it's to be able to deal with those things that your IT operators traditionally for years have have to deal with in terms of business continuity did you know data protection you know persistence you know all those things that are critical to the operations teams so this is kind of our focus area specifically what we've done within the past three years or past year is actually pretty significant yesterday there was a discussion but with Ted Ted young Paul Warren the folks from IBM around Diego persistence providing a persistence layer for the platform so we can deal with stateful applications that architecture allows for plug ability of software-defined storage we've got demo we'll show you in a second that allows scale IO to underpin this persistence layer a lot of feedback from the community about hey can I deploy containers on bare metal what about Cloud Foundry earlier this year released a bare-metal CPI allowing to deploy your applications on to bare metal environments unique we actually announced that yesterday we've been talking about it for a month or so now it's that kind of think about next-generation packaging technology being able to get to more efficient footprint with lower security threat surface areas if you will and then other innovations around intelligence scheduling so what I'd like to do now is do bring up Luke woodchuck from our San Francisco team so Luke is our development lead from San Francisco and look just how to baby six weeks ago so congratulations thank you just just waking up you know you know it just rolled out of bed so you have a new baby - it's called persistence and so this demo is going to show the folks here about persistence on scale i/o so exactly that you know capability so what you know what's the demo about what's the type app that you were looking at sure we all love Cloud Foundry here and and for the most part 12 factor apps are what we've been limited to in the past right we've now extended that so that you can take traditional apps onto Cloud Foundry and here's an example of one of those it's a wordpress app a blog that typically we've see well what's different about this app is that the themes and the plugins the customize WordPress are actually stored on a file system okay so this is the persistent data that's important for the for the word press app yeah exactly so we took this WordPress app and we we put it onto the platform and you can use the CF apps command here to see the EMC dojo WordPress app and now we're gonna do the magic and scale it okay so you're scaling to what five instances yeah we've scaled the five instances here now with WordPress if you're familiar with it if you do this in a traditional case with Cloud Foundry you lose that persistent data on all the replicants and we're gonna show you that it exists okay all right so in in the normal case we couldn't do this right so if you scaled the app and instances those this instances couldn't maintain the state across the the the different instances of the app yeah exactly all subsequent instances would be a vanilla WordPress okay so we should see as we bring up a separate browser window and navigate again to the site an exact copy but the difference here is that the instance index is different that shows this server that it's being delivered from okay we've scaled this with an exact replica preserving the themes and the plugins okay so maintaining the state between the different instances so that's pretty cool and it was pretty quick it was it two lines of code or I think what's one of the best things about Cloud Foundry is right we're trying to focus on the user interface and experience there's so much complexity underneath the surface here but it really boils down to a quick easy command to do this that's awesome so this was done in conjunction AMC IBM and pivotal up in San Francisco definitely appreciate it I'm sure a lot of our customers out here will see the value in this and you know it is I think one of the most significant you know developments if you will that's occurred recently with the platform yeah for the first time ever you're gonna be able to take your legacy traditional apps and manage them in the same place that you manage your 12 factor apps all right Thank You Luke get some sleep thank you it's gonna go back to bed alright so I am about a minute off target so I'll just kind of close with this point you down to the booth so to make it easier for developers we did launch a platform called native hybrid cloud allowing you to deploy applications whether it be on Prem or off Prem and do that in a very simplistic way with tools sitting on top around see ICD application performance management the bill back and show back capabilities as well as additional analytics so to close we see this movement really accelerating digital transformation across the globe you have made the right choice if you're here around Cloud Foundry it is by far the best platform on the planet our job as a community is to continue to enhance and enrich that without detracting from the abstraction or the simpler you know the simple way in which you can build and deploy applications the world will be you know kind of very heterogeneous in terms of VMs in containers it will be multi cloud you know Pass and open source or critical purchasing requirements Cloud Foundry is by far the best first and only choice allowing our customers you in the audience here to keep the balance between innovation velocity and business requirements so thank you and have a great rest of the show [Applause]
