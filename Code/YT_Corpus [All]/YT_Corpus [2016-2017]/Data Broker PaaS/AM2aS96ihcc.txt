 good morning everyone my name is Scott radarman and I would like to welcome you to our seventh session in our monthly Lunch and Learn series again revolution group will be discussing topics of interest for best practices for your small to medium business as we've mentioned before if there is a topic you are personally interested in discussing please feel free to tweet at REM underscore group using the hashtag Lunch and Learn and we will take that topic into consideration for future webinars as many of you are probably aware we are a premier IT consultant firm serving small to medium businesses in the greater columbus area for over 20 years today's discussion is centered on identity and access management I'm joined again today by our IT architect Scott Kaufman who will dive deeper into this topic as always if there are any questions throughout please feel free to type them in the browser and we will address them at the conclusion of the presentation and without further ado here's Scott thanks Scott as as you mentioned the topic is identity and access management which really is a very broad and vague term for consolidating the number of passwords you have to manage and making security around those passwords easier the definition of identity management is the concept of having a single source of information for user users and having that one identity managed and linked to other applications ideally when we're talking about this it's gonna be single sign-on that's really the example that we're referring to it's what most people think of when we talk about identity management is really consolidating the number of passwords down to a single authentication source so you don't have to remember seven passwords for your emailing your Windows account and your Salesforce account and your line of business account all of those identities can be centrally managed access management ties directly in with identity management and so when you have a single source of information for identity it makes it a lot easier to control access to those applications it's a single place to manage the permissions for those users single sign-on why is it so important why is it so benefit to companies and it's one thing that's been very popular in enterprise space for for a number of years as you can imagine you get into the larger enterprise companies they have you know tens maybe hundreds of applications well it's always a big push to try to get those applications all tied to the central authentication source when I mentioned central authentication source for most firms that's Active Directory that is your new log in the year domain that you log into your computer that uses Active Directory and single sign-on in most cases uses Active Directory as kind of that single trust that single place where the users exist so single sign-on leveraging that it makes it easier for your users they just have to remember their windows their domain username and password and that works for everything else that's linked to the single sign-on it simplifies the employee onboarding and off-boarding as you can imagine if you create the user in one place you have done the work of creating it for all those applications tied into your single sign-on you know today you may create a new user and you have to create their user account in your in your Salesforce account maybe your separate email setup system maybe your separate line of business applications you know whatever it may be you have to create that user in every place if you have all that tied together do a central authentication source you create it once and it's flown to everybody else and with so it controls access and security those systems and platforms so if you can imagine that when it comes time to let somebody go or maybe you have somebody leaving you know how sure you that you've disabled access to every single application they had access to if you have all of that centralized and you kill that central user it essentially will not it blocks out access to all those applications tied in which is really a big plus for for those that have to maintain security compliance being able to prove that you blocked everybody out is a very important thing and also it's less calls the service desk which allows your employees to be more productive they don't have to waste time calling you know calling our guys to get a password reset because they can't remember a password to this a pastor to that you know they're just one password they have to remember it really kind of cuts down on the number of of calls having to come in the with that and single sign-on is important for kind of a different reason - for the security aspect it allows you to take advantage of multi-factor authentication maybe protocol two-factor authentication and that we'll get into that a little bit later but really what this does is you may have used this before for your Apple ID or maybe your Google account or maybe your Dropbox account when you log in and that wants to challenge you the simplest form of that is like challenge questions but really what we're seeing more of the the popular trend is to do like one-time text message verification so you get a text message your phone that has a code so you know some services allow you to enforce that second level of authentication when there's certain circumstances at hand and I'll explain a little bit more you know as we proceed in that and the this and the slides here an example of single sign-on you know probably the most popular form of single sign-on that we see in use in small and medium business space today is centered around Microsoft's office 365 cloud platform and for those you that don't know it office 365 is it really is a suite of products in the cloud that are kind of bundled together email SharePoint Skype for business you know those types of services the office online apps all of those different kind of suite of products you know they are driven by a back-end authentication source called Microsoft Azure Active Directory and what you can do is link the Microsoft Azure Active Directory to your on-premise Active Directory so what happens is it trusts your authentication source your Active Directory that you have in your business as the point to authenticate those users so you can sign up and take advantage of all of these office 365 applications that maybe you already do and have the logins for that than having a separate office or 65 login you could have it run through your on-premise Active Directory so you use your windows your domain username and password to get access to those and again that allows for a synchronization of user count so you don't have to create those accounts in two places and some other cool things that you can do with the Microsoft is your Active Directory not just office 365 but they give you a platform to extend that to virtually almost any software as a service application so what they allow you to do is to pick through a gallery of applications that are already compatible with Azure Active Directory and allow you to link you know for example your Salesforce account your Dropbox account whatever it may be your box net link those software-as-a-service applications to office 365 as your Active Directory and have it all still go through your on-premise Active Directory environment so you control that access so in kind of an example of how to do that here's a quick little list of gallery of applications you can see there's quite a few doc you signs that when we see a lot of people using it with Citrix ShareFile it's a good web sharing platform all these are just an example I think there's a couple thousand different applications and it's really easy to get those added so most of the major software-as-a-service applications are going to be compatible with this but an example of of how you can go through and create it you just go through you pick your application from the list you join it to your account and you go and configure the other and the let it know that hey it's joined in my office 365 and it's going to it's going to give you the ability to map those users you know from Salesforce or whatever maybe to your Active Directory environment really allowing you to have a central place to manage that we talked about multi-factor authentication a little bit before you know there's a minute it's also known as two-factor authentication and when they mentioned two-factor what that really means is something you have or something you know so there's the first factor something you know in most cases that's a username and a password you know what that is and then the second factor is something you have whether it's a you know an RSA key fob maybe it's a smart card maybe it's your smart phone that you can get a verification key on that is a second factor you know a lot of compliance mechanisms require you to have multi-factor authentication we deal with some some government entities that require this type of of access into secure systems to really ensure that people accessing it are who they say they are a couple more examples a really primitive example that is really that everybody uses that they probably don't realize is to factor a multi-factor authentication is when you access an ATM you know something you have is your debit card and something you know is your PIN so when you're accessing an ATM you're using a very kind of physical form of two-factor authentication more more so used in the computing environments the cloud environments is the smartphone the token fob or the smart card some other examples beyond that is fingerprint recognition voice recognition or even handwriting recognition you're starting to see introduced in some in some cases where they're really looking to get that extra edge on some of the security so the multi-factor authentication is important kind of outside of the whole single sign-on but I mention it in in kind of this in this presentation just because of most Identity Management single sign-on platforms give you this ability and what's really neat is being able to tailor that there's your Active Directory has some extra levels of subscriptions if you wanted to get some advanced features and one of those are based upon a geographic location so imagine you have a rule in place that doesn't allow logins to your your software as a service or all those applications managed by single sign-on to not allow logins to come from China to not allow logins to come from or to disable a log in when there's login in the United States and login in Asia two hours later it's impossible to get for the United States agent within two hours you can set up time-based restraints to disable accounts when it sees suspicious activity this gives you the ability to do that it really is kind of a game you're applying kind of that next level security to your applications all of these examples are just kind of dealing with you know what's available through office 365 but there's other mechanisms available for providing single sign-on I think Salesforce they run their own kind of single sign-on platform if you maybe don't have an Active Directory environment you can just have everything in your Salesforce account and have it be the broker for those other applications this is kind of a very unique topic as it's it's hard to specialize because every every environment is different as far as what applications they use you know if you have any specific questions or examples that you want to get into more discussion about you know feel free to reach out to me my phone number is on the on the screen there also reach out to you know Scott radarman or your account manager if you want to initiate any further conversation we can't really look at your environments and see you know what we can do to help manage that password sprawl for your users and really make it simplified and give you a better secure platform for access to your applications at this time I'll turn it back over to mr. radarman all right thanks Scott just looking through it looks like we have a couple questions from our audience that came up throughout the presentation the first question was can I use single sign-on with any application not any application so really it's a case-by-case example the two-way street there is the there has to be the ability for that application to have a hook to work outside of it so some of the smaller line of business applications they may not have a mechanism available to trust another source another authentication source but most legitimate applications most applications that have a good development backing have integrated at least Active Directory Integration so you can have that be the login source so really it is a case-by-case basis you know what this presentation really is is to get you asking the question can and can I call my software vendor and ask them what do you guys offer for allowing me to have not have to use a separate login for this application there's about four Active Directory Integration so really I would recommend that to bring that up with your account manager and as a topic for to it to explore okay last question we had so far is do you have to have office 365 to use single sign-on no as I mentioned just a couple minutes ago Salesforce also has a platform there are other third-party providers out there that'll offer basically a they call it paas platform as a service and what you can do is build your identity management solution on top I think ping identity is one of them but there's a number of services that will basically give you Active Directory in the cloud but it's not really Active Directory it's their own identity management platform and just like office 365 and just like Salesforce they allow you to pick from a library of applications that are compatible with it and allow that to broker through their central identity source okay looks like that's all the questions we had again if anything else should come up feel free to contact Scott his information is listed on this final slide and as we've mentioned before if there's any topics of interest for further webinars that you I would be interested in hearing about I'll feel free to tweet at us at Rev underscore group using the hashtag Lunch and Learn be on the lookout we will be sending out some marketing information about next month's a webinar and again if there's any questions feel free to reach out we look forward to being in touch soon thank you
