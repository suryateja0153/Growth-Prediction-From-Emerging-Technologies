 hello I'm John stamps at BMC software this video describes how to configure the new my cloud services console before you start let's go over some preliminaries version for dot 5 introduced the new my cloud services console and we heavily improved it for four dot six this console goes by a lot of different names sometimes it's called the cloud portal web application sometimes it's called the end user portal and sometimes it's called the CLM you I this entire configuration involves mostly manual procedures and for that reason there's lots of room for error take snapshots of your VMs in case you make a mistake we took snapshots of the my cloud services and the platform manager hosts we created self-signed certificates with both the my cloud services and the platform manager host we also used the bundled JRE with the platform manager and the CLM you I I typically use the bundled JRE so that I don't have to worry about which JRE i'm using create a CLM end user to use with the my cloud services console and last but not least configure JRE home on the my cloud services host make sure that you verify that the platform manager is working correctly open a web browser and enter the https path to the platform manager you want to see the following code displayed in your browser log in to the platform manager host stop the BMC CSM service open up your file explorer and change directories into the program files BMC Software BMC cloud lifecycle management platform manager configuration preferences folder select the JSON file and make a backup copy of the JSON file open the original JSON file in a good text editor locate the following lines and update the value line with the correct end user portal hostname and port number change the protocol from HTTP to HTTPS enter the CLM host and change the port number to 8 for 43 coincidentally you're going to be making these same kinds of changes for the self checker base URL right here save the file now we need to delete the cache in the platform manager go into the platform manager configuration directory and delete the org eclipse osgi folder go up a level and go into the cache and select all the cache files and delete them go back to the platform manager folder go into the logs folder and delete all the logs now restart the BMC CSM service it takes about 5 to 10 minutes for platform manager to propagate all of your changes into the JSON we're now going to import the ca certs file on the platform manager host into the JRE on the cloud portal web application host navigate into the JRE home JVM one dot eight lib security and copy the CA search file now go to the my cloud services host an open the temp directory and copy the CA search file there open a command prompt and navigate to the JRE bin directory we're now going to enter the command to the key tool to import the certificate from the platform manager to the end user portal make sure that there are no errors you should see all of the certificates and all the entries successfully imported about 90 of them now we're going to verify that the platform manager is correctly configured in the end user portal navigate to cloud portal web application tomcat web apps clmu I web-inf classes and open the configuration properties in a good text editor make sure that the platform manager URL is correct the host name in the URL must match the host name that you entered when you created the self signed certificate in our environment we had to modify the setting to match the fully qualified domain name that we used with the self signed certificate open the services and stop and restart the CSM portal service we're now going to verify that everything is correctly configured and that we can open up the my cloud services portal go to your web browser enter the following URL in a browser the https um the name of the host the correct port number / CLM you I if you configured the https protocol with a self-signed certificate your connection is initially distrusted in the browser add and confirm the exception you should now see that the my cloud services console is properly displayed log in as a cloud end-user if you configured everything correctly you should be able to open the console successfully otherwise if you see error 500 you've done something wrong and you need to go back and troubleshoot your manual steps and that is that we have successfully configured the end user portal thank you for watching
