go off the air I'll come right back on and don't worry about that so we'll get started my name is John Mayfield I am a real estate broker from Southeast Missouri i received my real estate license at the age of 18 in 1978 so you can do the math and figure out that yes i recently turned 56 years old but I love technology and I I'm in the trenches like you I've owned three offices managed a number of real estate agents kind of actually went from a salesperson to a to a sales manager to a selling broker to just a managing broker and sewed my company a few years ago and I won't bore you with that big long story except to say I'm back in the trenches and I'm a I'm a selling broker again I run a virtual real estate office but I love real estate it's all I've ever done and this tool that I'm going to show you today is really one of the coolest tools I think we've had for real estate professionals and in my lifetime so I'm I am a big our PR fan I love to teach the courses and I do some help with the with the help center and the knowledge base articles and I think you're not going to find this course over the next hour just to be really a tremendous asset for your real estate profession so we're going to cover some of the basics of our PR but cash I would just be bored out of my gourd if all I could show you or some basic things so I'm gonna push the envelope a little bit and show you some really cool things that I'm doing with our PR and just I want you to think outside the box because this tool has some just mind-boggling things you can do for generating more business in your real estate career so we're going to look at a lot of the basic things with our PR but I'm going to show you some really cool things that you can use our PR for as well and I do want you to reach out to me if you have any questions and need help normally I'll get 50 to 60 people that will send me emails and say hey could can i watch that again or could you help me with this and I'm here to help you I want you to know that and there is no charge whatsoever unless you start calling me every day and then I might have to charge you but I am recording this as well and I'll put it on my website so you can watch that so what is our PR I mean I hear a lot of folks give me their explanation or their description or assumption of our PR what is our PR well our PR is this wholly owned subsidiary corporation that's a part of the national association of realtors it's a national database that's parcel centric and has over a hundred and sixty six million properties now every time I mention that bullet point I happen to end up back in my college algebra class I crammed four years of college in 25 that normally gets a good laugh in a live classroom but I i crammed four years of college in 25 i took my college algebra the last semester senior semester and unfortunately we didn't have youtube and all the various aids you could have for helping you study and learn things as students have today but i just didn't get college algebra and the teacher would say did everybody understand that and everybody would nod their head oh yeah we got that and I had no idea what the teacher was talking about so when I read this statement to you and I say oh it's a national database partial centric property information over a hundred and sixty six million u.s. properties what does that really mean and let me show you or explain to you what this means I'm listing a house this week actually already signed the papers we're doing some cleanup and paint on it for the folks I knew these people since I was a little bitty boy it's around the corner from where I grew up in fact there there boy one of their boys it's the same age as me he was born on May twentieth nineteen sixty and bill and I went to school together in fact bill and I shared a lot of our same birthday parties together in every other year we would kind of go back and forth and we would have our birthday party at his house in the next year at my house so I'm listing this house we're literally I had many of my birthday parties with bill just right around the corner from where I grew up Bill's mom and dad built that home Bill's mom and dad never ever put that home up for sale Bill's mother lived there until recently when she relocated to texas to be close to her children so that home has never ever been in the mls if I went to the mls and tried to pull up that property nothing would be there but I can go into RP our type in the address of that property even maybe add the owners last name to help refine the search our PR will find that property pull it up give me all of the information and even suggest what the property should be listed for that's what we mean by this database of over 166 million properties there are properties in the RP our database that have never ever been in your mls yet our PR has quick access to them and gives you lots of really cool cutting-edge information that will just blow you away and best of all as you can see there is no charge for you and I to use this and it's exclusively for realtor members the public has no access to this information now it's not an mls people think that our PR is trying to create this national MLS that is not the case because we get our information from the MLS so our PR could not function if it did not have an MLS so it's not an MLS it's not any kind of a consumer-facing business model so consumers don't have access to go and look at this this is strictly for us we're not Reese indicating or redistributing information it's only available for the national association of realtors now how do I use our PR I use it as a research tool in fact i'm going to show you briefly the the mobile app and if you haven't downloaded the mobile app i'm telling you what you as a real estate professional that has got to be one of the apps you put on your phone you will use it as much or more than you will instant messaging and email on your mobile phone guarantee it's just mind-boggling so it's a research tool it helps you accurately price a property now when I told you that I winton and looked up my friend Bill's mother's property and I found all the information everything I needed to list that property and our PR even said hey John here's what we think the price probably should be listed for I don't take that price and say well that's the list price no it's a computer that's giving me the valuation or it's a computer that's predicting the price based on lots of information we call that an algorithm and we'll talk more about that in a moment I get to use my experience and my knowledge of the market place to help accurately narrow in on what the price should be listed for but I want to tell you our PR does a pretty good job of getting right into the ballpark I find 85 to 90 percent of the time the rvm Realtors valuation model which I'm going to talk about on the next slide is right in the ballpark with my gut feeling so it's a research tool it helps you accurately price of property I'm going to show you how you can farm and prospect with our PR that will just I don't want to oversell but I think it will blow you away what you can do with farming and prospecting with our PR at least I've been using it as a farming and a prospecting tool and it works very good for me it also helps you impress buyers and sellers now what do I mean by that I'm driving to Columbia Missouri a couple of years ago going to teach in our PR course I'm listening to this mp3 of a motivational speaker and he makes his statement on this audio recording that just kind of had one of those wow moments so as he's being interviewed this successful online marketer his name's Joe polish you can go look him up joe said to the gentleman that was interviewing him he goes or made this statement he said you know there's really only one difference between a dollar bill and a hundred-dollar bill and I thought about that for a moment and I thought boy that's interesting there's only one difference between a dollar bill and a hundred-dollar bill and Joe polish said it's the message one of them gives you a dollar bill message one of them gives you a hundred-dollar bill message now if you get nothing else out of this session this afternoon I want you to think about that as a real estate professional are you delivering a dollar bill message or are you delivering a hundred-dollar bill message I'm here to tell you our PR will help you impress buyers and sellers with your reports and you will stand out at a listing presentation a buyers to or an open house it's one of the best reports I've seen it and I'm a tech guy I teach technology all over the world that's what I get paid to do outside of listing and selling real estate and if I don't like a tech tool I don't use it or promote it but I'm here to tell you this report rocks so how can you use our PR you can use it a lot of different ways as a real estate professional now we have one more slide and we're going to get right in and i'm going to start showing you how to use our PR two slides but want to i'll be briefed on these but it's important for you to understand what we're doing and what our PR is all about we have this thing called an AVM and we have an RV m they're both automated valuation models that's what they're called avms have been around for a long long time you probably have had the same scenario that I've been faced with many times you show up at a house you go to show a house you get out of the car and one of the questions the buyers always ask is how come this house is only worth X number of dollars on another website in fact I went to that website the other day just to look up some of my listings and none of the estimates that they were providing were even remotely close to what my list price was and those are called automated valuation models now in Missouri we are a non-disclosure state which means we do not report sales information to the courthouse and in many states like Missouri because those automated valuation models who do not have access to sold data they're not very accurate in fact a lot of times they're downright lousy the unfortunate thing is they're plastered out there on the internet and a lot of people think that their reality or they they believe that while I solid on the internet so it must be true and avms continue to become bigger and more popular and more in demand and banks and county assessors and all of these people want and need access to automated valuation models they want to know what is or what would this portfolio of real estate be worth on today's market and so these companies develop these algorithms that are not very accurate because they don't have good data and they wave their hand or put their website up on the internet and they say we can give you an automated valuation model and people pay for it and so it's become a very big business but it's not a real good tool here enters our PR the national association of realtors basically said you know what if people want automated valuation models and it's not a very good product we think we can do a better job and so we created our own algorithm we labeled it the Realtors valuation model you can see it right there but what's different about our algorithm or our automated valuation which is a Realtors valuation model versus the competition we have access to the MLS don't we we have MLS active we have sold data we have off market data and with all of this data it becomes the highest accurate type of automation automated valuation product that's available so that's why we have our PR that's why it's here and it's not going to go away and and the really cool thing is it's just going to become more accurate over time as the computer models begin to learn what's happening in our marketplace and learns more about what's going on with so data and everything else so it's a very interesting tool and we're going to jump right in now and just get started and take a look at that now remember if you have any questions you can always type that into Joe and she'll be glad to answer those questions so I'm going to bring over my web browser here and i'm going to show you we're on the main page here this is when you would go to our PR and and actually the website is in a are for national association of realtors are pr.com n AR AR pr.com many web many mls is like my mls and st. Louis have a link to our PR right on our mls dashboard some MLS's have what's called deep linking within your mls so there could be many different ways that you can access our PR but if you go to n AR our pr.com you'll you'll come to the website now let's take just a couple of let's take a look here at a couple of things notice that right here we're on the main page we can do a lot of different things right in here in fact notice I have a menu that says all properties I have a menu that says for sale I can search neighborhoods I can even look up school data which is pretty cool and i can look up market activity that i'll show you about and i can even look up my listings right here so we've got a lot of stuff that's going on right here on the on the main page i want to also show you right up here there's a little gear icon this is where you would set up your profile so if you needed to go and and you wanted to add your picture and i'll just kind of jump into that and we'll go right into the gear icon this is where you could set up your mls put your mls IBN you could add your company logo and some more information as well there make sure this is all completed correctly because you want your reports to generate and look very nice and have all of the correct information so that's again is located right up there where the gear icon is right here now I'll be honest with you you know there are some buttons up here that we can go and look at some reports that are generated we can also access the commercial icon I'll show you that a little bit for brokers we have data tools but most of my work I'm right down here in this area right there okay you also have the Help button but again there's some other items some other items here and hopefully i'm still on i noticed the power went out for just a second there but i believe and I'm hoping I'm still on Joe can you hear me okay it's going to okay great yeah that we're having a pretty wild lightning and thunderstorm here so I the power went out but I'm on a backup generator so I should be fine so so I wanted to point that out now for brokers i do want to point out one other item here notice i have my logo right here um get back to my little pin pin here you'll notice that well for some reason I'm I try the highlighter and see if there we go right up here's my logo and I just want you to know that's free of charge so if you're seeing up in this area your mls or perhaps you are not seeing your company logo that is free through our PR and i'll show you how to set that up toward the end so just want to point that out my logos up there your company logo could be up there as well okay so we're going to get started here now and I want to just show you one thing here notice all properties I want you to think in terms when you're searching all properties that you're searching the County Courthouse remember when I said Bill my friend's mother that I listed this week that property when I went to pool that property up I wanted to make sure that my all properties tab was selected then all I needed to do was type in the street address right here and I was able to go in and find that information so right here you can type in the street address if you want to do that in fact I'm going to just type in 212 and I want to show you something 45 if there's if there are any properties out here that are actively listed that begin with 21 to 45 they will auto-populate so you'll notice that as I'm looking for properties if i type in 76 43 you will notice that there's a property in scottsdale arizona that's seven 643 that's an active listing and i can just pull that up right there now i can also write in here i'm going to go back to all properties notice the zip code there is 85 2 667 so if i want to search by zip code i can type in 85 26 and you will see that it's automatically populating to that street address so or that zip code so i can search by street i can search by city and it will always auto-populate i can search by county lots of really interesting ways to search and sometimes i've actually had this in a class where people were saying you know I tried to go out and I tried to find my property and it wouldn't pull my property up if they're in a rural area what we would type in is there street address and over here under the Advanced tab now this is only on all properties under the Advanced tab I can come down here and type in the last name of the person so if i typed in my if i typed in westwood and i have mayfield i could then do a search you know Farmington Missouri I could do a search and it would bring that property up so i just wanted to point that out that sometimes for those of us who were in rural areas if you have difficulty pulling up a property by the street address and you know that person lives on that street type in their street address go to the Advanced tab which is right here on the out to the right and put their last name in and generally that will pull up the property for me you have lots of ways that you can search address zip code county city lots of different areas and again when you're searching all properties I want you to think in terms of searching the county courthouse now if you're searching for sale it's kind of like you're mirroring the MLS so let me show you how this works here let's just type in scottsdale and i'm going to go to I'm a creative spellers at yes we'll go back to Phoenix and here we go Phoenix Arizona I'm going to do the 8500 one and I'm searching for sale and I'm just gonna hit Search and I want you to look at the number over here on the Left where my mouse is 0 then we'll go back to the home screen this is like Geraldo Rivera when he opened the vault sometimes you sometimes you go and you search and nothing's there right we'll try Phoenix Arizona I may have been that zip code but perhaps that zip code is we should have some properties here for those not old enough to remember Geraldo Rivera had a two-hour special one time that was we were going to open up this vault that had Jimmy Hoffa's two minute and we watched for like two hours and at the end of two hours they finally up blew open the door and there was nothing there that's what technology sometimes happens now notice he 8042 properties remember i was searching so there's 8042 properties by the way notice I can search these by I can arrange those but I searched the eight-thousander for sale now let's go to all properties and let's search Phoenix Arizona and we should get a number that is much larger than 8042 why because we're searching the county courthouse and it's looking at all of the parcels of properties that are placed into our PR through the courthouse system that's why we're searching all properties so this number is going to be pretty large remember there's over 100 66 million properties now I tell you this because sometimes I'll have people that will call me after the session or write or send me an email and they'll say John I tried to go in and I've got this listing appointment I tried to pull it up the property won't pull up there so discouraged and they're so upset and I'll always ask them is the property on the market right now and they'll say no and i'll say did you search under for sale or all properties and they always say oh i see what i did wrong i was searching under for sale so when they click the all properties tab run the street address it pops right up and you can see here under all properties Phoenix Arizona we have 415,000 393 properties now I'm here to tell you that i can find properties in our PR faster than i can my mls in fact it's been days since i've logged in to my email the only time I really logged into my mls is to put a new listing in and update information from that respect but most of my work I'm doing through our PR just because I like it I like the information and I did and how easily and quickly I can go and find information in fact notice here on the left hand side if I said you know I really only want to look at the distressed properties in Phoenix Arizona I can quickly check the uncheck the non-distressed and now I'm telling our PR just give me everything that's a pre-foreclosure or a bank-owned property that's out there now I'm I'm under all properties so there may be some properties that have already transferred or sold but I wanted you to see how easy it is to change price bedrooms all kinds of information just from that one check box now keep in mind we're searching everything in Phoenix Arizona so it's going to take a little longer than it may take for a normal MLS if you were searching for sale but 3,500 pre-foreclosures or foreclosed properties under under all properties so you'll really like the fact as you get in to search for properties that are in your mls or if you're if you're going on a listing appointment that's not listed you can go right in and search through all properties so I did a search just a little earlier on Phoenix Arizona came up with a list here I wanted you to see this because over here on the right hand side one of the things I like about our PR is that everything is color-coordinated and so grey represents off market blues for sale red is distressed green is recently sold a darker grey has recently expired dark blue spending and a wine or a dark deep red is pending the stress so as we scroll through you'll see these color coordinated flags and as you become familiar with our PR you'll know that the green represents sold and red is for sale now it makes a little more sense if I select the bigger map and I can start to see these right within the subdivision or the neighborhood now I jumped over here and I pulled up a property for us on I'm going to go right back over here to 23 22 North tenth Street and Phoenix Arizona and so I pulled this property up I wanted us to take a look at a couple of things first of all here's the list price this is a property that's for sale 205,000 and look at the current rvm 184 to 200,000 now let's go back remember what the rvm is it's the Realtors valuation model and it's giving you a price based on data that it's collected and it's put through an algorithm or a computer so that hundred and eighty-four thousand two hundred dollar price that you see for an RV m you have to remind yourself at all times and when I'm when I'm showing this to sellers and n buyers that that is a computer model the computer doesn't know if they've had six dogs and seven cats in the house or the computer doesn't know the surroundings the computer is just saying based on this location this square footage other homes in the area this you know within the lat what is sold within the last period of days we think this house is worth a hundred eighty-four thousand two hundred you will find out that we're going to get to go in and add our experience and knowledge to this now one other thing I can see here is that it's a four-star confidence scale so our PR is basically saying you know we're not real confident about a hundred and eighty-four thousand two hundred dollars because the data we have may not be there in fact if you want to look at the data that our vm that that they used for the rvm you can select view details right below that and I can look at all the comparables right here that they chose now you will find we're going to get to pick our own comps in just a little bit but if I want to look at the details of the rvm I can do that at any time something else that's interesting about this now the rvm is updated monthly and you will see down below here that the rvm is gone up over the last month nine hundred and twenty dollars and it's remained the same over the last 12 months that's important for you to know because properties are being updated content continuously based on what's going on in the marketplace and what our our PR is looking at and analyzing and predicting this is a great prospecting tool right there because now if you sell this house at 23 22 North tenth street phoenix arizona and you closed on it today and you get your commission check today here's the next thing you need to do you need to get your smartphone or your calendar on your computer you need to go 12 months out and you need to follow up with your new buyers that you would be happy to give them an updated valuation on what their properties currently worth using our PR people want to know what their stocks are worth or do every so often why shouldn't we be doing this for sellers and buyers with their properties they have for sale or a perch it bought and sold through us so you have that ability to do that and you need to understand that that our PR is updating these every month now let's go over here to the bigger map in this neighborhood and look at the ability here to see what's going on in the neighborhood in fact if I want to see a Google view I can do that and I can look at other properties that have sold in the neighborhood other properties that are under contract I can look at the next door neighbor's house and see what our PR is calculating it for I can look at other so data I mean all of this information is right here within our PR here's your subject property this is where we're going with data you'll be able to go out on a listing appointment and you'll be able to pull up their house and literally know everything that's going on we have that right now everything that's going on in the neighborhood and if they say well our friends down the street sell their house for 215,000 you actually can pull it up and say here it is right here it's sold for 181 that's all right here within the map area and I and I came to that by selecting bigger map now I can also do some really cool things with these heat maps so if I want to look at what's going on in the market place over the last 12 months I can change and add a heat map here's my subject property and I'm actually able to see in this marketplace that property values are going up and they have been going up I had a listing not too long ago and you probably don't have sellers like this where you're at maybe you do do you ever have a seller that you go out and you tell them what their house is worth and they get real upset with you okay you have those as well I had a lady who got a little bit upset with me because I told her the value of her house and it went the wrong way it went down you know it was like planes trains and automobiles when the people kept hollering at them you're going the wrong way her house was right here and this was a huge big red cell deep dark red cell it looked like a storm was passing over it if you were a weather forecaster and dark red right down here means property values are going down over the last 12 months so you've got tons of information you can look up flood zones this is not in a flood zone but i can see flood zones over there and I know somebody's out there saying right now with John where do they get that bae data where is it from everything is footnoted in our PR so notice if I select the about button it tells me they get the map from FEMA if I go up here and I want to know a concentration of distressed properties I can look at that and I can select the about button and it will tell me where they got the data from the MLS from our PR and some other sources so I've got lots of heat overlays that will help me if I want to do average sales price I can do that I'll be very honest with you the one that tends to work for me and most of my listing presentations is a 12-month change in value I really want to know what's going on in my market place over the last 12 months but you'll have these heat overlays you can use and one of those might be able to help you deliver the message you need to deliver when I go up against competitors in my marketplace and I'm able to to win a new listing or be able to to present an 85 page CMA and trust me I do not print out the 85 pages I go over it with my ipad pro or your laptop and after you go over it with them you pull your smartphone out because the absence sync with your RP our account and I email them a copy right from my smartphone a link and if they want to download the 85 pages they can I don't go through all 85 pages but I go through the high points and what I need to do to win the business and I hear my clients who were customers but who've signed the listing agreement with me at the kitchen table say over and over again man you put a lot of work into that report you did for us I'm just using our PR my competitors are printing out two and three pages from the mls and if you go back to what I'd asked you earlier what's the difference between a dollar bill and a hundred-dollar bill it's the message so you're gonna have to delete this report let you deliver a good message by the way I'm going to go back here and I'm going to just change us to none I want you to see there's tons of things you can do here if I want to search by school districts or zip codes I can refine that if I need to search by distance I can go put them a place on the map and I can find out you know five miles or ten miles and I can search for properties within 10 miles if I need to do drive time I can go out here to drive time and literally I can select if they're driving by car or walking the time of day in the day of week this is a brand new feature hit the apply button and on mondays at 8am it will literally take the information from map onyx and it will put a display for the drive time so you can do that by day by time of day by driving or walking and here's the one feature that I really like a lot I'm going to drill in a little bit closer and I want to use the polygon and we're going to draw a map around this subdivision right here now this is whispering pines meadows we'll call it bogey estate so why don't we call that so I've driven drew a map around that subdivision and i'm going to select save i'm going to call this boggy creek subdivision and i'll select ok now i can go on and search boggy creek but here's what i've done if we go back to the home screen and we go to the saved button right here and i scroll down here look there's boggy creek subdivision I just saved that it's going to pull up all the results for bogey Creek subdivision 76 properties what I want you to think about doing next is selecting reports and we're already on market activity report I want you to go back one month and i want you to these will all be checked and i want you to uncheck open houses and expired listings and i want you to run the report now i can go on and work while that report is generating in fact this is pretty cool today's june first right so we've got somebody on the call who says john i want to begin the farm boggy creek subdivision i want to own that subdivision I want people if they're thinking about buying or selling the think of me and nobody else so what we're going to do is create a web page on our website call mayfield re forward slash bogey creek we're now going to send out postcards to everyone in the subdivision telling them that if they go to WWE field re forward slash bogey creek they'll be able to find out the latest information for their subdivision on what's going on in the real estate market and in fact you can get as creative as you want we're going to now embed that report on our website what i would do is encourage you to create some type of mechanism and there's lots of ways to do that so that in order for them to download the report they have to give you their name and email address that way you can send them the report email email it to them every month but it doesn't matter we could do postcards and spend 60 or 70 bucks we're driving them to our website we're driving them to this special peut page that specifically for their division you can then even do a green screen and be like the weather forecaster and have the report behind you and point out specific things on the report or you could just do a short video welcoming them to your website and that they can download the latest report and if they're thinking about buying or selling you'd love to help them and once this report is generated will be able to click on this report and download that so we'll come back to that in just a little bit but that's one of the really cool things we can do through using this market activity and again I drew that map through the the map area so going back to 23 22 North Street tenth street again we were on we were on the summary page there and literally we didn't even we didn't even get down here below I have all the listing agent information I have all of the historical records if I need to go in and I want to look at this house back in 2005 I can now look at what this house sold for back in 2005 and all of the information sometimes I find photos that are there but going back that far they're normally purged our PR is not going to purge any photos from this point forward but I can look at all the data right there if I want to come up here and say well that house was also in the market back in February I can pull that up and see the same exact information notice the historical rvm is 143 the current our VMS 142 so I love that feature right here it's on the right compare historical data I have information about what's going on in Phoenix I have the public records versus the MLS records if I need to make changes I can do that I can add notes into the system and I love this little map here it has helped me explain information to my customers and clients and normally what I do it's the median estimated home value I uncheck the county and I uncheck the state because what I'm trying to do is compare my property to the zip code and you can see if you were working with a buyer they should feel pretty confident that they're not buying at the high end of the market if if you have a seller they should feel pretty good that they're right in line with the median estimated home value so you can do some really creative cool things with the map there I have price change history I have distressed information this property at one time was a distressed property I could go on down and look at more information school information legal in Arizona you can even download the Platts tax information and so much more so schools are over here just lots of data and information and that is just the first page now if we jump over to the history tab we get more information this in my mls to go find prior mls transactions it's just you just pull your hair out because you have to put greater than and equal it's just it's a nightmare I haven't figured out a way to do it any easier I just look properties up in our PR I go to the history tab scroll down check the MLS records and all of the mls records are right here if this property it sold four times it would all be right here tax assessment I can go back and look at the tax assessment back in 2011 2010 2009 8 so all of this data is right there if mortgage information was available I'd have that and I see that a lot all of this information again is right here I can also compare the historical data and I can go over to charts and I can discuss and show charts until my heart's what's what's the word I'm looking for you could show all the charts and graphs you want do I go through all of those no I don't want to bore somebody with nine million charts and graphs but there might be one chart that helps me deliver the right message to get the property priced where it needs to be priced so that's on charts and now we're going to come to refine value this is a really cool spot because I can now come down here and I can begin to have a conversation with the customer and if they've added something like a bathroom last April in 2015 and they updated their bathroom and spent twenty thousand dollars I can add that it's an upscale bathroom and look what happened it gave them ten thousand six hundred eighty six dollars for their bathroom things we need to be having conversations we need to be having with our customers I hired a guy to do some work for me recently some tech tech work on my website I I'm a tech technology speaker but I'm not a geek and I don't know I know enough about programming to be dangerous so I hire that kind of stuff out i want to get somebody who knows what they're doing and so i went to his website called up work it's pretty cool website I've been hiring some virtual assistants to do work there and and i had i put my job that I needed done out and i probably had 15 people who responded and all said they wanted to do work and could do it for that price but i had one person who asked me a lot of questions about my goals and my you know this that they were asking questions and it was interesting to me and i hired that person and it dawned on me am i taking that same kind of interest in my clients and customers i'm just trying to to open your mind to the fact that when you go out on a listing appointment sellers may want you to ask them what have you done to your house some new things you've added over the last couple years and now you have this really awesome tool that you can go out find their repairs add the date and the price and you can give them value value for the property my sellers love it when I do that so I have remember the rvm is just a computer we are now taking your knowledge and your experience and you on the ground looking at the property talking to the seller and putting that to help refine the rvm so that it's a very good price and here's where you can add if the markets very good you can move that over if your markets slow you can move it this way you can if the condition of the outside of the home needs some work you can move that down if the interior needs some work you can move that down and look what's happening everything's being adjusted see then it's taking value away so if the view is not great or the lot size is not great so we're making changes now and our PRS are doing all the calculations for us and that is all on this refine value now we're going to move over to comp analysis and just like we would in the mls we're going to lees we're going to confirm the facts nine times out of ten that i'll just stay the same we're going to find the comps and I would encourage you just to leave this all alone because the computer is basing the scenario similar to what an appraiser has to look for and so just leave this alone and select search now if you need to come by come back if you're in a rural area and you need to go out further in months or you need to enlarge the search the search area you can always do that or if you want to draw a box around a subdivision you can do that but I would encourage you to leave that alone and select search by the way there's a keyword if it's lakefront or waterfront you can type that in and you would only pull up comps it had those those areas so something I change there I think I hit something will will search I must have hit something by accident I didn't when I was moving this around so let's zoom out and we'll modify the search and we'll try this again because normally in phoenix arizona i always get tons of comps so i must have clicked a button by accident but maybe not there's only five here so i'm going to add these comps right here I mean must be in a specific area Phoenix and so notice I'm adding all of these comps and I'll update the valuation and close and it's course it's giving me a real wild number because if I go back here to edit these comps i'm going to edit the comps some of these comps were really low in price so like that's 53,000 i would probably remove that and remove some of these others i think somehow i got moved around on my butt will update the valuation and close and again this number is going to be totally off so we can put our own our own numbers in here if we want to and of course I don't know I don't know anything about this market so sometimes I have to go in and draw maps in certain areas and I do that but now I I can adjust my comps and here i can rate this if this comps worse or better and I can come down here and i can add notes to the comp which I find very useful because on my iPad I'll highlight those and circle those for the client I can put these in the order so if this is the best comp and I want to put that there I can rearrange my comps and I'll update the valuation and close and i'll print the report and again if i want to uncheck any pages I can but I'm here to tell you I would just run the report go over it on your computer and then email them a link and they'll be very impressed trust me so let's go back to this one report we had a minute ago the bogey creek subdivision and I want to show you what that looks like because it's a really nice report it's for this subdivision and now I'm able to drive people to my website and they can download this report they can see what's for sale in their neighborhood they can see what's sold and lots of other information really a cool report now one of the things that I've done on my website is I've taken these reports and I've actually put them into a little program called flip builder we're just about done as well too so we're just about covered everything I have a couple more items but here is flip builder and now I've created a digital magazine so this is a neighborhood report I can share this via email I can put this on Facebook LinkedIn or Twitter and drive people to my website but i actually have all of my communities right here i also went and created a little subdivision I'm in the process of building this but here is log cabin Lane I have a drive-through where I used my GoPro camera and my bicycle they can download the latest market activity report they can sign up to get this report right here on my website those are just some really cool things that you can do using the reports with our PR and making if you want to farm an area to really become the expert in that farm people want to know what's going on with real estate values in their area and now you have this really awesome tool that you can do that notice there are some areas throughout our PR where you can find out more about the neighborhood so here is the neighborhood section and look I can get housing people economy tons of data all of these make great tools to share on your Facebook page if you wanted to share that I can jump over here and look at the housing I can look at people facts I can look at the economy and again tons of information I can even go right over here and look at how many days of sunshine and how many days of snow the annual rainfall and again I took all of that and I put that right into my communities using a digital flip book to where people could look at that right right from their computer so that is part of the neighborhood report and you can access that by going to the home button selecting neighborhoods and then type in a neighborhood in fact we can find i'm going to type in kingston mines illinois and search i can get a neighborhood report for any community in the united states remember i'm in part of the national association of realtors are PRS for us so if you have someone who's being relocated to orlando florida I can go into orlando florida and now if they're going to the 806 zip code i can get them a neighborhood report specifically for that zip code these are great reports to have at an open house they're great reports that you should share with human resource managers in your marketplace that you could share these with the Chamber of Commerce have those downloaded to your phone or put them on your website there's really some good information there we can do the same thing with school activity I basically showed you market activity through a subdivision but you can do that for a city or a zip code and you can pull up that information as well now keep in mind that there is right up here where I selected residential if you select commercial you actually have access to lots of commercial tools we don't talk about that on this webinar but I will tell you there are some great reports that you could share with your chamber of commerce again with human resource managers when I talk about the ability to network and to prospect and to use our PR to really stretch the boundaries there are some just mind-boggling things you can
