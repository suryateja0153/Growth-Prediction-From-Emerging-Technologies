 so we have a cloud architecture over here okay we first of all has a local system so I'll be first starting the broker alright so i have a broker which is starting the broker is running at port number 192.168 point 1.3 right i am going to get connected with the broker such that it can link to the surface s right you know i should also be signing into my SkyDrive account because this broker is a gateway to the so if I'm not logged into skype and it's going to ask me my credentials and it's going to ask whether a green to get dumps and conditions everything is fine with the login is successful it's going to take me to my SkyDrive okay at the same time it will show that this guy's name is connected right now I have it now this whole architecture is based on MQTT protocol and database management system for no SQL system which is used in the cloud let's have use ready server for no SEO system so what happens is first of all in the virtual machine in each of the virtual machine we need to we need to so I'm starting a totally free virtual machine 1 i'm starting in this system also i am starting up one server in this system also okay so every virtual machine will have the whole principle of the cloud late is that we need to keep the files in the memory running memo not in the hard disk such that we can access the file fast and then we shall be connecting to the server okay now i am going to connect to the broker say my broker address is this address 192.168 11.3 so I should get connected with a broker so as it gets connected with the broker we should see that you know service broker has already received on Rick okay with a system with amount of memory it will keep on updating its imperial eagle a 21-20 server many meantime from the other system the other virtual machine which is located another system I am going to start another virtual machine just get connected so this is its local server and I will be connecting to broken which is 192.168 point one point three so yeah as I connected with the crooked in the brokers smpc it shows that there are totally to virtual machines available right now and all of their memory map is also going to be alone I am starting the third virtual machine in one more system which is at IP address 192 168 1 point 6 right now here also i need to run its own local ready storage to keep the files in memory and then i need to connect it faith 192.168 point 1 4 3 which is the address of the broken you can see and that the broker has also received the connection i just got totally 3 virtual machines right txt file created at one particular virtue say for example let me click on extract at a remote system called hello you let's see this as clown late or PhD now let us upload this file from one of the local system so let's just upload this file by name txt chocolate up PhD see you know once the file can see once the file has been uploaded the file is basically split and systems will have different version of the file so what is the current version sake loudly dot txt is Ben now converted into two jocks okay one chunk is saved in 192.168 point 1.3 and another one is stored at 1.4 okay why 1.3 and 1.4 if you look carefully these two have the higher memory / 19 two point one point six okay so therefore this system has the two chunks now how do you understand what is the chunk now this particular system over here see also half our data ok that is this except in its local memory so how do you know that the style has been saved in the local memory right so what we can do is we can actually log into its local memory through something called Reddy's Klein ok we can hear Keys star you can keep T star out of lot of files you can see one file by name files understood very slowly yeah you can see one file by name files underscore cloudy light dot txt underscore 0 so if I show gate cloud let gate files underscore cloud lead dot txt underscore 0 so it has got seven dates hello cloud let base okay now my whole file was hello cloudy late based solution now in this particular system I have cloud let base hello cloud-based why a big portion of the memories in is same this is 192 168 1 point 3 it has got almost double the memory in respect to the other system which is connected so it has saved about ocean of big chunk in this virtual client and listen I won't have to tell in this virtual climb now if I log into the other virtual plane here also I can show the data in the memory directly that is if I log in is star so choose files on us for Cloudland dot txt others for 1k files underscore cloud late it is case sensitive cloud let dot txt underscore one ok solution so cloudy late bass bass up to e is their remaining the store over here no not only it is going to do that so now they fight now the files are in the memory of the system okay this is a local Cloudland but the files is available directly at the ram level okay but the same time what the project does is it also split the files and it's going to put the files so my file was split into two parts both the part separately is being saved at the same time frame let's see so now we can see the files what was then yeah you can see cloud late dot tips proudly at dot txt underscore 0 if you click on this you'll be able to see the file exactly on the local sky greg i can download and i can visualize right so two parts both the parts have been saved in this guide right okay now from a third system from one more system see this particular system let me close down this from this particular system i am going to generate an option called show financing cloud length as i show it is going to show the number of texts which is I mean number of files which is available over here the same thing I can show here also so in the virtual machine when I say show the files the virtual machine is going to show the files that is been saved however the client who is trying to retrieve the file will not be shown what percentage is stored over where okay he'll be already shown with the number of files which is available now let us as you see this is T so this is the broken ring you can see that this memory is keep on getting changed in the real time as their memory is going to change now what I'm going to do is now this system 192 168 1 point 4 had jumped number one all right what I'm going to do is I'm going to totally closed this system ok as I close this system you see what happens is it immediately gets updated their friend it immediately gets updated and that system is not now there is a problem we have a final seal it I have a funny which has got two copies to two versions okay one version is available locally however one version was available with a system which is no more connected so now let us try to retrieve this file from one more system so for example let us show for example from here the virtual machine is just click this and let us in download okay so as I said download so I've closed on virtual machine okay see it's going to show me immediately that one virtual machine is mental strength straight you see if I start money no SQL server and connect to the server connect to the 6 a-3 connect immediately becomes a new client has gone okay well then show the files in the cloud it shows the file list of it as I said download see two chunks it is receiving directly okay and the full file is available over here hello cloud left bridge system isn't it the whole file is not available over here one file has been sent from 192 168 1 point 3 another is being sent from a 1.4 now you try to understand what is the advantage of the work that we have done generally the data is acquired by the broker they are combined and then that is pushed to the client which is requesting I have done one more modification that is whoever request for a whoever request for a 50 K server does not collect all the chunks combined and send it server just till those lines which are holding the text file to send them directly to the claim see in ideal cases what happens is if the file size is big there are suppose 5 Charles first server has to tell all the virtual machines to send it all the jumps it has to combine all the chunks and then it has to push those chumps into the I mean correctly but here the modeling isn't that girl is the server notifies the virtual machine to transmit its chunk directly to the client which is requesting so the claim receives the data directly from 192 168 1 point 3 which is that system that virtual machine
