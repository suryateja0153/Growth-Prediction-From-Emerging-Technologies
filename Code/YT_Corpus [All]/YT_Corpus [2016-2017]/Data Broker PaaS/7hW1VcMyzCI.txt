 now my goal obviously is to make the most of this 45 minutes in the 45 minutes that we have folks my goal is to really give you all a proper expectation as far as what you can expect as a ports investor I know that we have people in the room to trade all different you know all different kinds of markets and from stocks the options to I mean I can go on and on but obviously I do absolutely love the forex market so what I wanted what I want to show you today when we get into life Marty here just a few minutes is I want to actually talk about a strategy you know a method of trading a way that you can literally take advantage of market movement early on in the morning to basically if you read the title says trading daily highs and lows for same-day returns also known as the one in breakout strategy and so as we move along we'll talk more about that but I do have to give you the good old disclaimer that trading does have its own form of risk involved so you should never invest money that you cannot afford to lose and you always want to trade with equity management in mind there is no such thing as an undefeated season you make your losses from time to time but the keys to keep your profits high and have minimal losses now Rihanna slee a great job with the introduction I appreciate that my friend and once again you know I did I basically you know do what the system of life tells you to do you know go to schools so the hot debate and so I did that grew up in Orlando Florida once you see death I did to up whence University of aiming school of law and I was in my 20s when I really just kind of you know it just kind of done upon me that all right this is not what it's really cut out to be you know I want to be financially independent and be able to travel and you know serpents do things that i love but i was making just enough to pay my bills and that was it and so ultimately that's how i was introduced to the forex market the trading you know and Here I am today so once again we talked about that so I want to spend too much time on on my story but once again everybody has their story you know as far as how you were introduced to the market and why you're here today now the company that's going to be backing you on they are MTI and the stands for market traders institute and we are an education company and I will let you know folks that what's pretty awesome is I'm very big on credibility I'm very big on you know taking a look at the credibility factor to all right if I'm going to listen to somebody from an alert than somebody or learn from a company what have they accomplished would have been what have they been able to produce and do and what's cool is that you notice that it says they're big you know logo there this is 21 what's awesome is that this month marks are twenty two year anniversary because obviously it is April and so we've been around for 22 years we are based out of Lake Mary / Orlando Florida and I we do over 30,000 students from all corners of the globe we are nominated in a year after year as you know one of the best companies to work for best trading platforms and I can go on and on but once again what am I telling you this because it all falls on credibility now one more thing I want to talk about is is success when it comes to trading the market every single every single quarter brokers they have to basically do their analysis I don't know how many of you are aware of this but the average forex trader claims that there are only about thirty three percent profitable and that's fairly dismal if you ask me um I didn't make this up this from data collected every quarter by brokers the survey well we did the same thing here at MTI except for all of our students and here is the difference is that MTI students were eighty-five percent more prop more profitable you know then the average trader out there and once again it's all falls on credibility however one thing I want to talk about right now because I'm going to pull up my charts here the next probably two minutes or so is not only do we have some of the absolute best um you know instructors and strategies but we also have some of the best analysts and traders in the forex industry and one specific instructor I want to make note of is josh martinez he's also known as the FX pathfinder now he is one of our product experts and the reason I'm letting you know about you know for those of you wondering who is he why are you letting us know about him you're the one basically teaching us today well it's because this is the gentleman that that for the most part taught me what I'm going to be showing you today here's one of my personal coaches for those of you that like what you see you're going to have the ability to actually plug and put into different into different sessions and two different lessons and training sessions that we have why that you can actually plug in with him for those of you that do like what you see however yes trained thousands of Ford's investors he's turned initial depaul the best enough 502 generated over 39,000 dollars of profit made thousands of forest investments published author international speaker pro analyst and a full-time trader now to give you an idea of a realistic track record became for example back in june fifth 2011 he opened up a trading account with just 500 US dollars and what does gave him the ability to do was the trade with a micro position and when he first started trading maybe like many of you you know he was only making around two to five dollars per trade and losing two to five dollars per trade and I can definitely relate to that as well but when he started to go into the education that MTI offers he started noticing patterns in the market now if we fast-forward he was able to take time compounding build residual income and through the course when he was able to obviously he put more money in and this is what allowed him to see higher returns a higher daily returns of up to four thousand and five thousand dollars per day in profits he was even withdrawing $10,000 at a time and what once took him six months working five and a half days a week to make as a personal trainer it was now doing in one single day but I want to ask all of you of a not very honest question how many of you would like to learn the skill you know typing yes or me if you would obviously like to get to a point where you can actually see these type of results no matter where you're at and where you know whatever you've been able to accomplish now one more thing that I do want to in fact talk about is a graph and and once once again one thing I didn't tell you early on that I will say now is I personally like to look at you know verify track records and things of that nature and so if you take a look at his track record which is third party verified you'll see if he hasn't gained a 4548 point eighty-two percent return on his initial deposit investment now if you take a look at the bottom of the screen you'll notice the graph of this growth it shows that he was making money losing money and all the sudden things absolutely just spike and took off in September of 2012 we like to call this a tipping point and that's what I'm here for today's to show you the exact strategy or one of them at least that's really been able to assist Josh and myself and funding our tipping points too I hope you assist you in finding your tipping points faster so let me go ahead and put the chart get into it and I'm going to go ahead and ask each and every one of you if you can please type in a wife or yes when you see my charts up on your screen let me go ahead and grab those real quick all right once again I'm just pulling them up right now all right there we go all right they were in fact on a different monitor so one second here alright so once again if everyone can see my charts let me know I just got the bot pulled up all right good stuff thanks everybody and all right now everyone should be good all right thank you everyone dirt tomorrow Lawrence Jim berry Mohammed everyone should be good to go it was actually uh actually plotting my screen for a moment it's like a fulsome up alright so once that once again what you're looking at right now folks is this is our ultimate charting software this is proprietary to us here at MTI this is the charting software that we are going to provide all of our students with here Adam TI even do decide to once again enroll in our ultimate raiders package our main program now one of the things that i want you to do right out of the gate is i want you to write down all six of these currency pairs you'll notice these are all on Great British Pound crosses we have the pound Ozzy the pound japanese yen pound canadian pound new zealand how swiss franc in the pound u.s. dollar now you'll also notice that these are all on a one-hour turn frame now a lot of you are going to wonder and ask me Michael can we use this strategy on you know multiple currencies and I'm not going to say no but I'm also going to let you know that I specifically personally use this strategy with the pound specifically so can't not going to tell you you can't but I am going to tell you there's a reason why we do what we're about to do with the out now once again folks would that being said the first thing I want to do is let me just go ahead and pull out of the pound JPY so we're going to go with the great first time against the Japanese yen on a one hour time frame and the very first thing that I want you all to understand is I want you to know how the market moves that's very basic fundamental movement the market is going to move in a wave-like pattern that's going to do this over and over and over again now you'll notice the markets going to form lows the markets going to form highs the market is going to form lows and highs and lows and highs and it's going to do this over and over and over again however if you really look closely at what the markets doing it's actually forming lower lows and lower highs lower lows and lower highs lower lows and lower highs and then it goes up it's going to form higher highs and higher lows similar to this right and so what goes up must come down and what goes down must come up it's just the nature of the beast it's what's going to happen and the beautiful thing about the forex market that I personally love is that you only have two options you're either buying or selling and that's it y'all with me on that and so you know the one of the things like I said about you know the one thing I like about the forks north compared because I do trade options as well but one of the things I love about the forex compared to other markets now putting any other market down is that like I said it's a buy or sell market so you have a 50 I mean yeah of course like any other market but I mean literally that's all you have those are the only two options are either buying or selling so understand that you have 50-50 chance of being right or being wrong just by simply guessing which means that if you had a deep strategy that makes how many of you agree with me that the percentage will fall highly in your favor just by simply adding a decent strategy to it right so what I want to do right now is let's go ahead and I want to actually demonstrate this for you show you what we're doing go over the strategy with you on a blank part of the charts it's a little bit easier to understand and then we are forced going to actually apply them to the market and the very first thing that I want to talk about is I want all of you to understand one little basic thing and let me go ahead and actually increase the size of this so it's a little bit easier to see all right there we go okay so once again let's go ahead and do it now okay so one of the things that I want you understand about the market is that the market is going to basically for the most part it's going to repeat itself over and over and over again and one of the neat things that I love about the market is the market is going to provide you with what you with what we call a high and or low now it will basically provide you with a high end or low typically two times a day now you could argue that it's going to be provide you as more highs or lows and you might be you actually to be right right referring to what you're actually referencing however there's two main high or lows that the market is going to provide for you and let's just go ahead and cover the time so the first higher low will typically form between the hours of 2 a.m. eastern time and five a.m. eastern time okay so that's once again that's the first higher low of the day between 2am and five a.m. eastern time now the second higher low of the day that is going to form anywhere between the hours of 8am eastern time and 2 p.m. eastern time now how many of you type in a wife or yes if you agree that the first higher load of the day would be much much easier to find the second high or low of the day because the first I love the day do a three hour gap in time opposed to a six hour gap in time yes how many of you would agree with me on that so the first thing I want you to understand about the strategy is we are going to be focusing in specifically on the first higher low of the day between the hours of 2 a.m. and 5am now the next thing I want you to next thing for those to be taken us next thing I want you to understand is that we are going to be focusing in on a specific candle specific candle and that is going to be a 3am candle that we're going to actually wait for it's going to determine what we're going to actually do and it'll make more sense when actually get back to that and actually apply it and show you what i'm referring to now the next thing i want you to know is that and this is very important to understand because the distance covered between the low and the high or the high and the low of the day this is known as average daily trading range a lot of you're familiar with the term obviously right but let me just go ahead and type this out for you average daily trading range now the average daily trading range right right now with the forex market is I'm going to say anywhere between 50 pics oops there we go 50 pips and 250 excuse me now one of the things and by the way that's depending okay that's within a single day depending on market fluctuation now we're going to be focusing in on going after a minimum of 50 bits okay so once again we could be going after more than 50 pics however we will not be going after less than 50 pips alright so at a minimum we're going after 50 pips now let's talk about profit let's talk about return on investment and by the way Paul I'm going to talk about that my friend is asking what time exactly is a 3am candle the beginning or the end of the hour and Paul but I'm going to get into that next okay my friend but let me cover one more thing before I talk about that Paul and I want to talk about basically your profit you know your profit in this market folks it's really going to depend and when I say it depends here's what I mean there's three major lot sizes they traded in the forex market depending on your investment that will determine what your ROI will be now let's get into this real quickly so we can up apply all this to the actual charts so the very first basic smallest law size you can enter into is none of a micro lot a micro a lot is a twenty-dollar mess and one tip is is basically worth ten cents okay now the second lot size this is going to be known as a mini lot a mini lot is a two-hundred-dollar investment and one pic is worth one dollar and finally you have the largest lot size available this is known as a standard lot a standard bought is a two thousand dollar investment one pic is worth ten dollars now would that be instead folks let me go ahead and correct that real quick all right now one of the things one of the beautiful things about this market is that we trade with leverage right a lot of you are aware of what leverage is for those of you that are not just if you're taking notes make sure that you write this down leverage equals find power okay that's it leverage equals buying power we have leverage here in the US for example we trade with a 50 to 1 leverage and everything you want to be showing you as you move along is going to be as if we're trading with a state or a law that's the example I'm going to use as we move along and so if I tell you that we captured 50 pips and I tell you that 50 pips equates the 500 US dollars that is because i'm using a standard but as the example and i'm not getting into broker fee spreads margins or anything like that for those of you that you know get pretty detailed and technical it just depends on your broker but i'm not getting that details the sake of time okay so as we move along let's get let's get out let's move on just some takeaways we're focusing on the first tire low of the day 3am candles the candle we're focusing on we're going out to a minimum of 50 pips could be more but it will not be less and we are going to be utilizing a standard lot as the example okay so let's everybody good let me get a wife or yes if you're good everyone doing awesome let's go ahead and clean this up let's delete all this and I am going to move on all right I get stuff thanks everybody for the confirmation there all right so let's go ahead and get right into things now first thing I want you all to take a look at the very first thing that I want you all would notice is is I want you to take a look at this downtrend for example all right now when you look at this downtrend obviously you notice the market is in fact forming lower lows and lower highs lower lows and lower highs lower lows and lower highs and it's doing this over and over and over again however what I really want you all focus on is I want you to take a look at and I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and start with the first 3am candle that I find all right so take a look right here does everybody see this 3am candle right there when we get a wiper yes everyone doesn't fact see this 3n candle right there when you go ahead and find it again okay everyone see that split up red says 3am well do you notice how there's a directional push down and going down towards the south from that candle everyone see that so within a few hours you notice the market is actually moving down towards the south now if we go ahead and measure pits I'm going to go ahead and grab my ruler tool I want to measure from right here to right there how many of you I want you want to take a look at the top left hand side of your screen does everybody see the little four lines of data that appear top left hand side look at the third line down or it says range with pips and parentheses can everyone type in the number that they see and don't worry about the decimal place just type in the main number 130 if you see it not because I said it but if you see it Anthony good job tomorrow Harry James Lawrence good stuff so that's telling us so four lines of information right the first life is the date the time and the price we got in second line is the date-time price we got out third line is how many pips we captured fourth line is bars right so it's saying if we're on a one hour time frame and it says eight bars that means that it took eight hours to fulfill right so 130 pips would equate to one thousand three hundred dollars standard position now if we go ahead and move along I can sit here and do this all day long and by the way one thing I want you to know is will put for the record does everyone see this 3m candle right here all right do you notice how right at the 3am candle depressional push going down towards the South once again yes or no alright so once again take a look right here 3am market moves in a downward manner and once again folks if we take a look the market basically moved 130 fits again in a matter of four hours and so moral of the story folks why am i showing you this over and over and over again is because i want you understand that at 3am the market is going to move typically going to move an upward or downward direction and there's a reason behind it all right so let's go ahead and move on let me show you how to apply the strategy and what what exactly are we doing here and as we go ahead and move along all right let me advance the wall here so we can get closer to live market of course all right now let me take a look okay it's too far back when i get i want to get a little bit closer life market obviously and show you how this works okay so first thing i want a first thing i want first thing i want everybody to understand first thing i want everyone to do especially for those of you that that are in fact taking notes is i want you to notice how i am going to advance the market forward and i want to start at a closer time okay let's start right here okay now i'm going to advance forward advance it forward and boom okay so first thing does everyone agree with me that we alright so first thing going to do the very very first thing we're going to do when we apply the strategy is the moment we identify our 3am candle and i'm going to type this out for you once again 3am candle is we are going to do two things right out of the gate we're going to do this every single time this is never going to change we're going to place two words on the lines on 3m candle the first tour is all line is going to be known as my entry by now i will i will let you know this folks the FBI is going to be we type stop for you the entry by is going to be plus 10 pips above the high okay so it's going to be plus 10 pips above the 3am wick hi so if we take a look right here we're going to move this plus 10 pips above and that is going to bring us to write about there now if we take a look at if we if we measure pips you'll notice that we are right at 10 pips right I'm going to see that so once again that is going to be the entry by now the next thing we're going to do is we're going to place another horizontal line at the bottom of that candle and that's going to be minus five pips below so let's drop that down five pips right there now here's what I want you to know that this can this horizontal line this is going to be known as our entry cell now there we go entry cell is going to be minus five pips kilo the 3am wicklow never going to change we're going to do is every single time right out the gate all right so everyone would be so far entry by entry cell now remember we are not in the market buying or selling yet okay these are nothing more than pending orders I want you to understand that so we're not buying or selling their pending orders now what we're going to do is we are going to wait for the market to either move up or move down which ever whichever zone and when I say zone whether my entry by zone or my entry cells on whichever horizontal line is is a hit first is going to indicate if i'm going to buy or i'm going to sell now folks question did we cross into our entry by or our entry cell okay we cross into our entry by zone right so i am immediately going to go ahead and mark that and by the way for those of you just to kind of so it's a little bit easier to keep track of this i'm going to put an orange arrow next to the 3am candle okay right there and also you'll notice that the market did in fact cross to the entry by zone right there so what we're going to do now is we are looking to in fact by the market now what we're going to do okay there's a couple things going to do before we do anything else and it's very very simple understand I want you to take a look at this right the moment we identify that we are looking to buy we are immediately first and foremost first thing we're going to do is we we're going to basically excuse me we're going to mark this right so our entry by now officially becomes our market pie okay next thing we're going to do is our entry cell okay it's it's gone we are now going to set up our stop now our stop is going to be placed at the 3am wick low okay so once again the stop if you don't know how to stop is understand that a stop is designed to protect you if you're buying the market goes down it'll it'll take you out okay now my stops going to be the 3am wicklow so that's going to be right there and the next thing i want you to know and let me just go ahead and type this out so my stop is going to be at the 3am wick low now how many pics am I going after well what we're going to do now folks is we are now going to measure what our risk is okay so how many of you can tell me how many pips am i risking day how many pips am i risking you can tell me 83 test right now for those of you that want to want to risk any three pips you can do that you can do it one to one however if you also want to do a two to one you can do that as well now when we get it when we get you into the different strategies when we get you into the live sessions where we talk about multiple strategies including one and break out we're going to teach you different ways ways and methods of what we're doing why we're doing what we're doing and where if you want to personally okay make put a risk to reward where look you know what you're risking half of that you can do that and so for instance if I go ahead and I advance the market for sears no one ever each and every one of you take a look at all right does the market move in an upward direction yes or no does everybody see that yes or no did the market move up now once you want to take a look at this ready if the market now look how many pips the market move the market moved how many pics did the market move in the upward direction it moved up 111 tips right now I want you to take a look at this if we were to go ahead and set our stuff at the 3am wicklow then we would be risking 83 pits right so our risk would be 83 pics risk now our reward okay understand this if our risk is 83 and we decided to go with an 83 paper award which you can obviously do that because once again like I said a lot of times what you can do is a one-to-one now if I decided to go after 83 pips take a look here okay that would bring me to roughly that would bring me to the 162 point does that would basically bring me right there at the top of that candle everyone see that now take a look at this if my reward okay take a look real quickly if my reward was right there and we're going to call this this is our 83 pick reward plus eighty three pips reward which obviously it turned into a profit right so for plus if we're up 83 pips that would equate to 830 dollars profit and it took how many hours one two three four hours to fulfill that now folks question type in a wife or yes in the chat box if you would be pretty excited if you were able to enter into the market set your set yourself up with a stop set yourself up with a limit and then you go back to bed because listen a lot of you are saying my gosh this is early in the morning I don't know if I can wake up I don't know about staying up this you know number one you're not staying up this late okay number two would you all be okay with waking up in the morning setting yourself up going back to sleep and letting the market take its course right and once again that's what you have to and by the way somebody's asking when was this this was yesterday or the day before hey this was the day before yesterday all right now what I want to do is if we go ahead and advance the market forward all right let's I want to show you one more thing here and then I'm gonna want to kind of move on to the next thing by the way how am i doing on time I got about 15 minutes left all right I kind of forgot about the time thing so I'm not used to having a 45 minute time frame I'm used to like having a couple hours so let's let's get going here okay now let's go ahead and go to today but there's everybody would be typing a why free yes if everyone's with me so far if it's making sense obviously you have questions and you know I I respect that fully okay but but as everyone would be so far okay so what I want to do now is let's go ahead and go to this morning alright and that is going to bring us to right there all right now I want everyone to take a look right here and I want everyone to take a look at what's happening and what we're doing I'm going to delete everything on the screen want to back this up and and by the way for those of you that are saying is this today yes okay this is live market can't go any further we're going to look at this morning and what took place now what we're going to do now is going to obviously we're going to look to identify the 3am candle now here is the 3am candle everybody see that okay 3m candle two day now once again we're going to do two things it's never going to change give me the same thing every single time we're going to place two words on a line the first one is going to be okay the entry by which is going to be plus 10 pips above so that's going to be right there Plus 10 pips above the entry cell is going to be minus 5 tips below that's going to be right there and I want you all to remember that right here right now we simply have okay once again entry by is going to be plus 10 pips above the high and then we have our entry cell which is minus five pips below the low now next thing we're going to market forward and we're going to wait for the market to take its course remember we're waiting to see does the market cross our entry by or entry cell now let's take a look okay it's almost like a close call did the market folks cross into our entry by or our entry cell you can tell me if it's a close call i know but believe it or not this market cross into our entry cells so we know that we are looking to short the market gave right there now remember folks remember this okay our entry cell is now going to turn into our market sell okay our entry by goes away they were nothing more than pending orders remember okay now we're going to place our stop now listen our stop is going to be plus five pics above the 3am wick hi all right we're going to place our stop plus five pips above our 3m lakai that's going to be our stops going to be right there okay now once again let's go ahead and change this to read write it and the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to measure my what am i risking right so what is our risk right here who can tell me our risk is about 87 pins you all y'all see that now take a look at this if I advance the market forward I want to ask all of you a very very simple question okay with the strategy at hand with what I'm showing you and with everything because once again I'm not the one to sit here and show you all wins or all walk you know all the way into no losses I want you understand folks debt that you're not going to necessarily win every single trade if anyone tells you that you're going to you know you're going to teach you how to trade it where you're never going to lose they're lying to you folks but if I was able to show you back test results on this we're literally the last you know if i take the last three months and show you how many wins have taken place and basically the super wait completely supersedes right the amount of losses how many of you believe this is something that you could do it apply and learn if you honestly thought the value in it and you really started to understand what we're doing and so once again you can apply this to buy or sell off strategies now i know i got about 12 minutes left and what I want to do right now is I want to go ahead and just kind of show you something real quick and what I want to do is I want to go ahead and I'm going to leave this right here okay and what I want to do right now is I'm going to go ahead and bring up the pound aussie now as i pull up the pound Ozzy let's go to today for instance and let's take a look now without getting to details because of obviously because of time does everybody agree that this is a 3am candle all right does everyone see this candle right here 3m right all right now remember i'm not going to get into the details okay because like i said we have about 12 minutes left but we're going to set up our entry by our entry cell and as I advance the market for it i want to ask called you a question did the market moves since this morning take a look did is it safe to say that the market did in fact cross into our entry by zone yes or no okay it did I it crossed into our entry by zone we look to buy and folks let me ask you a question did the market move up at the minimum 50 pips yes or no alright so that was once again a winner now I'm not going to talk 57 pips I'm just going to put plus 50 pips or 500 US dollars profit and that took about four to five hours so once again and four to five hours now if I go ahead and we we move back to yesterday okay I'm going to move back to yesterday let's go to the other three a.m. candle and I'm going to take us let's go ahead and identify where that is so we're looking for the 27th once again alright so once again take a look right here if we back this up there it is the 27th 3am folks question to each and every one of you did the market move down number one did it enter our entry by zone our entry sell zones who can tell me entry by entry so it crossed into our entry cells on right now did the market move at the least did it move at least 50 pips yes or no did it move at least 50 pips it did right so once again if you look at yesterday that was another one once again another winner now the one that I showed you now not the last one but the one before that that was actually a losing trade and the reason I did that I don't want you to think that I'm showing you everything that is a winner okay but if you were able to have way more wins than losses how many of you find value in this and believe this is something that could honestly be a value to you yes or no all right and that was n literally two hours that's a place so moral the story folks the market is going to move in an upward or downward direction if
