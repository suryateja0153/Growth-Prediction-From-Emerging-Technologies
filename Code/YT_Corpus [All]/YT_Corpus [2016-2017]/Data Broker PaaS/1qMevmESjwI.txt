 I have ready thanks for coming down to this sure web webinar how cloud server resellers can profit by hosting QuickBooks I'm your host Gil mwah I'll be with you for the next half hour although I think we have so much content for this particular webinar that we may run a little bit long I'll have a very special guest today one of our great partners called Brian Mangum from bright flow technologies bright flow is a very active partner of sure web and they've had a lot of success hosting QuickBooks and remote desktop applications for our clients and he's going to be talking to us a little bit later today so right into the webinar a little bit of an agenda so you know what's coming who is sure web what is quickbooks which i think everybody here is familiar but i just want to make sure that we're talking about the same thing we'll talk about QuickBooks in the cloud what's the opportunity for managed service provider that's when we'll talk to Brian will go to a little bit of a demonstration and then i'll talk about hosting quickbooks at sure web in our performance cloud the performance God's our infrastructure as a service platform ostrich Eric's suggest some next steps and then we'll go into some Q&A if you guys have questioned you can ask them any time during the webinar there is a box in the interface ask the question anytime most likely we'll wait to the end to answer the question to make sure we have time to go through the content if one of your question is not answered to ring the presentation don't worry we do reach out to everybody that ask questions during the webinar to make sure they get the information that they desired another note more of a service thing the webinar is recorded a recorded version will be sent to you in the next 24 to 48 hours if you have to leave sadly if you have a power lunch or something don't worry you'll still get all the information into your inbox in the next couple of days so let's get going so i think the first thing for this webinar as i know that we have a lot of people that this is the first contact with sure web as a company we should go through the basics sure web is a hosting company specialized in specializing in cloud services it was found in 1998 so this is no fly-by-night operation we have now more than 4,000 partners worldwide I think now we're in over a hundred countries some of those countries i can't pronounce their name I'm sorry we now have more than 200 staff including many microsoft certified expert and also other vendor certifications over 25,000 organization trust us further cloud services I think what we're best known for it might be our hosted exchange solutions where we have more than a quarter of a million mailboxes hosted within our data centers maybe of note we were Microsoft hosting partner of the year in 2013 and we were finalists again for the same a war in 2014 it's the first time in the history of the award that somebody goes a winner and then finalists the very next year we've won numerous awards some of them for our technological expertise but some also some of them for our financial stability and growth I think as you're selecting a partner for cloud services those are important thing to consider basically what sure web does for its partner is simplifying the cloud the partner experience is really an end-to-end thing from recruitment enablement marketing and sales support migration and onboarding and the what we call more customer service the professional sport 24 7 365 what that means is we're not just a box for sure we're not just a anonymous web site where you you procure things where your partner and we make sure that we're hand in hand with you for the whole experience you're here today to hear about QuickBooks and our infrastructure as a service but we do much more I'll take just a minute today too I want it to have that slide so that you can see the extent the breadth of our offering so I mentioned already hosted exchange but we also have office 365 which is something to consider I think for all partners it's probably the easiest sell how their office just happens to be the big selling software and just about the history of time we offer compliance in our targeting solution and to n male encryption we also offer compliance when we're talking about our infrastructure meaning that we offer PCI compliant hosting we have online backup we have sharepoint we have linked skype for business nowadays and so the the meat of this presentation we have cloud servers virtual networks and all of that jazz we have cloud databases microsoft sequel 2014 and we also do private managed and unmanaged sharepoint setups a quick word about our the three partner program that we offer just to make sure that you understand that you can become a partner which or web in any way that you want reseller white label is basically that your clients are not aware that you're working with sure web we simply provide you with the service the support everything and you provide that product to your client they don't know it show up they think it's from you but you get all the simplicity of working with show web with our top align enterprise products and you can provide them to your client it's your brand we support you you support your clients the other or the flip side of that program is our co-branded program which means that your clients see sure web we are the one that provide the customer service that support but you still own the pricing the billing the customer relationship both of those program can get you up to twenty percent discount on all of our product included in our infrastructure service when we're talking infrastructure that twenty percent margin is is very interesting very very competitive and we also have an advisor program so for anybody out there that just wants to refer clients to our great solution but doesn't want to manage the relationship a long term while they should look at a reviser program where we own the relationship meaning that we build a customer's we do the sport clients are aware that it's show whether they're working for and you can get a one-time commission of one hundred fifty percent of the value of the purchase plus seven percent monthly ongoing commission so as you can see I think there's something for everybody whichever way you want to work with sure web is there n is available to you of course all those partner programs are and it's mentioned at the bottom there free signup no obligation if you're unsure where the future is going to lead you as far as cloud services don't worry to just give us a shot and get started so now that that's out of the way let's take a minute to talk about QuickBooks itself so what is QuickBooks QuickBooks and accounting software package developed by a company called into it it was first released in 1994 prior to that they had a software called quickens that was more of a personal accounting software and he wanted to basically do the same thing before the SMB market they do they allow SMB to do their common function their common bookkeeping except business payments management pay bills and payroll function it was mostly or not mostly it was entirely created as an on-premise software so you install it on premise but now also exist as a software-as-a-service a thing of note for partners is that the market first QuickBooks is basically 29 million SMBs in the US or business in general it has more than eighty percent market share with small US based business that use financial management software meaning like translated means if they're using so financial management software four times out of five they're using QuickBooks so you can see why why this webinar is so so popular we had a lot of a lot of registrant QuickBooks it's just such a it's everywhere basically to put it bluntly here's a fun little graph to show the interest in in QuickBooks when it comes to to the general business population so I use a little tool from Google called Google Trends and basically they give you the air of searches of a certain term compared to other terms so basically if there's a million searches you can see what share of it is let's say QuickBooks and I compared it to other financial software paychecks NetSuite even olive sage and also quicken which really is a n client software but you can see QuickBooks is way way above everybody else it's not even close I mean the closest one is that personal tax software called Quicken it's just I mean it's a no-brainer for MSP managed service provider to be working with QuickBooks I think it's more of the other way around is you have no choice you'll be in court encountering it at your clients you want to make sure that you're well-equipped deal with it and that's what we're covered today so quickly there's a few desktop version of QuickBooks Pro premier enterprise all available is a yearly description or one-time fee the online version is now available of note it's called quickbooks online we're not we're not trying to convince you it doesn't exist it is there I've note it is a completely different user experience so the people that are familiar with QuickBooks will have to sort of relearn how to work with the QuickBooks Online will talk to Brian our partner about that why people are but as it in to go to the quickbooks online but certainly what we've heard is that and oh I'm sure you're familiar with it you've dealt with the financial staff of your clients is it easy to change the way they work is it easy to change the software that they use feel free to answer in a Q&A section but I think I know the answer to this one financial people bailing people are very very averse to change and what we're looking today at today is to give you a chance to move forward make sure you're on up-to-date technology but not impact the way that it work or impact it as little as possible the online version is multiple version from self-employed 2 plus with peril again available as a monthly per user subscription there's a bunch of options for quickbooks you can get payroll payments point of sales and and some others for more about for more information about QuickBooks and QuickBooks Online we've written a more of our commercial document it's not a technical document that describes what is hosted QuickBooks and mostly what is the difference between QuickBooks Online and no.8 QuickBooks once you are a partner of sure web you can access our partner toolbox URL is on the left but once you sign up that will be made very clear to you and very easy to access and it's full chock full of information for partners how to sort of get started material you can use with your clients how to present our products and this hosted quickbooks document is one of them so talking about quickbooks in the cloud what is the business opportunity for managed service providers so what we're proposing here today and what we're trying to pitch as a very good solution for you and your client is to take that QuickBooks insulation that they have and to put it with a service provider such as sure web feel free to use all the information today and select another service provider nobody's holding you hostage but for sure we hope that will convince you that your web is the place to do this project which are your clients it gives you the ability to promote remote access to the software to a secured internet connection the secure part being very important you want this solution to be khopoli sicker information that is stored is in QuickBooks is always very sensitive to clients allows you to retain the client relationship and I think maybe most importantly and it allows you to attach your managed services such as software configuration installation user management breakfast neck network configuration and others to disservice when you go to a quick book online you lose a lot of the relationship with the client this is really just moving their solution forward but you remain in control and you keep ownership of that solution and you can keep working with your client very closely as I mentioned before with some of our partner program you wouldn't even have to mention sure web anywhere okay so why offer Oh set QuickBooks basically the basic premise is to give them the opportunity to modernize their infrastructure and benefit from the advantages of the cloud without having to change their quick book version no capital is expenditure and amortisation is a big one I've worked with hundreds and hundreds of small billion business and having them spend money to improve IT it's it's a challenge it's tough not only that but once you move to the cloud you can squit a scale very quickly to meet changing business needs which means both ways if they reduce the size of the company they're not stuck with hardware that is overpowered but in the same and more positive sense it also means if they have a big success if they have new clients if they have a merger and acquisition they can just change the configuration on their setup and just keep keep running safeguard sensitive financial information that's one of the question that we get often what about security in the cloud like this information is vital to my client I'm worried or they're worried about the security and the show web performance club the way that I answered out and the way that are presented is how secure is your local information I'll secures your local network sadly most and I it comes back to spending capital expenditure money and all that how much are they willing to spend on the security of their local infrastructure how much for redundancy and firewalls and things like that the idea what using a provider like sure web is we we give you that for a fraction of the cost you don't have to do the big investment it's all there our infrastructure is is enterprise grade are the hardware and everything and that goes also for the security not only that but I have on staff multiple specialists that are only focused on the security and the security of your data it's something that few SMBs can are few the people that would use QuickBooks can sort of claim so really and this has been demonstrated in studies and everything but I won't get into that today but the security of your data is actually better in the cloud than it is on premise and it's act fairly easy it turns into actually a sales conversation where their red cent at first because of security but when you have that conversation with them it's one of the sailing point selling features of cloud better and more are retain control of versions and updates yeah when you go online you don't control the software if into it decides to change the software you're sort of stuck with that we're talking about your own remote desktop remote app QuickBooks insulation you're the owner if you want to stay on the same old version for the rest of time that's your prerequisite better and more cost effective a remote access so anybody that's and that's really compared to their own premise elution if you have remote workers if you have branch offices putting it in the cloud really simplifies that situation increase clients that stop hardware lifespan that's a good one that's one that we often have conversation about so let's say they're due to renew those those desktop computers especially let's say if they're they've bought either laptops or desktop from four or five ten years ago and it really can't support though that new version of QuickBooks that they want to run or anything like that well if you're looking at remote app remote desktop that that desktop really only now becomes a 10 client all it needs to do is to run the remote access application and that's very very light very optimized so you can really increase the lifespan of of the local hardware of your clients that's one thing of note if you can come in at a refresh cycle for the hardware with this project that's when you get the most success meaning that your they will compare the cost of your solution you remote desktop remote app QuickBooks server solution in the cloud to refreshing all of their hardware and that when the return on investment becomes a very stilted in favor of going into the cloud Oh disaster recovery made easy I a great / sad story here one of our partners had moved his client to the cloud for a few months they were happy there were some challenges of course but overall the solution was working well and then their birth or building burned down nobody was hurt so that's not too bad but thanks to the fact that they were already in the cloud they were back in 48 hours their engineering was up their accounting was up the sales were up and running so having a remote desktop remote app setup is is a great great way to protect yourself from local disaster streamlined centralized management that's really for our partners it means that you have only one place to go to manage all that you don't have 20 or 50 desktop computers to go and manage you can simply work from your remote console and just manage everything and while that might be obvious but no more infrastructure noble no more getting up in the middle of night to change a hard drive when you work with somebody like sure web it's all redundant it's all built to fail basically and and not impact you so right now I'm going to bring in my good friend Brian Mangum from bright fro technologies Brian are you there hey good morning guys thanks game so just to introduce you a little bit bright flow is a managed service provider in charlotte north carolina specializes in the web VoIP and obviously general IT you've been in the industry since 2002 and what i like for you today brian is to give us a little bit of a sense of what kind of company bright flow is and also how does show web performance cloud and partnering with sure web has allow you to provide your clients with a good quick book solution sure well thank you for that introduction like you said we are an MSP out of charlotte we focus on small to medium businesses between usually between five and 55 user base we have seen an increasing need for hardware as a service or hosted class infrastructure where companies don't want to spend huge amounts of money and they want to have more of a operating expense with their hardware and they also don't want to have to maintain that's that that same hardware and so where we come along and where we partnered with sure web to help us out is to help ease that burden without having to recreate and rebuild the wheel so to speak or recreate our own infrastructure which is it's already there okay and can you tell me a little bit about what type of situation you've come then or what type of client end client you've seen the most success with give give our listener a little bit of a sense of how you sort of target people and and where you found the most traction sure we've seen most of the traction with the businesses who already have QuickBooks installed either on an old server that's about to crash or have it installed on a what I call a pseudo server which is just a PC sitting in a closet somewhere that has been set up with some network sharing in any instance when we run an assessment or when we run our strategies through this company a lot of times we find that that's a security risk or they're at risk of losing data so we have a conversation quickly about their options whether its buying a new piece of very expensive hardware to replace that and then monitoring it and managing it and backing it up and the headache that comes along with that of owning your own equipment versus hey let the liability stand with us let us host it in our data center let our engineers configure it let our engineers support it for you when you have problem and then importantly to we see a lot more Apple computers coming into environments today so we've targeted companies that have a hybrid model approach to their hardware because it's been a real tricky scenario for other IT companies to try to make apple and PC work together on the same work when talking to QuickBooks so basically what you're saying is using the remote desktop or remote absolution you you've got the those mac covered yes one of the big benefits that I wanted to touch about today was you had spoke earlier about some of the benefits of the quickbooks online versus the regular QuickBooks but when we build one of the benefits of having QuickBooks itself hosted through sure web rather than the QuickBooks Online is we we truly build a virtual environment for someone to all get into so they're logging into a PC environment yes but when they log in their logging in they have full printing capabilities they have email they have QuickBooks they have internet browser they have everything they need to really run that desktop from that virtual environment whereas QuickBooks Online is just that you log into a website and that's all you can get as QuickBooks right meaning that if they're having challenges with their local hardware while they're still stuck with those same challenges exactly yeah that's that's something that I'm glad you mentioned there is definitely those two paths that can be looked at meaning that you can have you can create a desktop environment for your clients and have all their applications on a terminal session as Brian was describing another pad that is it depends on the situation another pie that we've seen partner uses the remote app pad which is really you just have a basically it comes down to just having an icon that runs the software and that to that effect in that situation that would retain their desktop and probably use it for some things I think one of the deciding factors is how far are they in being ready to replace everything or move everything the other one is their their willingness to change a little bit the way they work when we've seen very I don't want to say closed minded but let's say very cautious accounting departments they've really liked the remote app approach because it was basically a single like I didn't change anything it was a single icon they had to run and it would give them access to quickbooks which was very similar to the way that we're doing it before right so Brian may be looking for words what do you see in your in your near future when it comes to to partnering with sure web and working with those types of client well the big benefit what we've seen is the responsiveness of the network and the infrastructure and this is tested against some of the other bigger names out there and some mature webs competitors which we have tried all but we we have consistently seen the most responsive results from the sure web data centers the uptime has been phenomenal which we're very proud to say and very happy to say that so we would have partnered with sure web with the performance cloud and the servers even if we you know had no relationship with the exchange before it's just that good of a product by itself but what we really like more than anything though is the interface and not having to spend days and weeks with new hires that come in on our staff to train them how to set up a new vm instance or a new server it's all gui-based and so it's all very cut and dry on how to do that so what we see in the future is just really targeting CPA firms other small to medium businesses and the finance vertical people who are using QuickBooks to just kind of go out target them to see what we can do to help host that instance for them all right okay I see the time is flying I'm going to have to keep going Brian as always always a pleasure to talk to you and looking forward to seeing what we can do together in the future okay thanks guys thank you very much so that was Brian Mangum from bright flow technologies one of our great partner in charlotte north carolina okay I had a nice demonstration of QuickBooks through remote app plan this morning at a bit of a surprise where r and this is going to sound silly my license was expired of QuickBooks no worries i will still give you the demonstration but as you will notice i'm just playing a video it is basically the demo that i gave when i gave this webinar to last time don't be alarmed everything was in line to do the demonstration and there is no editing to this video it was just it is literally what i would have shown today let me just bring that up and i'm going to talk to you over it so what you see here today is one of the way and I've mentioned the two ways that you can do a remote desktop you can do terminal sessions where and they're now called remote desktop connections you can do a terminal session where you open what is basically a desktop and you have your icons in your application you run it from there or you can go to slightly more modern route of remote app this demonstration is about remote app what you can see here is the web access your cloud servers com is one of our dummy URL that we use one of our grey label URL so if you were to use sure web you could use that URL as well for yourself and I've logged in as basically one of your users and then I can see all the application that i can i can launch we only put three there to give a bit of an example calculator WordPad and quickbooks obviously you could have more one of my favorite to recommend is office obviously if you want to get office 465 put it on a virtual session and run it along with quickbooks that gives you a very nice remote desktop experience so basically i just logged in to my session in remote app if if you configure it so that the user domain is the same as the remote domain you would have single sign-on and wouldn't have to put in your credentials again necessarily so basically what this is doing is it's launching the application on the server this is a view of my desktop as a client as you can see that was the trial version I should have known that it would expire but my mistake I'm opening one of the demo demo company from QuickBooks put in the password and as you can see i'm not in a remote desktop session you cannot see the the remote desktop frame or anything like that it is simply the application running on my desktop and I've mentioned it this is probably the best scenario for your more finicky accounting clients because it is very very transparent the application just runs one of the question we get off and ask and it's a very good question is about how much Bend wit do you need a fast of an internet connection do you have to have if i have five six ten people that are going to use this remote version of QuickBooks the there's two sides to that answer the good part is it uses very little bandwidth this is just an image basically and a very well compressed image the technology has progressed very well and will be we'd be happy to give you the exact figures but that number is very low it's a matter of a few kilobits per session the other side of that is you are dependent on your internet connection if you are with a client and they have a bit of a up and down internet connection that will be a problem and as a partner that's one of the advice that we give very clearly is that you have to make sure that they can count on their internet connection 11 some partners what they do is they'll go there saving the money on the on the infrastructure and everything but what they sort of add and want to make sure that they add is a second internet connection from a different provider I've seen people go let's say cable provider one side and then a DSL provider the other side then just to make sure that that that company is never stuck sort of twiddling their thumbs if they have a problem with their isp on our end I can sort of guarantee the reliability we have multiple service provider we have multiple connections all of our stuff is redundant so that was the quick demonstration of what remote app QuickBooks look like the thing to notice is that it's just QuickBooks there is not much difference the only difference is outlook you launch it a little bit but if you could configure it properly you can put that shortcut on the desktop make sure that it's a single sign-on experience and it's transparent there you go you just start a software and use it that's an easy sell the big difference is if your computer crashes if your server crashes your stuff is all somewhere else completely backed up and everything what we'll talk about right now is I've talked a lot about hosting QuickBooks and so far what I've said mostly applies to everybody when I want to take a few minutes here today before we leave is what gets your web do for you additionally why is sure web the place to host this solution so the show web performance cloud its high performance it's in the name what does that mean it means that for a standard configuration for example I don't know to CPU 8gig of ram it will go much faster than the same configuration of one of our competitor I'll give you a random example Microsoft for sure that performance when it comes to a remote desktop remote app setup is very very as a very practical impact what it means is that because of the higher performance you can run more users on a smaller configuration and when it comes to remote desktop remote app that density is how you lower your costs so to be able to offer this at a reasonable cost to your client you want to make sure that you have identity until I have I density you want to have a high performance performance is nothing if it's not reliable no point in being fast if you're down so we have 59 SLA which means 99.999 percent of the time we are up otherwise we have to compensate you financially finds means we can be down for 26 seconds in a month before we have to issue credit and believe me we don't want to issue credit we have no intention of you any of their money because what we'll do is we'll keep our system up that's really what our promise and then cost-effective is what I was just talking about so what you will do is you can notice your QuickBooks server with us and then we allow you to run your you user clients by setting up a remote desktop environment we didn't provide you a secure connection between your client sites and you're sure web cloud and if you need it because they don't I know we have a number of service provider on our on our webinar today some of you may be less technical less inclined to manage that infrastructure or manage that remote desktop if that sounds scary we do offer managed services that will take care of all that for you so what is performance gardener just a few words it's cloud servers virtual networks is self manage backups so I know that one of the question we've been asked so far in the webinars how do we protect data well you make sure that you use our backup solution to protect your servers and what that means is we'll take you'll decide to schedule the retention of the back up and you can restore anytime you want giving you quick access to your clients data if you ever need it and we also offer cloud databases we have all the advantages of the cloud pay as you go it says daily billing that's actually hourly billing it should fix that which means we measure every hour how much resources that you're using here's a nice little I fact for you actually and my bosses always the money counters here always frown when I mentioned us if you if your client is a nine-to-five company why don't you shut down the servers between six and let's say seven six at night and seven in the morning reducing your cost drastically on your infrastructure bill that means you pay no cpu no ram overnight while no one is using the services that's something that you'll never be able to do with bought physical hardware or even dedicated servers at one of our competitor but with our hourly billing hey you turn it off off during the night I don't charge you the CPU in the ramp sailfin self-provisioning easy provisioning through elasticity I mentioned it before we offer windows and linux server I want to mention Linux because we're a very big microsoft partner but our Linux solution is really two parts it's great I mentioned the 59 SLA and we offer API access I've talked a little bit about how it's different the performance of reliability one thing I want to mention and it's one of the question we always get asked is what about migration well migration support is included in all of our of our relationship with partners there is no fee fee for you to get migrated obviously we cannot do unilateral migration we need your help we'll get involved but what our free migration and titles is basically that will sit down with you will make a migration plan we'll share our tools which you are technology if you want to do it over the weekend will be there over the weekend will do it which you would Nate will ensure your data comes over properly will make sure your our infrastructure goes up correctly will be there for you and that ties into that last point that's on this slide perfectly one of the reason you want to work with your webs our expertise in our and our partners we have a number of certified people I don't think anybody has been working longer than us with web services online services hosting we've been around we're getting close to being around for 20 years now and and that really shows and what we can do and how we can help you and that 20 year has been spent with partners to judge yourself we talked a language we understand the challenges we can provide a solution that are a good fit one thing of note if you are interested in selling QuickBooks solution but you're not interested in building it out and all of that you can talk to us and we could refer you to a partners such as bright flow technologies they already have a solution all implemented there they're happy to support it and and they could work with you to offer it to your clients so going quickly because I'm really out of time now I'm getting like evil eye from my for the people that are working with me on this webinar so you have a couple of options for quickbooks you can go dedicated you can go shared what i mean by shared and we we have documentation for that is you could have a single set up for multiple clients if you have very small clients and they're very price sensitive quote unquote cheap you could go with a shared set up where you set up one RT and a number of QuickBooks server or even you can set up a single cookbook server and put a number of company on it you'll have some challenges to make sure that the data is segregated from one another but we have we have technical document we have technical Proteas to help you with that you could set up a standalone server and keep the quickbooks client on-premise at your client but let me tell you we do not recommend that the reason that we don't recommend it is the same reason that quickbooks doesn't recommend it it doesn't work very well quickbooks is built to have the client and the server being on the same network in the same location it could work standalone if you're very close to our data center but even then I don't recommend it and then the other two options we've covered remote desktop session hosting and then remote apps I'm going to skip this one but basically if you want to hear about remote desktop and remote app we have all the information app documentation on how to set up technical guide step-by-step how to set it up on performance club this is what a hosted quickbooks solution would look like on the performance card if you go with a fairly robust set up it's a it's a good size set up this wouldn't be for one or two users basically you'd have the quickbooks database server on a server then you have a remote desktop session host on which the quickbooks client would run and then you have remote desktop connection broker and licensing on another server and then you'd have the web access gateway remote desktop gateway on a different server some of the rules role you can all pile on to the same server with some client we even worked on an all-in-one solution maybe not the best but like I said we understand the reality of working with small medium businesses and sometimes you have to find a way to cut costs as you can see the setup is fairly simple very straightforward a couple of technical documents that are in our partner toolbox again the remote desktop services configuration guide which is step by step to how to set it up and the hosted QuickBooks configuration guide again step by step I'm going quickly because I was hoping to get to this slide before we run out of time here's a little bit of value even if you don't in the end come with your web maybe you can get something out of this and take it with you as you serve as QuickBooks client so I mentioned QuickBooks is sensitive to network latency that's why the RDS setup is usually the best way to bring this to the cloud there are some issues with sometimes running it in a multi-user mode there's really two things that you can see in you need more performance which working with a product like sure web performance cloud can really help you solve that we really address that performance aspect and then it could be issues with your data file if it's not the performance then I recommend looking a technical guide we go into much more detail about what the issues are with data files into it recommends or supports only a limited number of simultaneous user depending on the different versions there pro versions on the up to three premiere up to five and then enterprise up to thirty simultaneous users QuickBooks is integrated tightly with microsoft office for example if you want to prepare letters you need microsoft word on the same server if you need to export reports you need excel and if you want to do contacts and condensation you would need microsoft outlook that's one of the reason why this remote desktop solution is interesting is you can simply install remote microsoft word microsoft excel on it if you have been as some of you have been long time MSPs and you've worked with the cloud before you know that microsoft was preventing people from installing their microsoft office 365 licenses in a virtual environment at a hosted service provider this is now addressed sure web is in a pilot program that enables us to for clients to use licenses that they bite through us in our in our multi-user environment so I'm glad to say officially that has been addressed if you're looking to do that we'll be happy to help you and we can also provide proof that this is legit with the Microsoft and a thing of note only quickbooks enterprise is officially supported by into it in a remote desktop environment we've tested pro and we've tested premium they work fine and they we expect them to continue to work fine we certainly don't avoid them as solutions but officially into it is not too keen on supporting them so next step one obvious sign up to our partner program i recommend you talk to your account representative that

partner at sure web com it's a bit of obvious I know and if you want to call us the numbers right there so allow me to just look at some of the questions that you we receive I've seen that we got a whole bunch of them so that we covered we talked about connectivity very important it's important to have that kind of a conversation about connectivity with your client nice thing to remember is how low the requirements are as far as bandwidth if you do remote app Oh licenses okay one of the question we got is do we sell quickbook licenses we do not we are not a licen quickbooks licensed reseller you would go through your normal software provider an Ingram an insight whoever you're working with you and simply use those on our on our performance go it's something that we're considering we're certainly evaluating becoming a saw licensure license reseller sorry but for now I know so the sure web offer integration migration support absolutely so everybody regardless of what service you use or whatever migration assistance is included and we have a fair bit of experience working with RDS setup and quickbooks setup and everything and then if you want further assistance stuff like we do your patching we do your antivirus then we're really talking about our managed services when I was think quick books is a toasted on a virtual server is it bare metal large trade iron it is a virtual server we can absolutely do dedicated server physical servers we can do private cloud that's that's what you're looking for but what we were talking about and what we recommend for smbs is virtual servers in our infrastructure as a service oh this is a multiple part question please address the following QuickBooks pain point multi-user connectivity so we talked about that company file backup so we covered that with our self managed backup we offer other backup solution if you need more than that and you also have the option of egressing your data back to your client for backups check printing check bring thing is a good question remote desktop one of the challenges is often printing luckily we have it in a we've had a number of situation where we have to figure out what works what doesn't work so i won't go into it today because i'm completely out of time but please talk to our are your account representative they will put you in touch with our either a business solution architect or directly with our support team and we can cover printing as a challenge so is this full cloud or I bread is colocation and option so easy answer the answer is yes all of those options are available I spent more time today on the cloud option but you could do colocation you could do dedicated servers ah quickly quickly she knows so regional support somebody's asking if we could support for example in North Dakota USA absolutely if we're not talking about using our migration assistance being able to get on call or link or go to webinars or go to my meeting we do all of that for our partners will even will even go as far as if you need us to say we're working up for you will say we're working for you we've very flexible with our partners will make it work so our focus is mainly north america we have client in europe actually we have big partner in Africa it is all were it's in this day and age we're very well connected and we support our clients everywhere so one of the question then it's going to be can we get a copy of the presentation absolutely I get a question oh that's a good one okay so maybe a couple more questions since i'm still getting them can data be stored in the US yes no problem our main data center for performance cloud is in montreal quebec canada but we have multiple locations including multiple locations in the US what is in Ashburn Virginia which is close washington DC basically the data center of the data center center of the united states so if you need your data to remain in the US you can absolutely talk to us and that is part of our product offering somebody mentioned if we could we work in Calgary or Saskatoon yes we have multiple partners in those regions always glad to work with people from the prairies no problem at all so I'm getting the comment that Enterprise 16 can cause issue on virtual servers I have a different and it's not supported by into it that's the actually that's the opposite of what we've been hearing and I so the opposite of what we've been seeing we didn't just say it's a good idea we actually did it we have multiple clients that are running it if you're having currently having issue i strongly recommend you contact us and we firdos issue and see if those fit what we've been seeing we haven't been seeing any any serious issues I haven't heard from any partners that have been limited by our virtual environment as i mentioned physical environment also an option but really for smbs it makes more sense to go virtual so one last thing somebody asked about pricing that I didn't cover pricing that's absolutely true here's my problem with pricing is very so much our pricing for a virtual environment is on our website it's also there's a there's a calculator you can just put the number of cpu ram storage that you need and it will spit out the number no problem at all the thing is and the reason i don't cover it in this webinar is so many possible configuration different quantity of ram that you can use amount of storage amount of data that you're kind of storing what i can say is we're very competitive for similar performance we are cheaper than as you're an Amazon i'll be happy to put two propositions side-by-side and as long as they're Apple to Apple I know that sure why would come out on top so please talk to us if you sign up as a partner will give you the price list will give you an excel file with which you can work on your solution we also have a number of default configuration that are pre-built with a price attached we'll be happy to share all of those being asked what about ipad access well let's cover iOS there is a remote desktop iOS client so it is a possibility your mileage may vary when you're trying to do accounting from a touchscreen that may or may not work for you all right so I'm being completely kicked off there is an email address on this slide that you're looking at right now please use it and if you want to contact me directly my address my personal address here at sure web is G boys vert which I know for most of our listener that's probably not that easy but basically my first letter of my name the the first layer of my first name and then my last name at sure web com if you call and you ask for the webinar guide they'll probably find me as well so I'm very glad you guys came out this was a really great crowd with a lot of questions and questions are always a good sign seems like people were listening awake it also seemed like people I have a lot of challenge as far as QuickBooks and hosting it please talk to us let us make your life as easy as possible thank you very much and I'm good
