 hi my name's Peter eels and I'm an executive IT architect with in IBM's devops global Tiger team what I'd like to talk to you about today are the various capabilities that we have within our cloud software portfolio so many of the clients I work with are very focused on how they optimize their current IT landscape and that's very much about being faster cheaper and better so faster relates to improve productivity cheaper relates to reduced cost and better relates to improvements in quality but for many organizations that simply will just keep the lights on but will not take them to a place where they can grow market share for example so moving to a place where they can innovate and produce innovative products which capture that the market is something that's of great interest to them and against that backdrop what we find is the need to support something called multi speed I T so many solutions actually comprise two distinctly different elements the first element is what we would call the industrialized core and those elements are relatively stable and if I think about a bank for example that may represent something like a payments of the core core banking platform the payment system that sits within it and that's relatively stable on the other hand some of the more innovative solutions so maybe a bank has a digital initiative which is very much focused on how you provide support for mobile devices and the apps that sits on them sit more in the innovation area and that's what we call the innovation edge and these two areas the industrialized core in innovation edge need to talk to each other so there is clearly an interface between them so for example a mobile banking app will need to access information that actually comes from the backend core banking platform maybe in terms of the payments that a client is looking to see on their mobile app now what I'm going to walk you through to try and make sense of the different capabilities that IBM has to offer are five themes in which we can consider those capabilities and those five themes are mobile integration DevOps hybrid cloud and then finally digital innovation platform so starting with mobile one of the challenges that many organizations have is they need to support different kinds of device whether it's a smartphone whether it's a tablet Smart Watch and other wearables not only that but they also need to support different versions of those devices and the further complexity is that those devices may need to support different operating systems so for example you may have iOS for Apple devices and Android for some others and other operating systems now one of the complexities you have there is that both the devices and the operating systems on them come in different versions so managing the complexity of all of those different variations of device and operating system really requires you to have a platform that helps you deliver your apps to those different devices and really have a platform that controls the way you develop your mobile solutions not only that but the mobile platform itself may have capabilities that allow you to do things such as mobile testing and have specific capabilities around things like vulnerability analysis because clearly security is a big issue with mobile devices and sentiment analysis for example so trying to get an understanding of what gestures your users are performing and maybe correlate that with feedback on an app store in order to gauge the sentiment so the mobile platform as a capability allows you to do all of those things so that's our first theme mobile the second theme is focused on integration so I mentioned earlier that the mobile design devices for example that sits on the innovation edge needs to interact with the more stable capabilities that sit in the industrialized core through an interface so the whole concept of integration from an IT perspective is clearly very important and as organizations move more and more into the deployment of their solutions on the cloud and the concept of api's in terms of the interface between the different elements becomes really important and the capability of API management and how you manage those interfaces is also something that needs to be supported and we also shouldn't forget our traditional integration technologies with which we may be fairly familiar so for example from an IBM perspective we have things like M hue series which provides a queuing mechanism between different elements of a solution and of course there are other raishin technologies as well such as an enterprise service bus for example and finally from in terms of the integration theme there's also integration from a business perspective so how do you actually integrate areas of the business and is there any business process automation that's required to support that so process automation is also something that we can consider in the integration space so that's the second theme integration so the third theme is DevOps so we talked a minute ago about the creation of more innovative solutions potentially deployed onto mobile devices and one of the difficulties with such an innovation initiative is that it's not always possible to easily derive the requirements upfront for what our mobile apps may need to look like the only way we can really understand what the final solution should be is by rapidly deploying increments of our solution to candidate end-users to under their feedback and understand how we can refine the solution so that it actually is fit for purpose when it's finally released so the you know big wide world and into production so the ability to be able to iterate as quickly as possible is extremely important now DevOps in IBM's terms is very much about how do we get from an idea into production as quickly as possible and how can we streamline that DevOps pipeline so DevOps to IBM is much more than simply connecting developments and operations it really is about that end-to-end pipeline now whilst there are some familiar capabilities that sit within that pipeline such as the ability to define and manage requirements the ability to write code to create designs to do functional testing for example there are certain capabilities that really help drive a continuous delivery pipeline so the first capability I'd like to focus on in terms of the DevOps theme is something called shift left testing so one of the challenges that the development organization often has is getting access to the external systems that their solutions may depend upon while they're developing some new capability themselves so one of the challenges that that causes is delay is in delivery because they need to wait for the provisioning of an appropriate environment that they can then use to access those external systems and the external systems themselves may not be available or themselves may need to be updated for some reason what the shift left testing capability does is it allows you to stub act access to such external systems so that development teams can continue to develop their piece of the overall solution but actually interact with the stubs so it then doesn't result in any delays to the development work shift left testing is sometimes known as service virtualization as well so the second capability I'd like to mention is the concept of automated deployment so one of the challenges that many organizations have is the fact that they manually deploy their solutions into the different environments that may exist and this can result in both delays because it's a manual task but also errors because it can be error-prone so the concept of automated deployment is really - as it says automate the deployment of solutions into the various environments and that can actually be quite complex so many organizations have different environments into which they want to deploy their solutions it could be a development environment a test environment an S IT environment for integration a staging environment and then finally a production environment so the automated deployment capability really allows you to produce consistent and repeatable deployments into each of those environments so the final DevOps capability I'd like to mention is something called application performance monitoring so once our solutions do get into production what we need to do is assure that they are actually fit for purpose and so the application performance monitoring capability allows you to determine just how effective our applications are once they are in production and take any necessary steps should they not be as required so that covers mobile integration and DevOps the fourth theme I'd like to talk about is hybrid cloud so many organizations currently deploy their solutions today on what we call traditional IT so that's hardware installed in their data centers and the same organizations also have aspirations of moving elements of their IT landscape to the cloud and in order to support that they may also have created a dedicated on-premises capability which is a private cloud that actually runs in their own data centers on their own infrastructure they may also deploy elements of their IT landscape to a dedicated off-premises infrastructure potentially hosted by a third party and then finally they may deploy elements of their IT landscape to something called a shared off premises solution now the reason that we have these different topologies is simply because an organization will deploy different elements of their IT landscape to one or more of these different topologies and the decision as to which one to use is based on consideration considerations such as workload and security so for example I live in the UK and the government has regulated that you cannot place citizen data outside of the UK so that may constrain what you can actually do so organisations may actually select one or more of these different topologies for different reasons and this is right why we call it hybrid cloud because it really will be a mix of those different environments that are deployed - based on considerations such as workload and security as I mentioned now in creating these different cloud environments it's very important to be able to define deploy manage and retire the services that are offered by each of those client solutions and that's what a client management capability provides for you an organization may also want to make use of different cloud vendors and so the ability to choose between different vendors and their different cloud solutions is also important and to deploy the right things to the right solution for the right reasons and this is why we also have a cloud brokerage capability to help you make those decisions and finally wouldn't it be great if some of these capabilities themselves were available in the cloud so one of the other capabilities we have is actually our fifth theme something we call the digital innovation platform this not only allows you to access some of the services that I have mentioned in declared itself so they become as a service offerings but the platform itself the digital innovation platform which in IBM is a product called bluemix also gives you access to a number of services that you can then bring into your solutions and an example could be insurance company that now has access to weather data and maybe the insurance company ensures vehicles so by integrating the weather data service an insurance company could be notified of any inclement weather that's occurring in certain areas and it was very severe they could actually use another service to notify their clients that that weathers about to hit them in that area so their clients the owners of the vehicles can put their vehicles under cover in order to avoid any damage and that's of benefit to their clients because obviously their vehicles aren't damaged and it's of benefits the insurance company because they'll have fewer claims to process so in summary that covers the five themes I wanted to discuss today so they are mobile integration DevOps hybrid cloud and the digital innovation platform which in IBM is the bluemix solution that we we have and a lot of our solutions are very much about driving consistency and repeatability and automation within the organizations we work with and radically improving the way they deliver their solutions at speed to the market thereby enabling them with our innovation agenda
