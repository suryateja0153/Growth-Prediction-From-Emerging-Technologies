 if I was gonna claim oh you got to mention the book I am Lots me like again you can reach the book yeah I'm gonna mention the book so that's be good coming up the rise of principle based media by CNBC launched an in-house agency and finally the launch of a new global independent media network which is privately owned hello and welcome to ID combs media snack episode 21 so three really interesting topics today we're going to report on a brilliant piece written in the US trade press in an age which for the first time puts down a marker on principle based media buying and we'll explain what that is and some of the implications and questions that it might raise at marketers CNBC have launched an in-house agency called catalyst mhm and they'll order your new TV TV TV show which is very exciting and finally we bring news of a the unveiling of a new media agency global network which is popped up out of the blue which it sounds like a really good idea privately-owned which i think is going to be a real differentiator potentially for their success she's good for the industry yeah all coming up on today's Adi comms media snack in just the time it takes to eat a sandwich and I nearly forgot to say okay first up today quite a big topic actually we're talking about principle-based media buying on the back of a piece written by Alexandre Brill in at age which is really interesting in caught our eye and it seems to be catching the interests of various different people around the world so what is principle based buying I mean we adding more complexity to an already complex marketplace absolutely always need more complexity right it's a principle based buying is just talking about the role that the agency plays in the contractual relationship with their client and then with the media vendor and the idea being is that as if your principle in the contract you basically take the risk okay so it's stuff that agencies have been doing for a while we're familiar with it in the UK in principle le in the form of shared deals and things like that which are you know kind of upfront commitments of volume but those are in principle commitments not actually necessary pre buying inventory what's going on in the US now and it's it's nascent but it's fast growing it's been around for a little while and it's brilliant that Alexandra has now raised this in a big way of in at age because it really rises and brings it to attention is that there are some of the media agency groups are now pre-buying not just committing to buy at some point in the future a share but actually buying media inventory in advance sometimes repackaging that and then selling that on so this is what might be has been called brokering media or arbitrage of media and so the agencies this is a u.s. story are increasingly taking that position there's still some quite small 510 percent of the market but that's that's still a lot of money the implications it has of course is that the agency takes the risk and as a client you are being asked to forego transparency on the cost of that media that the agency actually acquired it for because I just re selling it to you like a broker and also the fees involved on the assumption that you're getting as a client really competitive reloj media prices right well it's a it's a way I'm if you think about it's a way that agencies who you know they're claiming that their undoing obviously increasing pressure to deliver lower and lower costs so that's something that we hear quite a lot and so they're saying that this is a result of them and so they can go to a media vendor take a huge position on media inventory buy things at a huge discount use their leverage to negotiate ever cheaper cheaper prices package that up and then still sell it to a client cheaper but with massive margins with potentially you know unlimited margins because you can sell stuff whatever clients prepared to pay for it and there's no disclosure required as to how they acquire that media whether they paid anything for it frankly or that was part of some other reciprocal deal it's just interesting I think in terms of the the way that the agency groups are organizing themselves see which direction they're going yeah Brian who was leading x-axis is now is now key principle within within group at yeah and I mean and he's you know throughs axis he's an experienced principal based media buyer that's right now running group M which sends a I think there are such a clear signal of group aims intentions in that space is that they're very much focused perhaps on a future of you know broke of media or principal place point and we've seen again the same Scott Hague dawn who was the equivalent at Omnicon in their unit an elect Scott has just been put in charge of as it hearts and science the the new I wind or the new Omnicom media agency that they created on the back of the PNG wasn't something he's running the agency as is Brian that I think tells us you've got two big agents two of the biggest agencies in the US where the bets are going right yeah but as a client how can I be certain that my that the thinking the stress and the strategy in my planning is is is objective and neutral yeah if I'm being sold big chunks of media inventory that the agency needs to ship yeah I mean this is a this is the problem what is that agencies will end have a if they're taking these positions they'll have a vested interest of course in selling you specific types of media so it does call it a question then the neutrality in the objectivity of their planning when they've already got a whole ton of medium between that they that they've taken a risk alone right they've got to they got to sell it otherwise they lose money now so it does make it you know in that scenario it makes a bit of a mockery the idea that you would pay an agency yeah any kind of fee for strategy and planning when the outcome is largely determined based on what they have to say but I can but as a client I can see the benefit that if all I want from my major agency is the delivery of really cheap media inventory yeah right and I don't care how they make their money within that I have desire to have any transparency within that trading position yeah all I want is is is cheap media in the trip yeah if however I'm also that we're related to an outcome generally so it's it's okay to buy in that fashion if you're really clear that it drives a particular outcome for your business and you might go you know what I don't care I don't care what you bought it for I don't care actually what the as long as as long as it we can show that it's doing something so simply look perfectly legitimate a legitimate way of doing things but if I want my agency to be my advisor yeah my strategic leader Ryan that's not gonna work so so how how can I mean can the two options live together you know conveniently or do the agencies have to decide whether they're going to be a principle buyer of earth meter inventory or a strategic adviser to their class can the two of them cohabitate I think I think agencies are betting on being able to be all of these things but I thought what was so good about Alex's piece in had a jam or link to it please read it so we've been sharing it saying you know if you if you invest in media you need to read this just to understand what's going on the great thing about Alex's pieces it's it's starts I think it will be quite a watershed moment hopefully because it will create this to discussion and debate but it's you know it's going to require agencies I think eventually hopefully with marketers pressure to decide one way or the other what are they going to be I was at a dinner last night we're talking we were talking about this exact issue and agency groups seem to think that they can you know part of the group could be doing one bit and part could be doing the other net the strategic trusted advisor I think that's a real challenge it's going to be a real challenge for them especially I mean at the moment it's you know they can they can work within within both right because the arbitrage that the principle buying piece is still rosalie low so yeah five ten maybe even 15% of the inventory you are being delivered is is is is managed this way but as that becomes higher and you get to a critical mass there has to be a decision made right yeah-ha we both know he gives one compromises the other word the other word they would corrupt each other and you could argue that they put off doing that now you know there are there are and a half people I mean we've been talking about this for maybe 10 years does the doesn't media agencies buying position compromise the objectivity of their planning and so you know who knows as this rolls out you know we we expect at some point and that's why this you know now this kind of watershed perhaps moment with this piece coming out is that it might be the beginning of this separation a real delineation yeah between a side of the industry which is principle-based brokered buying with no transport or little transparency and the only thing you can really gamble on as a marketer is it's going to drive some outcome and you might be happy with that or you view media in a slightly different way with a more strategic way and you require transparency of what's happening to your money what you're buying and you want to impose really better governance over that company's investment company investment and make the process more accountable in which case you're going to need objective independent neutral trusted you know expertise and advice which agencies are very capable of delivering but they can have to separate these things out I'd be just interesting to see how agencies you know over the next year deal with these kind of shifting sands because I think a line really needs to be drawn and as a marketer yeah you've got to decide and I think that's the right model - challenge so we had we had a transparency panel discussion last Friday and we some brilliant panelists discussing transparency and Trust yeah the broader context Bob Watson I think made up a brilliant concluding point at the end and and in front of an audience full of you know very high-profile brand marketers he laid down the gauntlet he said it was their responsibility to take a leadership position on how they wanted to work with their agencies moving forward and and perhaps that will be you know a rallying cry and a discussion point for the ia this is the difference that you're going to be attending in a company yeah exactly so in in two weeks less than two weeks I will be sitting in sunny Florida where's sunny London it's quite nice today at the AMA is advertising financial management conference which is like the big snow I think year for for me this is where the whole media rebate discussion blew out yeah last year room of you know 700 I think you know marketing procurement leaders in the mostly US and this is going to be one of the you know talking points I hope it is in the kind of halls and corridors at the conference because the assembled people in that room are going to be the main decision-makers they have to be the main decision-makers they cannot duck this this is such a big decision that brands are going to have to take when it comes to how they invest in media and I think it's going to be pretty black and white it's going to have to be so they need to kind of get smart on the issues and also the options because they're two viable options you know they're both contract compliance yeah you know potentially there's nothing to kind of dodgy about one of the other but there has to be a separation and the assembled crowd in that room are going to be people that have to make decisions eventually on this on this topic it's fascinating absolutely fascinating yeah so we're going to do a live broadcast from now yeah we are going to try yeah watch out for that so when I'm in Florida so in two weeks time we're going to do a media snack live from the a in a conference and pression idea yeah and we don't know how we're gonna do that we might do that and Facebook live or something anyway we'll figure that out we'll let you know but yeah we're going live it's the second up two key announcements from CNBC this week the first is that they are launching their in-house agency called catalyst yeah this is this is the initiative of max Raven who's SVP of sales at CNBC and he's developed a team internally that weren't just act as a as a sales facilitator that's the NBC but they're going to do a lot more they're going to provide insights they're going to develop content they will create experiences for their clients they're bringing a lot of the stuff that perhaps additional II would be the roles and responsibilities of agencies yeah in-house yeah so really interesting it is I mean they've been CNBC and other kind of international media platforms properties have for years been you know helping clients develop content and doing those direct eyes and deals with with some brands but I think what max has done which is very interesting he's packaged it and branded it and selling that like an agency service yeah and it's the first thought I've heard of that and that kind of model which you know in the in the scheme of the all the things we've been talking about is kind of interesting this is you know max sat on the panel last week where at CNBC very interesting discussion they are building agency capability at a time when perhaps you know trust in it in the agency model as he is he's perhaps under threat and we were just interested to think is that a trend now that actually media vendors and publishes content owners can start to really serve brands directly not on just more sales perspective as you said but from a full end-to-end agency service and he's reposition debt based on you know refocusing from price to value yeah and that's the reason that he's added so many more services because he wants to add a value to his clients offer yeah which is great and what else they do and so they've launched an international show called marketing media money yep which is going to be a 30-minute slot each week yes and it is going to is essentially designed around navigating the the fascination of the the marketing advertising and media industry through the lens of senior high profile marketers yeah so Keith wheat I think was yeah we had a glimpse of that you know interview that the kickoff interview I think it starts in May the show the kickoff interview was with Keith weed who's one of the most high-profile celebrated marketers CMO of Unilever yeah and it was quite challenging that was the good thing is it wasn't you know didn't give him an easy ride it really kind of challenged him to to be accountable and be articulate why they're doing the things that they're doing that's right which was good so whereas we said with max we're in a bit of a ratings war now so but I like to I mean that the bit that we saw I thought was was really provocative and insightful so I think it's the fifth of May 10 o'clock in the evening on CNBC I'm going to be watching and so finally just quickly we we we've talked a little bit in the past about you know championing independent agencies and particularly in this you know this large shifting sands of the industry that we've been talking about just today you know the opportunity in the room for great independent media agencies to flourish and and and succeed and announced last week was a new global media network that's built up of loads of independent agencies which is a nice idea so called local planets yeah this is a consortium of local independent media agencies across 40 markets and they've got some really high-profile you know agencies in there so the seven stars who we referenced last week is the UK's offering horizon which is one of the largest agencies in the US I think is the sort of the founding agency but across 40 markets they I think identified the the best independent agencies and together they've created this this global network in theory it's going to be agile it's going to be innovative transparency is one of the core principles which I think would be interesting which is great refreshing to hear and so with great fanfare they've launched this week and I think you said it's a great point of reference and one that I think will be really interesting to see how they operate in some of the you know the big global reviews that that we anticipate will kick off in the next quarter yeah and that means it's a challenge isn't it having a it's success is going to rest on the ability of these agencies who are I think all privately owned that's the bit for me that's really interesting is that there's no shareholding there's no so that the commercial pressures on that as an organization are going to be very different which means that they can probably be braver or they can do things perhaps that a big conglomerate type group can't do but the challenge is getting them all to work to standard to standards and principles that's the difficulties are and I've met a lot of these agencies we used to be called Columbus to this group and it could have been repackaged and rebranded and I spoke at a conference of there's a couple years ago and so I've met a lot of the principles of these these agencies and they're really interested in great entrepreneurs getting a whole bunch of entrepreneurs to collaborate with consistency across market is going to be really tricky but if they can do that then I think there's a there's a good chance they need the right brief and the right project to prove the model I think cigarettes great I think Challenger yeah for the network I was like what absolutely fascinating and I think I think clients will will really embrace a different point of view and so I look forward to seeing on one of our pitches yeah you gonna mention the books yeah miss Olympics before we go I just wanted to say thank you to our Chairman mr. jonbillett who very kindly has given us a whole bunch of new books to add to our burgeoning ID coms library so look out for a slight rearrangement of the shelves exciting on next week's music snack anyway that's it for this week thank you for watching bye for now weekend you
