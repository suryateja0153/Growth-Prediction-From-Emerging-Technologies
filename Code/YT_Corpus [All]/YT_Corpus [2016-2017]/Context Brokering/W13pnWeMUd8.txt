 we'll go see Amazon Web Services cloud-based a few business my name is deadlift course a time it's a pleasure for me to introduce our next guest to you he's a retailer I think from from the beginning may I say it like that he is worked 4 is Cara and he has worked for four caliphs and he is mr. amazon germany warm welcome to Ralph Clabo Ralph Thank You Ralph first question amazon amazon the amazon story and the amazon AWS story how does it come together well it came together this morning when i pulled out my my blackberry and and used to my taxi app that was the first time it came to get it this morning so um well I'm I'm glad to be here and actually I gonna talk a little about and remind you or recall that some of you might not know that Amazon is not only a web service company we're also doing other stuff like selling cat food and shoes and and I'm here to give you more der the real context yeah you might forget here because I think I'm the only non technical person you could hear that by saying i have a blackberry so thank you that you found your way up here I hope we gonna spend an interesting 30 minutes together and if you want that we have time you can also ask question in the end so this is about amazon so the first question must be who in the room loves reading raise your arm if you love reading everybody loves reading so let me give you a safety tip we call this a safety tip when you love reading the thing that you shouldn't read usually is shareholder letters letters to shareholders right there utterly boring its pages of pages of explanation why better for exchange rate changes political climate ruined what would have been a sensational business here right with Amazon it's slightly different I would highly recommend you to read at Jeff's letter to shareholders the one in the back is to shareholder letter from 1997 very early on where Jeff pretty much explained what is the strategy and the vision and and and why Amazon and what is all a roadmap what is long-term thinking vice is important what kind of culture are we hoping to build and it's a it's four pages it's a quick read you can find it on Amazon are and why do I say that because last week he released his letter to the shareholder from this year and he talks a lot about web services and why web services and Amazon is something that make complete sense right and I hope that at the end of my short 25 30 minutes I helped a little bit understand why we believe that web services and Amazon make sense so in our history this is one of the most often things people ask us what I who are you techne I retailer today they also asked are you photo studio are you publisher and and funny enough and easy enough the answer to this question always is yes yes yes that's that's that's what we are exactly and and not everybody understands why this is goods him so I hope I can do something to help with that it all started with Jeff's wishing to make the internet usable for customer and that was 90 95 Jeff Bezos he's not a retailer right he's a tech guy he studied electronics and computer science it was really fascinated by that thing called internet that came up and all of a sudden millions of people start using it and he thought like oh wow this this this is becoming really big and I try to do something to make this thing that becomes more popular and really big useful and so here's wishing and this is also written in the 97 a shareholder was to build infrastructure that makes the internet usable for customers and the first infrastructure he was thinking of man you've got to sell something to these millions of people right and so he had this vision to create a store that unlike my stores at Calvin escada who follow very strict concept they have four walls and a ceiling and then they hire smart people who have to figure out what to sell in these four walls and the ceiling the internet did not have these walls and ceilings so the vision was to create earth's largest selection the place where customer can find everything everything we're still not finished right so that's what mainly my teams do in consumer retail marketplace but today or last time I checked amazon has 480 million items sellable viable in our store so we built a store with 400 million the eight items that customer can choose and buy from and we building the service around it pretty fascinating if you think about my cow for fed like 40,000 items in it and now I'm managing the German store has about a hundred and eighty million two hundred million by a blazing so that was that was the vision and this was the website that enabled that vision and yes laughs everybody laughs when they see that website because the amazon logo you can see the amazon in the logo right it was more like a hand-drawn and anybody remember how the company should be named anybody heard the name the original name should have been Cadabra like abracadabra yeah like the magician thing that you can do and thank God the phone connections were so bad at the time that the registered agent understood cadaver and and chef thought cadaver is not a good name for a company so we got to change the name and he looked around and pretty much in a dictionary and his wife McKenzie found on the a word that is similar in all languages amazonas and so it became am on so as funny as this website looked it was really disruptive and I just copied you one comment from the bad press not to make a comment about Slade but that was their reaction they said god damn nobody needs that right and Jeff was trying to talk about on the website 1 million titles constantly low prices customer reviews right these are elements that are still core of our shopping experience on amazon so they were there in 95 the first time so very very disruptive nobody thought this is ever going to do something when I joined I joined in in 99 the German company was relaunched in October 98 i joined jus 99 baron just just released an article the one to the left and called us amazon bump this thing is about to explode write the article talks about how companies like sony and dell will eat us alive and honestly i was scared i thought this might happen in 99 and thank God we're still alive 2005 when Jeff was presenting the first kindle a his mother hates this picture actually PR told me to not use this picture anymore because his mother hates her pictures of badly Jeff was trying to explain the tech community why we built a device that literally can do nothing right and he was trying that for two hours like steve jobs in front of tech journalists telling them look this is to kindle and you know tech journalists check journalists would ask ok what's the cpu how can I serve is it what kind of colors what's megapixel camera and what kind of music how much music and I store on it and Jeff was you can't take pictures with that thing you can store music on it it's it's trying to be booked it pretty much can't do anything right it's black and white it turns pages and it's those books and everybody was like oh wow this is not going to go anywhere right and chef said no no a pretty convinced it's important because we believe that it this thing must behave we book because reading a book is a habit that is like 500 years old right and a book is a pretty dead thing right you never take pictures with your book you never listen to music with you but I don't write or not successfully so and that's that's what we were trying to building but going to a to a to a technology company asked them to build something that can do nothing doesn't work so we have to build it our own so I going to BWW and ask them or Porsche can you build as a car that only tries 10 kilometers fast I go like go away so the thing that was interesting was now shopping became normal right people are sitting in front of their smartphones in front of their PCs depressing a button they do shopping in a virtual range of product and pressing a button and they're not surprised when six hours laters the door rings the doorbell rings and somebody hands them a pair of shoe or package of dog food or a book or music or whatever right it became normal and i think it's a it's a it's a pretty magic thing when things became normal it became so normal that it became our most important pillar right these are the three business pillars of Amazon to the left it's what we call retailer marketplace consumer business it's about buying and selling goods to our customers amazon has around about little more than 300 million customers worldwide worldwide the second part is our digital investment that's about content and devices its music its books its gaming you may have heard about twitch or other stuff so all that falls into do the digital area and the third column is the one that you can experience here the most it's what I call computing and storage it's simplified I know it's much more than that but it's pretty much web services so amazon is trying to build infrastructure in these three areas right now right and i will talk a little bit about the infrastructure itself but before i talk about the infrastructure i think it's very important to know what what you what is the basic of this infrastructure and the basic of this infrastructure is to have to write culture what we believe you need to have a culture of innovation and that comes with a with a lot of important elements that are important to us so today the most bespoke or written innovations of Amazon are to the left at the germ anybody from Germany in Germany they have this wonderful what Ronan right the drones because it sounds really scary and journalist were painting this picture that somebody will drop a washing machine on your cat a drone will wrong delivery templates thousands of drones flying around Berlin it's a it's a serious experiment right we're trying to find out today our fastest delivery option in many cities is two hours one hour to hour delivery here Berlin for example is as a six-hour area so you can order until noon you get it delivered starting six p.m. in the evening and we're trying to figure out how can you go faster right what what are you going to do to be faster than one or two hour and that's why the drones kick in right and you shouldn't think about this becoming the most common use case but there is use cases think about a mechanic singing in front of a washing machine needing a spare part think about somebody who needs a medical treatment not want to wait longer than 30 minutes to get it right and of course you should start with the easiest thing if you innovate if you're in a way that you start with the hardest thing so trone's is too long it's a lot of air regulation it's long process today we're only allowed to fly in the US and the UK Germany has not yet signed off so there's a lot of regulation going on we could have gone a much easier way to introduce a concept of non-human delivery right we could have introduced I don't know a delivery kangaroo right ever so sweet the Amazon kangaroo dot here it comes right I want one of these so that would be less controversial but the drones is one of the longest hardest regulated things to think on the right by the way is called the robots right and germ press was writing their germany is all the workforce is gone automate it's all robots its amazon replaces workforce with robots the usual picture right that you have in mind when you present when you confront people with something new so these robots is actually a product of Amazon robotics it's a company in Boston formerly known as Kiva and if you're running a storage room then you will find out that your storage room consists 30-percent shelving thirty percent production flow where you do the packaging and the manipulation and thirty percent aisles right and that's really unproductive you need the aisles for human beings to run along and pick the things and drop two things into shelves but the aisles are eating thirty percent of your capacity in the fulfillment center so if you think about a hundred thousand square meter fulfillment center at amazon and a way to gain thirty percent more productivity we get rid of the aisles right and this is what robots stop doom so they put the shelves together and you can watch this is really nice it looks like dancing walls so they move the shelves together and then whenever an item gets order they remove the shelves they know what's selling fast what's selling slow and then they drive around the shelves to somebody who then takes out the product it's a really cool system I really love it but what I wanted to say is when you put out these new things right you shouldn't expect that everybody in the first minute understands why are you doing that and what is this good for you will always meet people that say act nobody needs that or this is never going to work so we put some of these things together so our employee and our workforce and our partners understand how we're thinking about the things we think anything that is easy can't be really something that we're aiming for right if you love innovation then you need to love experimentation and anything that you know the result in the beginning from the beginning is not experimentation if you love experimentation then you need to be ready to fail and Jeff in the new shareholder letter he actually writes that he believes that Amazon is the best place to fail right and that's really important because in many of the of the cultures corporate cultures you learn how to hide failure rather than celebrated in front of over everybody I'm admit not every celebration feels like a celebration some feel you i've just been ripped apart but in the end it's about sharing the learnings sharing the pain and that's that's what you need to be ready you need to be long-term thinking it's not going to happen overnight you're not going to run out of the and invent something completely new so you need to also be able to afford long-term thinking right that's a financial thinking dimension behind that whole behavior and and lastly you need to have a very solid anchor what you what you're aiming for and that anchor for us is to customer in all of our business areas so we call it we start everything working with the customer backwards and it's it's truly working backwards right so the first thing you got to do at amazon which is not a secret is when you have an idea you need to write a press release you get one page of paper to tell everybody what's so exciting about this idea which is usually the press release right you put it out in public in front of the people and you need to be able in like a very short paragraph tell people why this is exciting so we write press releases write me on a September 15 I think we should deliver in one hour or in customer is exciting stuff like that so we work backwards from the customer what Saudi a brilliant idea from D customers and many of these thinks that we've worked backwards I just put some on here right i mean for example i mentioned customer reviews which was a revolution right i recall when when i when my team's introduced consumer electronics into the german market it took three hours but including the customer reviews until i got a call from from a manufacturers that what the heck is going on your customers are writing that my product is not the best product right and some road it's actually the worst right and you should buy something else it was empowering people that buy vacuum cleaners to tell about their vacuuming experience and don't laugh you can go to the website i just checked this morning i have a favorite days and it's a Zeman's wacom cleaner 90 euros which has 1,800 customer and we all would ask ourselves what are 1800 people writing about a vacuum cleaner for 90 euros while they're riding a lot read it it's really interesting right it's like I I woke him the cat or the I couldn't remove the cat hair from the sofa or the cable is not long enough I need to lie on the floor there's like thousands of things that you can tell after you purchase the thing why you think it's the best or the worst and that's what customer doing and that what became a real habit and we enjoyed that habit or free shipping cost blues leave along for those who can't read German free shipping right free shipping is was one of the very important innovations for for customer you think it's pretty simple but up until free shipping customers literally had to do math on our website we asked them like all right you buy this vacuum cleaner for 76 00 99 cents and you we charge you for euros 86 shipping is you don't care right you say a amazon tell me what are you going to take from my bank account on my credit card I don't care what you call it right call it shipping call it packaging totally aren't a nice extra fee I don't care i just want to know what you deduct from my bank account so free shipping was brought one thing we call this a peace of mind functionality right you stop thinking about something you stop doing math exercises on a website so you're reducing the heavy burden of shopping and making more lightweight you made it make it easier and easiness and convenience are the two most relevant things that we've been working on and if you're dropping on our website I could point you to several of these function one click obviously you don't want to wait for the cashier always entering your payment information you store it once and then we get you out of the store in 60 seconds less than 60 seconds is actually the goal which is very different by the way from a physical retailer they try to keep you in the store as long as they can we try to get you out of the store as fast if we can we call this unstar thinking so we take the things that do not work for us in physical stores reverse them and make them work online it's pretty cool so I'm all this easy are some convenience things that we that we found we start bundling them we start bundling them in a program to make them easier accessible for customers we started off with unlimited free shipping free shipping all-you-can-eat next day free shipping was the was the message here in Germany so every order for our brine members on the german website gets delivered on the next day guaranteed and it's free of charge it's awesome it makes you stop thinking when does that thing come which is one of the most relevant questions that the customer ask when he orders that item when will I have it and i can tell you none of the customer or not many use cases order thing to wait right they have a party on friday they have a barbecue next week they have a kids football game tomorrow so you want to know whether the shoes coming when it's the BBQ coming when it's my tres coming so that's a very very important question so free shipping was one element we over time then added lending library because we know many of our customers love reading so you can rent out of 800,000 books as many and as long as you like we added a free instant video streaming right so you can stream from over 18,000 movies and TV series including our exclusive stuff like mr. robot or men in the high castle and last year we added over million music titles that you can that you can why because we want to make it easier to do things that our customer love to do they love watching movies they love reading books they love listening to music they love shopping online so we make it easier and easier infrastructure itself has to become easier and easier because what what we observe over the last year is that there's a huge transition going on and our infrastructure is part and and serving this transition transformation because you could you can easily see that people who love to buy things are now two large extent also people that love to sell things they became so familiar with the internet that they start not only buying on the internet but they start their own little sales business right selling a youth thing on amazon or ebay selling and using a creating your own product and start telling it in digital in physical format it doesn't really matter people that loved reading books are now authors right they riding a hundred and forty letters at Twitter they are author write a customer review at amazon so people more and more become authors and looking for infrastructure that helps them to publish whatever they write to as many people as possible because that's what you want to do when you're an author people that were consumers start producing stuff people that were loving games all of a sudden start the capability brokering the apps there and inventing their own new games making money with it maybe maybe some of you did that already people who loved watching films are now really making films look at youtube yeah millions of films one of the most successful publishing platforms for video content so there's this whole transformation going on and that whole transformation needs infrastructure and I'll give you a few examples out of our infrastructure so marketplace having creating the ability that somebody can reach our 300 million customer with as simple as a few clicks with their product enables buyers to become Zellers right this couple on the left hand side mr. and mrs. Hollinger from lunch bag unless it's a little small qtown little sales of munich they actually consultants or they were consultants they love chocolate they started their old chocolate manufacturing and had a little store in Landsberg right and they make really great product honestly don't start with it you gonna get addicted it's it's really I stopped visiting them because you can you can see I shouldn't do that anymore so they became really really good and they selling across Europe now they're chocolate product on on the Amazon platform right because it's trivially easy to export from the Amazon platform into all other countries where we host websites the german sellers alone last year realized 1.8 billion euro business outside germany on top of their business in germany's or german sellers also seller selling on amazon de also made 1.8 billion revenue outside germany just with that function it's just amazing and you can see the spanish guy who lost designing product and obviously is very successful seller on amazon so we're building infrastructure in many ways not only on the website and through payments we also offer our logistic infrastructure because not everybody loves to handle trucks not everybody loves to handle storage we're experts in storing product and receiving packaging and shipping it we also the ones that have probably the most diverse shipping options with partners like DHL harmless oups so we use every carrier worldwide including our own carrier system so we give our partners access to that by choosing logistic services our infrastructure if you want so as their infrastructure so all they do is ship their product to our fulfillment centers and then we do all the packaging and end up picking and the handling the product automatically applies for this six hour service right for this to our service something that the seller probably it would take him a long time to get up to that standard I talked about authors and whenever I talk about authors I love to mention papi j anderson it's actually I you can you can google her real name she's from North rhine-westphalia she studied history and she started writing love books right it's something with quarterbacks and football I don't know I never been into that so don't ask me about details and Papa J not only became the most successful author on the Amazon self publishing platform so she wrote that books she didn't find a publisher the usual story right because publish I cannot publish every book so that's why we built that self-publishing in vironment well because we don't ask whether this book is good or bad you just publish it so if any of you have a book and you don't know how to publish it use Kindle self-publishing you can then decide to translate it without using our program crossing so if you publish it in German but you also want it to be out there in English then we would translate the book for you and then publish it in English obviously this is a machine task write something a technology task where we're really good at where things come together so the vision for us in digital publishing was not like have a kindle in September and then a new version in March and then we build another device in febrile next year the vision we had on the wall was every book in every language in every country in 60 seconds that's our vision for amazon books and publishing and I think that's a pretty cool vision because if you if you talk to authors write all they wanted to do is have people give people the possibility to read their book nobody writes a book so it doesn't get read right so if you wish that everybody fewer if you in any in Indian author right and you're writing a book and you want every German to read it but you don't find a way how to get to Germany right as it starts with who's going to translate it the publisher will ask you how how many will you sell and you say I don't know the publisher so well then maybe I don't know I should do that right so that business only works if you have a automated scaling self-publishing functionality and you can see with Papa J Anderson's example that you can sell millions so she sold millions of books so we have I think two handful of German authors since the existing of the self-publishing programs pretty much two years old two handful of orders that sold already sold millions of books it's amazing and became a professional author today by the way she is self publishing and she's also using a publisher obviously publisher then get attracted and a publisher can do a lot of good things to books so she now has both systems because obviously exclusivity is nothing that we would aim for and it's it's the same thing with web services right over the years we just became expert in handling this this infrastructure that you need to store and process data I think you asked me how that was in 99 99 we were sitting there like any other company and were making investment decisions can we afford another HP Superdome and and will that be enough to to handle the customer demand at peak in the Christmas time which is probably the hardest it was one of the critical questions the second critical question that I was constantly involved will we be able to handle the temperature because these things when demand kicked in they start temperatures start going up by two three four degrees in our in our data centers and we had a hard time cooling it down and that's why oftentimes it would see a doc appear on our website and it says gone fishing that's when the websites crashed right so we were we were we crashed so many times that we learned how to not crash anymore and thank God it hasn't happened since uh since a long time but obviously over time you you learn to manage and to scale this infrastructure and and you all know that scale is the most important factor a growing at infrastructure because only when you're big you're getting the large cost advantages only when you're big you're attracting the people that are capable managing this complex infrastructure that are capable securing that complex infrastructure and at the end of the day if you asked a majority of the companies and probably that's a question that you guys asking yourself is do you want to do your business or do you want to manage a data network BMW will tell me we want to build cars right I don't want to build an IT infrastructure to not not well they wanna they want to do design and they want to have to the knowledge for the applications but they don't care as much where the data is living and word is stored in how it gets processed like did not care for the water that they used to produce their paint or whatever you use water for you ideally you just don't want to ask where is worries my data coming from it should be so safe that you can do that and you can see that this is just a traffic chart it shows the scalability and the variability in the number of hits on the amazon website so we we became an expert ourselves for these ups and downs ups and downs because we constantly have them and in germany what does this mean in in November at timeframe November we pretty much have like 35 million people in our store in and out in and out doing transactions here and there and and that's different over over the course of the day but you can never you can never accurately predict when it is going to happen I know that the one of the anecdotes is during world football championships right I used to get this email website down website down said no football game football game right because everybody shut down their computers and was watching footballs right and then a phenomenal four years later from the next championship I think it was two thousand four you could see a peak at halftime right people watch the game then they came at halftime and they didn't go pee but they came to shop and then they go watch the game again right so that saved us the emails web site down website down and the answer of football game football game you it's really funny so and I was talking about my taxi right my tech my taxi is actually the perfect use case for this up and down up and down think about the demand for taxis in the morning when everybody arrives at the airport or in New Year's Eve right when everybody wants to get home and all of a sudden needs to use a taxi right if you had to to host and build and manage the capacity for that peak for the whole year that would be very very very inefficient I don't need to tell you but it's not only the startups I think there's many use cases out there it's also the big guys that learn how to use and leverage the infrastructure we build character is just one example there's plenty of those I think I shouldn't go deep in death so I hope that our infrastructure is will help you to be innovators right will help you to create just like LMK I don't know if she know Alan Kay he was the guy he de Velde he developed to do not book 1968 it's the thing that you would call a tablet today so it was little early to present at 90-68 but it's a really fascinating story if you haven't have not heard of him I would recommend reading about his story and he had this smart sentences s you know I know nothing about the future and it's so hard to predict so the much easier way to predict the future is just create the future and I think I hope you all here to create the future and I hope we can be part of that creation process thank you very much but by the way this is not LMK this is my my PR my fancy PR guy put this picture in there I don't know where these guys going so I need to find out it looks a little bit dangerous no I no no no no I encouraging encouraging just to start so rad thanks for that a wonderful impressive speech so I learned a lot I love amazon for myself I'll use Kindle I how I I try to learn a lot about self-publishing either way I learned as the mission is just too to enable people to do what they want this is what I found very very impressive and it takes is a marvelous story so if you have any questions now to Roth please please use this chance to to talk to mr. amazon germany and now you're really so this is not only a story about technology not about computing it's a story about how to use the digital transformation your own life and I think you have thousands of stories in your own mind in your own business so what is yours just please join us in our discussion and is there any question in there in the moment no question everybody's impressed it up so Amazon this is asking go ahead right thank you very much for that presentation that was that was great and I think it became clear in your presentation that it's a typical amazon scheme but in the moment where where amazon has developed a certain capability for for themselves and it became very good at that it opened it up to other people or to other companies to let them benefit from that which is unusual but obviously very successful so how came that this has not been this behavior has not been copied anywhere else ah it'sit's really i mean it's a right observation by the way it was not our the first way how we approached it a marketplace was the first time when we opened the website after failing having several attempts failing how to attach with other sellers right so we launched a dynamic business called auctions because everybody said hey this is a really cool business there was a company that was really successful also in berlin and is still really successful with this business and so we went to do that and we build like what was a mall concept it was called Seth shops or C shops as you like failed with that and the first attempt at the necessity the understanding that this is necessary when you Swan to sell everything right and you do the mathematical exercise how much storage capacity you will need to store everything you pretty much end up with a very scary number of fulfillment centers and they are not pretty right they're very square and they block a lot of land and there's trucks moving in and out and you can imagine that you probably become the most unpopular company of planet Earth if you blast our earth with 1,000 fulfillment center so the the thinking was a lot how can we acquire storage space without building it right and that's what what you pretty much do by acquiring a seller because he has a storage space somewhere right even the private person who sells his three CDs you're adding two centimeters of storage for these three CDs I can't tell you why this is a not copied right I think it may be copied we not spend a lot of time of finding out why or why not things are happening reserve we're so focused on on our own experiments right and failure and now it really became the DNA look at the echo I mean echo a lot of people would tell you that this is a very critical revolutionary piece of the future being able to do things with your voice instead your hands right I'm looking at the young people here I'm a pretty old person right I'm used when I wanted to do a grilled chicken I became an electrician first because I read the manual of the oven and temperature and time and put it in here and push this button and then it's gonna be been playing and then I became a cook at the same time and would tell me sold in here parcel whatever right and then I would clearly chicken I I think the future is gonna be open grilled chicken crispy that's it right and the open will know what to do he will know how heavy did the chicken is even know how long to clearly then at which temperature program and this is a piece of infrastructure that we open up right out the gate right you can sign up out there and do your own experience experiments with Alexa the infrastructure behind the device echo and it's now became our DNA I think it so it's a process and I could imagine that other companies will do the same thing but I'm probably not the first person to find out who you're going to tell me so always way maybe we could ask another question everybody anybody of you uses Siri on my phone who is going to use syriza from time to time you did you ever ask what's the sense of life you know that you know the story you know the series I'm not testing it now because now technologies how is it Siri normally is telling you I can't answer this question but Alexis telling you the answer to this question is you know 42 great why because it's it's a it's a fantastic book that everybody should read douglas adams hitchhiker travel through galaxy of course great is that a great story i love this story and there's a wonderful spotify we will see this evening of the alexa spot and do we see what it does it's interesting right when you think about designing a persona for something that lives in the virtual experience we honestly need to spend time asking yourself what is the answer right do you want to be funny do you want to be strict do you want to be right up do you do you sound like my mother right like don't ask like okay mother I'm not asking right or you like my like my teacher I gonna lecture you on the trees of life right and there's a lot of thinking process because it will it creates that the answer will create the persona that the customer will have in mind and be able to connect or not connect with the system and that's something that that's actually a very interesting process I love this not only interesting is it's incredible it's seven absolutely i could see so talk hours about writing that persona so I think this afternoon some some of you can can win in some so and we have a raffle we have a restless i believe a cozy device yes my sis called echoed the infrastructure is called alexa yes yes and if you have the chance just participate and use your app so i think you can can treasure hunt yes special stone of the alexa treasure hunt and then tonight wheel will present the winner user warning if you have kids at home be careful they taste not stop interacting with that thing right then the the cool thing is you walk into your room you say alexa play with David Bowie and Alexa is going to play
