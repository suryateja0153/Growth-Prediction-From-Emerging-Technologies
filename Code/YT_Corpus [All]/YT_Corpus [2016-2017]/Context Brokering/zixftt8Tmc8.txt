 so we've heard we've heard a great deal over the last day or so about radicalization and there's a growing recognition I think there was in the room yesterday as well that this is an increasingly problematic term because often serves to obscure far more than it illuminates it allows us to package all of our uncertainty and confusion and say we have a word for it so we understand it and sometimes that can be problematic today I want to complicate that a little bit by addressing what it means to be radical both from a contemporary and a historical perspective and connect it and talk about what connection that has with youth and also then talk a little bit about digital media as you know I said I recently corrupt the UN's annual youth reports that'll be published in a couple of months of time and we can't make them available if people interested this works okay so some clarity I think is necessary here and I think we should start by stating that defining radicalism isn't without its problems historically radicalism has often reflected the predominant political ideology and social current of its time either by resonating with some aspects of it or by emerging as opposition to the status quo so the definition of what is radical is really dependent on the context from which it emerges many movements that considered radical by their contemporaries and we're even criminalized in their own time have over time gained acceptance and legitimacy and have now entered the mainstream you can take for example the emergence of movements advocating decolonization women's liberation civil rights environmental concerns LGBT rights you can any any number of concerns over the last century or so what does that mean for our discussion about radicalization well it means that speaking about radicalism really only makes sense if you situate it within its own contemporary socio-political context to put that differently radicalism doesn't transcend time you can't be a radical in an absolute sense you can only be a radical in a relative sense relative to your society and relative to your own time this is the definition I put forward in the report my subjective definition but we might suggest that radicalism involves at least one of the following the acceptance or espousal of ideas beliefs and attitudes that clearly contradict or fall outside of the range of mainstream or acceptable views within their own societies within their own societies so for example the racist and intolerant attitudes of neo-nazi groups in contemporary Europe would be an example of relic ISM today perhaps not 80 years ago but certainly today but another way you're thinking about radicalism is the employment of illegitimate methods or strategies in pursuing ideas beliefs irrespective irrespective of the legitimacy and mainstream acceptability of those ideas so I'd hope that everyone in this room accepts that animals have rights and should be protected from unnecessary harm but violent attacks on people and research facilities in order to stop them carrying out testing animals would be considered illegal an example of radicalism so radicalism involves the transgressing of either mainstream beliefs and ideas or legitimate methods and strategies and so it's found in the margins of the mainstream in both but I should add a cousin isn't necessarily a bad thing one way of thinking about this is that the ideas that positively cause a society to change almost by that very definition have to begin life on the margins or peripheries of society change almost never happens from within the status quo that's what changes it's it's something different to the status quo now I'm not suggesting for a minute that joining - Islamic States or a neo-nazi group could there be a good thing of course not but it does mean that if we want we have to think about this problem a little bit differently if we want to find solutions to it now who is drawn to radicalism is also worth thinking about because it impacts how we devise solutions to it and radicalism is generally understood as largely being a youth phenomenon historically speaking youth demographics have been brought drawn disproportionately to these sorts of movements and activities and exceptionally large youth cohorts or what you call youth bulges often make countries more susceptible to political violence that's a image from the Cultural Revolution in China for example where we had the Red Guards an entire generation for example and sometimes the very name of a group may sometimes reflect a youth demographic the name al-shabaab in Somalia literally means the youth in Arabic the name the Taliban from Afghanistan is the Pashto word for students okay I guess most strikingly today though how does them in the guise of al-qaeda or - is almost exclusively associated with young men under the age of 25 certainly under the age of 30 but under the age of 25 and originates in regions are experiencing this youth substantial youth bulge and I didn't this is unintentional but that image there kind of illustrates my point that I just made about radicalism being only in its time so Ronald Reagan introduced the Taliban as being the moral equivalent of the founding fathers in America okay while they were sitting in the White House of course that's not how we think of them today but in their own minds they're probably not that different in terms of what they think they're doing they're fighting an imperial superpower for example using this not dissimilar tactics so our idea of what radical means does change with time as well and of course those of you have seen Rambo three know who the good guys are in Rambo 3 fighting alongside Sylvester Stallone okay now we can identify certain critical factors which might make young people more susceptible to radical narratives or groups and I'll deal with I think the three that I think are the most important the first is identity crises and a quest for meaning to political disenfranchisement and three socio-economic inequality there are others but these are the three that I think are most important the connection between radicals and youth stems primarily from this transitional stage of identity formation during this adolescent period identity crises inspired by a host of issues present a state of vulnerability of heightened crisis and might compel individuals to seek comfort and belonging in groups that offer a safe and welcoming community of like-minded outcasts to speak many European jihadists for example suffer from an intense type of identity crisis they feel alienated from mainstream society but also alienated from their parents culture it's a kind of cultural schizophrenia in a sense and so in the absence of an appealing cultural base from either their parents or from mainstream society a certain type of religion becomes the identity by default in a sense it's not the appearance religion I should stress it's a certain type of religion often Salafism or Wahhabism adi culturally ad acculturated sort of religion so religion provides a rejection to the identity offered by their parents but also a rejection of the identity offer by Western society to which these individuals feel has already rejected them anyway and in some cases it's easy to understand why they might feel that way if we take the example of France as a case study and the experience of French Muslims the public discourse in France is generally quite hostile to Muslims and Islam broadly speaking at least over the last few years there's an ominous fear of Muslims of the immigrant of the other and it's what leads to amongst other things the desecration of gravestones of Muslim world war ii veterans restriction on muslim woman's dress there are number one bestsellers like Michelle Hill Baek su misión which in these kind of classic fear-mongering ways imagine a future France overrun by Muslims ruled by Muslims but I guess most significantly it's what's helped the far-right the the front last year now win a country victory in the European Parliament this slide actually reinforces my point let me explain what this does this slide that looks at perceptions of Muslims in a number of countries it's a survey the light blue bar refers to the actual number percentage of Muslims in a given country and the blue and the light blue bar together reflect what the average person in that country thinks the number of Muslims are in that country okay so let me explain what that means so in France for example Muslims make up about 8% of the population but if you ask the average French person on the street they think Muslims make up 31% of the population so they think that one in three French people are Muslim staggering disparity and that's reflected pretty much everywhere pretty much everywhere and of course if you take places like the United States we're seeing of this very kind of anti-muslim rhetoric going on that kind of figure would be you know far exactly exaggerated how do you explain that well part of it is the construction of public and media discourses and Muslims and Muslims might are beginning to be seen as a kind of a one unwelcome minority in a sense an unwelcome presence due to this kind of scrutiny now in that context it's not difficult to see how for many French Muslims feeling under siege and alienated in their own country an attractive religious identity might appear more appealing than attained national one and of course groups that prey on this kind of alienation end up benefiting enormously it's like state issues new passports when you travel there and many of the people from Europe publicly burnt their original national identity documents in response some countries France Australia others have also talked about removing citizenship from their citizens but of course that only serves to reinforce the perception of - as not just a legitimate alternative polity in the International World Order but also this kind of welcoming utopia and I should say that most most of the various propaganda that we see is involves you know the beheadings and the burnings and the violence is actually a very small proportion of the overall property onda something like 60 to 70 percent of the propaganda has nothing to do with violence it's about welcoming it's about utopia it's about State Building it's about identity but of course we don't see that because we are not the primary audience for that sort of propaganda the connection between youth and radicalism also stems in part from the exposure this formative stage to new ideas new outlets for expression provided by both expanding social networks and also educational opportunities for example the university is historically the home of radical ideas revolutionary beliefs precisely because it's often the first heady exciting exposure that students have to the political world around them many of the great political movements which were no doubt considered radical in their own time began life in university campuses intoxicated by new causes to animate them and struggles to inspire them students are never to be filled with enthusiasm and idealism but often are very naive and kind of unrefined variety well that's part of growing up of healthy political socialization and development students don't just experiment with sex drugs and music University about ideas to second point the second factor I think is important is disillusionment and with an alienation from traditional political processes institutions and structures young people often feel legitimately that the issues which concern them aren't being addressed through public policy through politics and that can sometimes result in a recourse to protest to demonstrations and where these legitimate protests on demonstrations proved unsuccessful or are suppressed by Gov individuals might begin to consider more illegitimate modes of being political rioting sabotage public disorder and even terrorism so radicalism might be interpreted as one of the ways in which young people seek to air their frustrations and grievances and also seek out structures that presumably allow themselves to feel they're being empowered socially and politically the third factor I'll talk about is socio-economic inequality and this is quite important I think high rates of global youth unemployment as well as other broader forms of socio-economic inequality I have have been central to youth grievances over the last years over the last few years the rise of anti austerity and inequality movements throughout the world largely rests on these sorts of socio-economic inequalities that disproportionately disproportionately target young people in these the youth bulge within much of the Middle East and North Africa and the associated lack of employment and other opportunities for young people was widely held as being one of the principal precursors for the Arab Spring young people experiencing blocked upward social mobility might find solutions to their predicaments in extreme organizations and movements returning to France for a second as the case study the two young Frenchmen who carried out the the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris last year held from the French pioneers for example these are almost ghetto like areas that are characterized as environments providing a heady mix of unemployment crime drugs institutional racism and endemic cycles of poverty and disenfranchisement and it's in these sorts of scenarios that radical groups might potentially offer an escape from a bleak future or a criminal past this slide is about six years old now so the figures are even worse but the I apologize for the color scheme nice colors but the light green refers to the actual percentage of Muslims in any given population and the dark green refers to the percentage that Muslims make up of the prison population in that country so if you look at France for example French Muslims make up 78% of the population in France yet they make up and this this is outdated now they make up almost 70% of the prison population in France let me repeat that again French Muslims make up 7% of the population of France but make up 70% of the prison population of France that's a factor of 10 difference I mean that should shame us all collectively that sort of statistic I think anyone who tries to explain to you why France is the leading kind of exporter of militants to Islamic state from Western Europe without fundamentally touching on this elephant in the room or this structural inequality is not telling you the entire picture let me say something about social media as well very quickly and youth audiences the Internet and in particular social media have emerged as a principal arena for youth political and social engagement of the last decade that's largely a positive thing I should say these platforms help to level hierarchies of knowledge and power they reinforce the democratizing and gallatin sort of nature of the the Internet and the new media environment but these technologies have also contributed significantly to the visibility at least of youth radicalism and extremism how do we explain that well principally it's a function of young people being what are sometimes referred to as digital natives rather than digital immigrants digital natives are defined as native speakers of the digital language of computers video games and the internet they're born into that world conversely the rest of us I'm sorry to point out how incredibly old all of you are but you're all digital immigrants we are all digital immigrants we weren't born into the digital world we've had to come into the digital world at some later point sometimes kicking and screaming and of course we adopt the aspects were not the same way that the digital natives do now for young people there is little that's new about the new media environment it's just their media environment it's only new to us that makes sense so it's just the media environment to them and for this newer generation of political actors most of their activities have some incarnation that takes place in the virtual arena anyway so is it really surprising if they're political activism or radical escapism also takes place within this arena I've got three seconds and I don't know how I'm gonna finish this but I'll take a couple more things now one of the paradoxes of the context of the new media environment is that despite enabling access to staggering amounts of information and data exposing users to new perspectives and experiences it still allows individuals to gravitate towards extremism because they find themselves in these very closed environments which effectively cocoon them from alternative realities interpretational frameworks and these online spaces can act us of echo chambers they don't have any debates any dialogue it's reinforcing that particular viewpoint over and over again ad nauseam in a sense it's very effective if you want to you know pend opponent to brainwash if you want someone towards a particular viewpoint and of course is has been very clever in invoking social media but also pop culture in its propaganda drive you've all heard of the hashtag Yolo you only live once well Yodo you only die once why not make it Martin okay the bottom line is quote from call of duty for example the most popular video game of our time for those of you don't know but when you play the game you play the soldier when you die you respawn you come back as another character this says well this is our Call of Duty and we respawn in Paradise to playing on the same tropes that they are familiar with let me conclude now let's be clear that from the outset that radicalism isn't necessarily always a bad thing rather radicalism usually indicates a political awakening for young people and the presence of latent energies and desires to change the world around themselves for the better at the very least it shows a dissatisfaction with the status quo and in fact we might actually contrast the political engagement of radicals how the problematic with the widespread apathy amongst youth in recent years evident from chronically low voter turnouts in pretty much all democracies the fact that so few young people vote when they're first given opportunity is surely a damning indictment of the state of young people's engagement in the status quo something we should be worried about consequently it might be more useful to ask how to divert the very same energies hijacked by extremists and radicals towards positive healthy outcomes there's an old adage that springs to mind if you're young and you're not a radical you've got no soul whereas if you're old and still a radical you've got no sense it's very difficult to be a middle-aged radical when you're going to mortgage and you need to take your cholesterol tablets and take your daughter's to college young people do engage with radical ideas and through that interaction try to change the world around them but also changing the process themselves and that's that's an important part of development and political socialization and that sums up really radical politics and how the role is played throughout time in a sense one of the most reassuring things for us should be the fact that people who join is are generally young the idea is that these groups are peddling lose their currency as you get older and I'll stop there okay thank you good morning I'm very happy to be here with you all I want to say thank you to UNDP and the Oslo government centers for our 40 minutes opportunity to share my experience with you yesterday we talked a lot about the process of violent radicalization the key drivers and we had a robust discussion that enforced what I believe to be now our shared understanding that radicalization is a very individualized process and there's no single pathway to becoming radicalized it's dependent on individuals and contexts everything we just talked about the socio economics international regional politics regional really just ideology and repression being just some of the underlying grievances and hearing the very engaging presentation from my fellow panelists Akhil reaffirmed a lot of that but I'd like to focus my remarks today on highlighting some of the things that are being done to prevent and to respond to about an extremism particularly focusing on youth led initiatives putting the Somalia situation into context and focusing also on gender-based violence however before proceeding to that I have to say at countering violent extremism or PvE sessions we always talk about the role of youth we emphasize this and we also acknowledge that youth sometimes are perpetrators but we overlook the majority of young people that are not perpetrators but are involved in positive initiatives that are that are preventing extremism so you mean yesterday the language around youth and the numerous mentions of youth being unpredictable being impatient or rash perpetuate the belief that youth have a big question mark on them and we must tread on careful waters when it comes to them as though they could switch at any moment so I think that in itself is harmful it's condescending and worse I think it's presumptuous so we really have to train ourselves as well to be very careful about that we practice what we preach and it starts with how we talk to and about each other with that said I'm still very happy to be here and to share my experiences with you all just to frame my context in Somalia where most of my experiences derived from in recent years al-shabaab has suffered major setbacks losing territory and support splinter factions have emerged further disintegrating a once powerful group ideological differences within the group the sustained military campaigns by Somali and au forces as well as the decline and support from communities has led to an increased number of young people defecting from the group in 2015 the Somali government has introduced a blanket amnesty program for combatants which further increased the number of defections but that came with its own challenges as well defections are only the first stage in the long process of disarmament demobilization and reintegration a process that is fraught with many challenges in Somalia as there is no form of peace agreement between the formal between the warring parties ex-combatants faced a myriad of challenges including stigma from communities harassment and arbitrary arrests by security forces fear of retribution by the group's they left and the lack of gainful engagement such as employ and education leaves these young people essentially in limbo after the break of the civil war in Somalia the founder of the organization that I now run the island peace and human rights center launched a campaign to disengage youth that were co-opted into the militia groups run by the Warlord's and he had a very very famous slogan called drop the gun pick up the pen successfully targeting thousands of young people across South Central Somalia 20 years later we are still working in the similar field with the shift in dynamics and the new phenomenon of violent extremism we are now focusing our initiatives on targeting young people lured into al-shabaab by a variety of drivers and vulnerabilities the next combatants who are received at the Owlman centers come from multiple routes some are transferred from the government's defectors program others surrender to their clans and others are drawn in by former colleagues we proactively work with security forces rescuing youth detained without trial on suspicion of being al Shabaab and unroll them into our centers as well as to prevent those very youth that have been in conflict with the law to not act on impulses of seeking revenge or retaliation for the missing treatment for the mistreatment they commonly endure while they're in prisons while defection have increased our see Bob's appeal has waned but not dissipated hundreds of youth are still drawn to its appeal within the country and also beyond within the Somali diaspora further compounding the problem which I alluded to before is the government's hastily conceived amnesty program which has in many ways been a debriefing Clearing House contributing to mixed messaging and unclear legal implementation implications for those willing to leave the armed group young people who defect or are detained in raids are held incommunicado for months they're interrogated and they are paraded before the media a bigger number live in fear within communities that I best reluctantly let them back in and then brand them as outcasts they face continuous threats and extortion from security forces and they live in extreme poverty a bigger group of fighters remain engaged in Al Shabaab despite realizing the group's misplaced claims and false ideology it's a pragmatic reluctance driven by their witnessing of the witnessing of the treatment of ex combatants by communities and government security forces so I believe it's imperative that all preventive that preventive work on violent extremism needs to target both combatants security forces communities and improve the overall process of reintegration and taking to account the wider challenges and reduce the appeal for violent extremism so our theory of change is threefold and under this strategy what we do in Somalia is we provide direct services to children and to youth and to women that are directly involved with armed groups we help them to disassociate from al-shabaab and become disengaged we facilitate social movements on youth leadership on culture change through education using our centers to both work with former fighters for their individual recovery but to start the conversation within the community to dissect beliefs concern reintegration acceptance of these very people and the community's own responsibility and preventing further recruitment from taking on in many ways we end up brokering the contact between the people's movements at the very grassroots and the state and traditional bodies to achieve deep and lasting change to the issues that youth continuously face we employ activities such as civic education and policy work not just responding to the affected communities but working with the government to ensure there's legislation and policies to create a more enabling and preventative environment we provide interim care centers and undisclosed residential locations throughout the country excuse me we provide residential locations in areas in which we work we provide the religious psychosocial ideological vocational economic and educational rehabilitation and reintegration services we work with charismatic young religious leaders to support those who join al-shabaab because they actually believe the ideology it's imperative that for every grievance or Driver which led these young people to join the armed group that we have experts to dispel or alleviate those thoughts and feelings and that can only be done by qualified individuals but are also relatable to the demographic they are working with common themes that these young religious mentors discuss with formers include gender jihad violence law an ambiguous text in the Quran but they also import important life skills such as communication critical thinking and conflict mitigation through nuanced discussions on the ethics and etiquette of disagreement as well as humility and the possibility of being wrong or misled and how to come back from that this is an important message particularly when being sent from someone on the same level or in the same age group as them these sort of one-on-one dialogues reveal the uncomfortable truth within ourselves backed by real examples of supporting verses in the Quran this is what really supports used to reflect deeper on their very own ideologies that they once believed they had a very definitive position on excuse me we believe very strongly in building the capacity of credible and influential voices that already exists within the community in which we work and subsequently providing them with the necessary tools and resources to go on to educate their own communities on countering and preventing violent extremism we found much greater reception and understanding and spreading of the messages that we have been trying to send a rejecting extremism when it comes from actors that already have influence in their local constituency so we've rolled out a series of trainings throughout the country for local civil society organizations on countering extremism excuse me it's the weather change so we rolled out a series of trainings for local civil society organizations on countering extremism empowering them to then take the lead on facilitating these discussions in their communities and we had local youth organizations training women leaders religious scholars security forces and the purpose of this model was that young people that are already doing very important work were imparted with the skills and then given both the technical and the financial resources to continue to mainstream this throughout their community so it's not another entity coming from the outside in the past there have been many grand conferences and summits and reconciliation events organized in Somalia for Somalia and often outside of Somalia on reconciliation but was always missing about this is that they take the elite actors that by name and in title represent a community but are so far detached that they don't actually have the means in place to go back and impart these lessons of social cohesion another aspect that was missing too is that when people are taken outside of the country for reconciliation efforts they're not provided with the resources to come back and actually implement it and what we try to do in Somalia is to not only amplify the voices of thought leaders but to provide them with the resources to do it in their community at the moment there's a plethora of actors in the CV PvE space the many different coordination bodies in place they're working groups and all of that the focus on this fail to adequately incorporate the perspectives of national organizations of particularly local youth initiatives this is certainly an issue in Somalia but surely in other civil society experiences as well CVE has been looked at through a security lens through a peacebuilding lens and now more recently through a developmental lens yet it's still a very difficult space for civil society and what the global attention on it now is becoming increasingly challenging where governments decide the appropriate levels of engagement of civil society where it is appropriate or not appropriate for them to be a part of it and among the greatest differentiating factors that at least I thought between counterterrorism initiatives and CVE or community was the community aspect yet we're still seeing many of the same actors that are involved between CT and CVE initiatives because of this role because of this the role of youth has become passive they are not empowered to actually influence overall responses and prevention efforts and our participation is frequently limited to implementing partners although our actions in our influence within the communities that we are from are indeed transformative and I think this is a missed opportunity because of the diminished ability of youth to contribute to conceptual issues effective collaboration between the various governments and the international counterparts is also hindered I've mentioned the positive examples where we and Somalia have been able to work with government directly in the disengagement and rehabilitation but that's not to say that it's a perfect situation we are harassed we are threatened and often excluded by government and security forces we are not viewed as allies but sometimes as a nuisance forcing themselves into this closed space I'm often asked how is it that you do this work and that you are not targeted to which often responds there is an odd sense of protection and being overtly exposed where people know your mission and what you're about but really the protection that we should be getting from government not there we're getting that protection through the recognition and support that we have from community which bears the question of how can we as actors that are working to prevent violent extremism work with communities to restore trust between security forces when we ourselves that are working with them are also at risk of unlawful arrests and disappearances and gross human rights violations we need clearly defined roles and stronger partnerships grounded on mutual respect and cooperation another big challenge for young people working in this space is funding access to funding opportunities and exposure for youth to access different actors that are doing the same or similar work it's important and now the world is acknowledging the plight of youth in this day and age and the increasing declarations and rhetoric to support youth initiatives is constructive but moving forward it's also important to actually invest financially in youth led initiatives to be able to continue what they do the important work young people are doing around the world shouldn't constantly just be reinvented because you don't know about it but we need more opportunities to share experience and learn from each other I was too I'll also talk about gender-based violence in my topic and it seems I'm running close to out of time but quickly I'll touch on this my organization as was said in the introduction co-founded the first rape crisis center in Somalia through our sister Somalia program we generate our discussion on gender-based violence that never before existed in the country we went from a situation where you couldn't even help a victim of sexual violence let alone do public advocacy around it but now it's very much gender-based violence is on the social and on the political agenda with sexual offences bills in place a legal framework to hold perpetrators to account starting to shape up and a society that identifies gender-based violence as a violation of Human Rights and not just a milestone in a girl's life but when it comes to looking at the gender aspect of countering violent extremism or preventing it women and girls are still viewed as just victims only the spoils of war and which they are forced temporary marriages sexual slavery girls impregnated by militants and then abandoned and then ostracized from their communities is all too rampant and we see this often this is industry this introduced many gender specific constraints in their reintegration and ability to rebuild their lives that's very unique from the experience that we've seen with boys and young men but the other rule that women and girls also play that is over often overlooked is the role of perpetrators and we support girls who were fighters and informants and Porter's or domestic workers but in that process have adopted extreme ideologies women and girls face the stomach gender-based violence discrimination and marginalization in Somalia which was recently ranked as one of the worst places on earth to be a woman so groups like al-shabaab take advantage of this by selectively targeting women and girls under the auspice that they can offer protection and justice under Sharia law or physically arming them to defend themselves for girls who have been raped without any accountability for their perpetrator being armed and joining al-shabaab is as much of a means of self preservation and protection as it is the way of vengeance and taking inflicting pain on those inflicted pain on you we do a lot of work on women and girls that have been sexually exploited and abused by foreign troops as well in Somalia and I want to give you an example of what happened a couple years ago where there was a very public case in Somalia of a young woman who was kidnapped by Somali forces taken to an AU base was raped and then tossed out to the street naked and she was very public about her sexual abuse by the AU forces and it caused an outrage in the country and this is one of the uncomfortable truths that we have in our society to where sexual violence is rampant but when it's a non Somali or a different actor the society mobilizes a lot larger to to collectively voice their disconcerning it but what happened in this process when a you and thus my government collectively denied those allegations upfront al-shabaab capitalized on that and they took to the radios and mobilizing people to send the message that not only did the infidels come to take over the country but now they're pillaging and raping our women so you must bomb you must attack and revolt against the system so I think it's also interesting to see that they have a unique ability to use gender issues when it suits their message and this is something that needs to be carefully viewed as well so we've looked at women as both victims as perpetrators but most importantly they're champions they are key actors in preventing violent extremism and we work with mothers in Somalia to not only prevent violent extremism but to start the conversation at homes and this is something that I can discuss more in the panel as well thank you very much I'm very glad to be here today again I think that I kind of lose the authority on saying that young people don't get spaces when I got space toys in the same conference thank you for that the world has never been this young today we have one point eight billion people between the age of 10 to 24 never again is there likely to be such a potential for economic and social progress however young population especially in conflict and post-conflict context is mostly we've as instigators of violence and sometimes as a society's vulnerable section that needs protection even in yesterday's conversations we heard a lot that youth the notion that you'd need to be fixed and about the youth problem and I think and we think that this is actually the problem which needs to be fixed we have to recognize young people as actors and peacebuilding talking about my own experience in peace building and countering violent extremism at aware girls which is a youth-led organization we have developed a youth Peace Network which focus on preventing and countering violent extremism through promoting peace activism among young people and engaging young people as partners in promoting societal tolerance ruralism non-violence and conflict resolution we have developed disengagement strategy which uses pure education individual engagement positive role models indigenous narrative of non-violence and mentorship as tools I want to talk about the disengagement strategies a bit in detail the way we use it how well it is working we engage young people in peer education we have seen peer education as an effective tool for disengagement because when peer approach peers when peers approach peers they relate and connects easily to each other they don't feel like being told what is right and what is wrong for them instead they explore the phenomena and dynamics of an issue together and build knowledge together young people are more receptive to change their mindsets through peer to peer approaches peer to peer approaches provide opportunities for personal engagement for sharing and refining their grievances hopes and desires young people empathize with each other they generally don't lecture to one another yesterday we talked about role models and how being belonging to a group give youth an identity and a status which can act as a push factor or as a pull factor through the youth Peace Network which we have established we glorify peace for youth we make peace a matter of energy adventure and creativity we have provided a network to young people with whom they can associate themselves and can build their identity as peace activists it becomes a matter of status and pride for youth to be associated with such networks along with their peers and along with their comrades every year the existing members of youth Peace Network brings in their friends and peers for membership to the network their peers had seen them being associated with a network they get inspired and they want to be associated with the same network in 2009 we started with a group of only 30 young people today we have 20 active groups in different part of Pakistan and Afghanistan reaching out to more than 3,000 young people annually networks like youth based network make youth feel significant and it also helps helps them make dream for a better path in life and for a peaceful society thus it convinced them to contribute towards peace justice and equity in their communities we believe that give youth a dream and they will together use their synergies for bringing peace when we work on countering extremism we don't use counter narratives for example we don't tell them that Taliban are - are killing people and killing is bad and do you want to be a bad guy we don't use this counter narrative because this is not helpful they already know that Taliban and - are killing people and they already know that it's a business of killing and killing is bad but they have been convinced and they have decided to do that business so we don't go and tell them that what you are doing is wrong so most of the most of the counter narratives that we see are often they are often general public repetitive messages and they don't provide an opportunity of individual individuals engagement on the other hand we have seen that the extremist organizations they provide huge opportunity of individual engagement if you see their Twitter post for example you will see 1,000 retweets you will see the hashtag used by thousands of people so they find an opportunity of individual engagement and I think that is one of the pull factor for them let me give you an example from our very own context in 2009 when Taliban were gaining control in Sabbath when they were getting influenced do you know who was the who which was the biggest section of society which supported Taliban women women gave them the biggest support women would come out they will give out their gold so that Taliban can get funds why women were giving their jewelry and gold because when we hear about Taliban Taliban are someone who oppresses women so why in savate this is on record wines of ottoman were giving so much gold and their personal money without the permission of their husbands and mined it we live in a country where women don't even breathe without husband without the permission of the enhancement but they were giving out their gold without the permission of their husbands why because Taliban gave significance to a section of society which was ignored by the rest there was free media then but the media and the people the civil society no one was talking about a woman no one was talking to women even if they were talking about woman no one was talking to women and one the Taliban leader mallanna for Allah when he started his radio channel he specifically started a program in which he would talk to women in which he would talk about women's issue this was for the first time in the history of that place that someone gave significance to women someone started talking to women someone started talking about women's issues someone was responding to the questions of woman that is why women became their greatest consumers of the radio programmes of Taliban and they became their greatest supporters so when we build narratives minded that there are some really effective strategies which we often leave out so when we talk about narratives to counter violent extremism it is important that rather than countering narratives and telling people what they already know we should ensure that we provide opportunities of individuals engagement we empathize with the young people and we offer significance in our work we engage young people in community dialogues and intergenerational dialogues interfaith dialogues and activities which help them explore their own indigenous pluralistic discourse and indigenous movements of non-violence I work in the northwest of Pakistan where we had a very historical indigenous nonviolent movement it was known as hidayah the mudguard movement and the movement the movement was developed in when people were struggling for freedom for British Raj there was a local movement known as kadai with mat gar which was using which was mob and young people were part of that move and they would go to the communities and they would mobilize them for social welfare and nonviolent civic action so when we work on countering violent extremism we don't create new narratives we use our own existing indigenous alternative narratives and the indigenous narratives are powerful because people can see that we have not imported these narratives and these strategies from somewhere else these are very local strategies these are very local narratives which were developed by our own elders by our own people so they own it and they can see the relevance another effective disengagement strategy for youth is to provide them platforms and opportunities for building their own initiatives small-scale initiatives research shows a small-scale local initiatives are more effective than large-scale programs in reducing violence through use through youth Peace Network as I had already said that we engage young people as partners in peace building and countering violent extremism so in the network young people built their initiatives for PvE C V or peace building whatever you call it and we support them in the last seven years we have supported a range of initiatives of young people in the network which included peace education programs mediations of conflicts in the communities interfaith dialogues engaging madrasa students and digital media campaigns besides working at grassroots level for peace building and countering violent extremism young people are pushing global boundaries as well for peace building in December 2016 United Nations United Nations Security Council passed a resolution recognizing the role of young people as important actors in peace building resolution two to five 0 the resolution recognized that young people including youth beside that young people are important actors and in peace building and and young people youth peace activists especially organizations like United Network of young leaders were and were one of the major force behind this resolution we were working for years and years we were convincing we were building partnerships and we work on wincing the state members and development agencies that how important it is to have a global document to have an international commitment which actually recognize recognizes the role of young people as piece builders and in December 2016 United Nations Security Council passed that resolution and that is why young people like me are hopeful today because for the first time in the history UN adopted a resolution that focuses entirely on the role of young men and women in peace building and countering violent extremism the resolution acknowledged the urgent need to engage young peace builders in promoting peace and countering extremism the resolution also position youth and youth led organizations as important partners in global efforts to counter violent extremism and promote lasting peace this resolution is a major breakthrough in our collective efforts to change the predominantly negative narrative of youth and start recognizing their significant role in peace filling now we look forward to the implementation of the resolution two to five zero on Youth peace and security we urge that in partnership with the young people national and regional action plans are developed for investment in young people enabling them to fulfill their peacebuilding potential we look forward at countries find ways to meaningfully engage young people in decision-making processes at all levels to engage young people in peace negotiations and to engage young people in implementation of the peace agreements we hope that measures are taken to support youth let peace initiatives and that human rights of young people who are living in conflict our post-conflict zones are protected we also hope that the agenda of CVE and the agenda of youth peace and security is not used to shrink spaces for youth let civil society organizations but is used to create more civic spaces for youth led organizations I want to share story of Farooq and I want to tell you that why I believe that young people are important actors in peace building it's not that because I'm a young person that's why I think I should sit on the table and I should be doing everything it's because of my experience it's because I have seen these hundreds of young people just in my own community were working for peace I want to share story of Farooq I have already shared some stories yes trade but I want to share story of farouq farouq is one of the peace activists now he is a young person from the tribal areas of Pakistan where Taliban had enjoyed control for a long time life for Farooq under the regime of Taliban was as a young man was very difficult because he didn't wanted to follow the Taliban code of life and the Taliban code of dress so he would often stay at home because he didn't want to be seen outside not having beard and the Taliban dress code but one day Taliban raided his home and arrested him for not following the code he was taken to the prison once he went to the prison he saw dehumanizing behavior of Taliban he got really frightened that was a very traumatic experience to be in the prison of Taliban and seeing the dehumanizing behavior of Taliban with other prisoners his brother had to pay a huge amount of money to release his brother but as soon as he got released he decided he will not live anymore in his village and he moved to Peshawar which was a Taliban free zone so he moved there but luckily once he moved here he got to meet other young people who were members of the youth Peace Network he was amazed to get connected with the young people who don't see themselves who were not seeing themselves as victims but they were saving seeing themselves as actors in peace building and they were reclaiming their spaces their progressive spaces from extremist organizations he decided that he will join the network so he decided he joined the network and together with other young people he he started an initiative of young men to reclaim their spaces from extremist organizations he went back with his group to his village he talked with the elders with the tribal elders and he raised funds and with those funds he organized a youth sports festival in a time when it was difficult for people to come out in public spaces because of the fear of Taliban at that time he built he brought together elders he brought together young people and they organized their first sports festival and they also used that festival to raise funds for education of children children new kin who couldn't afford to go to public schools and therefore were sent to Taliban mattresses by their parents he started raising funds with this coming with his friends and today he is sponsoring their organization is sponsoring education of three hundred students and besides that they are also imparting peace education and more than ten lakh local schools because he's aware that the kind of education and the problems of an education system has so he's also knee with his team is also imparting peace education in more than 10 10 local schools Farooq through his local small scale initiative has become a role model for many he is an example of being significant and relevant to his community this is the power and potential of young people that is why I believe in the power of young people I invite all of you to go back to your community find a Farooq build partnership with him support him and together with him build peace in your community thank you
