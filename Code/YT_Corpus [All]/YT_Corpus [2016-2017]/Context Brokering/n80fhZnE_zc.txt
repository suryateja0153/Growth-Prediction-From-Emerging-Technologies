 to welcome you all to the berkman lunch series and welcome Vicky cats who is here to speak about her research on the under connected in America how lower-income families are responding to digital equity challenges this talk is part of the inclusive innovation speaker series a series of talks about how marginalized communities create adapt and use technology to serve their own needs and goals a couple housekeeping announcements before we begin please be aware that our luncheons our webcast live and recorded on our website for our website people can ask questions and participate online via twitter using the hashtag berkman and ricky is happy to take questions during the presentation and we particularly encourage questions from new people in the audience who have joined us this week so a little introduction Vicky cats is an associate professor in the department of communication and affiliate graduate faculty in the department of sociology at rutgers university she conducts research on immigrant and low-income families efforts to access us social institutions resources and opportunities with a particular interest in how digital equity issues affect these experiences her findings have been published in journals including American behavioral scientists journal communication and social problems she is the author of kids in the middle how immigrant how children of immigrants negotiate community interactions for their families and co-author of understanding ethic ethnic media producers consumers and societies she holds a BA from UCLA and an MA and a PhD from the Annenberg School for Communication and journalism at the University of Southern California Thank You Vicki so thank you is it we can hear me I hope yes okay thank you very much Emmy and thank you to all of you for making the time to be here it's a it's a thrill to get to speak to the Burke mania having followed so many of your work for such a long time so I'm going to talk to you today about a project around digital equity and it's kind of fun to talk to a group like this because there's very little introduction that's required for understanding with digital equity is and why it's important but as equitable access to the internet and Internet connecting technologies has increasingly become recognized as being linked to social inequality more generally that the people who are least likely to be connected or to have quality connections are those who experience other social inequalities more broadly the fear has obviously becomes the digital inequality may exacerbate existing social inequalities but the hope is that access might ameliorate some of those inequalities and we've seen that rhetoric play out especially within the schools that being connected for kids in schools is and has become an urgent national priority many of you may be familiar with Obama's Connect ed program that over the last number of years has worked to put high speed broadband into all of the nation's schools and they're reporting that they're close to ninety nine percent at this point and as schools have become effectively universally connected the focus has moved more and more to what happens outside of school so looking at children not as students in schools but also as children within families and that's where my project is situated out of the 2010 National Broadband Plan came a proposal to have subsidized broadband internet available for families whose kids are on free and reduced costs lunch at least in the original formulation of this plan this would have been a government-run program what happened in the wake of the Great Recession is that it became a public private partnership with local telecommunications companies which means that the programs were rolled out unevenly and a little bit differently in each site depending on who had taken the sun sometimes telecommunication companies did this as a condition of a merger sometimes for other types of benefits but it rolled out differently in different places and so the program is called connect to compete I'd offered 995 a month subsidized broadband access to the lowest income families of school-age kids in some places that was prepared with the opportunity to purchase a refurbished computer or Internet connecting device at reduced costs and in even fewer places it was paired with skills training for parents and children and so what I was interested in as the rhetoric around this program was you know starting to become stronger and the program was starting to be rolled out is what was the bottom-up response to these kinds of top-down digital equity programs where these programs meeting people's needs how were they responding to them how do parents make decisions about adopting subsidized broadband programs that are available to them in their community in context of the other kinds of technology initiatives that might be available for local school districts but also their own independent decisions to purchase technologies or to have broadband access within their homes how do parents and kids make decisions about adoption how do they make decisions about integrating technology into their everyday lives and how does that look different depending on the local environments in which those decisions take place I'm going to talk less about the local level differences today just in the interests of having time for discussion but I'm happy to take questions about that and my colleague Carmen Gonzalez and I recently published an article on the local level differences in American behavioral scientists and I'm happy to share with you as well so let me tell you just a little bit about the study if we can that I conducted so with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation this was a project with two stages between july 2013 in February of 2015 I a very talented team of bilingual and bicultural student researchers to conduct open-ended interviews with parents and children in three school districts that were demographically similar one in Arizona one in California and one in Colorado all three districts from majority Hispanic and specifically majority Mexican heritage meaning that parents might be immigrants or us-born but of Mexican descent and I'll explain why in a second and more than three-quarters of the students in these districts around free or reduced-cost lunch so all high poverty districts all Mexican heritage all districts that were rolling out connect to compete so we knew that across all three district families had the possibility of access to at least one subsidized digital equity initiative aimed at increasing broadband adoption the reason that I focused on districts that were specifically Mexican heritage is because a lot of diversity is lost under the umbrella label of Latino and Mexican heritage youth are those that face the greatest social inequalities in the United States they're more likely than any other group to be growing up in poverty more likely to have a parent that hasn't finished high school and/or to have a parent that doesn't speak English fluently and so I wanted to focus on the highest need group within our fastest growing demographic with a rational rationale that rising waters kind of carried all ships if you've looked at the highest need groups you will capture some of the needs of groups that have slightly less vulnerability but not the other way around and so in each of these three school sites we work very closely with schools through a rapid approach to qualitative data collection we spent between two and three weeks in each study site and conducted interviews with between 50 and 60 families in each district in that time interviewing parents and kids separately for about an hour each in their language of preference either at home or school according to their preference I'm happy to talk in more detail about what we what we asked them about but we really asked questions about how from parents and kids perspectives how they make decisions about adopting technology how connectivity affects family relationships learning activity connections to local services and resources and we tailored those questionnaires to each site to some degree some of the questions were universal but we also ask them about local initiatives that were happening in the districts so that we could look at that as well all the parents had children a focal child that we interviewed between kindergarten and eighth grades ages 6 through 13 so we had an enormous amount of qualitative data which we which we coded and analyzed it's a data set that we're using in a variety of ways to understand things in its own right but we also used it to do something that's a little bit more unusual we use what we found from the qualitative data to inductively develop a survey questionnaire that was a nationally representative look at lower income parents with kids in the same age range and I say that this is unusual because very few national level surveys do systematic qualitative data collection ahead the questions that we asked came out of our interviews the categories for answers came out of our interviews and so the convergence amongst our results is something that we feel more confidently actually shows us that there's a there there because we were asking questions that came from one of the demographics that we surveyed so in spring of last year did a nationally representative phone survey on cell phones and landlines parents with kids in the same age group we focus not just on families whose kids qualified for free and reduced-cost lunch we also focus on the lower-income families meaning that to qualify you needed a kid in school between ages 6 and 13 and you needed to report a total household income below the national median for parents raising kids in the United States or to 65 thousand dollars about half the sample was why thirty percent Hispanic sixteen percent black and amongst the Hispanics almost two-thirds were of immigrant were of immigrant stock and half where spanish-speaking so we've got a robust sample of Spanish and language and English language parents so I want to talk to you about three points across the two data sets in our time today the first thing is related to family connectivity which is that we found both in the qualitative and quantitative portions of the study that most families are connected but they're not as connected as they want to be so amongst our our our survey of respondents ninety-four percent of parents in this demographic report that they have internet access so this is a far cry from the rhetoric of the digital divide that you know these are the families that would fall on the have-nots side of that binary right ninety-four percent of them have internet access amongst those who report income's below the federal poverty level it's 91% right of the ninety-four percent that have access two thirds report that they have home broadband access 23% or mobile only meaning that they have a smartphone or a tablet that they used to connect to the internet but they don't have a home computer either a laptop or a desktop 5% report having dial-up access at home and been six percent report that they don't have access we also found that eighty-one percent of families owned either a laptop or desktop computer seventy-nine percent have at least one smartphone in the home and two-thirds 67% have a tablet right so these are homes that are more media rich and more connected than would be presumed for lower income families raising children yeah yes we I I can't remember it off the top of my head but it sits within that 23% I think it's about a quarter yeah but we asked them whether or not they're connecting through a data plan or whether they're only connecting in public spaces that have Wi-Fi including libraries but also local businesses I can I can check that but the majority had data plans of some kind yeah are you using for broadband we asked about four different questions where we asked in a variety of ways you know whether they had fiber whether they you know had a high-speed connection we used every possible word we could use to and then group them together to see what we count on the next slide you'll see though that this is only the very beginning of the story because we can the digital divide or digital inequality is not not over let's let's put it that way right so if you stop at just the access question this looks great right Wow we've really done an amazing job of connecting lower-income families except that would we find is that access is not enough of a question what we're proposing as opposed to the digital divide binary that we tend to still use since the 90s when it reflected a reality in the early days of the internet is that it's not enough to ask whether or not people have access it's really a question of whether or not there is connected as they want to be right how high quality is that connection how consistent is that connection so based on the interviews and what people had said their challenges to staying connected were and as connected as they wanted to be we asked people a variety of questions about whether or not they'd experienced certain problems with their connectivity in the last 12 months and we ask more questions than these but for those who have home access more than half reported one of one or more of these issues that their service had been cut off for an inability to pay that too many people share the computer for them to have enough time on it that their services too slow for the quarter of parents who have mobile only access you can see that almost thirty percent of hit their data limits in the last year one in four has had their service cut off to do an inability to pay and one in five say the too many people share the device for them to have enough time on it for immigrants Hispanic parents the number who have experienced at least one of these challenges is sixty-five percent of the that sample right so there's variation within but what we are forwarding is this idea that rather than looking at connectivity as a binary which is something so many people including many in this room have been arguing for years it's time to put the digital divide to bed and think about this in a more textured way is that we're offering this as another contribution to that conversation that may be thinking of people as being more and less connected and who's under connected offers multiple avenues for trying to remedy this from a policy perspective from a program perspective and so on yeah smartphones what access to young people have to those smartphones what for Senate it's funny that you ask that let me tell you if you get an advanced coffee of these so i want to show you why mobile only doesn't get us to solving the problem either because there's been a lot of rhetoric especially in the last five or eight years talking about the high rates of adoption amongst young people amongst people of color lower income adults and kids of mobile technologies many people have made at least the insinuation that leap frogging over the laptop or the desktop computer isn't that big of a deal and that mobile can replace that replaced the capacities of a computer anyone in this room who has ever waited until they get home to write a long email or to fill out an application or do anything more than fire off you know it tweets knows what I'm talking about that it's not the same thing if you can only use a mobile device we know that yeah do you know what happened to them did they because they don't have a credit history maybe they can't get new service or are they aware of the ability to get free or subsidized service it and are they able to access I'm going to address that in two slides time I'll be able to i'll be able to speak to that but i wanted to show you we asked parents a set of questions about things that they do online again these categories that we asked about where things that came out of our interviews so you can see that there are distinctive differences amongst parents that are mobile only which is the green versus those that have accessed through a laptop or desktop right that there's a twelve percent difference in using the internet to get news there's a twenty-five percent difference in using it for online banking and bill paying there's a thirty percent difference in using it to shop which might seem like a silly thing but if you think about how much money you've saved by shopping online for low-income families this is not an insignificant disadvantage being able to comparison shop online versus in your local community for anyone who is studying how people engage technology in underserved and inner-city communities having to go to the local bodega to buy things instead of being able to buy them online could be a markup of anywhere from 100 to 300 percent so this is not an insignificant finding applying for jobs and services they qualify for including poverty alleviation programs the people who need those the most right because the people who are mobile only were disproportionately lower income within our sample disproportionately immigrants disproportionately parents with less education they're less likely to be applying for jobs and services online we asked them about what their kids do in with the technology in response to your question we asked them about a range of things that their kids do and different activities or kids do online but I wanted to highlight two of them for kids who are growing up in homes where they only have just through a mobile device whether it's their own or parents there's a twenty percent difference in whether or not they use it everyday which we know is one of the things that allows kids to develop skills and confidence is having regular access to the technology but they're also almost twenty percent less likely to be looking up things that they are interested in anyone in this room who's ever looked at or being concerned about interest driven learning this is a real problem right because the inability of or the constraints that are disproportionately put on certain kids even in comparison to other lower income kids when it comes to being able to drive their own curiosities and seek out more information about that not in an environment that's being led by a teacher or another adult but that their own curiosities are driving them to seek information if something we should all be concerned about because a love of learning is rooted in the experiences of being able to follow your own interests down a rabbit hole if you so choose and these kids are doing it less even than other low-income kids when it comes to being able to do that kind of thing online so I wanted to give you just a little bit of a sense of some of the challenges of being under connected from the interviews as well so what we found was that you know parents and kids talked at length about creative strategies and sacrifices they were making in order to be able to afford internet connectivity and to be able to afford to have devices in the home for their kids this involved foregoing things for themselves extending out of much needed car repair waiting for a tax return consolidating Christmas and birthday gifts into a single gift that was a tablet or computer for the whole family to share but they were making these sacrifices because I'd absolutely bought into the idea that this is something their children needed to master in order to be successful in their current environments but also for their future educational opportunities they used what they had to the extent that they were able to do so but there were also realities the parents made a lot of tough choices I'm going to talk in just a minute about how much they were actually you using subsidized broadband programs but this is a one quote that gives you an example of the kinds of realities that parents are facing and any digital equity program that is aimed at lower income families that doesn't allow for forgiveness of debt with that company it's a program that doesn't work for a lot of families because when families are making decisions between keeping the lights on and keeping the internet something is going to go and making it impossible for them to sign up for a subsidized program if they have dead effectively means that you're disqualifying a considerable number of families you can see that this is a this is one of a number of a very large number of parents who talked about the kinds of difficulties that they have in being able to pay for it but that they're really trying to prioritize paying for the internet and many of them are paying much more than the 995 a month so that's the next thing I want to talk about is you know so far families are largely connected but many are under connected in comparison to how connected they would like to be but very few of them are benefitting from programs that are designed for low-income families like connect to compete what we found in the survey is that for parents who would financially qualify because if you're the threshold for qualifying for most of the programs including connect to compete is being below the one hundred and eighty-five percent of the federal poverty line amongst parents who qualify financially for these programs six percent of them had ever used them and a quarter had disconnected their service since they've started using it and that looked very much like the interviews consistent with the survey finding we found amongst 170 families who were randomly selected from lists of students within those schools and then we called to see if they qualified in terms of being of Mexican heritage and ensuring that their kids are on free or reduced-cost lunch so we did reference representative interviews with 170 families in three school districts right 37 had ever signed up for to compete even though it was in all three districts and they all qualified for it and of the families that of those 37 only eight were going online for the first time so the program is ostensibly designed for families getting online for the first time but most low-income families are already online they might not be as connected as they want to be they might be paying too much money for it but a much larger number than the program designers could have anticipated are already online in some way or shape you know the program was a mismatch for family needs and it showed that service providers had different perceptions of families they were perceiving them as they have knocked on the wrong side of the digital divide and so they were offering a program that didn't reflect the realities of what families had in their homes and what kinds of connectivity they wanted the up and download speeds were very slow sometimes as low as three or four megabits which means you couldn't stream video it's a modem with a single ethernet cord if your mobile only that's not going to serve your needs if you have multiple devices it's not going to serve your needs and so for a lot of families they said that they had found out about the program and they desist that it was not offering them the same internet that they were paying forty or fifty dollars a month for it didn't fit the family's needs and therefore they couldn't use it most service providers as I've already insinuated had disqualification if you had death with the company some of them had documentation requirements which either scared off potential users or disqualified them outright and for a number of the companies if you currently have an account with them you have to disconnect for either three months or six months depending on the company in order to qualify for the 995 a month which is would be funny if it was funny that you have to disconnect in order to connect and most families said our connectivity is too important to us for us to be disconnected for three or six months so the offer doesn't apply so the program it really wasn't meeting people's needs as as you can see here yeah response to these outrageous facts and the regulatory response if any well now I've had some interesting public and private conversations with some of these companies we can talk about this when it's not live streaming I'm happy to have that conversation but there has been some response and some movement to start offering routers as part of the programs the changes to the Lifeline program which we can perhaps talk about in more detail in the QA but this was a big deal right lifeline should I explain yes ok so the Lifeline program through the federal communications commission was set up in order to provide access to telephone service for the lowest income people in America who couldn't afford it you know a couple of decades ago as with the argument that you know these were the people who most needed a lifeline right that if not you had an emergency in your home you needed to be able to call out and if there was an emergency in your community to disadvantage those people that they couldn't find out about that threat was something that we couldn't countenance as a country over time that's been expanded as the technology's changed to include subsidies for cell phones to a limited degree and in the last couple of months the FCC has been deliberating Emmy is eminently more qualified to have this conversation than i am but they've been debating whether or not to make subsidies available for broadband and in the past month they've announced that they're going to do that what's fantastic about what they have agreed to do is that they've for the first time set a national floor on subsidized broadband programs that it has to be no less than 10 megabits up and download speeds which is much higher than most of these programs have been offering previously and even more importantly they're reserving the right to increase that floor as the technology changes which allows the program to actually evolved along with the technology which was fantastic but it's also the first time that we've had something that will be offered nationally it's not it's not enough but it's a great start right and it's an indication that these conversations are moving forward that combined with the Kinect home initiative that HUD has been working on to connect residents in public housing right there's some movements towards really systematizing access to broadband as people are realizing and recognizing that you can't address social inequality without addressing how digital inequality plays into that so I think that public-private partnerships have potential that has not been realized in this particular iteration of the program but there's a lot of good work that's happening to move forward on a number of fronts to make the program's better than they have been yeah in it and i'll be more anonymous doing a lot of the material that comes over the internet is has its own portable messages underneath and i'm wondering whether these programs are politically neutral or they're providing some subliminal message gets destructive and in their direction rather than direction the people are receiving them that hasn't been my experience I think that for the most part the executives that are crafting these programs may have inaccurate perceptions of who it is that they're serving with these programs but there is actually a desire to be part of a solution however imperfectly they might be in the execution um I think what you're proposing sounds frightening I hope that's not playing and I have no evidence to suggest that it is and there might be people in this room that can shed more light on the question then I can at least from the data that I have but I haven't had a conversation with anybody they might be resistant to accepting this evidence as something they need to make changes about but I haven't ever encountered anybody saying anything that I would think is nefarious or underhanded in the way that you're asking so you know this is this is one mom but it reflects the experiences of so many parents with regards to this program that effectively she realized she was paying ten dollars a month to not use it had disconnected and started paying fifty dollars a month so these programs as they stand are not meeting the needs of most families and it's a missed opportunity to actually have impact in the digital equity space the last thing that I wanted to talk about is technology and family learning so most of the families are connected they may not be as connected as they want to be they're not benefiting overall from programs designed for subsidized access to the Internet and two related technologies but they are making absolutely the most of what they have in terms of engaging and learning with each other and I think that this is a very important piece for a couple of reasons number one these are families that are too often defined by their deficits rather than their strengths even referring to them as lower income or low-income families defines them by deficit in income they're often defined by deficits and education in language proficiency and on and on and on and if we only focus on their deficits we miss we really risk missing the things that make them strong and recognizing those strengths as a point of entry to make families partners in the kinds of changes they want to see for themselves in their communities to me as a person but also as an empirical researcher the evidence demands that they be considered as partners because any effort to make sustainable change is not going to work without them and so I wanted to talk a little bit about the kinds of learning that parents and children and siblings are doing with each other around the technology once they've made decisions to adopt it and something that I'm working on is a set of articles around the idea that parents and children are digital learning are working more and more as digital learning teams and it's a term that comes from one of our interviewed parents and I like the term teams because it emphasizes that all players matter and that the results of the efforts are shared rather than presuming that parents should be leading the way when it comes to technology and that something is rotten if children are leading the way or that it's something we need to panic about and what we found in our interviews is that parents and children are scaffolding each other's learning they're bringing different skills to the table and they're exchanging expert and learner roles and dynamic ways that are important for us to think about I brought a few copies of some of the reports they're also on our website but one of the families that we profiled in this report which is six case studies of 170 families is Veronica and Theresa who were one of the families we interviewed actually I conducted this interview in our Arizona study site and so you can read more about this but I wanted to tell you just a little bit Theresa is an immigrant from Mexico who doesn't speak proficient English she has four daughters and she's a single mom and so she engages the help of her daughters in a variety of ways in order to engage with technology and the reason that I've started thinking that this is digital learning teams is because the families themselves recognize with what they're doing with each other is learning it's a self-defined term not one that I'm placing on them which for me is an important thing so one of the things that she told us in the interview and in the time that we spent in our home is that when she can't find the website her daughter's will often take the computer from her to start doing it for themselves and she has to stop them and say teach me right teach me how to find it myself because they're very quick to do it for her she wants to learn how to fish right with an astronaut the pH right oh sorry man I love that that's a joke I could just make him with room and it works so she's asking them to teach her how to do it and may help her to acquire new skills her daughter who I interviewed talked about how her mom even though she's not fully confident with the technology and even though she's doing homework in English her mom will often come and sit right next to her on the couch while she's doing her homework and because she's right there she'll use her mom as a resource for her homework whenever she needs some help she'll ask her mom she'll help me and she learns a little more so they are recognizing these as back and forth exchanges in a way that is important right but they're not only recognizing this as learning but they're valuing those experiences it's something that requires a deeper look I want to show you also something from our survey data that we are just about to submit to to a journal for review one of the things that we did in the survey was we first asked parents whether or not they've ever helped their kids learn how to use a device or to get online and we asked them if their children have ever helped them to do this same thing and what we found was that seventy-seven percent of parents have helped their kids across the sample so cross all education ranges across racial and ethnic origins across language groups three-quarters of parents have helped their kids on this sort of universal question and more than half say that their kids have helped them right which is a high number because that's actually for every parent that we surveyed if we look just at older kids like 10 to 13 that proportion would be higher some of the parents we were asking about a six or seven year old right but fifty-three percent of how to kid help them and eighty-one percent say that their kids if they've more than one kid between age of six and 13 eighty-one percent of their kids have helped each other learn how to use technology right so those are high numbers then if they said that you know they help their kids or the kids help them we ask them specific questions and again these particular activities where things that came out of the interviews so when it comes to learning how devices work you know the most basic question which is in the third column there fixing things that go wrong with devices finding and translating if they spoke a language other than English in the home and downloading apps software music and movies which is something that seems to still scare parents more than other activities we ask them those questions what this table shows you is the differential in how much kids broker those connections for parents versus how much parents are guiding kids right so all this all the cells that are in white that's the percentage more help that parents are providing kids than the reverse right so for college graduate parents in this in the survey they're providing twenty-six percent they're providing health on fixing things that go wrong twenty-six percent more often than their kids are helping them fix things if that makes sense right these are the differentials in the amount of health on each of these activities and so what we found is that there's clusters within the survey we found that the two demographic variables have made the most difference in terms of how much help is flowing between parents and kids are what we're calling race and ethnic origins because we're dividing into white black spanish speaking hispanic and english-speaking hispanic as the four groups right so it's both language and race and ethnicity and parental education income didn't make a significant difference but that might be because we're only looking at parents who are in the bottom half of the income spectrum right there might not be enough variability but we found that there are three groups where across the board parents are helping more but it varies across activities and it varies across those groups how much more help they're providing their kids then their kids are providing to them right college graduate parents not surprisingly are providing more help to kids more guidance to their children across the board than any other group non-hispanic whites also fall into that category those who have graduated high school or have attended some college classes also provide their kids more help but you can see in terms of downloading that you're basically at an even exchange the proportion no difference is much lower for that group for English dominance Hispanics and for african-americans it's more of a back and forth right there are some activities that parents are guiding their kids with technology more and others where their children are brokering their connections more and then we have two groups those who do not have a high school diploma and Spanish dominant Hispanics where their kids are providing them more assistance with technology across the board than the reverse right so one of the things that this survey gives us as a set of you know evidentiary data points that we haven't had before is that this is the first time that there's been a nationally representative survey of low-income parents on their own terms right that income is not simply a variable but that you're actually looking at the challenges of lower-income families as the topic itself right so not comparing a crossing income spectrum looking specifically at these families which we think is major gap in what we know and what we can do it's also the first time we've been able to differentiate Hispanics by native born and immigrant because if you look at the surveys of of parents or of low-income individuals Hispanics are often not differentiated by language or Nativity because they don't because the sample size of Hispanics isn't large enough to make that possible so what we found is that Hispanics don't look as different as they have on prior surveys where whites and blacks in the same income category looked like each other and Hispanics look different when you differentiate by language or by emigration it's immigrant Hispanics that look different us-born Hispanics look like african-americans on almost every measure we looked at they look very much more like their African American counterparts and so it means that immigrants Hispanics and parents who have less than a college education I'd less than a high school diploma excuse me are the two groups that are highest need not necessarily something we didn't know but it provides more evidence for targeting our efforts at these highest need groups yeah yeah ABS your surveys looked into situations where there's potentially sensitive information medical financial accessing public services where obviously the kids may have much more facility with dealing with it especially medical yeah from personal experience I will need to pay you twenty dollars after this it's ends for asking that question because you've just stepped into my my primary sphere of research so some of the people in this room know that the work that preceded this for about ten years I've looked at children of immigrants when they're the primary English speakers in their homes and what it means to be the intermediary between or the broker between your family and an english-speaking environment I've looked at what it means to go into a doctor's office and speak for your family what it means to be the intermediary in school social services I'm finishing up a project looking at what that looks like in the court system but I in a subset that I wasn't going to talk much about today looked at how kids brokered online information for their parents that is potentially sensitive because the online space offers both opportunities and constraints that are different from those face-to-face interactions but more and more kids are taking the technology into those interactions so they're translating for a moment the doctor but they're checking that they've got the right word by using the mobile device right so it's not really all completely separate those situations are fraught whether the technologies involved or it isn't in many families from the family that I've studied and I've wrote a book called kids in the middle about this topic but for families where they're sensitive information how that gets negotiated depends on a number of things one is the gender of the parent and child in that interaction when it's a girl brokering for her mom those conversations are much less fraught then translating for dad especially if it's a girl translating for dead right there's a there's a gendered aspect to that relationship around sensitive information that's important the age of the child makes a difference obviously who the other person is and that interaction makes it different how is the doctor responding to the interaction that's happening how are they supporting or not supporting what that kid is doing when it comes to doing that kinds of negotiation with information that's online one of the benefits and kids have said this in words that are far better than I can paraphrase it right now it's sort of like no one knows your dog online it's like well they don't judge me if I'm asking questions through an online portal for my parents they don't know how old I am and so they don't treat me like a kid and they don't freak out but they have to talk about a gynecological exam to a kid and some kids find that very freeing that they could be they could be the mother right they could be an adult the person on the other side of that helpline conversation that they're having online the chaff that they're having doesn't know but brokering information online also has constraints for kids right we've already talked about that these are the kids who are the least likely to be online on a daily basis or to have as much access to the technology as they want to have they don't have the same digital skill set that would be optimal for dealing with these kinds of challenges so there's things they don't know how to do and you're layering that on top of having to negotiate two languages and technical information in two languages and at least two sets of cultural norms right because they've got to be culturally appropriate with the parent they're translating the English but that English may be infused with a culture related to medicine right which is would be a task for any one of 25 it's a hell of a task of your 13 and it might be harder because no one knows that their 13-year old having this conversation might be harder to pull support for those conversations so a lot of kids find brokering tip online more difficult than brokering other types of technology that are static like a newspaper or stuff that comes in the mail but less emotionally wrenching than doing it for example in an emergency room or in the doctor's office follow up to that on the other side of it if let's say a medical entity found out that this was happening that he third party was an intermediary would HIPAA rules that make them go ballistic yes yes I mean you know when I was doing my dissertation research which became that book I spent a year and a half in a clinic in South Los Angeles as one of the sites were always both following families in but also watching what happens in that facility health care is the worst place for kids to have to do this because in most places there were rules about family members translating in health care settings but those places are not necessarily providing interpreters or appropriate support for families so they bring their best resource and their best resources off their kids and it's even harder to do that kind of work when you're doing it in an environment that is determined to make it impossible for that to be done by children or family members it made the environment even more hostile as a place to go in and negotiate and it made their parents more tentative in those interactions and they would have been in others which is something I'm seeing again looking at kids doing this in court because they obviously are not doing it in the court proceedings but if they're brokering for mom and her lawyer in the hallway before the interaction that's not supposed to be happening either and it's not the kids fault but that's a violation of the rules they're doing it because they're the best thing available and i think you know kind of decriminalizing that and being able to look at this from a value neutral perspective of what free labor kids are offering in circumstances where they have to fill in the void we do better by looking at what strengths that creates and supporting kids or replacing them with supports that actually support parents in the ways that their kids are doing it whether it's not just language but also emotional support in a sense that their advocate is invested in them I think it's a critically important part of getting immigrant families meaningfully connected to American social institutions it's taking that seriously thank you so much for that question and for allowing me to go on clearly a tangent that matters a great deal to me so the last point that I want to bring up to you because I think it's fascinating is that once we took this and looked at you know sort of the intensity of guidance that parents are providing the intensity of brokering of technology the children are doing which you can see is more and less intensive in different families here once we calculated that we looked at how that affected what siblings are doing with each other like is the intergenerational dynamic setting a tone for what kids and parents do or if parents are less able to help kids do they help each other more ease they're compensating mechanism in these families that the kids are trying to compensate for parents not being able to help with these things we asked we asked parents who had more than one kid between 6 and 13 to tell us how often their children helped each other to go online to learn something new how often they're using video and television to learn together so all these questions were framed explicitly as learning but they could define what that meant to do homework together arts and science projects together and to read together or to help each other learn to read depending on the ages of the kids and what we found was that in homes where parents are guiding technology use more intensively those are the homes where kids are helping each other more with homework with art and science projects and with reading together the three kinds of home based learning that schools recognized as actively supporting learning in school right those are the forms of learning that they validate as things that people can do at home to support what happens in school when kids drive tech brokering those kids kids and those families are significantly more likely to be doing tech related activities together now homework science and art projects and reading could involve technology they often do right you can be reading an e-book you're going online to do stuff for homework you're going online to complete a project they don't have to be tech related but they could be those pair with the families that at least amongst their peers are advantaged by higher parental education and often higher income so even amongst low-income families those families are more able to hew to the line of what formal educators validate as the kinds of learning at home that matter and where kids are driving technology learning in the home right which is happening amongst those who have less than a high school diploma and Spanish dominant families those are homes where kids are doing more of the kinds of activities around learning with technology that are seen as either informal or often as wastes of time by teachers that could be used more constructively so for me it's someone who's very interested in how kids broker in this more general sense that we just talked about I wonder if some people this makes me wonder if some people's findings that brokering for your family adversely affects your development and your performance in school if that might not be in part because of what schools are telling them they value in terms of forms of learning and how narrow those definitions are right and so for me that's an exciting potential area to think about in terms of how to make schools and formal education more responsive to the strengths and resources within families so those are the things I wanted to talk to you about today if you're interested in learning more about the project or any of the reports that we've done out of this project the website for the project is digital equity for learning org the first three here are individual reports for the three study sites where we did interviews so the top one is a California study site the teal the purple is Denver Arizona's in orange the case studies of six of those families the blue one is there and then the report from the survey and I've got a few copies here if anyone wants to pick up the hard copy or likes to have that this is the opportunity for all with a question mark is the survey report and then there's a policy brief in the yellow and green so looking forward to more questions and conversation and I just before we do that that's my contact info that's my team of researchers and again it's funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and benefited very much from partnership with the Joan Ganz Cooney center at Sesame Workshop where I'm a senior research scientist as well so thank you very very much hi thank you for this fascinating talk I'm a member of the Cambridge broadband task force and where I hope headed towards a municipal broadband system here in Cambridge and Cambridge has you know is a ridiculously wealthy city with a digital equity problem so we have an opportunity you know to design something different for digital access I mean this is a good prescription of what not to do but what what would you do if to actually provide access to everybody man I'm good I can be clean for a day or benevolent dictator I do a few I would do a few things the first thing is that I would try to organize focus groups perhaps using the schools or other community organizations as partnerships bring some families in feed them definitely feed them providing childcare if necessary but talk to families and ask them the kinds of questions we ask them about what they have and why it doesn't work for them but instead of presuming which you wouldn't that they're getting online for the first time what's their past experience been what have their challenges of connectivity been in the past what would they design that would work for them are they primarily using a mobile device that connects only in public spaces have they worked out a deal with a neighbor to share a router and they each pay half which we saw in a lot of families where people were creative what are they doing that they would prefer to be doing differently and use that as part of the architecture for the plan that would already put you about four miles ahead of most programs no matter how well-intentioned if you haven't talked to the people that will benefit from it to see what they need your done before you start and a lot of good intention and a lot of money goes into things that don't work that's the first thing i think that the access is crucial but so are relationships to human beings that can help provides support as people are learning so providing regular support and training opportunities for for parents and kids either together or separately that allows them to increase their confidence and knowledge troubleshoot problems they're having is at least as critical as the you know the connections in technology terms right is that the relationships matter a great deal and using the sites that people already trust and go to as the places to host those things matters so if the schools have good relationships with those families work with your best administrators in those if the churches are the places where people go and spend time and see as refuge work with the churches if it's community organizations and resources for specific you know ethnic or immigrant groups that provide services and language train those people to be the people who train the families that's I'll get off my soapbox but that's what I would do thank you thank you hi thank you so much thank you I wanted to follow up on your last comment about the narrowness of what's taught in schools and to relate it to technology because technology is now a core infrastructure of our society and if you don't have access to it you're not just missing out on the tools for everything else you're actually missing out on the kind of insights of why things work like they do so I you know I really want to support that and you just ask if you have any other suggestions well I don't think necessarily that the schools are narrowing what they're teaching but what they're defining as learning right what counts is learning is still a very traditional definition and you know there's a lot of challenges with integrating technology into formal learning in schools that we haven't addressed quite yet because the model is generally let's get the technology and let's then figure out what we'll do with it instead of let's design a learning space or a program that will really help kids to do XY and Z and then bring in the technology that lets us use that program right the design seems to come after the technology have entered the schools and a lot of the time very well-meaning programs to bring technology into the schools they haven't done any kind of assessment of where they're starting from so it's impossible to know whether or not they've moved the needle and so you know if you don't have an idea of what the baseline needs are in a school and what gaps there are then you've introduced a new stimulus into the classroom but you have no idea whether or not it's made any difference that's you know I'm not an evaluation researcher and I'm not an experimental design person but pre and post-test for something you're introducing seems very important but it's often in the exuberance of bringing new tech in that pretest is the part that gets left out so we've got there's a lot of room to improve but I think that's part of what makes all of this exciting as the technology landscapes change so quickly what about those experiences and the relationships that matter to kids and families remains consistent and universal and what might we be able to effect change by engaging technology in ways that enhance those relationships but don't try to replace them oh my big dog actually liked it thank you and my question was I think where you just hinted at something and left it was about mobile devices versus laptops and you know you made a case for why broadband access is important and needs to be looked at which I completely agree with and in fact in you know a lot of developing countries the argument is that let's just give them basic access and then they can figure it out after that and so I was wondering if you found different behaviors amongst those who have more access or dominant access through mobile phones versus laptops in you know terms of like exploratory behavior if you had a laptop at your disposal and internet you'd be probably more likely i don't know to actually do a bunch of google searches with no image it end but if you are just using mobile device which is more communicative in nature right so I was wondering if you had any insights on that right so um this slide that I had back here top you know kind of addresses that a little bit which is you know that people are using the mobile devices for a narrower set of tasks you know part of what you're pointing to is you know if you give people access and you give it to them on a device that's capable of a much broader range of activities will they use it more broadly you know studies you know long before mine and in greater numbers have shown that you know the more points of access the more types of devices people have the more intensively they engage and use them because they use them for different tasks but one of the issues that your question made me think about that we haven't talked about that's a whole other area of digital equity issue that is very important and very current is if you're giving people access you know whether it's in a developing country are here are you giving them the whole internet or are you filtering it it was a very nice piece in the Atlantic in the last couple of weeks about how internet filtering hurts kids and how it hurts the lowest income kids the most because there are all kinds of programs through schools and school issued devices that filter out content that is inappropriate for kids right obviously some of that is reasonable but the reach seems to be too large you know we interviewed families in two of the three districts that had filters on devices that went home with kids they couldn't access YouTube which is a major learning platform for kids now obviously there are things on YouTube but maybe kids shouldn't be looking after that the problem is when the platforms have multiple purposes it's very hard to make Universal decision for the entire platform because families would get on a different device to use YouTube to extend learning beyond the homework Facebook usually is filtered out the majority of immigrant families in our interview pool used Facebook as a way to stay connected with family back in Mexico and so kids are actually using it as a way to maintain not just connection to family but to practice spanish it's very hard to navigate what filters they're coders should be and which ones there shouldn't be but if what we give low-income kids through digital equity programs is a filtered version of the internet then that's not equity that's something else and we need to we need to own up to that if those are conversations happening in Silicon Valley internet.org right even with the best of intentions it's not the same internet you know in the developing world these issues are are certainly present my cousin is working for the Ministry of Education in Addis Ababa at the moment and she read this report she said what you're describing is under connected in America is like the top of the range in Ethiopia like I'd love to be as under connected as these as these families are but it's relative to what you're missing right by what under connected means is relative to how connected the most privileged are in whatever space you're in right thank you yeah oh sorry i'll stop Cheryl um yeah so a methodological question about an interview and the ways that people access their own understanding of their technology use and curious if something was learned for if people were also demonstrating to you through their mobile devices how they searched you did some kind of systematic I use your experience your view but I morph in the future for something people not just got just a language barrier but kind of an articulation barrier and kind of showing you how they access as a prompt for greater awareness of their own practice we did that to the best of our abilities within you know conducting an interview the children's interviews if we were at home they walked us through the house and we mapped out on a worksheet where everything in the home was digital non digital mobile non-mobile we mapped out the whole house and if we were at school we'd have them start with this was more than half interview with the kid was let's start at the front door and they would narrate to us where everything in the house was now obviously they're going to forget certain things but they're recalls much better in that kind of concrete activity and it put them immediately in the position of being the experts and then we'd have them pick the three rooms in the house they spent the most time in usually their room their parents room in the living room which one of these which media that you've told us are in this room what's most important to you why who do you think owns it who uses it most in what language for what kinds of activities what rules are associated with it and that elicited the kinds of things you would never get in a standard interview one of my favorites was the kid that you know he was he's seven he told us that the tablet was on the coffee table or the top of the cabinet in the living room I said well what's the difference and he said well when I'm bad it's on top of the cabinet right which tells you something that the parent would either not remember or choose not to tell us and I said both where is it most of the time on top of the cabinet right so how much time is this kid really spending with that technology and how is it being used as a carrot for good behavior is it is illustrative right you can't get out of an interview what you would get out of out of an extended home visit but that wasn't what we were trying to do a study that I've done with Carmen Gonzalez and Jason yep has been sitting with kids and having them take us through like the last task they went online for their parent to do and narrate us through what they did and where they hit a roadblock and so on so actually engaging in a narrative study of the search process and where the constraining and enabling factors and what strategies are using and having them guide us so it's a kind of subset of the same study but it's a you know we do a deeper dive into that particular thing and obviously we can talk about that in more detail but thank you very much for the question that's a good one yes sir hi have you had a chance in this to observe possibly any technological or pricing based redlining in these communities in terms of either the service is offered or in terms of the services available at any price or you know things that even seem even things like bundling some of these findings might pick internet but not TV and then it's actually more expensive there were a lot of families who were signed up for bundles that they didn't need but that's true everywhere you know they're there were some parents who talked about you know calling the company to find out about connect to compete and being up sold to something more expensive and connect to compete because the person on the phone would say but you can't get the football from Mexico at that speed you're going to need something higher right that there is obviously using sales tactics that were designed for this audience but I don't know if that's you know that's anecdotal evidence I don't know if that's a particularly enterprising service representative or if that's something that was formally advised I haven't seen evidence of that although I do you know obviously it's new it's a very important issue related to understanding how these programs should or could roll out definitely right I want to thank Ricki for this year really we may go in a discussion and thank all of you and thank thank you very very much for having me
