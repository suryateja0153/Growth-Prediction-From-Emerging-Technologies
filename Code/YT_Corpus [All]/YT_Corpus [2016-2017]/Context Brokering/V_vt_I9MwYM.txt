 hello and welcome to this video series today we're talking about securing your Amazon AWS environment leveraging Centrify Active Directory in any other technologies and fresh fruits focusing on securing the Amazon root account for those who don't know what the Amazon root account is that account that is able to you know manage billing billing basically it's kind of like the most secure account you have has all the power to create users roles and all that stuff and additional keys so what happens in organizations is that this account is typically shared or you know maybe put somewhere behind lock and key only certain people should have access to it but the key here is to eliminate sharing that account and adding additional control so my proposal is this and since this is a security oriented video basically a eliminate the sharing of those credentials protecting the password by knoweth not exposing it to any users if needed limit access only to that account via the corporate network that way you know that the person that is going to access that account is doing it from inside your premises the recommendation of adding a multi-factor authentication and not necessarily just with what you know an oath OTP capability provided by Amazon but being able to add additional factors like you know Centrify Authenticator or phone factor SMS email or even lis secure security question and also being able to control on-demand access to that account perhaps somebody does need access to this account for a certain amount of time but then after they're done with that they need to be able to you know lose access and and they never knew the password right so this is very different from using I am roles and I'm gonna have another series of videos that I is going to cover that so what are the tools that you have available to you Centrify well you have Active Directory of course and one of the benefits is that Centrify can actually use not only Active Directory as a source of identity but also a an LDAP directory in addition it can use a Google directory as well if you're using Google as your directory it can leverage social logins in in in in scenarios in which you don't want to maintain user identities and it can also be the service provider in a federated in a federated scenario perhaps you have a a DFS or any other identity as a service providers and you want to use this as the application so a lot of flexibility around this I'm going to focus on on ad and samo and using centralized tools but the key here is being able to secure first the root account and then move to the other use cases so I'm hoping that this series actually helps
