 thanks case and thank you Patrick for posing those good questions and for inviting me I learned a lot from trying to prepare to answer your questions not all of them but you know some of them so I wanted to mention this is an image Illustrated drawn by Hillary Cobb Sasson whose saskia sassen the son was an artist and a filmmaker and it's to illustrate a story that Saskia Sassen wrote a parable about a monster that lives on liquid gold that takes over cities that burro is in two cities and then shows up with a kind of exoskeleton throughout the city and I thought it was an act image and an act story you might want to look up for what we're talking about today and of course it's not happening in every city but it's important to recognize the dynamics of this and what it means for different types of cities I also thought it would be interesting since Saskia Sassen is sort of the inheritor of the Rosa Luxemburg / you know Karl Marx mantel of theory about capitalism and crisis to just point out that there is always a boom and there is a bust in capitalist systems and what we're seeing right now as a boom could someday be a bust I think Toure devide in Caracas has an example of big structures built that later bust but this dynamic of capital accumulating getting disconnected from production and then either being devalued or removed from those systems is likely to happen in these cities that are currently receiving a lot of global capital at some point so what I'm gonna recommend my basic argument today and I see myself as an activist as much as an academic so I'm talking to the heads of public agencies and to lots of environmental groups and NGOs around the Bay Area is that we have to understand and work with the way that cities have been ranked in two tiers now I don't mean accept it I mean the subvert it but we have to recognize this tearing this ranking has occurred and that it's affecting the topology not not the typology but the connectedness of capital flows around the world this kind of report from the Qatar Financial Center shows us how the financial community ranks cities this is the ranking of global financial centers and you can dig into it it is this very funny visual language of golf at the same time it's telling us about all these different cities and why you might invest in one or the others to me hilariously disconnected but I'm sure not to the other readers of this particular report so London is number one in 2015 recently replaced New York San Francisco was number nine I think Hoover's number 18 you can see the tears right away in the ranking and it goes down to a hundred and those are the cities that they actually bothered to pay attention to within North America New York is well above all the other cities that are ranked in terms of capital flow and invest good places for capital to be parked and you can see the tearing in this graph very quickly the numbers on the vertical axis are the score is in an index that this Qatar Financial Center uses which is partly a kind of crowd-sourced index among people in the finance world and partly based on metrics metrics like infrastructure infrastructure metrics I've just highlighted with the green box the ones that I think are so important you can see there a small proportion of the list but being able to demonstrate environmental performance and be competitive and global sustainability are at least two of the variables that these organizations are looking at and then other groups like McKinsey annually inform us about the flows of capital and how they're changing around the world and what we see occurring of course is increases in the amount of capital flowing on a global basis although some relationships begin to not be as significant for example the u.s. Western Europe I think they really mean North America and Western Europe that relationship seems to be a little smaller in larger global context of some new relationships between for example China and Latin America so we see changes happening in these topologies and we also see a kind of League of Cities that was my first thought after reading Saskia Sassen and looking at these kinds of analytical diagrams was that there is a group of cities that are at play in this and what if we as the citizens of those cities would begin to talk about how we could ally ourselves and figure out how to take advantage of the flow of capital and not be subjected to it as a passive receiver and I thought of the history of the Hansa merchants who of course traveled around the the Baltic and the North Sea area exchanging goods they actually the the cities that participated in that particular league had their own armies they would defend their trade routes with those local armies and they had their own kind of Parliament and a diet called then and that was another interesting thing to find out that there was an alliance of those cities and while I was thinking to myself oh this would be such a good idea I thought oh there RT is an alliance of cities it's the Clinton c40 alliance that we hear a lot about at least in the u.s. about how the Clinton Foundation has pulled all these cities together to try to reduce our carbon emissions and try to coordinate cities and reward excellence and provide funding and I had thought that was really what it was all about until you know the last couple of years because it does say they're trying to empower cities to connect with each other and cities seem happy to be in the Clinton c40 and then I read I actually read the website and they're focused on this thing I've highlighted or they actually they put the bold text in there that that the transformation of cities into a new economy investing in different transportation more efficient buildings waste management I like how they've added the adjective vast like we wouldn't know that 17 trillion was a big number but represents a vast 17 trillion opportunity worldwide now I always think of adaptation as a cost it never occurred to me that someone else is out there moving a lot of money around and saying adaptation is this vast opportunity so if you look a little deeper into the c40 language they use the word lucrative as an opportunity for the private sector that we're talking about a lot of capital support for projects that are about adaptation and a lot of yield I love what they bold yielding 20% I mean 200 2000 percent return I'm sorry I figure to 20 times return on that's easier to say on the 1 million invested in each project and what's really interesting is that the last part of it that I've highlighted below at the red is that they're focused on these barriers the thing that prevents us all from benefiting from this vast 17 trillion opportunity for the private sector is the difficulties of procurement and conflict of interest challenges I can't imagine why there would be any challenges produced by conflicts of interest in this situation so it's very clear that they know what the problem is and they're putting it right up front for us they're clearly not talking to us on this website they're talking to people from the private sector and then each city for example of Vancouver has a section where it's described by the Clinton c40 Alliance and there's a focus on climate performance I don't I don't find those graphs very informative I don't know about you maybe over time they're gonna show us trends and become very informative but here's what I think is informative oh sorry let me go back one they're showing us all these little facts about Vancouver as if it's a tourism website as if you'd need to know how much rainfall there is to be able understand co2 emissions and then they have a little thing up here contact c40 about Vancouver so they're basically advertising this city as something you can invest in look at all these fantastic things about the city and contact us so we can be your broker and that's what c40 really is is brokering private financial investments in cities it's one of the services that have developed in a sense around all of this global capital flows and what they focus on is the executive power of the mayor not the level of citizen participation not social equity but the power of the mayor because if you're in the private sector and you want to get something done you need an executive who will get that done for you and if it's a city with a weak mayor you don't have a partner for the city with a strong mayor ideally somewhat dictatorial you would have a great partner and then there's always our suspicions about where the money comes from for the Clinton Foundation and how it's related to other things going on around the world not to get paranoid but there it is who else is a broker this organization City age is a broker they're traveling around the world you may know some of the founders I think one of them was from Europe from here in Vancouver I was involved in government and now he and a partner have founded this private company a for-profit company to help us well us is the wrong word let's see what they help who they're helping 4,500 decision-makers thought leaders and investors we're building our economy and society okay now I get it we're talking about having the people who run these companies and make these investment decisions actually build our society okay let's just make it super clear and when they come here to Vancouver I hope you'll all try to go and find out who these thought leaders are they're building our society sidewalk labs I just was at a kind of chilling presentation by Dan Doctoroff who's the CEO of Google's sidewalk labs and they are of course trying to figure out well what they say about themselves is that they are building products addressing big urban problems it's a fascinating situation that Google has decided to invest in addressing big urban problems by turning cities into R&D labs and from autonomous vehicles to building code side rock labs is thinking about problems solutions that could shape cities for centuries so this is not a flash in the pan we're talking here about restructuring cities for a very long time and if you dig somewhat into it here is the team that leads sidewalk labs and Dan Doctoroff is of course the CEO you might not recognize his name but he was Bloomberg's developments are in New York during the period of time when huge development projects and flows of global capital came in to New York and he's he's a character that I wouldn't necessarily describe as evil but he is about as close as I can imagine coming to evil and still you know not being and well people people don't go to jail so I don't even mention in prison this is the car the Lexus version of the Google car that's the driverless car that's driving around the Bay Area now in San Francisco area and when I when Doctoroff told us about what it is that they're doing at sidewalk labs he made it very clear that they're not an R&D company really they're a media company what is a media company a media company is kind of a PR firm a media company tries to persuade you about what's happening in the world and what you should think about it and how you should feel about it so what they're really doing with sidewalk labs is preparing us all for Google's big money-making opportunity which is to own the franchise for particular cities driverless vehicles that's the business opportunity that automakers and Google are competing for and Google is the closest to operationalizing something like that and their vision is not that these driverless cars will be out there with us all driving because they've discovered that it's actually dangerous for both driverless and driver occupied cars to be on the street together they're actually picturing at some point that these driverless cars will completely replace human driven cars not in the distant future but in the relatively near future so they're setting us up setting up our national highway administration's to give grants to think about adapting cities to this vast investment and franchising opportunity so here was the resistance to Doctoroff in New York and I think it's instructive to see you know who was willing to take him on majora Carter took on this issue about the the challenge was to dr. offs plan to locate a new J in the South Bronx a new prison facility and she won a recycling center she's an activist to community activists who wanted a recycling center and she basically accused him of being Robert Moses of ignoring the needs of local people and his response was that she's an indie person that she needs to accept what she gets because we have to put these things somewhere so no recognition at all about social justice or environmental justice and the legacy of certain neighborhoods getting the negative uses over and over again and if that's who's running the driverless cars program I think our hopes that it might be a leveling effort for access in cities may not be true New York is one of those number two right now city receiving capital in the world got this kind of public space as an iconic public spaces of course the Highline project that coroner and others designed and this kind of public space was part of the sort of ornamental component of dr.oz projects to do real estate development the High Line is successful or was built because of all the real estate development happening right around it so it's a project that's really not a standalone it's part of a whole redevelopment of that part of New York quite a high you know top dollar redevelopment effort Flint Michigan got this so we see the tiers of cities I would say New York is obviously Tier one it's the number two city receiving capital flows in the world Flint has to be a Tier three or four and we have to figure out as designers and planners how to actually respond what should our strategies be in these different kinds of cities the cities that are basically being cut off and let go versus the cities that are receiving capital and it's not the same strategy it can't be then there's a kind of tier - I think of tier two as I would include San Francisco in this cities that are receiving the investment money as a venture capital not just as real estate but as venture capital Seattle receives a lot of venture capital money for tech startups in software for widgets for gadgets and for biotech so tech includes biological components as well as software and electronic devices and what's interesting is I just wanted to reflect on ten years ago what Seattle was like not now but ten years ago there was a woman named Nancy Mangrum who used to show up at the city council meetings dressed in a salmon costume to advocate for salmon barring streams in the city and I want to contrast this to the kind of iconic development that we see happening around the country and around the world iconic design this kind of citizen activist based sort of sweet design and these two women this could be told as a story of two pegs peg gainer and pegs - hailey started the natural drainage program that was the stormwater program for the City of Seattle they personally started it and then operated politically to make it happen doing pro bono work doing but all current they're both landscape architects but they created this program from outside the city walls by befriending lonely women engineers within the public infrastructure organization and it worked really well they did a bunch of projects that now look dated and old but what's interesting about them to me is that they were very body scale they were very much about the embodied aesthetic experience they were almost residential they were a really residential scale they used residential plants they were infrastructure idea of extending infrastructure into everybody's yard into everybody's street front and it's sweet not only is it sweet but it was performance-based it was focused on success if it performed and so when they tested the first one and it performed very well they began to build more that was the criterion not was an iconic and appealing in promotional literature but was it performing as it was designed to perform this is our project and they're under scan quickly show a big public housing project in Seattle that was redeveloped it was an interesting it's still an interesting project and it was a kind of micro topography project it was it used this planting strip as the infrastructure they dug down ten feet they filled it with engineered soil they used that in not instead of pipes completely because they did put pipes in to make sure nothing would fail but they developed a technology that could build over and over again it was art this is our R&D this is urban R&D the storm water utility spent four million dollars to test this idea here that's what I think of as urban Rd and then they identified performance they had identified performance goals and they tracked and monitored performance of how those engineered soils and micro topography interventions actually performed so I think that the irrational new normal that we see happening all around us is that we're seeing a design for iconic value instead of performance value and even in places like Seattle we're not seeing the focus on small-scale embodiment aesthetic you know what you've what you sense that you walk through a place we're seeing more of the iconic scale and we're certainly seeing that in the Bay Area too I think the strategic new normal that we all could adopt is to try to use iconic value to create performance value and I know that that's tricky and may fail but I can't stop the flow of capital all I can do is try to subvert it so I'm trying to think of ways to do that and that this is really about adaptation not resilience not sustainability this is about adaptation because the changes are going to see in coastal areas and even in interior areas of the continents over the next 50 years are gonna scare the pants off us we are going to actually change cities or we're just gonna start abandoning pieces of them and come back and recolonize them later so I work with topologies I think it's been interesting this a little bit of a theme of the return of the typology in the presentations I work with understanding adaptation designs and I've categorized them into a set of designs that are really wall based forms and a set of designs that are really landform based but both can be either dynamic or fixed and we see examples around the world of walls that are fixed walls that are dynamic are more few and far between but a simple tied gate is a dynamic wall - it doesn't have to be the the Rotterdam barrier the may flaunt barrier landforms obviously dykes and canals are fixed mounds all those structures are fixed and dynamic things would be more like the sand engine which I'll show you a couple of pictures of in a minute or wetlands which are meant to accrete and maybe a road and then accrete and accrete higher and higher over time to keep up and sea-level rise then I take that typology and I make it a four dimensional space I'm sorry I occasionally do have to talk to the science community so I'm thinking about a kind of solution space where we might be able to optimize hybrids of these different things things that have more walls more static things that have more walls more dynamic strategies for a sex from the shoreline that have more dynamic landforms or more static landforms and I feel like someone needs to lay out this solution space because in the engineering community people are rushing to solutions instead of standing back and saying wait a minute what are the range of things that we could do how could we combine them and not to vilify or deify any particular strategy but keep the floor open because this technology is changing quickly I want to show you a few cities that are doing iconic things and talk about this theme reef leav how iconic design investments might be subverted to be performance oriented design investments and that's maybe a little easier in the coastal area of work but it's been a funny focus in the last two days - on skylines a lot of people are using images of skylines which of course is the marketing of the iconic so I did that on purpose to try to emphasize that for each city but in my skylines of course you'll see water as the foreground instead of an old neighborhood which is of course the theme skyline of the event this is the Thames Barrier sitting in the Thames River that's central London is back here Canary Wharf and all that is here and the structure is really a series of towers that rotate a barrier into place from that's normally resting in the riverbed it's a very shallow River so it's relatively easy to turn a structure on a kind of cam and the design of it that was influenced by the Greater London architecture office when it existed it's been disbanded was to do the protection from corrosion by adding this stainless steel cladding over the tower and of course it wanted prize from the stainless steel people obviously but from the other side this is the photo you never see of the thames barrier from the other side you can see they did something else which to my mind is unusual the engineers that I work with would never have aligned this aperture and this aperture in a symmetrical way using a bilateral symmetry they just wouldn't have done it it's not necessary this might have been symmetrical but when you add them all up together everything has a bilateral symmetry emphasized by the crest of the cladding to me there's likely to be a reason for that every every person educated in the UK has seen something of the archaeological materials found at Sutton Hoo this is a helmet from a 7 7th century Anglo Saxon warrior that was found and cleaned up from the Sutton Hoo archaeological dig to me it has a lot of resonance with the structure of the barrier and when you see the barrier at night it's lighted like a hearth it's lighted as if you're returning from the sea to the fires of home so the language becomes a language of a kind of native warrior defending the city and that's pretty good that's a good sale they have made a good sale there with iconic design that's actually performance-based and highly monitored and will eventually be adapted it's a very popular barrier it's the most popular barrier I know of in the world you can find a lot of videos of it on YouTube people drive by in a Zodiac and record it let's look someplace else Osaka again water in the foreground used to be a reflecting pool to reflect the power and design control of big skyscrapers now kind of an urgent need to understand it and be ready it's not going to be our friend in the future in the same way so in Osaka they built the super dike they used an economic downturn in a kind of Keynesian way to invest in public infrastructure and they built this huge well widened it was already a 30-foot high dike along the river there they just widened it a lot and then put terraces on the back to be able to trap any overtopping water that came over and they extended everybody's property lines up through the new massive material which now basically can't fail it could be overtopped but it can't catastrophic we fail and it created a new plinth for iconic architecture they didn't actually build that common architecture in Osaka but they could have a super dyke could be a plinth for exactly what the flows of capital the liquid gold want to make and it can make everyone else safer people back here in these original buildings are safer because of this which suggests the potential of a kind of Robin Hood strategy this is what it looks like from the air Rotterdam the thinned engine is actually north of it's arguably it's The Hague not Rotterdam but I always approach it from Rotterdam so I'm sort of lumping it in with what's happening there it's a huge amount of sand it's 28 million cubic yards which is between three and five times larger than any sand nourishment project ever done in North America so it's a lot of sand and most of it is underwater this is the part that makes it cheap this is cheaper to do than placing sand all along the whole coast every year which is the old strategy because it's cheaper to plant more place more sand in deeper water you just dump it out of the bottom of the boat the dredge boat instead of having to spray it and rain Boeing or even more expensive push it up onto the beach with with big pipes so the idea of it is place the sand in a big lump and let the wind and the waves do the work of moving the sand up and down the coast widening the sandy shoreline and allowing the Netherlands to have a robust edge even as sea level rises this will have to be done we think or they think every 15 years maybe maybe more often there's actually been more motion than people expected in the sand but it's being monitored very very carefully and a 3d model really a 4d model of how sand moves has been augmented with these data which will then be sold to all of us is already being sold to all of us by Dutch consultants who develop bottles of sand transport and sell them all over the world and the Bay Area is using that model now and will continue to feed information into it from this prototype project so what what I like about this as an iconic design made into a performance design is that it was originally supposed to be in the shape of a tulip the original proposal was a tulip island off the coast and you can find the images of that online it's kind of funny because it would have looked like a tulip for all of a week maybe then it would have been completely reshaped like the you know a tail of a comet as water moved that sand around it was sort of a pointless tulip idea but when they shaped it into a hook instead and a spit shape and put it on the coast itself that's because they thought that would perform better and it still has iconic value although if they ever form a friends of the sand engine group that wants to preserve its original form you know that it's failed because this is supposed to teach us about the beauty of change not teach us to try to put the sand back where it was last weekend when I brought my kids out to be on the beach this is one of projects that I talk a lot about in the Bay Area this was in Nestle onda which is in the sort of metropolitan part of Rotterdam and what I liked about it other than wondering if that woman dresses that way every day I don't know it's possible that it's not staged is that it's in what could function as an expression of the water table it's in a pond that's always wet and this is not a floating house is a house on pile foundations which is in a wet area which can also function to store stormwater so this is a house in the stormwater infrastructure this is a house that allows people to see what the where the water table is and to be able to function as part of the flood management system I like that again suggesting us a Robin Hood strategy where we could actually sell houses or rent them that are in our infrastructure system and that serve to protect others and then this I don't know how real this is maybe I'll get a hand show of hands from Dutch people in the room how real is this project this is a proposal that was used as a speculative iconic proposal but what's interesting about it I mean that the basic idea was that it would be luxury Hotel luxury apartments a kind of ferris wheel like the eye of London but that this piece in here that looks like a kind of harp that that would be electric electrostatic wind energy generation a whole new version of the Dutch windmill and that this project would be something that would be funded and actually built in the water so there it is with foundations right in the harbor the old Harbor not the oldest chopper but one of the areas the harbour they're no longer used for ships so this is the kind of building we may see a lot more of in fact we'll see more of it in Hamburg in Hamburg they built an iconic building here'd saga engineer and designed the Elbe Philharmonic Hall placing this kind of confection of glass on top of an old warehouse then the Symphony Hall is in there but don't be fooled that the Symphony Hall is in the prow of this shape it is not it's in the back luxury apartments are in the prow of this hall that are essentially trophy apartments maybe somebody will occupy them but it's all part of of encouraging people in Hamburg to say we are still the people of the ship we are still the handsome urchins we can maintain a container port that is the second largest in Europe I believe still in the heart of the city that's what they've been doing but by trying to maintain a container port in the heart of the city they've created a situation where the floods from the North Sea actually are coming downhill into Hamburg and causing enormous flooding problems in the area that used to be old warehouses so what they've done is built the - city district where in these illustrations from a colleague of mine on tear struck Mon you can see there's a walkway here next to the water here's the warehouse that they built that Philharmonic Hall on and the heart the first floor of all these buildings is hardened and waterproofed there are waterproof parking garages in there which is kind of amazing here's what happens over time you can see the tide come up it's still just on the face of that seawall and then it reaches in the flood a new level beyond to flood that pedestrian walkway and what families do is they put their cars in the waterproof parking garages except for these people who must have gone to Malaga and not gotten the email and Families actually stay they don't evacuate they stay and they take the kids down to see the storm the flood how much better is that to actually look at the environment you live in and get to know the dynamics instead of having to evacuate or live behind walls much much better as a model and the new competitions and housing in that - city district will be four buildings with foundations in the water mid rise and this is the studio gang version which came in third but I think they're actually going to build this prototype as well so let me very quickly say something about San Francisco Bay and I'll stop for questions another iconic water photo we are looking at significant sea level rise with only 16 inches of sea level rise all these light blue areas would be flooded that's our entire wetland environment that we have spent we that environmentalists have spent and federal government lots and lots of money over the last 30 years to restore so all that would go down the tubes because those wetlands will collapse into mud flats as they're submerged by sea level rise and the habitats of wetlands will go away not to mention the investments and homes of something like a quarter of a million people the Googleplex is down here the highway system would be interrupted in probably 50 places it's an incredible impact to think about what would really happen if that as that does occur if we don't respond and it's already happening this is the Embarcadero in San Francisco and this is just a high tide this is not a storm this is just an astronomical high tide the high tide of the year in downtown San Francisco so we're right on the verge of very expensive real estate being flooded and important roadways at the same time capital is flowing into the San Francisco Bay Area and creating new development Treasure Island is part of the city of San Francisco and the mayor of San Francisco made it very clear to consultants working on that project that at a certain point they had to stop talking about sea level rise until he could line up all the capital and then they could talk about sea level rise once the investments were already made this is an artificial island which is now going to be home to eight to ten thousand units of housing it's all done that's permitted this is gonna happen and it's vulnerable to the first tsunami that might come from an earthquake through the bay and it's vulnerable to sea level rise it's about a meter maybe two at the highest above the bay level and again as I said it's all made land so it's going to have other issues with water logging and how it behaves in an earthquake so the question is can we can we manipulate global capital flow into housing which is where it's coming in the Bay Area and simultaneously build a new protective and biodiverse shoreline that's the challenge these wetlands that are so important to the Bay Area we've been studying and we've learned how they do reduce storm surge they do reduce wave energy so we can use them in a performative way and this is the proposal to actually irrigate the wetlands from the top with sewage effluent treated sewage effluent which has nutrients in it to put those nutrients into a brackish wetland at the top and then at the bottom to actually add silt in front of these wetlands and have the waves bring a silt up onto the wetland top which would be kind of a silt engine a little more modest in the American context smaller particles and beaches this is chrissie beach at Crissy Field and it actually shows the accumulation of sand there it's one of the few accreting beaches in the San Francisco Bay Area it secreting naturally because of a funky sing where big waves come up from the South Pacific and curl around the Golden Gate but we can use artificially accreted beaches to make a sand barrier island which allows in this case this is the new site of the University of California up here they're going to do a international there this is a sand barrier island and what it would do would would be to accelerate the accretion of wetlands behind it by limiting wave energy so by manipulating some of the way that the sediment works we can mint it manipulate the shape of the shoreline this one was a proposal by a student of mine for adding a beach in a particular case a huge beach in an area where there's housing right now right on the water's edge that will be flooded and has a very kind of limited somewhat ineffective seawall so adding beaches there a recreational opportunity there an opportunity to protect urban development and basically the whole strategy ends up maybe buying US time we can't probably do it forever although the Dutch plan to and we'll learn from them about how you can do it forever but the proposal that I'm making in the Bay Area is that we think of the shoreline as a series of kind of micro polders truly small where we can try some pilot projects that bring in new housing in the indicated in the orange color in these ground water ponds that function as a kind of cellular stormwater infrastructure for flooding mostly from tributaries because we can't solve that problem very easily we have to figure out how to handle flooding from the tributaries that come into the day add beaches for recreational and habitat value and add wetlands to be able to have a living edge that's paid for by new luxury housing I think that's fair and having things like this when I showed this to the the man who's the head of the bay Commission board it's very excited about it and he wants me to do a case study that explains this to everybody in the Bay Area because he thinks it can make money and this looks a little weirder to him but it's a possibility we could talk about mid-rise that might actually happen so thank you for hearing about those examples and I look forward to a few questions look at that right on time pretty good this thank you for the presentation it was so exciting to hear a positive spin on some of these global processes my question is and it might be a bit unfair but thinking about how we harness these these flows of capital in terms of an equity lens and obviously there's an equity aspect to climate change and climate change adaptation but Stephen E and thoughts on how you can apply it to a broader context and think about equity more generally in urban areas yeah I mean if you're in a tier 3 city what I've been calling a tier 3 city good luck because you will not have the capital to be able to do these kinds of adaptation strategies it's much more likely that people will do floating houseboats they'll do they'll have non-functional sewage systems they're already in non-functional infrastructure settings anyway but we'll see a lot of failed systems as well and small towns along the coasts I really don't know over the long term what they're gonna do I think there's going to be a lot of relocation a lot some of that is second houses so it's not an equity problem second homes and I don't want to see us spend a single public dollar on second homes but I do think that there is an opportunity to offer things like revolving loan funds to lower-income homeowners and even renters to be able to improve their properties to elevate them rather than build levees and floodwalls and pump systems because I I know that those levees and floodwalls and pump systems will fail eventually in a community in a climate of people not doing maintenance and monitoring as they did in New Orleans and I know that many of the low-income communities around United States had no opportunity to borrow money in the 1920s 30s up to the 60s and maybe even extending into today because of phenomena like redlining where communities are prevented from getting loans because they had brown skin or they were the wrong religion so we can correct some of that I think of adaptation as an opportunity to try to level some of the playing field and not take the status quo into the future and we can say that a lot but what we really need is for credible community organizations people of color to come forward and Riaan lead people's adaptation councils go to the mic and demand that these adaptation solutions try to address inequality and then the technical people more on my side can make that happen but we have to have people who are willing to go to the microphone and say you know you're screwing us again and you've got to stop doing that there there is going to be a very different problem with groundwater which I didn't talk about in the interest of time as sea-level comes up the freshwater lens of the water table Rises on top of it and in communities that have a history of soil contamination that contamination is going to be R immobilized and the people who suffered cancer and other diseases from those contamination exposures in the 1940s 50s 60s 70s 80s until recently will suffer again some of them have been replaced by rich people as gentrification occurs and they'll suffer too so we have to address a number of legacy issues and I think I think that that's the way to get at some of these things as to consider whether we do public infrastructure as a solution I don't think we always should or whether you provide people with money to improve their homes and then we improve their roadways and their sewage systems but gentrification is a dynamic that as you know you know goes on without us being able to completely stop it that's a much bigger policy question than what I've tackled I just want to make sure that my particular proposals don't cause more inequity and hopefully do a little bit of good for people who have been trying to get loans I have a practical question thank you so much for your presentation very innovative ideas so I'm involved in politics in my community and I just have a practical question of how do you bring these innovative ideas if you could have a couple of examples do you sit down I'm just doing really practical or politicians do you have a coffee with them and say I have some ideas or do you do do you have a venue where they you bring your presentation you were talking about that you showed somebody these ideas so just some a very practical point of view politicians have no time as you know they're overwhelmed they're the ones who have to make approve these kinds of things or proof funding or there's different committees so just wondering if you have a couple of practical examples so yeah if you're not already connected to the actual elected official head of agency or the people who organize City age it's it's worth talking to the staff of the elected officials that's often where I've started and I've been fortunate to get some media attention so the staff sometimes come to me and then it's it'll be you know you have to do something for them like three times before you actually meet the elected official and then eventually you meet the elected official once they decide you're not a crazy lunatic and they don't want to be photographed with you so it takes a while to actually get to the elected official but there are people out there who've decided they want to be on the Hope side of this not on the doom-and-gloom side of this and those are the people that you want to be talking to their staff sharing examples of ideas that you can back up with more information and I also do a lot of speaking to community groups because I find that there'll be some older woman in the audience or older man who decides to make this their issue and then goes to their elected officials who they've given money to in the past and tries to get them onto this and also public agencies there are lonely good technical people at public agencies who could use a coffee and that is what the private sector does that's what they do they go talk to those people so we need to figure out how to talk to those people too is this hope can you hear me I think it the the equity question is very complex in the United States and and there's the rich communities and have-nots communities but I'm an education facility planner as well as a urban planner but one of the things I've noticed in the states is there's also poor schools and well-to-do school because it's local funding yes and it's it's a basically you have to have local bonds and if there's no support and you don't get it so how do you see that do you think there's a need for transformation in the system in the United States in terms of you know there needs to be some change to to create better get me started there are so many things that need to be changed and since I can't change those things I'm focused on helping to change things on the ground to the extent that I can but yeah there are a lot of things that need to be changed and you know we've descended into a situation where because of of thirty years of effort on the part of the private sector to reduce the number of people who are in the public sector getting paid to work for the public this has taken 30 years you know the Reagan administration was a while ago to totally gut public agencies I work with agencies now they have almost no staff and they rely on these pro bono projects by private companies that are feathering their own nest they have almost no staff and what's happened really not to be too much of a conspiracy theorist but when you look at it they've got at the public sector and so now the private sector can rush in with City agents say they're building our society for us with no oversight by the public because there's no one else to do it they need our help but it's totally self-serving because that's the same community that's voted for Republicans who have gutted the public sector you take all of its teeth out then you wonder why it can't you earlier about City age and the Vancouver connection mero certain egg one of the two founders is a journalist and wrote for the national newspaper that I used to work for here and saw the end of that tunnel and jumped off and formed it they don't want local participation it's I'm not surprised it's only global hot capital so there is very interestingly these global currents of information an opinion been touched down in only certain places and Vancouver is buying into that game in a big way by putting a lot of public money millions of public dollars into attracting the Ted Ted conferences here etc so I think they're the you could map those flows of information or information generation institutions just a quick comment I was in Phnom Penh a couple weeks ago which was a fascinating city that I wasn't expecting a land and development boom there but it's got one and for them crazy land prices etc with the specter of the damming and the Mekong River we shouldn't have enormous hydrological effects all through Southeast Asia now this just strikes me is that based on your talk one wants to produce kind of global images of geo-economic morphology in other words eating away at places like Bangladesh and Tunxis of Cambodia because they don't have the capital to preserve or enhance landscapes and then the aggrandizement of those places with and I'm just curious if it has anyone sat down and done a big picture picture a rendering of world transformed by these forces I haven't seen that I've seen artists doing maps Network maps of how for example the bushes and the Saudis are connected and all these other pieces but nobody has done it yet in terms of the physical world but they should and I you know it's possible Saskia Sassen is I've been reading the last few years since I saw her give a lecture was writing recently about commodity cities the cities where the raw materials come from and maybe that really should be tier 3 and then Flint Michigan would be even tier 4 below them because the dynamics of places where you get your water places where you get your lithium places where you get your other commodities those are very important and differently affected by the flows of capital hi Christina any student want to ask a question hi I'm a mud student hair and this year we'll be working on the City of Surrey project and we are specifically working in the wally area what he is the Northwest region of Surrey and it's it's mostly industrial zone and it's near the Fraser River so it's also the most of the part of that region is at the floodplain or at the verge of flooding but my question is that they have some existing industrial works or industrial lands near those floodplain are those near to the Fraser River how we tackle those those private sector or that industrial existing industrial businesses - okay either make some gentrification or either just move and maybe just introducing something more sand or and there there's some some kind of a existing occupancy as well over there and which which experiences flood that floods as we talk about those officials that they experience the sludge not every year but in mostly like three four years but the people were the community doesn't want to move they have some social and a really cultural bonding that to that place and they don't want to move so what do you think would be the right solution for that space well I don't know if this is the right solution for that place or for industrial areas generally I mean the supply chains of all manufacturing are going to be affected by flooding because they're all in flat places because they need a big floor plate those kinds of buildings need a big floor plate and so they're in flat places that are going to be wet places maybe there'll be a typological change or people will use more and levies for those places in particular it's a brutal thing but it would least only be flooding an industrial site not flooding residential the the thing that strikes me about it though is that there will be places that we will pardon the gambling analogy we will double down and I think that we'll be doubling down around our switch treatment facilities we'll be protecting those because there are billion dollar investments that we have no place to relocate them to and when we double down which we will to protect those kinds of facilities maybe we should put some housing in there and if you decide that it's important to double down on that industrial location put some housing in there you might as well find a place for people to live who will be protected by whatever strategies will protect those private investments that's make sense I love to talk and I love the kind of morale I love the the obvious moral ambiguity of it all and the concession to the reality part of it so I totally applaud that as a preface just to challenging you and the challenge is in a way have you reflected on this possibility if this depends on the 1% or the point zero one percent as the economic driver for it their physical footprint on the land is relatively small in comparison with the huge footprint that the middle class had particularly in places like the United States during the 50 60 70 and 80 so the internet system the infrastructure of the suburbs all that stuff was driven by you know the overwhelming geographical footprint of that class in comparison this is a tiny class they have the they have the they have the wealth of Midas but it it it lands in these tiny points so have you reflected on that problem as a problematic potentially I'm not you know a valorous of the middle class so I don't it's not like I'm defending the middle class in all this but I think that the footprint of the 1% may be small where they actually live but their capital has a big footprint that capital needs to be parked somewhere in order to make more money and so the Bay Area Treasure Island is entirely the result of the 1% that's 8 to 10 thousand units that are funded by foreign capital and local politicians who are funded by some of that real estate development capital open the doors to make that happen so the middle class is going to live there about the upper middle class it's gonna live there in Treasure Island not the 1% maybe a 1% will live in the penthouse apartments but it's the 1% that makes a development deal that makes the 20% return on investment that pulls their money out as the units are sold so that's I would say the real footprint of the 1% and that's the pressure that feeling of you can only say no to that much money so many times and eventually someone will cave and say yes and then the thing gets built yeah I agree with the thing gets built in and I'm doing what you're talking about is doing God's work you know you'll definitely get into heaven but I'm still I'm still skeptical yeah well that's the Irish Catholic and me I'm always worried about what's there's reincarnation I'm gonna have to suffer whatever I caused to make but you know I just want I'm just reflecting on a conversation of the whole conference about how can we treat this thing as a landscape scale issue at the same time it's an equity issue at the same time it's a climate change issue I haven't I don't have the solution well I actually think that these land form based strategies which will have to be mostly land farm based because they're cheaper these land farm based strategies provide us with an armature for rethinking the landscape of the way this capital works to create land that gets the investment both for habitat and for human habitat and for a nonhuman habitat and for flood protection so I think that we can by using landscape as something create a bowl not something we have to fight over the last you know few parcels but something create a bowl I think that that's going to gonna be the saving grace not to go back to your you know religious language but you've got me started thank you Christina this is fantastic that's the
