 there's no anomalous introduce themselves and we're going to start from the right well we're gonna troll myself and it was from basting you guys have seen me enough the head of research at braiding a coin formerly Bear Stearns JPMorgan completely with Wall Street now on just in Bitcoin space and outraging coin would like to think of ourselves as the Bloomberg of the crypto industry without data collection building an index and then use division and i will introduce the a lot of panels introduce themselves where i go i'm going to go ahead and start without like even know my name is richie middleton high founder of veritasium which is a small contracts startup that basically attempt to take the business functions though wall street banks you can do it in two blonde chain Peter clear transactions previously before then I was a self-directed investor did my own analysis and I've known for media for calling for Bear Stearns from an employer being brothers country washed Mutual's over there crisis technology land areas that were roughly about 82 successful calls and because of that I could see me me I've been seeing you see doesn't challenge everything had it between his 77 so drive measurable Your Honor Casey and does a variation mom uses small contracts to enable the small compact a wallet that allows individuals and entities to trade directly each other use about 45,000 tickets nes a class any geographic course so you can go on IBM charcoal long facebook chalk your style long the Ukrainian hub gun your au pair short lecture speeches in it and you do it with zero trust base if you don't have to know the other side or just the other side and there's no counterparty risk it's a sages much angel for week one chain this guaranteed durable n77 real time accordingly when it oh thanks Scott girl next to tell about yourself pretty much felt and one point so briefly got myself on the sales leader I worked for three different software companies in Silicon Valley started we're gonna lose myself in the start of 2014 I join all the point and have been growing that business for the last two years at hotpoint could have employed powers exchanges so for a white label a shame provider it's a platform that will enable you to launch an exchange and definitely use awesome and unfortunately I could make it so we're skipping out ahead hey guys I'm Craig sellers boundary CTO cheddar but you got currencies REM Vic I'm watching reviews technology called the Omni later which is basically a technology and vertical that puts private watching technology on top of the dickering public watching i'm also a technologist for disconnects which is the world's largest dick on you as the exchange awesome i so we're going to jump right in this is a panel of awesome Pokemon exchanges and you can't talk about exchanges about poking the history of exchanges so we're going to kick right in with a very first Bitcoin exchange info boss what kind of all know what happened what are your views on the opinion upon gosselin stood for for example I'm very happy that my boss came into existence partially perhaps because I didn't lose any money in mom cops I wasn't not a little training on it but they took the initiative and they joined the space and they created a very first exchange and establish an initial price of Bitcoin and what has happened since that sorrow anybody wants to comment on the history of exchanges and how is it up take it off it's a book called digital gold so yes yes I really don't care ha yeah so I read that book you guys have a red it's fantastic it really details the knocks yeah now God's played a great role initially it's funny how small that company was again at the cheech global impact and that the book gives great insight into how he was managing this basically global exchange what a lot of talk at times so yeah I mean it certainly played a crucial role as we know exchanges are price discovery mechanisms and sources of liquidity and that's exactly what what it did for a big one now gosh for me at least I was only in this for the creation of temperament as Nagas began to fail one of the uploading things started that process the US government seized their US bank accounts and so you assess which I know it getting dollars out of the system so what they do is they have balances on dogs and buy a big coins that were there I'm forced related supply price up in the draw their bitcoins we couldn't withdraw their dollars and the question was why can't I withdraw my dollars in might be going that makes no sense to me so they said the creators of GOP on long at the same time though we can talk about the generations of technology companies when the big going space and the lessons they've been learning previous experiences business as an example like this is a very large US dollar Bitcoin exchange I'm so many of the security concerns that are there at all then from failures in the past now gossip was being an artist I like to comment because oftentimes when it eventually won thoughts it's a connection with some type of sherry big time Bob Dobbs was sheer of management executioner and that's what it was it wasn't afraid in big market was a matter of fact they knew he's become a cop you took your pic on your assets you real interest control possession and customer pick on dissent among Cox summer and Japan gradually and it's a conveniently disappear mob gods had a mental institution every they collapsed across the assets the power of bitcoin is yonas I have to do that you came back you can I'm waterpark a hypergate that's a word possession control and ownership Bitcoin um because mom God's business model did not rely upon the powers inherent Bitcoin that quote was spectacular in heaven we did but in an epic vengeance you can choose happen all the time not just Bitcoin you Estelle zero exedra blackwell I don't even I just want to make sure that we all understand that montage was picture your fancy not fared underlying technology or the asset that was used yeah and I always say that it's actually it's a good example of free market because mom comes fail now we're gonna get the regulation in a minute but they say well before nice regulation or guess what bitcoin was fully regulated imagine if my Oxford a government bailout because it was today and so on so you can also do about an average point actually talk about evolution control over your assets it was not a technological killer vehicles imagio failure but it spawned the creation of decentralized exchanges of start asean on later as well so even though their managerial failures in the technology of sign it inspired greater technology to prevent those injured orientation yeah and from a sales perspective you know I talk to people all over the globe every day in the start of 2014 you know I couldn't get through a phone call hustle be right on top dogs and then I was like yeah I understand yeah you know there was the resistor but what quickly happened I from my perspective was you know the industry's a whole got past it the industry survived became a lot stronger from it from what these don't going to point out from a technical perspective and I think overall the coin became much much longer alright let's jump on it's not even it's a matter of trust so we'd like to do want to separate trust and regulation in two forms so i was going to separate the question so this is normally a question i raised the key i get to 12 with the CTO on auto out of the movie we have a she do this time is a londres you kick us off how do you create an exchange to generally trust without the human element of trust without a law without a mandate how do you is it possible to design something that is inherently trustworthy kind of like Bitcoin itself thank you questions p what we do is we essentially take a blushing and replace the transactions come party with the block chain after a wants to go long bitcoin struck us tile actively months ago short yourself on big one normally they face each other in our either of the our transaction or i'd say a legacy institution citibank some decentralized Bitcoin exchanges etc with a pure clear transaction they can deal directly with each other without having trust an intermediary or no man that you made would be a well-funded record company Citibank JP Morgan etc all armed guards and on top of that when they do as per their funds now the block chain comes in counterparty and if you believe it into the block chain that we really can't afford we call that a counterparty risk free transaction or zero stress transaction I'm you taking out a significant amount of risk they make papers we need the net contemplated rates and do little bigger than a execution X as far as I'm glad she is a comical unreliable and I think most people call these this series believes that the block chain is inherently up a new assume anybody up for comment well I can see the note to launch of that you don't have a purely centralized solution if I do I find elegant beautiful thang well we have a centralized solution there are other aspects of trust that you'd like to get across one of the layers of non-toxic or some transparency into where the assets were who helped me ask etc one of the names we done with the next especially partnered with a company called pitco changes multi signature wallets such that every deposit or withdrawal it's occurring on the next platform and then subsequently every single trade that occurs is actually settled on watching multi signature accounts so any point in time you can actually look big on watching and see exactly the dish hold in the exchange so therefore it's cryptographically protected insecure and demonstrate all across things i watch love what Scott kick off the next topic which is a topic of regulations and what I say actually I kind of hit me when I was on a on a panel at MIT Thank You Mitchell for good album and someone asked the question well whatever regulation would you like to see in within the Bitcoin space and my answer is my default position has always been no regulations because i am now found but as I think about it I would actually like to see very hard regulations on the business would consumer protection side which means at the time the person destiny happen to be the CEO of pleasure of X which has launched yet but they're going to launch options on on Bitcoin and that is a very leveraged very dangerous instrument and what I said was for a company like that I would like maximum regulation to make sure that he's actually holding his customer funds or if you can show it some kind of wild that regulated to make sure he's not running with people's money and to be sure he's not leveraged to the gills to form the next long-term capital management with is a different space however I wants your regulation on people in their property so I want ok I see all day avail to be abolished personally across the world that is a dream I know I may not ever see but that's my utopia for regulation so I want the other panel state on the human element of reggae when it comes to exchanges and value transfer within a Bitcoin space what you think is going to happen and what you would like that so I'll kick it off I probably show you this quite a bit as well if you're going to be taking in somebody's money especially if it is a an exchange that includes a national currency so we're not talking to even maybe even when the digital digital exchanged well but let's say a US dollar to digital exchange if you are receiving some of these dollars or if your centralized exchange and urmc have a good point any kind of value consumers do need to be protected and we don't want to have people gain scam that's just not good at the same time we don't want to have so much regulation that is over-regulating companies that don't have any control over over the value of story so if within the context of exchanges where they're centralized and you do have to send your your collateral in either dollars or digital value I think it's important that there is regulation I think these guys should be monitored and they should be able to prove that the dirt legit I'm seeing along those same lines is remembering the riddle settlement dreams where they had to agree to actually we're not actually natural breeding or forced to make changes to the protocol of traceability I and reversibility in certain cases and of course being proud alleging that they themselves control they can fulfill that demand in the Bitcoin space from the public block chain space first ball itself is on find by the organizations that use it and so those kinds of will stand enforced and so what happens is the regulation she gets pushed to the borders or the threat the threshold of when people get into or out of any centralized system I think one of the interesting things we should be doing as an industry isn't going to regulators more on what that boundary actually is and how can he use organs from protection I've at the chiming my visits recently came under the purview of the CFTC and going through CBC regulation it became came to really expect we a day that that announcement was made was about three weeks maybe two years after it was absolutely so basically it was absolutely real time when you graduate something at the very least read the directions big client is programmable it is very malleable it has its own transportation so if you're going to regulate it as a commodity it is not on porkbelly's you know it's not corn it can easily take the form open up of another asset enter your commodity it came emulate cash flows it can base reading something else so when you pass regulation you should work with those in the community on the regulation um the right regulation that is absolutely as soon as it's fast does no good it doesn't meet consumer because we are financial engineers we're going to engineer the way about it it doesn't I'm false innovation because it costs on a small money to try to comply with and it doesn't protect the tunes because we have bad and there's again we'll find it weighs about under regulation so my best wishes they have smart cooperatives I guess that could be synonymous if everybody had seen how long each other any other should replace my smart contracts well technically six months to a year oh yeah we really in handy a while you know why use the same with you Reggie and it applies to like all all levels of our of Finance given like I said whatever regulation they come up with to prevent the next 2008 crisis is it relevant it's not going to happen again crises and financial markets always happen when every one that remembers the last crisis is already like dying of old age because people have memories that Wall Street doesn't want to see another 2008 they take advantage of the situation until it crashes and then they won't remember and they're not going to do it again until they all pretty much are starting to diagnose the next crisis i perceive is that crisis in government bonds which was in 1931 and everyone is about 70 or 80 years old would yes got a question Reuters financing and I widnes arises for when you're fit quite as personally surprise that hasn't been in there yet but until they have a magical way to control Bitcoin I don't see a course known in my personal view is that the fact that too many lonely people that come up with economic laws are actually lawyers and not people that have traded and people that have dealt with economics is one of the reasons why the world is liquidity of the world and all assets is going down a carabiner wester that's going to change do you know the chamber visual commerce or anyone's is lobbying on nation currency man I'm not sure it's not anybody's radar screen but there's been a series of hearings over the last several months for the city's been brought up multiple times and it's very much like a page reactant in 2001 where they threw anything that's been sitting around if they wanted to get through went into this mess that became the Patriot Act and I just I don't think I started if you know putting more people to the right bitcoin so I love it okay so we got about seven more minutes and let's talk about equity and micro story and liquidity so I've been given this say presentations a time of different speakers for while I'm here now and in Hong Kong I asked the same question the hooded and what's not what happens in the current financial oil is you have a stock like Apple and in a real financial world exchange and broker are two different things on the Bitcoin world your exchange is the broker to give a more specific example for the nonce traders apple stock since under NASDAQ exchange but you can't trade on the nasdaq you straight off that led you straight on each raid if they still exist I interactive brokers which is what i use a spy on them optionsxpress whatever and they all compete on fees execution trading tools they open beyond the quiddity they access the same pool acquitted infinitely that doesn't happen and that's why you have these skus in prices where somebody just wants to buy a lot of one exchange or the other so my question has always been what bitcoin benefit from a single pool of liquidity but I also understand so dangerous because I was like a honey pot for a massive amount of Bitcoin maybe up to twenty thirty percent of all hit points out there and on one of my panels one of the panelists was Bobby lead and he just smiled and said we're working on something so that's something turned out to be liquid on side chains so now we at least have a partial prototype of the sharing of exchanges sharing your liquidity between exchanges and I want to get the panel's view on that and the guys got all right so like picking up on what he is talking about the concept of brokers and exchanges a lot of the exchanges that are on the planets data are brokers and they're brokering on the larger global liquidity so one of the pieces of technology we have at alpha point to support our clients culver environment what it does is it basically connects their exchange to larger pools including like 15 x and it's fantastic because it enables a local region to have liquidity so there is some concentration liquidity it's definitely there there's a handful of large pools and a lot of the exchanges are a lot of cases is it is a dangerous Mohammed Atta to talk about if it's dangerous or not but I know that it does exist is probably just a handful I mean there's bitstamp there's bit fedex there's BTC China there's okay coin down yeah that's probably your top five pools and liquidity phone line right now and at least one of those vista max's were so tender guys today removing validity common point has a number of relationships as well from the exchanges he mentioned forces the liquid network as well so there's a variety of different businesses that are coming up right now as you solved that problem not the pool liquidity but to make the access those funds more instant across all the various organizations there's also issue of overcome transactions this is significant amount of transactions that off exchange where someone takes their private asset means to do with somebody else sells it and vice versa yeah we both almost the price only affect the general consumer that's again but you know if you create in the game you know now that sounds self-serving you create a peer-to-peer network you're able to move the assets once you know the answers to a certain amount then that feel good networking that said its own price and that can be done with everything started big one big one is programmable you get an injector price feeding and you listen to that and I'm people trade have to stop who's the client network you set a price Babel because more people start raining 10 people trade I'm period here
