 good afternoon I like to suggest that you come forward and be a little bit more welcoming and mom to our speakers and guess you don't have to be that distant and it's really a pleasure to welcome you all to this symposium on as I mentioned of sustainability and the theme today is human dimensions of climate change it's very interesting that we are meeting in a science building and this might be historic first that we meet meeting here for a symposium and have decided not to invite any scientist to be a part of the collection of speakers of course scientists always will have their say so we have in that sense drop Stevenson as our moderator but largely to know the proceedings are going to be dominated by people other than their those who deal with climate change science and that is very important it's very very critical that that we reach out to a lot of people and we hear various dimensions of the problem and I'm not going to say much more than that Reimer will say more except that I do want to acknowledge our gratitude to root and fought soft watch it is rude and what stuff what fund that supports these series I also want to thank correct Kelly chair of the biology department for his really continent support and encouragement and to my colleagues in the school of environment especially Robin for making the slot on Wednesday available for this series so right mark Prasad your thank you come up and welcome everybody great to see everybody here is first time we've done on Wednesday so I guess there's more people from school for the environment than we're used to on friday isn't that great and if Boyle any people here as well so we've got quite a mixture and it's great to see everybody the yes the full title of today's event is human dimensions of climate change vision imagination and communication so we're going a little bit Big Island as dr. Bowers ever going a little bit beyond the natural science issues related to climate change and would be looking at the way people respond to climate change and the image that I chose for the poster with this semester is symposium is it's one of the iconic images of 19th century romanticism Cosmo David Friedrich was the painter in and he painted this in 1818 at the height of the Industrial Revolution was ongoing in Europe just about the time when the multi various uses of coal first fossil fuel to be used goodbye we're coming into focus and people realizing this was unbelievably useful if you want to get a lot of work done and so in a way this this image is sort of at the basis of the larger trend that we're looking at which is now producing some very vast changes that we hadn't been hadn't expected it hadn't anticipated but this painting is interesting because it it shows probably friedrich himself the painter and he was red hair and this this character here is red here to see him from the back so we see the view that he has as opposed to most portraits where you're seeing behind the subject of the portrait so we see what he sees and what he sees is essentially the result of a temperature inversion so it's probably early morning and he's gotten up there on to a peak and he's looking down to the valley where that colder air is settled from the night and there's a blanket of warmer air on top which is creating the sea of fog and he's standing in front now this this is one of the ways in which storms development so I you know to sort of bring it into the present I could say that this is an example of the the sorts of effects that we can expect to continue to become more and more severe as as climate change if not where is this this figure here had no suspicion that something like that would happen the energy of the painting is in the background but the focus these diagonal line is coming down and up from the the rock that he's standing on the focus of the painting is the individual and that was one of the ways in which romanticism was reacting to social all sorts of social disruptions of dislocations that were happening as industrial revolution continued and people were being already being replaced by machinery and their their livelihoods in their workplaces and all sorts of ferment was happening in in society I think this has continued the pace of changes even more rapid and but we will this afternoon continue this focus on the response of the individual and of society to the challenges that are being thrown up many of which are unanticipated many of which are still unknown we're going to be looking at unknowns and uncertainties this afternoon but not so much what we might be more familiar with here the uncertainties in the data will be looking at the uncertainties as to how people respond or fail to respond to the challenges that we're facing now so our first speaker our first speaker is a psychology social psychologist from from penn state university Janet's swim dr. scrip will be a pro environmental engagement in social context personal actions and social movements doctors way thank you very much pleasure to be here and if I stand too close evidently it'll reverberate so let me know if you can still hear me yeah so thank you for being here it's a pleasure to be a part of a interdisciplinary plan panel and to be speaking to a wide audience of people and look forward to hearing what you all have to say about what I have to say so I am a social psychologist and as a social psychologist i'm interested in individuals in social context so I'm interested in both how individuals perceive a social context and how the social context influences individuals under and behavior and what I'm going to talk about today is a particular social context of gender and prior to my work on environmental issues I did a lot of work on gender studies and what I'm doing right now with this research is integrating some of the things that I had done and gender work with environmental science work and this is a work that I've been doing largely with Terry vest shows Stephanie Johnson and you Julia dollas are graduate students so in terms of the gender context so when you in the social sciences when we look at differences tendency to behave in pro-environmental manners you find that women are more likely report that they do it women are more likely report concern about climate change the more likely report the climate change is a risk and so there's this Jenner difference out there and so we're trying to think about what why is that and what is the implications of that gender differences for engagement in climate change and one of the things that people often talk about with general gender difference is is the idea that one reason why that happens is part of general socialization so the idea that women are socialized to be caretakers socialized to be nurturing and to care for the planet is a simple extension of that caretaking the general socialization is not just that sort of behaviors for women you also have socialization of men and the socialization of men and contrast the caretaking then is this toughness this this playing and your roughhousing with people and that is some interesting consequences for men so part of the general socialization for men then is to be tough and powerful and if you don't live up to that tough and powerfulness you are thought about as a wimp you're not quite there yet so there's a lot of pressure on men to be tough and powerful which then has some implications for the types of behaviors that they're willing to engage in but another part of general socialization for men is that they are explicitly supposed to be not women so they're anti feminine and anti femininity and so that and i sent amenity is often called the flight from the feminine so men are engaging in hey viewers to make sure that they are tough and powerful and that they are not feminine and that again can potentially have some implications for engagement environmental issues and topic areas so historically there's an interesting assessment of men's engagement in climate change so back in the Progressive Era in the early 1900's it was a lot of the women's movements that was involved in environmental topics and they were trying to do it for social justice reasons but then you have some famous people like John Muir a lot of environmental scientists who are men and engaged in it but this is an example one of those consequences for men being engaged in environmental context so this is a picture of John Muir when he's working in the Hetch Hetchy a project to block a dam and what you have is his total cartoon is putting him up as a woman and they're trying to mock him for doing that sort of behavior and so there's pressure on men to not be environmentalist that also extended farther in in the 1960s even when Rachel Carl Carlson started working on the topic there's a lot of issues about sexism against Rachel Carlson but when you get into it in terms of men's willingness to talk about climate chant the time environmental problems at that point there was concern what they called a fear about being a bunny boy and so men's willings to talk about climate change they not climate change they could say climate change because that's what I'm doing now but environmental topics was suppressing man's ability to fully explain their feelings about environmental problems because they didn't want to be characterized as being feminine again so the what I'm interested then in an hour research has been is the environmental context still perceived as gendered and so those are historical notes but is it still seen that way so our pro-environmental behaviors gendered so are there some behaviors that seem to be more associated with women than men and concern about climate change itself is that gendered and because it's still concerned in a nurturing role and in terms of involvement in social movements and how you frame and talk about climate change is that gender so part of my research will be about seeing first is that still perceived as gendered and another part of it is trying to understand what the implications of those are for those 33 same topic so I'm going to go through those three things first the behaviors then concern and then the framing of climate change so the first set of studies what are the impressions of behaviors pro-environmental behaviors and people who do them and what other is there evidence for the impact of that on willingness to engage in behaviors so a first one is a set of studies where we ask people first to tell us what is your default not if we don't say default but what is the when you conceive of pearl endure mental behaviors what are they and we got a whole list of them but the top 10 behaviors tend to be more likely be associated with women so they the number one behavioral is recycling and people think women are doing that more than men but a whole other set of other behaviors also are that same way so for instance organic foods that's associated with women growing it or eating it so that by default people when people thinking about pro-environmental behaviors they tend to think about feminine ones but that's not all there is there is also a whole variety of other types of pro-environmental behaviors so ceiling windows fixing leaky pipes those things become masculine behaviors when people think about them so when you ask people about these behaviors the default tends to be feminine ones but if they're pushed to think about other behaviors that are masculine ones and what we wanted to look at then is what is perception of people when men engaged in the feminine behaviors and when women engage in the masculine behaviors so we gave them this scenario we said imagine either Diane or David they got one of those two and there this person is describing how they ran into their old friend and they were lying drying their clothes what they repainted their living room to be able reflective of daylight they roared sustainably design clothing they recycled everything and they use recyclable usable bikes so what is your impression of this person and then another group of people either got Diane or David who was doing masculine behaviors so they donated to Ducks Unlimited to protect wild waterfowl they worked in their car to make sure was more efficient they put tire pressure and they're in they're cutting their car tires to make sure they weren't wasting gas they their windows these online videos to reduce the electronic waste and so what is your impression of these people and one of the key things that we found had to do with impressions of the person's sexual orientation and so when they were described as doing the feminine behaviors and it was Diane it was higher on this scale they're more likely to thought of thought of them as being heterosexual but when a man did them his sexual orientation was lower it's almost over the area of that basically they're not certain what that person's sexual orientation they don't go down and say that is gay but they're just don't know about that person's sexual orientation and then on the masculine ones you get to reverse so you get the tendency when David does the masculine behaviour okay he's heterosexual but when Diane does it she's questioning her sexual orientation is questioned it's a part of this then has to do with the threat of having proof for men in particular because it's more threatening about this anti femininity is it the threat of people not really knowing what your sexual orientation is and the importance of not being seen as gay and so one of the things we wanted to do then would say well given that are their gender differences in willingness to do these different type of pro-environmental behaviors and so we gave them a whole list of the behaviors and we asked men and women their willingness to do those behaviors and there's one set of them that were the feminine behaviors that's not spelled right but feminine behaviors and the masculine behaviors and what you find is that women are more likely to be willing to do the feminine ones than men are they're equally likely to do the masculine behaviors so men are avoiding these behaviors the feminine behaviors and we would argue it's because of the way that it's portrayed and the info patience it has four men and masculinity then that next set of studies has to be more generally about concern about climate change so we wanted to look at what people's expectations are about whether men or women are more going to be concerned about climate change and in particular what are the traits that they associate with people who are concerned about climate change and do those then have implications for men's and women's willingness to be involved in activist activities climate change activism so I had put this in the context of some other research when people are thought told to think about and describe what their impressions are of environmentalists they tend to think of them is socially deviant so they tend to think about is their self-righteous their eccentric and that leads people to not like environmentalists oh sorry I know many of you are in the department environmental science your social deviance so so but people think of you as social deviants and that because your ailment because you're even if you're doing something that people like you're out there telling them they're not doing the right thing and so what our interest was is is there a gendered component for that social devious and so what we've looked at was trying to look at how do people what are people's impressions of people who are alarmed about climate change and first of all people do expect them to be more likely to be women than men but we have them rape them on a series of traits and so we rated them are they naggy whiny complaining or if they're feminine they still could be nurturing gentle and sympathetic are they masculine negative are they aggressive dictatorial or arrogant are they masculine positive are the courageous adventures or stand up under pressure and what we find is that like environmentalists in general they tend to be seen as negative so that's the feminine negative and masculine negative are stronger than the other traits but within the negativity they tend to be thought about as being whiny and complain so it's not just negative it's feminine negative so that then we wanted to say well what is the implications of that for people's willingness to sign up and say you're concerned about climate change so what we did was we manipulated people's expectations about whether somebody who's very concerned about climate change is a woman or a man or tend to be women or men making salient the expectations or countering that so we couldn't didn't want to just tell them the demographics of this group we wanted them to just be thinking about it in the back of their mind so we've set up a study where we said this is a study on memory and we want you to memorize a whole bunch of sentences and the names of the people who said it and the context was well you know when your discussion you're trying to remember who said what well you can use mnemonics to help you remember who says what so we gave them for quotes and we associated those quotes with different names and in one condition they were all women had another condition they're all men and the third condition they were equally likely to be a woman or a man so for instance and one of the women one was for Julia it says julia says climate change is a topic that needs to be addressed nobody seems too concerned about it and by the time people really want to do something about it it'll be too late and so they either learned that Julia said that or Jack's of that and then they get these quotes and they memorize them and then they recall them then after they recall them said oh by the way we'd like you to know what your impressions are of people who are concerned about climate change and so this case actually we found that they were positive so they tended to see them as both feminine positive masculine positive but not very negative on either one of them but what's important about this is this feminine negative one here so this is one where we get gender differences in perceptions of the people who are concerned about climate change and so what we find is that when the group is composed of all men women and men see them the same way about when they're composed of both equal numbers of women and men or there's more women than men and then the perceptions start to change so when you add women to the mix they start to see this group as having more feminine negative attributes so before they're generally positive when it's men but when you add women into the mix they start banging they've got these other attributes that I don't really like and they tend to be feminine negative attributes and then we also ask them that's you know notes yeah so how interested are you in signing up for doing various climate change activism would you sign the petition would you go to a talk a whole series of different things would you do and people are more likely to do those things when they heard about men men doing the behaviors but in particularly again we're interested in what is can we explain that and can we explain that based upon their impressions of the group and so basically what we have is that when the group is equal or more women than men we know that men see them is more negative and it is that negativity which then decreases their willingness to support it when women are involved or set in the reverse when they're more men involved they see them as having less of these negative attributes and there's less negative attributes make them more willing to be involved so the gendered nature of their impressions of the group are preventing them for being willing to be part of a climate change movement on the last set of studies has to do about the social movement idea itself so social movements are have their influence in the public by being able to frame the problem in such a way that can increase people's engagement in the topic and they tend to define the way that people think about climate change and so we wanted to see what are some of the impressions of the different ways that climate change has been presented in the to the public and what is the implications of those again impressions of those different frames and framings so the dominant climate change message in the United States this is from some sociological work is characterized by two different things so the first one is characterized by the things that you can see being said by the 350.org movement and so they say we hope that fossil fuel divestment movements can help break the hold that the fossil fuel industry has on our economy and our government so it's it's a powerful statement we're going to fight evil that's the way we're going to stand up and we're going to be tough and so there is that that's one sort of message and another way is the scientific message so here we are in the Science Building and so the scientific message at the union of concerned scientists we put rigorous science to work to build a healthier planet and a safer world so that's a scientific view and when you ask people who do you think said these things they will say I think men said these things and that's but that's the dominant framework we have in this country about how we talk about climate change there are alternative frames so this is from the national Geographics society the mission of the National Geographic societies and star people inspire people to care about the planet and so this is a very caretaking role again another one is a social justice frame or climate justice so climate change is hurting people these frameworks you find them more in the south on the southern hemisphere that is not the southern part the United States the southern hemisphere is where you hear these sorts of arguments you don't hear them is in the United States but when you ask people who's saying these that they'll say women are more likely to say these things and so we were interested again is how do these sorts of framings then impact the way people in their impressions of people who say these things and their willingness to talk about climate change and how do they talk about them so we gave them this a couple of different policies and this one I'm just focusing on one of them so we gave them one this is one we saw it was promoted in England was the illegal ization is standby mode policy so this is basically the idea is to make the idea that look that the phantom load on your electronics can't be there it's illegal to have it it's just sucking up energy and so they then read arguments that people associated with men in this masculine framing or they read arguments that are associated women in the feminine framing so the example would be adopting this policy will show the world that we are willing to step forward and be a leader in developing technologies to combat climate change that's one that people associate with men a legalization of electronics will stand with standby mind will demonstrate our concerns go beyond making our lives easier with extended the well-being of those harmed by climate change so they got a series of these different arguments to look at and evaluate and trying to make this short because I don't have much time left it to get down to the basic part of it when we had men evaluating their impressions of men who say these different types of arguments and you'll see the same sort of pattern that we saw with climate change concerned that when men say the feminine arguments there seemed to have feminine negative traits but they're also seen to have feminine positive traits so there seem to be more feminine when they use the feminine arguments then when they use the masculine arguments and it doesn't seem to impact their perceived masculinity but it impacts their perceived femininity but what's important is the line that goes after that that those negative traits are then associated with seeing that the argument isn't as strong and when the argument isn't as strong they don't like the policy so the argument decreases support for the policy by way of making them think about the person who did this has these whiny sort of characterizations and so that decreases their support for the environmental policy women do something a bit different they see them as more feminine positive but that feminine positivity doesn't relate to the argument strength and so the gendered nature of the argument is not influencing women's endorsement of it it's influencing man's endorsement of it so I think I actually have more time I'm at the end so I'm trying to go fast I hope you've been able to follow it so in the end or what the point being here is that the social context a gendered social contact map matters so in parlin vironment engagement a climate action is not just politicized so we hear a lot about the political sighs nature of climate change it's also gendered and those gender nature of the way we talk about climate change the gendered nature's of the behaviors we ask people do are going to impact people and their decisions about doing the behavior and part of this I think it's important to be thinking about in terms of whose behavior needs to be explained so often times when you're- when people are trying to describe somebody who somebody's behavior they will try and describe the think person that's different from the rest of the group and so a lot of times when people are trying to describe gender differences in behavior they focus in on women so what is it about women and that's rooted in the idea that who the normal person is a man and what you need to do is explain women but in this case what we're arguing is that you don't need to necessarily explain women they're doing these things and they're not impacted by the gendered nature but what you need to be thinking about is what is it about men what is the qualities of men and masculinity that are impacting their impressions of these behaviors and their willingness to do them and to be engaged and women understand these implications of masculinity in per se and masc socialization then you can understand how they can have implications for men's willingness to engage in behavior so masculinity basically is constraining men's pro-environmental engagement they will do some things but they will not go beyond those things they will feel more constrained in terms of their behaviors that they're willing to do they'll also constricts the acceptable characterizations of what environmental activism is going to be when the dominant framework is one of masculinity men are not going to be willing to say or they're going to be more hesitant to talk about things about environmental justice and things about caretaking because of those implications it has for the way people will perceive them to be so this becomes an issue than of routing and thinking about these fundamental context of gendered context and how that influences the way men are willing to be engaged in climate change actions thank you dr. Phil very interesting so I think it's really interesting to see how with this I guess this previous talk was an example of her ways in which disciplines that previously haven't been connected to issue such as climate change are expanding to incorporate it to start to address some of the issues that are being that are being brought up by this this new challenge
