 thank you for coming to the evening plenary we're very pleased to see you all happy to be here Kathy and I heavy with guests here at the horror and we're very pleased this evening to have Terry McCarty as you know we at this particular iteration of the four of our celebrating Nancy one burger and our way of trying to celebrate our service to the forum all these years or dedication is to try to celebrate her work both as a scholar and is an end tour and I hope that all of you had the chance to attend at least one or two of the sessions this afternoon where various of Nancy's former students came back and put on for really wonderful panels on themes that she's laid out in her work and that they have built on so beautifully so it was great to have that and when we were thinking about a plenary speaker for this evening we could think of no one better than Terry McCarty who's been a close colleague of Nancy's for several decades now and she's the person that we knew that Nancy would most like to have and we were thrilled that she was available and willing to come and so we'd like to organize this is that Nancy herself will come up and do the formal introduction so thanks again for coming this evening and we're surely enjoy at the top thank you I found it first of all thank sandton Cathy hall who's somewhere here there she is Rachel Scott glow Rita Harvey who are the core group for making this forum happen this year and not only did all the hard work that entails but also did all this special stuff for me is it's pretty amazing and I've just been on cloud nine all day I also want to thank the usual core of gse colleagues and staff who also make this thing go including Charles who's at the video camera they are in Suzanne Oh who's been you know all along the way the administrative assistant and Zach who helps out with IT and many others whose names I won't be able to remember or list here and I also want to thank that San mentioned that my students so many students who have prepared and participated and come all this way to put together this amazing set of panels that I had the pleasure of hearing today and that have been recorded for my for my you know for all posterity for me thanks again to Cathy so thank you also my sisters some of you have met my sister's my sister-in-law my family my husband my daughter who just arrived my son my granddaughters who have come to celebrate with me in the vest so I'm really touched and honored by all this gratitude so they can be very grateful it's a wonderful honor to welcome and introduce streisand McCarty as our plenary speaker tonight professor McCartney has so many distinctions accomplishments publications it would truly be impossible to recount even a tenth of them right now here are a few just last October she gave a ii rnas that's the american educational research associations 2015 brown lecture in washington DC this is an annual invited public lecture commemorating the 1954 US Supreme Court Brown versus Board of Education decision and it's an invited lecture given by a distinguished scholar notable for producing significant research related to equality and education in Terry's case her phenomenal scholarship and leadership in Native American education and language revitalisation professor McCartney has devoted her career to working collaboratively with Navajo and other Native American educators and she also writes up this work beautifully to two books I can name their you know representative of this or her 2002 a place to be Navajo and her 2013 language planning and policy Native America two books that are groundbreaking paradigm-shifting anything you can think of they're just been beautifully written she's an indefatigable writer and advocate often in collaboration with her indigenous colleagues she has published more than 100 refereed journal articles and book chapters she's authored and edited more than 15 volumes she's the the topics of our Native American indigenous language and literacy indigenous language revitalisation indigenous education and she's still going strong what's more I can personally attest for many years of collaborating with Terry that she is an absolutely meticulous author and editor every word every phrase every sentence every citation every quotation is carefully thought through checked and rechecked and any type again the result is wonderfully purry treatable and invariably insightful illuminating and instructive writing another for accomplishments distinctions we enlist beside her name is her co directorship from nineteen eighty nine two thousand four of the American Indian languages Development Institute along with Ophelia Cepeda that Institute has had tremendous impact not only on indigenous educators and indigenous language development but also on national policy relating to American Indian languages as professor at the University Arizona Arizona State and now UCLA terry has mentored countless students served as department head interim dean she served in innumerable leadership roles in both AE RA and the American Anthropological Association especially the council on american council on anthropology and education she served as the editor of the anthropology education quarterly she was president of the council and much much more Terry and I go back a long way I first met her through her 1984 dissertation many of you have had that experience of meeting someone for the first time through their writings and just feeling like you know the person based on on that writing and that happened with me with Darren McCarty's dissertation on bilingual education at rough Rock I was just designing my my new course on bilingual education here at Penn and looking for ethnographic studies of which there were exceedingly few in those days and hers was one of the ones I found which by the way it was very hard to retrieve this was you know before the days of Internet access email and all those things but i think i got it eventually through interlibrary loan and which is still wrong oh and I tried to track her down but at that time she was working as a education specialist in the Indian education because their arizona department of education as I learned later building on her earlier work as curriculum coordinator and specialist at the Navajo Nation rough Rock School so I I never did find her at that time a little dreamed that we would need a few years later and go on to become close colleagues and collaborators we have worked together as co-authors co-editors contributors co-organizers co-presenters making visits to each other schools to speak in each other's classes nominating and recommending each other for various awards and responsibilities emailing each other notes of encouragement and admonishments to not work so hard terry is currently professor of Education and nellore chair and education and anthropology at UCLA the cherish inherited from its first incumbent was with us here tonight our own thread Erickson there's another forum connection I want to tell you about and that will be helpful I'll finish with that Terry under Navajo colleague Galena dick where saturday evening plenary speaker conversation lists at the very first forum that I was responsible for convening in two thousand inviting them reflected several of my goals over the years in choosing speakers to infuse issues of language and multilingualism to include perspectives from Native American and indigenous scholars and to model the vision of research and practice as reciprocally and integrally connected Terry's co-presenter delena dick Galena cells dick now deceased was a native of Rafah a bilingual teacher and at that time director of the rough Rock Community Schools pre-k through 12 bilingual bicultural program Galena and Terry co-authored several articles on Navajo language Newell and on their experiences at rough rock and one that I got to know well was a chocolate they contributed to my book indigenous literacies in the Americas and I remember very clearly reading the first time in there the Lena tells very eloquently of being assigned in fourth grade when she had just moved to a public school after a public school from her boarding school in Chinle Arizona and she was assigned in that public school to write a composition about quote the first time you made a cake and of the she writes in this essay of the cultural assumptions and conflicts that the seemingly simple task highlighted for her Terry and Alina traversed many apps episodes in the life of the ref community school of Navajo renewal and our conversation that night was intended to reflect on that we use a recurring forum saturday evening format that night the same format we are using tomorrow night here the informal retrospective conversation and we have brainstorms questions such as what has been the role of ethnographic research in Navajo or Native American education in what ways is this role changing and why what kinds of relationships have evolved between researchers and practitioners working in Navajo for Native American education who are the researchers who are the practitioners but what stands out most in my memory of that evening and maybe some of you were there as clearly as if it were yesterday and as a symbol of what is so special about the forum for me is that at one point someone in the audience asked a question I no longer remember what the question was what I do remember is that Terry turned to Galena to provide the answer and she waited while Galena thought we all waited in what became an unusually prolonged silence what I loved was the waiting the silence the respect for a way of speaking and being that permeated steigler auditorium night no one coughed no one tried to speak no one even seemed uncomfortable and after a while delena answered in a profoundly thoughtful way that experience has stayed with me over the years as a testimony to the deep respect and sensitivity that are one of the signatures of this that's not a free form so on that note that please do i need welcoming that's well good evening and Nancy what can I say those words are my precious to me and much more than his deserved and I I just thank you for all of thoughtfulness of that very kind and generous introduction and I want to thank all of you for coming out for staying staying or coming out or whatever it was tonight this is that this is the first time I think that I've ever given a talk after a wine and cheese reception so I hope you're all feeling really happy what an amazing what an amazing day with an amazing advances and I just I just did something wrong here in the back sorry so I too want to extend my deep appreciation to Cathy hall and Stanton Northup for inviting me to this year's forum and Sarita Harvey and Rachel scurlock I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that right thank you okay this been great as the coordinators and david hunt who's been my wonderful GSE guide David are you out there there he is yes he's been making sure I show up where I'm supposed to be and I'm not where I'm not supposed to be and and Charles and Dominic who have had my technology back here which is very very reassuring it's a profound honor to be at this forum of its deep history in ethnographic traditions guided by a commitment versity and social justice and to be here this year in particular as we honor our dear colleague and friend professor Nancy Hornberger who has lived just that kind of ethnographic life Thank You Nancy for all you've given all of us multimodal literacies and monolingual policies lessons by and for we who imagine alternative schools well all of us familiar with Nancy horn burgers work will recognize immediately the Hornburg area influences on this title I've been practicing that adjective the very first words of course invoke Nancy's well-known continua by literacy continua continued of intersecting modalities and multi literacies oral to written micro to macro and multilingual to monolingual context accepted it to productive and l1 to l2 and beyond connections and continuities minorities to majorities content simultaneous two successive exposure and learning two or more languages similar too dissimilar language structures convergent to divergent scripts and of course wrapped around all of this the power relations that infuse literacy and by literacy in any context this complexity and multiplicity stands in contrast to many policy regimes around the world particularly in the United States a contrast that has been taken up in Nancy's and others work including the mentor of mentors and I think Nancy's mentor Dale Himes who described the us's multilingualism as quote terra incognita in terms of language policy with regard to knowledge of itself in terms of language times room the United States remains an underdeveloped country that's going to be a theme of my talk but this is the ideological paradox of the multimodal language practices that are bound around the world and the monolingual lyst language policies that seek to quiet and erase them this is a paradox that nancy has I think in all of all of her work and that paradox two anchors my talk I'm going to look specifically tonight at past and current language education policies in the US and the enduring culture of poverty logic that characterizes them including recent quote word gap regimes that those logics have spun I position this work in the ethnography of language policy and extension of gumpert and himes ethnography of communication that has its origins in a 1988 study published by Nancy on my little education and koechlin language maintenance in Highland Peru is that the speaker or is that okay it sounds kind of funny up here so a driving question in this work is how language humankind's commonplace meaning making tool gets constructed as a resource or a liability and children's schooling so the questions what counts is language and literacy in school whose languages and literacies count by what measures and who gets to measure education policies reflect and produce these constructions this includes explicit de jure policies such as a no child left behind act in the United States and its air the newly authorized every student succeeds after SF but equally important and what and ethnographic lens brings into sharp focus our implicit de facto language policies the complex social practices ideologies and attitudes that regulate people's language choices and behaviors and pervasive everyday ways so let me give an example of this for my own work consider the Navajo speaking child who after a few months in an English preschool begins to respond to her parents Navajo initiative initiations in English the parents reinitiate in Navajo a child responds in English out of love and concern for her child the bilingual parents switch to English I'm sure many of you in this room have observed this this is the points as Lily on fillmore when parents come face to face with a pivotal factor in intergenerational language transmission a factor that is salient only when the home language is a non dominant or minorities one and that's linguistic inequality these intimate family language choices exemplify unofficial implicit language policy making and this policy making shapes children's life trajectories in profound ways how they'll identify with their heritage Community the kinds of learning resources available to them and that in that that community and whether heritage we'll be sustained or lost in future generations but as nancy horn work and parm burgers work and peru shows so powerfully implicit policymaking like this can only be understood in the context of the wider social political and economic forces that structure language hierarchies so how is it that by the tender age of four a bilingual preschooler internalizes the societal message that one language is privileged over another and so the ethnography of language policy asks how to implicit and explicit education policies structure linguistic inequality and how is linguistic and equality organized along lines of race social class gender ability and other axes of social difference to address these questions I'm going to develop three themes in the next 40 or so minutes first theme policy logics how do official policy shape ways of thinking about language learners language problems and solutions and with what material consequences second language practices what do we know from ethnographic research about diverse non-dominant children's communicative repertoires and their home and community linguistic ecologists and how is this research square with official policy logics and third policy interventions how can we use this ethnographic knowledge to inform language asian policies that promote diversity equity and justice so let me turn to the first theme and to illuminate that theme i'm going to use it as an example 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the United States ESEA now essa at 1061 pages still the most massive federal intervention in education in this nation's history and here I'm going to draw on the work of Sanders Stein in the this her wonderful treatment of ESEA policy development published in 2004 where she looks at it in a criminal critical fashion as a socio-cultural process what Bradley Levinson Margaret sutten called policymaking Esther practice of power so Stein argues that the narrative elements of any policy the scenarios and argumentation upon which a policy is based construct logics about those the policy is designed to influence the part of the behaviors that the policy seeks to regulate and those policy areas them constitute taken for granted ways of imagining education problems and solutions they are self reinforcing that is they close off other ways of thinking about those quote problems and solutions in so doing the policies construct kinds of subjects what James G calls kinds of people but policy narratives don't just write themselves they don't spring up from something outside of human control their socially constructed of course in particular historical context so in a particular historical moment in United States the mid 1960s when the Johnson administration's launched its war on poverty and in a scholarly realm culture of poverty explanations for economic education disparities reign supreme the cover on the front is from a book that grew out of a 1964 conference called compensatory education for cultural deprivation and this was really the reigning logic in a Kadeem to account for education disparities as just one example in the hundreds that she examines Stein provides this excerpt from influential that are written by a man by the name of John Silver who was then the chair of the philosophy department at the University of Texas and he sent this letter to his state senator the powerful Democrat some of you will remember who helped push through the ESEA Ralph Yarborough so the letter which Yarborough read on the floor of Congress said in part the inability of the desperately poor profit from educational and economic opportunities derives from the fact that they're partially by lack of verbal stimulation that is the normal part of the childhood experiences in middle-class homes remember this I'm going to come back to it but silver went on then to racial eyes his sense of normalcy claiming that children born into Negro families and families whose native language is not English are not sufficiently stimulated verbally to compete successfully in the public schools whose programs are designed for english-speaking children this is just amazing evidence I think of the ideologies that were rampant at the time but as I'm going to discuss that are still rampant in our in public and policy spears so over and over again Stein shows students are described as deprived and mothers is deficient and their communities is pathological scholars and politicians colluded she says in seeing culture as a foundation of poverty with government intervention through the transformation of the policy subjects moms and children as a solution just as important though is what is not said in this policy narrative and that is of course the racial izing ikan economic and political forces that create poverty in the first place intertwined discourses of a culture of poverty and a reified quote Standard English have percolated through every ensuing ESEA reauthorization the original bilingual education act which was a 1968 amendment to the ESEA targeted children characterizes poor and educationally disadvantaged by their home language and as our beloved late colleague Richard Greece was quick to point out the VA the VA was never about developing any language other than English it was not about developing genuine bilingualism and has since as we know been renamed the English language acquisition language enhancement and academic achievement act under nclb the purging of the word bilingual in the ESEA has not changed new SF the current policy narrative bonds race poverty language deficit and immigration status as illustrated by this policy excerpt and although SF has replaced the LEP limited English Proficient label with the term English Learner the label English Learner still emphasizes what students lack not what they know and as the working group on EOL policy led by Kenji acuta and Robert link wanti points out this is the working group associated with the esso they say that essa remains silent in addressing the value of bilingualism and by literacy not only for English learners but also for language majority students so it's definitely a lopsided continuum well ESEA programs have undoubtedly had unquestionably had positive education benefits for underserved students but we have yet to shake the yoke of the culture of poverty from US policy discourse as in 1965 the Academy continues to be complicit in this for example 2010 issue of the annals of the American Academy of political and social science one of the most prestigious scholarly organizations in the world published a special issue entitled reconsidering culture and poverty and that issue received with full congressional briefing and a New York Times right up head culture of poverty makes a comeback the article opened with this resurrected 1952 photograph of an african-american youth appearing to dart between deteriorating inner city housing in a debris strewn alley while two small children sort through trash nearby now after decades of silence the caption reads scholars are conceding that culture and persistent poverty are meshed so what are the material consequences of these policy logics the naturalized ways of seeing and not seeing social problems and solutions when one effect as the ll working group points out has been to preclude the cultivation of genuine bilingualism multilingualism and multiculturalism as a national policy goal why not have that as a national policy goal but that flips the whole logic on its head and this disadvantage is non dominant as well as dominant language learners but non dominant learners are are doubly disadvantaged by the English standardized tests used to measure which languages and literacies count and the curricula remedies prescribed for test under performance so we are now in an era of word gap logic are you familiar with this ok so the idea behind this logic is that the measure of children's language development is the number of dominant English and I say Donna English that some people use English but dominant English words because there's a power to mention there they can get delighted when we use that word standard that children bring to school so the original site study that cited in support of the word gap logic was published in nineteen ninety five by two psychologists Betty heart and Todd grizzly it was entitled meaningful differences in the everyday experience of young children so what they did bang a team of researchers at six years doing 11 our word counts in the homes of 42 families of different social classes in Kansas and as you see in this statement it opens their book the study which has been replicated multiple times is described as as scientifically based and which also informs a host of current family literacy intervention programs is explicitly based on a culture of poverty logic so according to these researchers I'm quoting now that they revealed that the most important aspect of children's language experience is its amount some parents said more than 3,000 words to their children and an average hour together they say another said fewer than 300 words so children from poor immigrants and working-class families and our school behind their white middle-class appears when you add all of this up by some 30 million words that's the claim they make hence we have projects now like the 30 million work project so let's go back to that letter by professor john silver red and eighteen sixty five on the floor of the US Congress about the reason the alleged reason for the inability of the desperate for profit from educational and economic opportunities and we see a parallel in 1995 that goes on to present present day logics behind these these programs so let's think about this for a minute I consulted the Oxford Dictionary and Oxford is supposedly the authority on the English language and the Oxford Dictionary experts say there's no sensible answer to the question of how many words there are in the English language no sensible answer in fact the most recent Oxford English Dictionary records a total of 171 476 English words in current use and 40 7156 obsolete English words about a quarter million up about a quarter million English words altogether so how do we get from 250,000 even if somehow we fed it always 250,000 the kids from birth to age 32 30 million by the time they get to preschool and then there's the problem of how the words are counted this dog an hour of herb my dog Layla is naughty she's really naughty that creditor won't won't quit doggin me one word or two whose words and what language count and by what measure the silence count as a cultural pattern way of knowing so aside with the methodological problems this research it's over culture of poverty logic has enormous terial effects constructing for children Joan of color and their families as failed and dysfunctional while shielding from scrutiny the racial social class and power differentials that enable this kind of thinking as and actually have something I'll just take this up here thanks let me go back on that sentence but the point is is that these these launches shield from scrutiny the racial social class and power differentials that enable this kind of research can be taken seriously replicated and be used as quote scientific evidence to inform policy and social quote reforms through the remedy of reductive workout regimes and English standardized testing this logic reproduces the very disparities it calls into question and for more on this if you're interested in maybe some of you have seen us the Journal of linguistic anthropology published a special forum on what they call the language gap in the March 2015 issue of em journal so let me turn now to the second part the second theme what does the ethnography of language policy teach about the language practices and the home language environments of culturally diverse non-dominant learners well there's a history here too that's important and that parallels the lifespan of the ESEA it was fall 1965 Courtney Kasdan wrote when the first summer Head Start was just over and a small group of anthropologist linguist psychologists and sociologists were called together in New York by Edmund Gordon by the way he was then working with head start our task she said was to suggest priorities to be to the US Office of Education for research on children's language and its relation to school success John Gilbert's and Dell Hines had just introduced the ethnography of communication and a special issue of American anthropologist where they called for ethnographic studies of communication and the patterned complexity of children's everyday languages out of this historic moment came a relentless empirical assault on the culture of poverty ethnographies that showed Latino and african-american students grammatically and pragmatically sophisticated language mixing and what Perry Gilmore called their sub rosa literacies and the complex culturally distinctive rules regulating talk and diverse families and communities and professor Erickson of course is part of some of this seminal work susan phillips called these practices the invisible culture surely Bryce Heath called them ways with words through the voices of parents and children P throat 30 years later we see how their uses structures styles and models of language move in synchrony with their values surrounding work and play well we're in a different historical moment now yet the deficit logic persists as do the enduring academic disparities that logic spawns I spent time developing this history precisely to show the tenacity of this logic it infuses a 20-hour 21st century policy of English only common core and word gap so let's look at this now against contemporary ethnographic research on children's language practices in the 1990s scholars began identifying and documenting what they called language brokering language practices were by young immigrant children broker English for non-english speaking family members and amperes more recently scholars like Marjorie Oriana picture here of Phil Garcia danny martinez and others including others at this forum have taken this work up and the important thing here is that this language brokering is not just translation word-for-word translation these young people have to adjust vocabulary tone nonverbal cues as they mediate between speakers of different languages social classes ethnicities and life experiences orianna calls this complex knowledge and skills transcultural repositioning for example 10 year old Estella a language broker in Laureano study was considered to be by her mother to be the right hand of the family as Oriana relates a still used her knowledge of English to make an answer phone calls scheduled appointments sort and decipher the Daily Mail fill out forms apply for credit help her younger sister with homework and read stories and translation to her younger siblings ethnographic research by Oriana Ophelia Garcia and lastly Bartlett by Kendall King Bessie rhymes Stanton wertham and others on immigrant and trans migrant children and that of indigenous scholars like Sheila Nicholas tiffany lea mary hermes and ananda moran and my own research on indigenous youth shows these young people's competence in trans languaging dynamic language practices in which young people draw multiple linguistic and sociolinguistic resources that comprise their communicative repertory earlier today in a session on horn burgers contributions to indigenous language revitalization sami scott scholar hannah with a co Stokowski referred to these practices as language transiting as Betsy rhymes shows in a study of two-year epigraphic study of second language learners in an english-only classroom these learners have control of the English language far beyond the words on Phonics cards she says playing with a homonym 'ok character of words and linking written words two worlds outside the text and those worlds include rich multilingual urban environments that students pass through everyday to and from school like these from orianna's research in los angeles work at my own ethnographic research with Mary Eunice Romero little an affiliate of paida and in another national study directed by Brian brave boy has investigated the language practices of indigenous youth and as we know so well from Nancy's work Kendall King's work and that of others the situation in indigenous communities is distinct due to the fact of language endangerment and following long centuries of linguistic and cultural and political oppression so in this research that we are done with dr. Cepeda and Romero lil we've had the privilege of interviewing scores of indigenous youth who are contesting at history and with apologies for necessary brevity i want to share just a few representative vignettes from this research it was Norma Valenzuela an 18-year old high school student and softball star and a large urban high school when we interviewed her in 2005 and by the way all the names are pseudonyms and these are not the actual photographs because her photographs that we selected in consultation with people at the site including some of the youth that seemed to capture sort of the character or an essence of these young people so North great-grandparents were survivors of a diaspora of indigenous people from Mexico at the turn of the 20th century and Nora called it as a child or grandmother spoke the indigenous language to us almost all the time every day her teachers by the way told us that no one speaks the indigenous language her father and mother her father her father's family spoke Spanish nor enter school bilingual in spanish and indigenous language i really didn't understand a lot of English my entered school she said but by the time we met her she moved fluidly between spanish and english that were by then her primary language and she described her own family language policy this way to my brothers i used spanish but my youngest brother he doesn't understand much Spanish so I speak English with him and with my mom and grandmother that would be the indigenous language when we interviewed Samuel in 2005 he was preparing to celebrate his 17th birthday of Navajo Apache Hopi and European descent sounding was a tall self-possessed young man an A student with an easy smile and a quick intellect who aspired to become a medical doctor and returned to the Navajo Nation to treat diabetes he considered himself fluent in Navajo and Apache and to know in his words some Hopi and a little French spending time with his grandmother who was a retired schoolteacher Samuel learned to read and write Navajo using her Navajo language Bible his grandmother also taught him to read and write her native language Apache in high school sandal began studying French and he said I caught on real quick kind of explaining his own words what linguists call metalinguistic awareness when I go to an English class I compare the difference in reading and writing and how Navajo is so descriptive in much the same way as Nora trans language or transitive at home Samuel described strands languaging with peers with my friends who don't speak English I incorporate more Navajo and with my friends who speak primarily English I incorporate less Navajo for Samuel knowing multiple languages is very important he said because I get the best of both worlds I want to become a doctor he said to do that I need to know how to communicate with patients in Navajo in English and finally there was desi Wilson a seventh grader who had recently graduated from an elementary Navajo immersion program and she introduced herself as Navajo african-american and chrome English growing up in a reservation town about 80 miles distant from the city where she was attending school they see were called a Navajo teacher who encouraged her singing talent in Navajo launching her on a career of song and dance competitions that she was so involved in that she was teaching Navajo to her younger sister who was scheduled to enroll in the Navajo immersion program and she said I bought her little baby books and I read them to her so that way she'll know some Navajo when she goes to school it's cool for us to learn Navajo because not a lot of kids that are Navajo get a chance to learn these are just a few examples but they are representative of what our ethnic graphic research reveals word gap these young people have a lot to teach us about depth and researchers understandings and the flawed logic behind monolingual assessments of what in shoes languages and letters count as nancy Hornberger and david Cassell's johnson right this kind of ethnographic monitoring to use Johannes words helps uncover the voices that might otherwise be silenced or obscurity and in these people's actions in their words we glimpse the dynamic multi-layered multilingual multicultural worlds that they transit every day from home to school across geographic and cultural space taking a heritage language practices and loyalties with them a new language practices and varieties or communicative rapper tours and they attest to the tremendous linguistic cognitive and trans cultural strengths young people bring to school and was fourth of it when education policies miss recognized and failed nurture those drinks I come now to the final part of my talk how can we use this knowledge gleaned over generations of ethnographic labor to promote education policies based on the logics on inclusion diversity and justice I believe there are at least two strategies that we can employ and here I come back to a key or porn berberian insight the coupling of top-down and bottom-up language planning and policy making so from the top down the new essa does leave some official policy openings there's more flexibility and measures of achievement and who does the measuring although it's not at all clear that allowing States greater control which is what the policy does will serve non-dominant students well especially in language restriction estate and their numbers are growing there's also some distancing from previous gold standard randomized clinical trials in education research toward education improvements that our quote evidence-based and while the evidence deemed strong quote unquote is still the randomized clinical trial so-called promising evidence could include qualitative and perhaps even ethnographic research and in response to decades of indigenous activism title six of essa allows for the possibility of indigenous language revitalisation programmes provide other conditions of the law are met I Ichi and Don in English as Fred Erickson is noted pre-existing structure does not simply constrained there is he said using highly technical scientific language wiggle room like Fred Nancy and I suspect all of us gathered here tonight I believe we must continue to chip away at damaging top-down policies even as we work from the bottom up to transform was more directly in our grasp in an issue of anthropology and education quarter that published nearly 30 years ago Fred Erickson rogue peb it's not acceptable to simply wait for a revolution in the general society our task is not only to analyze the structural conditions by which inequity is reproduced but to search out every possible site in which the struggle for progressive transformation you can take place end quote and thank you for that Fred still obviously still site that that important insight Nancy Hornberger has called these possible sites ideological and implementational spaces in our work and my own experience those spaces can be leveraged when university-based researchers collaborate with the policy implementers local education practitioners again and with apologies for necessary Brody I offer three illustrative examples from this work in the content and context as diverse as the School District of Philadelphia and professional indigenous professional development programs and the Andes and in South Africa nancy Hornberger and Hornberger and her former student David Cassell's Johnson examined comparatively and ethnographically the ways in which educators reshape remedial constructions of indigenous and immigrant language learners bringing students diverse linguistic and cultural Heritage's directly into instruction even if those Heritage's are not those of the teachers an explicit language and culture resource policy orientation quoting Richard supports students and teachers in this work they say enabling students to maintain proficiency in their home languages this is not of course a seamless uncomplicated uncontested process not all educators or parents or community members hold ideologies of additive bilingualism but of relevance to the present discussion what this comparative at the graphic court work reveals is the power of individual education practitioners and collectives can wheel in such ideologically contested space opening up new possibilities for revitalizing indigenous languages and for cultivating multilingualism and schools Louis mole and his colleagues Mary Carol combs and Roman Gonzalez have studied bilingual children's language news he's been structured English immersion classrooms in English only Tucson Arizona and in that work they show that teachers of Mexican immigrant students are creating what they call a third space where students language and culture are respected and where the teacher trusts that students will engage solidly and academic activities when given the opportunity and a final example comes from my own ethnographic work in the two national studies that I just mentioned and I'm highlight here data from one school in these studies rotated oral bridget beauty school in spanish and navajo it's a k5 public magnet school located in flagstaff arizona that aims to build multilingual multicultural competence among all of its 450 students and to do this the school offers a unique strong Jewish Dual Language Program and a Navajo language immersion program for kids that are learning alcohol as a second language and these two programs grew out of the express desires of Mexican American Native American and Anglo parents seeking a multilingual multicultural alternative to Arizona's otherwise English only school in Puente students are viewed and one educators words known as problems to be solved but as an educational elite whose heritage languages and cultures constitute a heart and soul of the school and in its 14 years of operation puente de Ojo has not feared from that anchoring philosophy an explicit antidote to culture of poverty gap logic while consistently performing among the top schools in the district these are just a few examples from a wide-ranging literature taken together this ethnographic work reveals clear alternatives to gap logic illuminating the ways of seeing language learners through what Richard briefs is called a resource orientation and through practitioner grounded policymaking and harnessing those resources despite the damaging logics of enduring culture of poverty discourses and the gap regimes they spawned the ethnography of language policy points us toward the end of the diggable promise of human agency and cracking open spaces of hope and possibility and here i return to the words of nancy Hornberger my more convinced than ever she says that we who imagine multilingual schools have a long time long-term advantage and she reflects on this in fulfilling garcia atolls book called imagining multilingual schools threatened fear and restriction can never prevail in the grand scheme of things she insists but a profuse and rich diversity of ways of speaking meaning thinking valuing and being will for we who like Nancy Hornberger imagine multilingual schools this guiding logic steers us away from the gap metaphor toward policies aimed at constructing a multi-path multilingual multicultural British a logic that embraces critique and social transformation and that promotes diverse ways of learning teaching and knowing for all okay thank you very much you're not all this lip from being here for 12 hours or so today someone had someone have a hand up back there I just had a question okay can your work with the Navajo communities do you receive a pushback or support from school districts or other government institutions pushback I think pushback is always there in this kind of work wherever we do it you know Navajo Native American communities like all communities are not monolithic entities with where everybody has the same idea about how things should be done and parents want their kids to do well on those darn discriminatory tests they want their kids to be successful in school so I would say that push back it's certainly yes from from the top down policies I remember teachers who were in a school that was under mandated it's called school correction status under NCLB and they were required to implement the scripted curriculum and these were veteran teachers who were extremely skilled and they were basically doing word calling they were playing served silence says we're calling where you trip the student if they don't follow that the script and they speak up too soon or say a word that they're not supposed to say before you ask them for it and the teachers told me no Terry we're just doing this it's a can get the kids scores up on the test and then they don't you know that they called it this is not real teaching and they said once we get the kids scores up we can go back and do real teaching so I think there yes I mean that's absolutely right there's pushback coming from a lot of different sources some of it within communities and and a lot of it coming from the top down and and these are those those those moments are those times when you look for those openings to kind of push through that kind of damaging logic and damaging pedagogy to try to find your way through to something that is more appropriate and honors what these teachers and the students bring to school I don't know if I an totally answered your question it's a really good question it's got a lot of complexity built into it thank you for that yes hi I have been involved I'm from Rhode Island and I've been involved in an initiative to change language education and to implement more dual language programs statewide I don't know if you're familiar what's happening in Utah for example they've implemented 100 and something dual language programs we're just wondering what your viewers of these initiatives and if you have any advice to us on how we can keep all of your research in mind as we try to roll out this type of I ok well the key to the research that I've talked about and certainly Nancy hard burgers work is is working with local communities and working with working with local practitioners and so I really think that bottom-up approach these aren't things that one can give a general recipe for right but that is to me that's a rule of thumb and so I think the extent that you could stay very close close to that and are you also doing research and at those contacts I think it brings together it's a it's a it's an opening it's an opening but it's a little bit of a risky opening by virtue of where it where it's coming from right so we have to be constantly vigilant about that you know there are sort of safe places for bilingualism in this country in other places without now in there are dangerous places and we can just look at the difference between foreign language education how that's been treated in this country we spend billions of dollars drumming languages out of some kids that bring those languages to school and we spend billions of dollars teaching those same languages to other people's kids poorly in high school foreign language program so I mean just being very cautious of that and being rooted in a community would be what I would just be advice I would give just as you started on that I know that you are so yeah yes yeah whether ango i am from the National University of Mexico in the 2000s I did research among them approaches indigenous groups in Chile under the dictator be no Chet the Mapuche s and the map rele'w lungu was very much neglected and it was idea that it has to disappear but it was through the textile workers the woman's working together that when President Lagos came to power the textile workers started to work and develop gatherings and then the mobile logo started to return unto the pointer today they have bilingual schools in greenway and in telugu like anna spaces of resistance informal spaces or resistance were created and later became official how you found something similar in the communities here well I think I'm not not exactly like that story that you met you tell but in the 1960s as this ESEA policymaking was going on that was there was also of course the civil rights movement was going on and in in Indian country Native American communities there was a very strong kind of resurgence and development of this self-determination movement where in the school that Nancy mentioned that i worked at the rough rock it was called a rough rock demonstration school was the firsts the first Native American community in contemporary times to take control of the local school and that that sort of started a whole path of this self-determination movement of course it's gotten caught up with all of these policies now the schools are is there they're very contested tricky places to try to do something indigenous something different no but so I think that that's um you know that movement that self-determination movement which is still I think going strong and schools have been a prime place for that for better or for worse schools are a place where children spend a good portion of their time and to the extent that those schools for indigenous children can be indigenous I think that's you know that's a very positive thing but just going back to Nancy's continuum that Phil is a little bit unbalanced because a lot of indigenous kids of course aren't able to attend aren't living in those areas where those schools are common or or where they have opportunity and they're in public schools where they make you know be just a few Native American kids so we still have to work on the dominant sector as well to get to develop through appreciation for an indigenous kind of perspective ways of knowing and curriculum so that might be a parallel sure other people here in the audience might have other white suggestions about that but thank you for sharing that um I have a question about so I think what you said was really very true about these ideologies about the culture of poverty and even bilingualism or multilingualism Mike multilingualism as a liability almost for students in their educational pursuits and I'm curious a little bit about you've talked about what we as educators can do but also to support parents especially parents who might have the idea that bilingualism of multilingualism is a potential I guess threat to my child's development what suggestions or thoughts you have so that we can help partner with parents and who are really instrumental in their children's development and education to put aside those ideas and those thoughts that are kind of throwing them through all of these different sound channels yeah well of course there's a just a huge international literature showing the benefits of the cognitive and academic benefits of buying multilingualism Kendall King has done some really nice work on this that's designed specifically to for families and prepares since it's readable it's not in our usual scholarly jargon and I don't know if you're familiar with Kendall king's work but on that but yes I would share some of that sometimes you know it just helps to bring in someone from the outside to kind of validate what you're your own knowledge you're on your own professional knowledge and expertise and and and research and so I don't know maybe Kendall king could come in and talk to your parents but or something you know what I'm saying something like that just to have through a fresh perspective but the research is just so clear on the benefits of this of well done bilingual education program so I think it's talking with parents it's sharing some of that work and also if there are other schools that are doing this kind of work if you can bring in people from those schools like the point 8 emotional example those people from other schools go to that school to see what they're doing the kids are scoring well at the top on this on these English standardized tests and yet they're being educated in a language that's not their first language so so bringing in other experts like yourself from other places to talk with parents or getting parents to go visit that kind of thing I think that can be helpful to we really have to work hard at sharing our stories and our daily lines make that sometimes just very very difficult but they're the stories are out there and I think stories are some of the best ways to to teach right to hear from other people that are doing something like that professor McCarty one more time I just would like to remind you that tomorrow evening at six thirty we'll be having a special event it will be the evening less formal forum that Nancy and phrasal 615 so at this event not only what we have conversations about the past of the forum its history when it's accomplished and the future where we would all like to see it go but we'll also have multimodal sorts of events that Nancy will stay in Philippi and we will have a film with images of Terry and Fred and Nancy and others please do come for that special event tomorrow evening and before we close you
