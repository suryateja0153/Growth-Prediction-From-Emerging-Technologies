 .  Kelly: SO WE CAN CALL TO ORDER THE OCTOBER 12th, 2016 MEETING OF THE PORTLAND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS. CALL THE ROLL, PLEASE. [ ROLL CALL ]  Kelly: OKAY. NEXT ON THE AGENDA IS COMMISSIONER REPORTS. COMMISSIONER CRUZ, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO START OVER ON MY RIGHT.  Cruz: SURE. JUST A COUPLE OF SORT OF PDC-RELATED MEETINGS. ON SEPTEMBER 20th I ATTENDED THE ECO TRUST ROOTS OF THE RED EVENT, THE 20th ANNIVERSARY. ON OCTOBER 6th, I MET WITH THE DIRECTOR OF AUDIT SERVICES FOR THE CITY OF PORTLAND AND CHAIR KELLY TO FOLLOW UP ON OUR AUDIT LIAISON DUTIES. HAD SOME OTHER THINGS, BUT THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY RELATED TO THE PDC.  Kelly: THANK YOU.  Edlen: I ATTENDED THE OREGON HISTORICAL SOCIETY ANNUAL DINNER DEAL. THE DOERNBECHER FOUNDATION ANNUAL DINNER. ATTENDED THE CIRCUS PROJECT EVENT LAST NIGHT. WENT TO THE DETROIT BEST PRACTICES WITH KIMBERLY. ALSO ATTENDED THE ROOTS AT THE RED. ATTENDED THE PSU FOUNDATION EVENT, MET WITH NORTH FIELD HIGH SCHOOL AND ALSO, THE BULLET FOUNDATION AND MET WITH PAIR TODAY AND MOST HUMILIATING AT ALL, I SPENT SATURDAY AFTERNOON IN EUGENE.  Kelly: ME, TOO. DOES THAT HAVE TO BE ON THE RECORD?  SO I JUST HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH KIMBERLY MORELAND TO TALK ABOUT THE NORTHEAST PORTLAND INITIATIVE AND THE SPENDING OF $32 MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS. THEY HAVE HAD A WONDERFUL COMMUNITY LISTENING SESSION, ONE WAS ON OCTOBER 6th AND IT WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED AND LOTS OF GREAT FEEDBACK CAME OUT OF THAT. THEY HAVE ANOTHER ONE COMING UP ON THE 20th OF OCTOBER IF ANY OF YOU ARE AVAILABLE TO GO AND HOPEFULLY, THEY'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO COME TALK TO THIS BODY ABOUT THE WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING, BUT SO FAR, SO GOOD.  Kelly: COMMISSIONER MYERS.  Myers: JUST IN THE LAST MONTH ATTENDED SEVERAL GROUND BREAKINGS. WE HAVE SEVERAL MORE THIS WEEK THAT ARE COMING UP. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO REPORT.  Kelly: THANK YOU. LET'S SEE. I WAS AT THE ROOTS AT THE RED. I DID ATTEND THE NORTH-NORTHEAST COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE MEETING AND PLEASED TO REPORT THAT OUR NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND TORY CAMPBELL BOTH ACQUITTED THEMSELVES WELL IN THEIR PRESENTATIONS. I WAS PROUD OF THEM. LEARNED SOME THINGS I DIDN'T KNOW. IN FACT, THAT SLIDE THAT SHOWS THE ASSETS OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK SOMETIMES THE COMMISSION SHOULD SEE. IT WAS INFORMATIVE FOR ME. AND REALLY WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE KIMBERLY. I THOUGHT SHE DID MORE THAN I'VE SEEN A PDC DIRECTOR EVER DO IN ACKNOWLEDGING TO A COMMUNITY SOME OF OUR FAULTS IN A WAY THAT WAS I THINK WELL DONE. ATTENDED THE PSU STUDENT DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL EVENT FOR THE POST OFFICE. GOLLY, I WENT OUT TO A NEW ACADEMY IN PORTLAND TO TALK TO THEM. THEY'RE INTERESTED IN MAYBE GETTING FUNDING FROM PDC, THE WAY FINDING ACADEMY WITH COMMISSIONER CRUZ. I MET WITH THE  AUDITOR'S OFFICE, AND I THINK WE WOULD BOTH RECOMMEND THAT AS SOMETHING TO LEARN FROM THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE, SOME OF THE HISTORY THAT HAS GONE ON WITH PDC IN THE PAST. I FOUND IT INFORMATIVE AND ENLIGHTENING SO I THINK THAT'S MAYBE SOMETHING WE COULD EVEN DO WHEN WE HAVE NEW COMMISSIONERS AS PART OF THEIR ORIENTATION.  YEAH. GREAT.  Kelly: IT WAS VERY INTERESTING SO WITH THAT I WILL HAND IT OVER TO OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR.  Branam: WELL, GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR KELLY, COMMISSIONERS. IT'S BEEN A VERY BUSY MONTH SO LOTS OF ACTIVITIES AND A COUPLE NEW STAFF THAT I WANT TO RECOGNIZE, AS WELL. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO TRAVEL PORTLAND WHO WAS CONVENING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES GIVEN THE NEW CONVENTION CENTER HOTEL, SO THERE WERE LOCAL TRAVEL AND EVENT PLANNERS AND HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CENTRAL CITY HERE. ALSO ATTENDED THE ECO TRUST ROOTS AT THE RED EVENT AND GOT TO SEE A VERY COOL VIRTUAL REALITY OF WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY REDO THE SPACE. GREAT RECOGNITION OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MERL AND THE CITY OF PORTLAND. ATTENDED THE BREAKFAST EVENT, GOT TO PARTICIPATE ON THAT PANEL OF PSU STUDENTS WHO DID AN EXCELLENT JOB  OF IMAGINING WHAT THE POST OFFICE SITE COULD BE AND USING THAT OPPORTUNITY SO THAT WAS A GREAT EVENT. ATTENDED THE ANNUAL LATINO NETWORKS EVENT, AS WELL. WENT TO SPEAK TO THE COLUMBIA CORRIDOR ASSOCIATION WITH THE HEAD OF BUSINESS OREGON, CHRIS HARDER. ALSO ENJOYED THE DETROIT BEST PRACTICES TRIP, PARTICULARLY LEARNING ABOUT SOME OF THE SMALL BUSINESS WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE, THE MOTOR CITY MATCH REALLY PAIRING SMALL BUSINESSES AND SOME OPEN SPACES SO THINGS TO LEARN FROM THAT, THEY HAVE HAD AN AMAZING LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IN THE CENTRAL CITY AND CONTINUE TO HAVE REALLY VIBRANT NEIGHBORHOODS, BUT ALSO, A NUMBER OF NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THERE'S JUST VERY  LITTLE DENSITY AND YOU SEE, YOU KNOW, CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGES. ATTENDED THE NORTH-NORTHEAST COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE, THE SLIDE THAT CHAIR KELLY REFERRED TO SHOWED THE WEALTH DISPARITY BETWEEN WHITE FAMILIES, WHITE HOUSEHOLDS, AFRICAN-AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS AND LATINO HOUSEHOLDS. NATIONALLY WHERE YOU HAVE ON AVERAGE THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD ASSETS FOR WHITE AMERICANS IS ABOUT $140,000, THE MEDIAN ASSETS FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES IN THE UNITED STATES IS AROUND $11,000 AND THE MEDIAN ASSETS FOR LATINO FAMILIES IS APPROXIMATELY $13,000. SO IT'S REALLY A STAGGERING DISPARITY THAT DWARFS INCOME INEQUALITY. SO THE FOCUS ON THE NORTH-NORTHEAST PLAN ON GENERATING WEALTH WAS SOMETHING THAT REALLY SEEMED LIKE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE PLAN TO THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO CAME AND PARTICIPATED, DO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME TO THE EVENT ON OCTOBER 20th AND THERE'S MORE INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LEARN MORE. I ATTENDED THE PHILIPPINE AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE EVENT LAST WEEK AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE SOME GREAT WORK THAT WAS PROFILED BY KGW AND CHANNEL 8. THEY HAD ON 42nd AVENUE, WHICH IS ONE OF THE NPIs, WITH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MICHAEL DEMARCO, THEY ACQUIRED A PROPERTY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD PROSPERITY DISTRICT USING THE COMMUNITY OPPORTUNITY FUND AND THEY WERE INTERVIEWED AND SO WE HAVE THAT ON OUR WEBSITE WE WILL, BUT IT'S REALLY A GREAT COMMUNITY-LED, PUBLIC BENEFIT ORIENTED APPROACH SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT. COMING UP, WE HAVE THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE DINNER ON THE 14th. I THINK THERE WILL BE A BIG FOCUS ON THE NEW PROJECT IN LENTS TOWN CENTER. I'LL BE SPEAKING AT THE NORTH BY NORTHEAST COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER RIBBON CUTTING, WHICH IS HAPPENING ON THE 21st. I WANT TO INVITE EVERYONE TO THE GROUND BREAKING ON THE 23rd AT LENTS, AS WELL, MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE 9101 PROJECT ON OUR WEBSITE. AND THAT IS ON 92nd AND FOSTER. SO OUR TEAM IS BUSY WORKING ON THAT AND WILL BE TIED TO THE LENTS FARMERS MARKET. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO COME TO. AND THEN FINALLY, I WILL BE ATTENDING ALONG WITH OTHER COMMISSIONERS THE PBA LEADERSHIP EVENING ON NOVEMBER 1st. IT'S A GREAT EVENT, IT'S ALWAYS VERY INFORMATIVE AND THIS YEAR, THEY WILL BE RECOGNIZING  FORMER PDC COMMISSIONER CHARLES RECEIVING THE WILLIAM S.NAITO OUTSTANDING SERVICE AWARD SO WE'LL BE GOING TO THAT. FINALLY WANT TO RECOGNIZE TOO TWO CITY EMPLOYEES. THE NEW DIRECTOR OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. BEFORE COMING TO PDC, SHE WAS THE H.R. DIRECTOR AT THE OREGON DEPARTMENT OF -- PRIOR TO THAT SHE MANAGED DIVERSE TALENT PIPELINE FOR KAISER PERMANENTE WHERE SHE CREATED ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE HOSPITALS OR THE MOST DIVERSE HOSPITAL IN OREGON AT EVERY LEVEL SO C. LEVEL THROUGH NURSES AND CONTINUES TO BE A VERY DIVERSE HOSPITAL IN OREGON. BEFORE THAT SHE WAS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PARTNERS IN DIVERSITY AND DIRECTOR OF PBA'S LEADERSHIP PORTLAND. BEFORE THAT SHE WAS THE ASSISTANT DEAN AT REED COLLEGE. SHE'S REALLY PROVIDED US WITH EXTRAORDINARILY BENEFICIAL ADVICE AND HAS INFORMED A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON. HAS AN MBA FROM WILLAMETTE UNIVERSITY AND MASTER'S IN EDUCATION FROM BALL STATE UNIVERSITY AND A BACHELOR'S IN SCIENCE FROM GRAND VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY. SHE'S A NATIVE OF MICHIGAN, BUT NOW CALLS PORTLAND HOME AND HAS FOR A WHILE. AND SHE RECENTLY PUBLISHED A BOOK THAT YOU CAN BUY ON AMAZON CALLED CHANGE THE WORK GAME, BUILDING AND SUSTAINING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE. SO ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK THAT OUT SO WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE HER HERE. AND JILLION  DETWILER, THE NEW INTERIM DEVELOPMENT MANAGER WHO COMES FROM THE MAYOR'S OFFICE, SHE'S BEEN A POLICY ADVISOR THERE FOR THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND HAS BEEN INFLUENTIAL ALSO IN SHAPING A LOT OF THE WORK WE HAVE DONE HELPING GUIDE OUR WORK IN LENTS AND ACROSS OUR URBAN RENEWAL AREAS. BEEN A REALLY TRUSTED ADVISOR SO WE ARE THRILLED TO HAVE HER IN THIS NEW ROLE. BEFORE THAT SHE WAS AT TRIMET FOR 13 YEARS WHERE SHE WENT FROM SENIOR PLANNER TO PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT MANAGER AND THEN EVENTUALLY DIRECTOR OF REAL ESTATE. SHE WORKED ON THE ORANGE LINE AND ACQUIRED 200 SOME PROPERTIES THROUGH THAT PROCESS SO VERY EXPERIENCED IN ACQUISITION AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. BEFORE THAT, SHE WAS LIAISON FOR PLANNING AND PERMITS WITH COMMISSIONER CHARLIE HALES FOR ALMOST EIGHT YEARS AND BEFORE THAT SHE WAS A NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPER AND A COMMUNITY ACTIVIST SO LOTS OF EXPERIENCE AND WE'RE REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE HER. SHE HAS A MASTER'S IN CITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING FROM U.N.C., A BACHELOR'S FROM LEWIS AND CLARK AND SHE PLAYS SOCCER FOR PORTLAND STRAIGHT SHOOTERS. SO DELIGHTED TO HAVE JILLIAN. SO THAT'S MY REPORT.  Kelly: THANK YOU. WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A STRAIGHT SHOOTER. [ LAUGHS ] SERIOUSLY, WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU. MOVING ON. WE HAVE APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES. AND, AS YOU CAN SEE, WE HAVE A LOT OF MINUTES. AND, IN FACT, IF THERE'S NO OBJECTION WE CAN VOTE FOR THEM ALL AT ONCE. SO UNLESS WE HAVE CORRECTIONS TO THE MINUTES?  I WOULD MOVE TO ACCEPT.  SECOND.  Kelly: WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR OF THE MINUTES, APPROVING THE MINUTES FOR JUNE 8th, 21st, AUGUST 8th, 17th, AND SEPTEMBER 14th AND YES, I DID READ THEM ALL. SIGNIFY BY SAYING AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] AYES HAVE IT, MOTION CARRIES. WE HAVE ONE INDIVIDUAL FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. DAVID, WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME UP? DAVID HAS BEEN BEFORE US BEFORE TALKING ABOUT  THE PARKING GARAGE. I THINK HE WANTS TO TALK TO US ABOUT SEISMIC  ISSUES TODAY; IS THAT RIGHT?  THAT'S CORRECT. I'M  DAVID, WE'VE BEEN A TENANT IN THAT BUILDING FOR OVER 32 YEARS. I PROVIDED SOME HANDOUTS THAT WILL BE INFORMATIVE. WE'RE TRYING TO INTERACT WITH PBOT AND THE PORTLAND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION REGARDING THIS PROPERTY SINCE WE'RE GOING TO BE EVICTED AND IF WE'RE GOING TO BE EVICTED WE MIGHT AS WELL DO THIS RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. THE PROBLEM WITH THE PROPERTY IS THAT WHEN THEY BUILT IT AND YOU CAN SEE ON PAGE TEN THEY BUILT THE PILLARS, I THINK I DESCRIBED THIS BEFORE, BUT I HAVE PICTURES THIS TIME. THEY BUILT THE PILLARS, THEY DROPPED THE BEAMS IN AND THEY DIDN'T ATTACH THEM TO THE PILLARS. THEY'RE  BALANCED. THESE LITTLE HOLES THAT  IN 1978 OR NINE WAS A VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO BUILD BUT GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW NOW ABOUT SEISMIC ISSUES, THINGS HAVE CHANGED. NOW, THE ARCHITECTURE FIRM INVOLVED FROM THE BEGINNING AND THIS PROJECT SEEMS TO HAVE GONE BACK QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS EVEN THEY EXPRESSED WHAT THEY CALL RAISED DOUBTS CONCERNING SEISMIC PERFORMANCE, BUT THEY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION LAST YEAR THAT THEY COULD GET AROUND OR THEY CAN COMPLY WITH CITY ORDINANCES SINCE THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A DRASTIC CHANGE IN OCCUPANCY. WELL, SINCE THE CITY ORDINANCES WERE WRITTEN QUITE A WHILE AGO, THEY'RE GOING TO BE UPDATED HERE SHORTLY, BUT NOT FOR THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF PROJECT AND SINCE THEIR OPINION CAME OUT THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF CHANCES THAT WE'LL HAVE A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE THAT WILL EFFECT -- AFFECT PORTLAND IN THE NEXT 50 YEARS. THERE'S THREE PARTS TO MY HANDOUT. ONE IS THE REPORT THAT WE COMMISSIONED BY A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER WHO'S TAUGHT STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING AND SEISMIC ISSUES AT PORTLAND STATE FOR  OVER 40 YEARS, PROBABLY TRAINED THE GUYS WHO HAD THE OPINION THAT THIS WOULD BE OKAY. ANYWAY, SINCE THEN, IT'S GONE FROM THE ODDS OF  17:14, EXCUSE ME 14 TO 17% UP TO 20% IN THE NEXT 50 YEARS. THERE'S A VERY LARGE TECTONIC PLATE OFF THE COAST OF OREGON, AND IT MOVES ROUGHLY EVERY 350 YEARS. WELL, IT'S 317 YEARS SINCE IT MOVED THE LAST TIME. 1,700 WAS THE LAST TIME IT MOVED DRAMATICALLY. NOW, OBVIOUSLY, PORTLAND IS QUITE A WAYS FROM THE COAST, BUT IT WOULD AFFECT PORTLAND AND DEPENDING ON THE TIDE, WE COULD EVEN HAVE SOME SMALL AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY COMING UP THE COLUMBIA AND DOWN THE WILLAMETTE SO WHAT WE'RE ENCOURAGING THE PORTLAND DEVELOPMENTAL COMMISSION TO DO IS TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THIS PROJECT BECAUSE IF I'M RIGHT AND I DON'T WANT TO BE RIGHT, IT'S GOING TO COST ANOTHER FIVE  TO $9 MILLION TO PUT -- THEY HAVE A WAY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THEY HAVE EPOXY PLATES THAT THEY CAN PUT IN THAT WOULD ATTACH THE BEAMS AND THE PILLARS, ON TOP OF IT -- BECAUSE IT WAS BUILT IN TWO STAGES, FIRST, THEY BUILT THIS CONCRETE STAGE, AND THEN THEY BUILT THE STEEL STAGE. THE STEEL STAGE ACTUALLY KIND OF HOLDS IT TOGETHER. THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S RUST SO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIX THAT RUST, BUT ANYWAY, THE ARCHITECTURE FIRM ISN'T INTERESTED IN RECEIVING THIS UNLESS IT COMES FROM PBOT. BUT YOU SEE THE -- THIS IS A WAY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CITY OF PORTLAND SINCE WE'RE GOING TO BE SACRIFICED IN THIS PROCESS, WE MIGHT AS WELL -- THE CITY MIGHT AS WELL GET SOMETHING OUT OF THIS OTHER THAN A LACK OF A CONVENIENCE STORE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR  TIME. THANK  YOU.  Kelly: THANK YOU. SO ON THE CONSENT AGENDA, ITEM NUMBER SIX, WE HAVE REPORT 1651, RESOLUTION 7211, MODIFYING THE TERMS OF A PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT TO CONVEY 0.38 ACRES OF REAL PROPERTY IN THE LENTS TOWN CENTER RENEWAL AREA TO LISAC BROTHERS CONSTRUCTION. SO THAT JUST REQUIRES A MOTION FOR  APPROVAL.  SO MOVED.  Kelly: WE HAVE A MOTION.  SECOND.  Kelly: WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR SIGNIFY BY SAYING AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] THE AYES HAVE IT, THE MOTION CARRIES. OUR NEXT ITEM NUMBER SEVEN IS AN INFORMATION ITEM, UPDATE ON A HOME FOR EVERYONE, MARC JOLIN, THE INITIATIVE DIRECTOR IS HERE TO SPEAK WITH US I THINK. [ INAUDIBLE ] WELCOME.  THANK YOU. SORRY TO KEEP YOU  WAITING. SO MY NAME IS MARC JOLIN, I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE JOINT OFFICE OF HOMELESS SERVICES AND I ALSO SERVE AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE HOME FOR EVERYONE INITIATIVE. SO I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND SPEND A FEW MINUTES WITH YOU TODAY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT AND I'LL KEEP MY PART OF THE PRESENTATION RELATIVELY BRIEF JUST IN TERMS OF WHAT THE INITIATIVE IS, WHAT THE OFFICE IS AND GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK ME QUESTIONS.  Kelly: MARC SO YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A SCHEDULED 4:00, OUR NEXT ITEM AND WE ARE RUNNING A LITTLE FAST SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE MORE TIME.  SO I'M GLAD I WASN'T  ACTUALLYLA TE TO THE TIME I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. LET ME JUST GRAB SOMETHING. SO I'LL GIVE YOU JUST A BRIEF OVERVIEW. I GREW UP IN PORTLAND AND STARTED OUT DOING WORK ON HOMELESSNESS WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE IN PHILLY, JUST LITERALLY TAKING SANDWICHES OUT TO THE STREET AND THEN CAME BACK HERE AND WORKED AT TRANSITION PROJECTS FOR A WHILE, WHICH IS STILL OUR BIGGEST PUBLICLY FUNDED SHELTER PROVIDER GETTING BIGGER ALL THE TIME AND THEN WAS AT ST. FRANCIS DINING HALL AS THE PROGRAM MANAGER FOR A BIT, AND THEN I WAS IN CHICAGO AT LAW SCHOOL AND CAME BACK AND WORKED FOR THE OREGON LAW CENTER SO I WAS A LEGAL SERVICES ATTORNEY REPRESENTING HOMELESS PEOPLE, LARGELY AROUND THINGS LIKE CAMPING ISSUES AND USE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, USE OF PARKS, AND THEN I WAS IN THE PRIVATE BAR FOR A BIT AND THEN WENT TO BECOME  EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT A STREET OUTREACH ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO HELP MOVE PEOPLE BACK INTO PERMANENT HOUSING, REMAIN STABLE THERE. I WAS THERE FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS BEFORE MAKING THE TRANSITION INTO THE HOME FOR EVERYONE INITIATIVE ROLE AND BECAUSE IT GETS CONFUSING I WORK FOR MULTNOMAH COUNTY SO MY PAYCHECK COMES FROM MULTNOMAH COUNTY AND AS YOU'LL SEE, I ACTUALLY ANSWER TO BOTH THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AT THE COUNTY AND AT THE CITY AND ALSO TO A WIDER BOARD AND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE HOME FOR EVERYONE INITIATIVE. SO THAT IS MY  BACKGROUND. SO WHAT I WANTED TO DO IS TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF THE CONTEXT FOR A HOME FOR EVERYONE. WE HAD A TEN-YEAR PLAN THAT THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN IN PORTLAND FOR A WHILE PROBABLY KNOW ABOUT, IT LAUNCHED IN 2004 AND IT WAS DUE TO EXPIRE IN 2014 AND SO PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THAT TEN-YEAR PLAN AND RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAD NOT ENDED HOMELESSNESS, THE COMMUNITY CAME BACK TOGETHER TO CREATE A NEW STRATEGIC PLAN THAT SOUGHT TO LEARN FROM THE THINGS THAT WERE WORKING WELL UNDER THE TEN-YEAR PLAN AND THERE WERE A LOT OF STRATEGIES THAT WE DEVELOPED IN THAT PLAN THAT DO WORK WELL, BUT WE JUST NEVER WERE ABLE TO TAKE THEM TO THE SCALE THAT WE NEEDED AND THERE WERE ALSO SOME THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T DO SO WELL INTO THE TEN-YEAR PLAN AND WE TRIED TO LEARN FROM THOSE THINGS, AND IT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW WHAT WE IDENTIFIED AS SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS. THAT PLAN WAS VERY FOCUSED ON CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS, FOLKS WHO HAD BEEN OUT A VERY LONG TIME WHO WERE STRUGGLING WITH A DISABILITY, THE THEORY OF CHANGE WAS THAT IF WE COULD HOUSE ALL OF THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO WERE CONSUMING A SIGNIFICANT, DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE RESOURCE, IT WOULD FREE UP RESOURCES FOR OTHER POPULATIONS THAT HAD NEED AND THAT'S FINE, IT'S TRUE WHEN WE HOUSE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE THERE IS A COST SAVINGS TO THE COMMUNITY AND HOUSING THAT POPULATION IS MORE CHALLENGING THAN FOLKS THOUGHT, AND IT'S HARDER TO SEE THOSE COST COMES BACK INTO THE SYSTEM TO SERVE OTHER PEOPLE THAN FOLKS ORIGINALLY IMAGINED SO WE HAD A VERY NARROW FOCUS ON CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS WHICH WORKED WELL. WE SAW GOOD PROGRESS IN MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR CHRONICALLY HOMELESS COMMUNITY, BUT BECAUSE IT WAS SO NARROW AND OTHER COMMUNITIES HAD NEEDS, TOO, THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COMMUNITY, THE HOMELESS FAMILIES AND YOUTH WE DIDN'T STAY TOGETHER AROUND ONE TABLE. WE HAD ONE PLAN AND IT WAS LARGELY WITHIN THE CITY BECAUSE THE CITY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING WITH HOMELESS SINGLES AND THEN THE COUNTY DEVELOPED SEPARATE SYSTEMS OF CARE FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, FOR YOUTH, FOR FAMILIES. SO CREATED THIS KIND OF FRAGMENTATION. THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON, MANY NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON AND HAVING A VERY FRAGMENTED SYSTEM OFTEN LED TO  INEFFICIENCIES AND LESS EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT OF OUR SCARCE RESOURCES. SO THAT WAS ONE  LIMITATION. THE OTHER WAS THAT THERE WAS NO RECOGNITION IN THAT PLAN AND SO FOCUS ON RACIAL EQUITY AND ONE OF THE WELL DOCUMENTED AND CERTAINLY NOW MUCH BETTER UNDERSTOOD DYNAMICS IN THE HOMELESS POPULATION IS HOW OVERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE WITHIN HOMELESSNESS AND THAT MEANT THAT WE REALLY WEREN'T ONE, UNDERSTANDING THAT DYNAMIC FROM A DATA AND ANALYSIS PERSPECTIVE AND WE ALSO WEREN'T PROGRAMMING TOWARDS TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT OVERREPRESENTATION AND THAT DISPARITY. WE ALSO DIDN'T TALK ABOUT SHELTER. AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE THING THAT GOT THE MOST ATTENTION IN OUR COMMUNITY WAS THAT THERE WAS A SENSE THAT UNDER THE TEN-YEAR PLAN AND THE WORK WE WERE DOING THROUGH 2014 WE DIDN'T WANT SHELTER OR WE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT SHELTER. THE REALITY WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED THE TEN-YEAR PLAN IN 2004, ALL WE HAD WAS SHELTER. ALL WE DID WAS ASK OUR PROVIDERS TO TELL US HOW MANY BED NIGHTS THEY WERE PROVIDING, HOW MANY SHOWERS THEY WERE PROVIDING. WE WEREN'T ACTUALLY ASKING OUR PROVIDERS HOW MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME INTO YOUR SHELTER ARE MOVING OUT OF SHELTER AND INTO PERMANENT HOUSING? AND WHEN THEY GET THERE, HOW MANY OF THEM ARE STAYING HOUSED? WE WEREN'T BUILDING A SYSTEM THAT WAS ORIENTED TOWARDS ENDING HOMELESSNESS, BUT RESPONDING TO THE EMERGENCY THAT YOU HAD PEOPLE SLEEPING OUTSIDE WHICH WAS FINE. WHEN WE INITIATED THE TEN-YEAR PLAN THERE WAS A FOCUS ON HOW DO WE MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF HOMELESSNESS, OUT OF THE SHELTERS, OFF THE STREETS, HOW DO WE KEEP THEM IN HOUSING IN THE FIRST PLACE? HOW DO WE DO A BETTER JOB OF PREVENTION? WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED I THINK BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO DRAFTED THAT PLAN REALLY DID THINK WE COULD MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS ENDING HOMELESSNESS. THEY FELT LIKE WE DIDN'T NEED TO INVEST MORE MONEY IN SHELTER. WE KNOW NOW THAT WE NEED SHELTER AND THAT THAT WE NEED TO BE PLANFUL AROUND IT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS IN THIS PLAN IS A DEDICATED FOCUS TO UNDERSTANDING THE LEVEL OF SHELTER NEED AND PLANNING FOR THAT AND INVESTING IN THAT NEED. AND THEN FINALLY, THE PIECE THAT I THINK WILL PROBABLY BE WHAT SETS THIS EFFORT APART FROM THAT TEN-YEAR PLAN PROCESS IS WE LACKED A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE UNDER THE ORIGINAL TEN-YEAR PLAN. THERE WAS NO ONE REALLY IN CHARGE OF OVERSEEING AND ENSURING THAT THAT PLAN WAS BEING IMPLEMENTED AND UPDATED AND CHECKED FOR ITS EFFECTIVENESS OVER TIME. WE WEREN'T DOING A LOT OF GOOD DATA ANALYSIS, WE WEREN'T DOING ONGOING EVALUATION. AND THERE WAS A COMMITTEE AND I WENT TO THESE MEETINGS FOR EIGHT YEARS EVERY MONTH, THE COORDINATING COMMITTEE ON HOMELESSNESS, BUT THERE WAS NO APPOINTED MEMBERSHIP. THERE WAS NO FORMAL AUTHORITY IN THAT BODY. SO ONE OF THE CRITICAL THING THAT WE DID UNDER THIS PLAN IS CREATE A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND IT'S A STRONG ONE. WE HAVE AN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WITHIN A HOME FOR EVERYONE THAT IS THE MAYOR AND THE HOUSING COMMISSIONER AND THE CITY OF PORTLAND SIDE, THE COUNTY CHAIR AND COMMISSIONER BAILEY, WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CITY COUNCIL IN GRESHAM, WE HAVE HOME FORWARD'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, MY MEMORIAL TRUST IS THERE, PORTLAND BUSINESS ALLIANCE IS THERE, AND WE HAVE FAITH COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION, AS WELL. THAT GROUP MEETS EVERY TWO MONTHS. IT'S UNPRECEDENTED, OUR COMMUNITY'S EFFORTS TO HAVE THAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP AROUND THE TABLE FOCUSED ON  THIS ISSUE AND IT MEANS THAT WE'RE CONSTANTLY HAVING COMMUNICATION, PROGRESS REPORTS, THEY'RE ASKING US THAT CRITICAL QUESTION, HOW ARE YOU DOING TOWARDS YOUR GOALS, WHAT ARE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS, WHAT'S WORKING, WHAT'S NOT? AND THAT CONVERSATION MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL HERE. WITHOUT THAT ONGOING ACCOUNTABILITY AND DIALOGUE, WE WERE FACING JUST HAVING ANOTHER PLAN THAT WASN'T REALLY MOVING THE COMMUNITY FORWARD. SO UNDER THAT EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, THERE'S ALSO A COORDINATING BOARD WITH APPOINTED MEMBERSHIP AND I'LL HAVE IT ILLUSTRATED HERE THAT HAS 30 SOME MEMBERS ON IT. IT'S UNWIELDY, BUT IT'S INTENDED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL STAKEHOLDER VOICES ARE BEING HEARD IN THIS PROCESS AND HAVE A FORMAL ROLE AND BELOW IT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT SUBCOMMITTEES THAT ARE DOING WORK, BOTH STANDING COMMITTEES AND AD HOC COMMITTEES THAT GET FORMED. GOING BACK BRIEFLY TO THE FIRST SLIDE, THE PLAN AT ONE LEVEL IS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD. THIS IS OUR COLLECTIVE EFFORT TO CREATE A COMMUNITY IN WHICH NO ONE IS HOMELESS AND EVERYONE HAS A SAFE AND STABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME. THERE ARE SOME GUIDING VALUES HERE THAT ARE REALLY CRITICAL TO ALL OF THE PRIORITY SETTING THAT WE DO AND WE HAVE TO SET PRIORITIES. WE'RE FOCUSED ON THE MOST VULNERABLE, THERE IS A COMMITMENT TO PROMOTING RACIAL JUSTICE, WE NEED TO HOLD THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT COMES BACK TO THAT DATA, THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA IN ALL OF THIS WORK. THE COMMUNITY IS HEAVILY INVOLVED AND WE WERE BEFORE COUNCIL THIS MORNING TALKING ABOUT A PROGRAM THAT ONI IS PUTTING TOGETHER TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO BRING FOLKS WITH EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS TO THE TABLES THAT WE'VE CREATED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR VOICES ARE CENTRAL IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING AND THE DIRECTIONS THAT WE'RE TAKING, AND THEN WE'RE LOOKING AT STRENGTHENING EXISTING CAPACITY AND PARTNERSHIPS AND WE CAN TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. AND THEN WE'VE GOT WORK HAPPENING AND WE HAVE BUSINESS PLANS ESSENTIALLY IN EACH OF THOSE SIX FOCUS AREAS, IN HOUSING, HEALTHCARE, EMPLOYMENT, EMERGENCY SERVICES, ACCESS, AND SYSTEM COORDINATION WHICH ARE A LITTLE MORE ON THE WONKY SIDE. ALL OF THOSE ACTION PLANS ARE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE WHICH IS AT WWW.HOMEFOREVERYONE.NET. WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO LOOK AT THOSE TODAY. SO IN ADDITION TO CREATING THAT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, THERE WERE IN EARLY CONVERSATIONS, A RECOGNITION THAT WE NEEDED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE GOVERNMENT SIDE OF THIS WORK RATIONALIZED A LITTLE BIT AND FOR YEARS AND YEARS SOME PEOPLE SAY DECADES THERE HAD BEEN CONVERSATIONS AROUND CONSOLIDATING THE CITY AND COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES FUNCTION. WE DID NOT DO THAT ENTIRELY. BUT WE DID ON JULY 1 LAUNCH THE JOINT OFFICE OF HOMELESS SERVICES AND IT TAKES THE GENERAL FUND RESOURCES FROM THE CITY OF PORTLAND THAT WERE GOING TO HOMELESS SERVICES THROUGH THE HOUSING BUREAU AND CONSOLIDATES THEM WITH THOSE THAT WERE BEING CONTRACTED OUT THROUGH THE COUNTY INTO THIS OFFICE SO WE HAVE A BUDGET OF ABOUT $43 MILLION THIS YEAR, OUR STAFF IS NOT HUGE. RIGHT NOW, IT'S ABOUT EIGHT. WE'RE ADDING A FEW STAFF PEOPLE TO IT. BUT OUR JOB IS TO DO THE WORK FOR BOTH THE CITY OF PORTLAND AND MULTNOMAH COUNTY TO GET THOSE DOLLARS OUT TO OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS, TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE AND THE OFFICE SPORTS THE LARGER HOME FOR EVERYONE INITIATIVE, THAT LARGER PARTNERSHIP THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. I THINK THERE ARE QUESTIONS HERE ABOUT SORT OF WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS NOW BETWEEN PHB AND THIS. THE PORTLAND HOUSING BUREAU MAINTAINS ALL PLANNING RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. SO WHILE AS PEOPLE WHO WORK ON HOMELESSNESS WE ARE GOING TO BE A STRONG VOICE FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVENTORY AND ESPECIALLY ZERO TO 30, THE PLANNING FUNCTION, THE BUDGETING FUNCTION FOR ALL OF THOSE THINGS, THAT'S WORK THAT PHB CONTINUES TO DO. IT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. THEY ARE ALSO CONTINUING TO DO HOME OWNERSHIP WORK AND THEY ARE DOING TENANT PROTECTION WORK. SO FOR BOTH ON THE LEGAL SIDE AND ON  THE HABITABILITY STANDARDS SIDE. OUR ROLE IS TO DO EVERYTHING UP TO AND INCLUDING PLACING PEOPLE INTO HOUSING. ALL OF THE EMERGENCY SERVICES, SHELTER PROVISION, THE RENT ASSISTANCE, THE STREET OUTREACH PROGRAMS, THE MENTAL HEALTH OUTREACH PROGRAMS, TRANSITIONAL HOUSING, HOUSING PLACEMENT AND THE SUPPORT PEOPLE NEED WHO WERE HOMELESS TO STAY IN THE HOUSING THEY HAVE, AND THEN THAT'S SORT OF WHERE OUR RESPONSIBILITY STOPS. THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS IS DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES AT THE COUNTY. THEY TAKE OFF FROM THERE IN TERMS OF THE SERVICES AND MAINTAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL OF THE ANTI-POVERTY WORK SO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IS JUST ONE END OF THAT CONTINUUM, DHS CONTINUES TO DO THE SUN SYSTEM AND THE ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAMS THAT EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO WORK EXTREMELY CLOSELY WITH THEM AND DO, AND IT'S ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF HAVING THIS OFFICE IN THE COUNTY. SO I TALKED ABOUT DATA AND THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA AND COMING AT THIS FROM A LARGER SYSTEM PERSPECTIVE AND ONE OF THE PIECES OF WORK THAT HAS REALLY BEEN THE FOCUS FOR THE FIRST YEAR AND IT WAS THE FIRST DIRECTIVE THAT OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORY GAVE US, YOU'VE GOT THESE SYSTEMS, WE KNOW WHAT THEY DO BUT TELL US THE OVERALL NEED. WHO'S OUT THERE? WHAT'S THE LEVEL OF NEED? TELL US HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BECOMING HOMELESS. TELL US HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE MOVING OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. TELL US WHAT OUR INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY MAKING, CONTRIBUTING TO BOTH REDUCING INFLOW AND HELPING PEOPLE MOVE OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. WE REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL WHY DO WE HAVE AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T HAVE THIS NUMBER IN YOUR HEADS 4,000 PEOPLE A NIGHT WHO ARE EITHER SLEEPING OUTSIDE OR IN A SHELTER BED OR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING, WHY IS THAT UNMET NEED THERE? WHAT'S THE DYNAMIC THAT'S DRIVING IT AND IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT BRINGING THAT NUMBER DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY, LET'S SAY IF WE HAD A THREE-YEAR PLANNING HORIZON, WHAT WOULD WE HAVE TO DO TO TAKE THIS NUMBER DOWN BY 50%? SO WE WENT ABOUT DIGGING INTO THE DATA AND COMING AT IT IN THIS WAY, RECOGNIZING THAT THE HOMELESS POPULATION IS NOT STATIC, IT'S NOT THE SAME PEOPLE EVERY NIGHT. WE'VE GOT PEOPLE MOVING INTO HOUSING EVERY SINGLE DAY AND YOU'LL SEE THE OUTCOME NUMBER LATER, BUT WE HAD OVER 4,600 PEOPLE WHO WE MOVED BACK INTO PERMANENT HOUSING LAST YEAR. SO THERE ARE PEOPLE COMING INTO HOMELESSNESS, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS MOVING OUT. HOW MANY PEOPLE IS IT THAT ARE COMING IN? WHAT'S OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY NEWLY HOMELESS PEOPLE WE HAVE? ARE WE DOING ENOUGH? AND IF NOT SORT OF WHAT'S THE SCALE OF INVESTMENT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE? IT'S ESSENTIALLY A SYSTEM LEVEL INFLOW OUTFLOW MODEL. AT ONE LEVEL IT'S FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND WHAT WE FOUND OUT FROM OUR INITIAL DATA RUNS AND IT WAS HELPFUL BECAUSE WE DID THIS JUST BEFORE THE 2015 POINT IN TIME COUNTED. IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS EVERY TWO YEARS WE DO A SYSTEMATIC CENSUS OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SLEEPING OUTSIDE, IN SHELTER AND IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING TO GET A ONE NIGHT COUNT. THAT'S WHERE THAT 4,000 NUMBER COMES FROM. WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE TO US EVEN BEFORE WE DID THE 2015 POINT IN TIME COUNT WAS THAT WE HAD ABOUT AS MANY PEOPLE COMING INTO HOMELESSNESS EVERY YEAR AS WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE OUT AND SO IF WE HAD AN UNMET NEED NUMBER, THERE IT SHOWS 3,000 BECAUSE WE WEREN'T COUNTING THE -- THE BLUE LINE IS THE UNMET, THE 4,200 AND WE'RE TRYING TO DRIVE THON MET NEED DOWN BY HALF, WHAT WE KNEW IS WE WERE DOING ABOUT 3,000 PLACEMENTS A YEAR OUT OF THERE AND WE WERE DOING THE PREVENTION WORK THAT WE WERE DOING, WE HAD THAT NUMBER IDENTIFIED AND ESSENTIALLY, WE WEREN'T GOING TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS IN TERMS OF DRIVING DOWN THE NIGHTLY UNMET NEED IF WE KEPT DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE DOING. AND THIS WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAIL IS WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO DO IF WE WANTED TO BRING THE UNMET NEED DOWN BY 50% OVER A THREE-YEAR PLANNING PERIOD. WE NEEDED TO INCREASE  PLACEMENT, 4,350 PLACEMENTS A YEAR FROM THAT 3,000 BASELINE, WE NEEDED TO BRING PREVENTIONS UP TOWARDS ABOUT 10,000 PREVENTIONS A YEAR. AND IF WE DID THAT AND SUSTAINED THAT OVER TIME AND WE WERE RIGHT ABOUT OUR INFLOW ASSUMPTIONS, A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS BUILT INTO A MODEL LIKE THIS WE SHOULD START SEE THON MET NEED NUMBER DROP. SO WITH THAT PICTURE, WE ALSO HAD TO THEN ANSWER BECAUSE WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO SHELTER EVEN AS WE START TO BRING UNMET NEED DOWN THERE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO SLEEP OUTSIDE. GIVEN OUR CURRENT SHELTER CAPACITY, HOW MUCH MORE SHELTER DO WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT GREEN LINE THERE AND THAT GRAY DASHED LINE AT ANY GIVEN POINT, IT'S THAT BLUE BOX THAT WE'RE SOLVING FOR WHEN WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH MORE SHELTER WE NEED IN THE COMMUNITY SO FROM THERE, WE TAKE THAT AND MAKE THAT INTO SOME VERY SPECIFIC GOALS AND THESE AREN'T THE CITY AND THE COUNTY'S GOALS. REMEMBER THOSE ARE THE HOME FOR EVERYONE GOALS, IT'S NOT THE EXPECTATION THAT THE CITY AND THE COUNTY ARE ACHIEVING ALL THESE THINGS, IT'S HOW ARE WE AS A COMMUNITY GOING TO GET TO THESE NUMBERS? WE WON'T GO INTO DETAIL HERE, BUT OUR TARGET FOR THIS YEAR WAS TO ADD 650 SHELTER BEDS TO THE SYSTEM, TO MEET SOME OF THE GAP THAT WE IDENTIFIED. TO BRING OUR PLACEMENT NUMBERS UP TO 4350, TO BRING OUR PREVENTION NUMBERS UP TOWARDS 10,000 BY THE END OF THIS YEAR AND WHAT YOU SEE THERE ARE THE INCREMENTAL INCREASES AND BECAUSE WE HAVE EQUITY GOALS AND WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE LARGER SYSTEM, BUT WE HAVE THE LARGER PRIORITY POPULATIONS, WE BREAK IT DOWN FURTHER. WE ALLOCATE OUR RESOURCES ACCORDING TO THESE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES OF PREVENTION, HOUSING, PLACEMENT AND STRUCTURE AND WE'RE USING THE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW ARE THE WAYS TO SPEND THOSE DOLLARS, RIGHT? SO WE DO RAPID REHOUSING AND SHORT-TERM RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED A SHORT AMOUNT OF SUPPORT TO GET BACK INTO STABLE HOUSING. WE FOCUS ON GETTING PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED ONTO LONG-TERM BENEFITS. WE HELP PEOPLE GET BACK INTO EMPLOYMENT AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SOME OF THE WORK THAT YOU ALL DO HERE WITH THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY INITIATIVE. WE TRY TO GET UPSTREAM AND PREVENT EVICTION. IT'S MUCH BETTER FOR THE FAMILIES, MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE WHEN FOLKS CAN BE PREVENTED FROM BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE  HAVE TO DO -- WHO NEED ONGOING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THEY KEEP THEIR HOUSING. AND, OF COURSE, WE'RE USING HOUSING FIRST APPROACH AND WE HEAR THIS QUESTION A  LOT. WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY ON THE STREET ANY LONGER THAN THEY ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS TO KEEP SOMEONE IN THE HOUSING THAT THEY HAVE. OUR NEXT PRIORITY IS TO GET THEM INTO THE NEXT PLACE THAT'S PERMANENT. ONLY IF NEITHER OF THESE TWO OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT PROVIDING SHELTER TO SOMEBODY. UNFORTUNATELY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY, TONIGHT THOSE OTHER OPTIONS AREN'T AVAILABLE. I TALKED ABOUT THE WORK GROUPS AND THE BUSINESS PLANS IN EACH OF THOSE AREAS, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU ALL DO WORK IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT AREA I THOUGHT I WOULD FOCUS HERE, BUT THIS IS A WORK GROUP MADE UP OF ALL OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS WHO GOT AROUND THE TABLE AND SAID ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THIS. HOW ARE WE GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE SUCCESSFUL PLACEMENT AND PREVENTION NUMBERS? WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE IF WE WANT TO SEE FEWER FAMILIES LOSE THEIR HOUSING. THESE FOLKS SPENT LITERALLY MONTHS OF MEETINGS AROUND THE TABLE, COMING UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS. BROADLY THESE ARE THE TYPES OF RECOMMENDATIONS THEY CAME UP WITH, LOOKING HOW TO BETTER ALIGN DOLLARS WITH OUR HOUSING RESOURCES, HOW TO BRING HOUSING DOLLARS TO THE WORKFORCE SYSTEM AND HOW TO BRING WORKFORCE RESOURCES TO THE HOUSING SYSTEM, HOW TO DO MORE ALIGNMENT WITH BIGGER SYSTEMS LIKE TANF, HOW TO DO TARGETED INVESTMENTS AROUND  EQUITY AND EMPLOYMENT AND SOME IMMEDIATE INCOME PRIORITIES, THINK STREET ROOTS, EVEN IF IT'S NOT AS MUCH WE MENTIONED LIKE IT GIVES THEM A START AND WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT IN THIS YEAR WE'VE PUT ANOTHER $1.2 MILLION TOWARDS THAT SET OF STRATEGIES, MANY OF THEM LEVERAGING INVESTMENTS THAT PDC IS MAKING THROUGH ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. SO THESE NUMBERS ARE BRAND-NEW. AND WE COMPETED OUR GOALS  IN 15-16 BY QUITE A BIT AND WE'VE GOT NEW MONEY THIS YEAR SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUSH BEYOND THE INITIAL GOALS THAT WE SET BUT THERE WERE 4,600 PEOPLE WHO MOVED OFF THE STREETS, MORE THAN 9,000 PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR HOUSING AND IN PART BECAUSE WE EXPANDED SHELTER FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY, WE HAD OVER 6,000 PEOPLE GO THROUGH SHELTER LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT IT WAS OVER 4,000. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION OF SHELTERS. WE DID SET THAT GOAL OF 650 ADDITIONAL SHELTER BEDS, WE'RE AT 562 RIGHT NOW. THE CITY AND THE COUNTY ALONE, BUT ANOTHER $5 MILLION INTO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TO EXPAND SHELTER CAPACITY AND THAT'S REALLY JUST FOR THE OPERATIONS, THE COUNTY'S INVESTED QUITE A BIT MORE IN ACQUISITION, AS WELL. WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY AND IT'S NOT ONE BIG SHELTER. IT'S A NUMBER OF VERY INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED SHELTERS TO SERVE DIFFERENT NEEDS FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE MINDFUL OF IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA IS THAT BECAUSE WE WEREN'T PLANNING AROUND SHELTER, WE WEREN'T SERVING EVERYBODY WHO NEEDED SHELTER SO WE HAD A CERTAIN KIND OF SHELTER THAT WE WERE FUNDING, BUT FOR MANY OF THE MOST CHRONIC FOLKS WHO ARE OUT THERE, REALLY WE DIDN'T HAVE A SHELTER OPTION FOR THEM. NOT ONLY ARE WE CREATING BEDS, BUT WE'RE CHANGING THE RULES IN THOSE SHELTERS SO PEOPLE CAN BRING THEIR PETS AND THEIR PARTNERS AND THEIR POSSESSIONS INSIDE AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE CLEAN AND SOBER WHEN THEY COME IN. WE OFFER THEM THOSE SERVICES WHEN THEY'RE THERE, THAT HAS OPENED THE DOORS FOR PEOPLE WHO PREVIOUSLY REALLY HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO CAMP IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE'RE CONFIDENT WE NEED MORE SHELTER, WE'RE WORKING ON WINTER SHELTER CAPACITY AND YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH CONVERSATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY, IT'S ALMOST DOUBLING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PUBLICLY FUNDED SHELTER BEDS WE HAD CREATED AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO 2015. WE'RE MOVING FASTER THAN WE EVER HAVE IN THIS AREA. AND SO THIS IS JUST, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF OUR CONVERSATION NOW, THE WORK WE DO CAN'T HAPPEN AND CERTAINLY CAN'T BE SUCCESSFUL AT THE SCALE IT NEEDS TO BE IF WE AREN'T FIGURING OUT AS A COMMUNITY WAYS TO ADD AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVENTORY AND THE SUPPORT SERVICES PIECE WE CAN DO, BUT WE DEFINITELY LOOK TO THE COMMUNITY AND TO YOU AND TO P.H.B. AROUND THE INVENTORIES SIDE. EMPLOYMENT IS CRITICAL. THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU FUND AND THAT WE'RE LEVERAGING ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WE'RE HOUSING HAVE A FEW MONTHS OF ASSISTANCE, JUST ENOUGH TO HELP THEM STABILIZE, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PICK UP THEIR OWN RENT SOON AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE WORK AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE WORK THAT PAYS WELL ENOUGH THAT THEY CAN SUSTAIN THAT UNIT. MANY OF THE FOLKS WE HELP ARE SEVERELY RENT BURDENED, WE'RE NOT MOVING MOST PEOPLE INTO 30% UNITS. WE'RE MOVING THEM INTO WHAT THEY CAN FIND AND THEY'RE SPENDING 80% OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT, AND THEN THE LAST PIECE IS PROPERTY FOR SHELTER AND THIS HAS BEEN A BIG TOPIC OF CONVERSATION IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE ARE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT BOTH FOR PROPERTY THAT WE CAN USE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM FACILITIES FOR OPEN SPACE. SO THERE YOU ARE. I TALKED A LITTLE LONGER THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD. HOPEFULLY, IT WAS A HELPFUL ORIENTATION.  Kelly: COMMISSIONERS, QUESTIONS?  THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. I APPRECIATE IT. I WANTED TO ASK ACTUALLY A FEW QUESTIONS. ONE YOU SHOWED THE PIE GRAPH OF THE ALLOCATIONS OF SHELTER VERSUS TRANSITIONAL HOUSING VERSUS PERMANENT HOUSING. AND I WANT TO KNOW DOES THAT ALSO REPRESENT HAD THE FUNDS THAT ARE BEING ALLOCATED FOR SHELTER, TRANSITIONAL HOUSING AND PERMANENT HOUSING AS WELL?  SO THAT WAS FUNDED PLACEMENTS, THE PERCENTAGE OF --  IF THAT DOESN'T REPRESENT IT.  IT CAN TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE SPENDING. SO THIS WAS REALLY JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW WE'RE -- THE OVERALL FUNDING IS GOING OUT, BUT IT DOES GENERALLY. SARY PUTTING ABOUT $15 MILLION A YEAR RIGHT NOW OF OUR BUDGET TOWARDS SHELTER  OPERATIONS. AND THEN COMBINED, THE PREVENTION IS -- THE RAPID REHOUSING PREVENTION IS THE REMAINDER OF THAT, I'M NOT SURE HOW IT BREAKS DOWN.  ARE WE TALKING OUT OF THE $43 MILLION TOTAL BUDGET OR ADDITIONAL MONEY?  THAT'S ALL OUT OF THE 43. SO THAT'S JUST HOW WE DIVIDE IT UP AND IT'S A LITTLE CHALLENGING BECAUSE SOME OF THE DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TOWARDS IT ARE STILL AT PHB AND SOME OF THE PREVENTION DOLLARS ARE AT DCHS. THE TOTAL PIE IS BIGGER THAN 43. IT'S CLOSER TO 60.  GOT IT. $15 MILLION IS ALLOCATED FOR SHELTER? AND WHAT ABOUT TRANSITIONAL HOUSING?  FOR US THAT'S IN THE SAME BOX. WE DON'T SPEND A LOT OF LOCAL DOLLARS ON TRANSITIONAL HOUSING, MOST OF IS FUNDED THROUGH THE FEDERAL GRANTS.  AND THEN IN YOUR HOMELESSNESS NUMBERS, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THE DEFINITIONS AND TERMS HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING, WE TALKED ABOUT FOLKS WHO ARE ON THE STREET, BUT DO THOSE NUMBERS ALSO INCLUDE PERSONS WHO ARE COUCH SURFING?  NO. SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES, THE HUD DEFINITION, WHICH IS WHAT WE WORK WITH DOESN'T INCLUDE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOUBLED UP AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THERE BEING 4,000 PEOPLE A NIGHT, WE'RE REALLY ONLY TALKING PEOPLE WHO ARE OUTSIDE, IN SHELTER, OR IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. IF YOU INCLUDE THE FOLKS WHO ARE DOUBLED UP, OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS THERE'S ANOTHER 12 TO 14,000 PEOPLE ON TOP OF THAT. WE HAVE SOME WAYS TO GET AT THAT DATA, BUT NOT GREAT WAYS. IT'S WHY THE HOMELESS SCHOOL NUMBERS ARE SO MUCH HIGHER BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION USES THAT BROADER DEFINITION OF ANYBODY WHO IS DOUBLED UP OR MEETS THE HUD DEFINITION. WE TALK ABOUT IT A LOT. FROM AN EQUITY IMPORTANT WE KNOW WITHIN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR, THE DOUBLED UP EXPERIENCE IS MORE PREVALENT AND ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT OUR GENERAL FUND, HUD DOLLARS ARE CONSTRAINED. WE CAN'T SPEND HUD DOLLARS ON PEOPLE WHO DON'T MEET THE DEFINITION. IN OUR LOCAL DOLLARS, WE CAN AND WE DO, PARTICULAR IN OUR FAMILY SYSTEM.  OKAY. AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION, I'M SORRY. THANK YOU FOR THE REPORT. THE LAST QUESTION WAS ACTUALLY WITH REGARDS TO ONCE FOLKS MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM TRANSITIONAL HOUSING TO PERMANENT HOUSING, WHAT IS THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT YOU ALL SUPPORT THEM WITH RENTAL ASSISTANCE?  IT VARIES.  AVERAGE.  I REALLY CAN'T ANSWER THAT. ON AVERAGE I THINK THE GENERAL SHORT-TERM RENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM PARTICIPATION LENGTH IS LESS THAN THREE MONTHS THAT FOLKS ARE GETTING SUPPORT THERE. YOU'VE GOT SOME FAMILIES WHO ARE GOING TO NEED EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS OF RENT ASSISTANCE. IT'S A SCARCE RESOURCE, WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE FAMILIES TO BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. OFTEN FAMILIES WILL START OUT. WE SET IT UP WITH THE PROVIDERS TO BE AS FLEXIBLE -- I WILL SAY THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, EVERY PLACEMENT HAS GOTTEN A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE, THAT IT'S COSTING MORE TO GET INTO UNITS, WE'RE PAYING DOUBLE AND TRIPLE DEPOSITS, ONCE FOLKS ARE IN, THEIR RENTS ARE HIGHER SO OUR PROVIDERS ARE HAVING TO SPEND MORE RESOURCES KEEPING THE FAMILIES THEY HAVE HOUSED, HAVE LESS AVAILABLE TO HELP THOSE FAMILIES IN THE SHELTER.  ALL RIGHT, THIS IS THE LAST QUESTION. AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE POPULATION OF FOLKS OR THE CONTINGENT THAT ACTUALLY GOES TO PERMANENT HOUSING, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE FOLKS HAVE SECURED EMPLOYMENT OR SOME EDUCATIONAL PLANS BY THE TIME THEY HIT PERMANENT OR SOME FORM OF PERMANENT HOUSING?  I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. I CAN FIND OUT FOR  YOU.  THANK YOU.  THANKS VERY MUCH. FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR GREAT WORK. I ADMIRE YOU FOR DEVOTING SO MUCH OF YOUR CAREER TO THIS DIFFICULT ISSUE SO THANKS FOR YOUR GREAT WORK. TWO QUESTIONS. ONE IS I WONDERED IF YOU COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON SPECIFIC WAYS THAT WE MIGHT COLLABORATE IN SOME WAY? I KNOW YOU SPOKE VERY GENERALLY ABOUT POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES BUT ANY FURTHER THOUGHTS OR MORE SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE? I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THAT AND SECONDLY, I WONDERED IF YOU MIGHT GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THE T-1 PROJECT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE ANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS THERE. THANK YOU.  WELL, SO I'M RELATIVELY NEW TO THIS, I WANT TO BE CAREFUL WITHOUT MAKING TOO MANY CONCRETE SUGGESTIONS AROUND COLLABORATION, I KNOW THERE ARE NUMEROUS PROJECTS WHERE YOU'RE PARTNERED WITH PHB RIGHT NOW AROUND PROVIDING LAND, YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN DEVELOPMENTS AND OBVIOUSLY, FOR US, YOU KNOW, WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON THAT ZERO TO 30, HOW DO WE GET UNITS INTO THE MIX IN THESE DEVELOPMENTS? AND JUST EVEN SOMEONE WORKING FULL-TIME MINIMUM WAGE IS GOING TO BE IN THAT ZERO TO 30 CATEGORY AND SOMEBODY ON SOCIAL SECURITY IS LIKELY TO BE CLOSE TO THAT INCOME LEVEL. SO FOR US THAT IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR US ON THE ENDING HOMELESSNESS SIDE OF THINGS. THOSE PARTNERSHIPS THAT YOU HAVE GOING NOW ARE GREAT AND THE MORE THE COLLABORATION CAN HAPPEN WITH PHB THE BETTER AND WE CAN BE THERE WITH YOU ON THE SERVICED SIDE WHERE IF FOLKS CAN GET INTO A UNIT, AND THEY NEED THAT ONGOING SUPPORT TO BE SUCCESSFUL TENANTS, THAT'S THE PIECE THAT OUR NONPROFIT PROVIDERS CAN OFFER AND ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT SIDE, I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN THIS AREA. I THINK IT'S THE CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO THE KINDS OF PROGRAMS YOU'RE CURRENTLY FUNDING. YOU'VE GOT AN AMAZING NETWORK OF NONPROFITS THAT ARE SERVING A REALLY DIVERSE GROUP OF CONSTITUENTS IN THE COMMUNITY, SUPPORTING THAT PROGRAM, AND SIMILAR INITIATIVES AND WORKING WITH US AND PHB AROUND HOW TO CONNECT AND ALIGN THOSE DOLLARS WITH OUR HOUSING DOLLARS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE SEE THE MISSED OPPORTUNITY. WE DON'T WANT SOMEONE GOING THROUGH A JOB TRAINING PROGRAM AND LOSING THEIR HOUSING HALFWAY THROUGH IT AND NOT FINISHING THE PROGRAM. THAT'S THE PIECE WHERE IT DOESN'T COST US MONEY. AND ON THE PROPERTY SEARCH, YOU KNOW, IT REALLY IS THE CASE AND WE'VE DONE SOME WORK AROUND THIS ALREADY, BUT WE ARE LOOKING FOR SHORT TERM WINTER SHELTER FACILITIES, WE ARE LOOKING FOR LONGER TERM FACILITY BASED SHELTER OPPORTUNITIES AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING INCREASINGLY AT OPEN SPACES AND THIS IDEA THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CREATE SOME OUTDOOR SHELTERING COMMUNITIES WITH AN ORGANIZATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTING THAT. JUST AS AN ENTITY THAT OWNS PROPERTY, IT'S THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE.  SO SHELTER OVER THE WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL SITE WHERE THE OLD HIGH SCHOOL IS THERE'S LIKE A FOUR OR FIVE ACRE LAND NEXT TO, THERE'S NO PLANS IN THE NEAR FUTURE, STRIKES ME AS A REAL OBVIOUS EXAMPLE. IT'S NICELY FENCED WITH PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE FENCE.  IT WAS CONTEMPLATED THAT THE ACTUAL BUILDING THERE FOR A NAVIGATION CENTER, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY ALL OF THE DETAILS BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF COMPLEXITIES IN THE CURRENT OWNERSHIP POSTURE OF THAT BUILDING AND WHATEVER THE CONNECTED PARKS CONVERSATIONS ARE. SO I WOULD GUESS IT'S A SITE THAT IS ON THE RADAR AND CERTAINLY HAS BEEN A SUBJECT OF SOME DISCUSSION.  THEY STARTED BUILDING FACTORIES OUT OF MYLAR MATERIAL AND THINK THE DENVER AIRPORT AND I'VE ASKED THEM TO FOLLOW UP ON THE COST TO BUILD A 70,000-SQUARE-FOOT FACILITY ALL IN, IT WAS $11 MILLION. AND I WOULD BE GLAD TO GIVE YOU THE NAME OF THE PERSON THERE THAT DID THE WORK ON THAT. THEY THINK IT'S GOT A LONG LIFE SPAN AND THEY CAN PUT IT UP IN A MATTER OF A FEW MONTHS AND DRIVING BY A SITE LIKE WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL THAT'S FOUR ACRES WE COULD PUT A LARGE FACILITY THERE. WHAT PERCENT OF THE POPULATION DO YOU THINK, KIDS THAT ARE WITH NO PARENTS?  UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH?  YES.  IT'S RELATIVELY SMALL. IN OUR LAST COUNT, IT WAS 7% OF THE POPULATION. IT IS A POPULATION THAT GROWS IN THE SUMMER OFTEN, VARIES BY YEAR, BUT WE DO HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE USUALLY IN THE 24 AND UNDER AGE GROUP WHO COME THROUGH TOWN AND MANY OF THEM AREN'T PLANNING TO STAY AND THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING FOR THE KINDS OF ENDING HOMELESSNESS SERVICES THAT OUR SYSTEM OFFERS SO WE HAVE SOME STREET OUTREACH PROGRAMS THAT ENGAGE THOSE FOLKS, THE POLICE HAVE SOME INTERVENTIONS THAT THEY USE AND WE TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE SAFE TO THE EXTENT THERE'S DRUG USE GOING ON AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO STAY SAFE AND HEALTHY AS POSSIBLE, BUT THE LOCAL, THE FOLKS WHO DO -- WHO ARE HERE AND STAY HERE WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD HOMELESS YOUTH SYSTEM AND SOME EXCELLENT PROVIDERS THAT ENGAGE MORE THAN 1,000 YOUTH A YEAR IN HELPING THEM TRANSITION THROUGH IT, GET THROUGH SCHOOL, GET INTO EMPLOYMENT.  KIMBERLY, WHAT DO WE INVEST IN JOB TRAINING ROUGH LAY -- ROUGHLY A YEAR?  Branam: $3 MILLION. AND ROUGHLY HALF OF THAT GOES INTO YOUTH PROGRAMS AND ROUGHLY HALF GOES INTO ADULTS. WE DO SUPPORT SOME OF THE PROVIDERS THAT MARC IS TALKING ABOUT.  RECENTLY, I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH A PAIR PAIR -- WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE METRICS ON THE RESULTS OF THOSE.  WHICH  PROJECT?  PEAR AND THE CIRCUS PROJECT, THE RESULTS THEY'VE HAD WITH YOUNG PEOPLE SOUNDS LIKE IT'S BEEN FANTASTIC. AND YOUR COMMENT ABOUT COLLABORATION ON THE JOB TRAINING, I MEAN, THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT EFFORT.  ABSOLUTELY.  I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME FOLKS COME IN AND TELL SOME STORY THAT ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY, YOU KNOW, TAKE YOUR WALLET OUT AND YOUR HEART OUT. I JUST WONDER IF THERE'S NOT WAYS THAT WE COULD WORK TOGETHER OR THINK ABOUT HOW WE COULD INCREASE OUR FUNDING AROUND JOB TRAINING AND THINK ABOUT IT BEING MORE TARGETED. NOT THAT WE AREN'T ALREADY, BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A PLACE THAT WE COULD HELP PERHAPS.  THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND WE PUT SOME MORE MONEY TOWARDS YOUTH EMPLOYMENT, AS WELL. WE'VE GOT TO GIVE YOUTH THAT OPPORTUNITY.  Kelly: THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS.  I HAVE A MORE GENERAL QUESTION FOR YOU. SEEMS TO ME THAT THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH ARE THE -- IT'S THE ISSUE OF OUR TIME. ARE WE AS A REGION -- ARE WE INVESTING AT AN ADEQUATE LEVEL? AN EASY QUESTION FOR YOU PROBABLY TO ANSWER.  IT NEEDS TO BE MORE.  HOW MUCH MORE?  THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ANSWERS TO THIS. I THINK OUR COMMUNITY JUST LIKE EVERY MAJOR CITY IS GOING TO STRUGGLE IF OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS DON'T REINVEST IN HOUSING. SO YOU KNOW, WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO DO MORE, AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE FAIRLY UNITED AND ASK OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO DO MORE IN ORDER TO REALLY GET A HANDLE ON THIS. AND THEN I THINK INCREASINGLY THIS IS A REGIONAL CHALLENGE, THE HOUSING CRISIS ISN'T JUST A MULTNOMAH COUNTY CRISIS AND SO I THINK THERE IS  AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK MORE ON THE SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE OF THINGS AND ON THE HOUSING SIDE TO REALLY PARTNER WITH THE SURROUNDING COUNTIES ON THEIR EFFORTS AND FIGURE OUT WHERE WE CAN DO MORE TOGETHER. SO THAT I THINK IS A PIECE OF IT. YOU KNOW, GENERALLY WE HAVEN'T YET IN PORTLAND SEEN THE KINDS OF NUMBERS OF STREET HOMELESS INCREASE THAT SEATTLE, IS -- SAN FRANCISCO HAVE SEEN, SEATTLE SAW A DOUBLE-DIGIT INCREASE. WE WERE ABOUT A 4% TOTAL INCREASE IN 2015. WE'LL SEE. WE THINK THAT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS AND WE ALSO ARE HEARING FROM OUR PROVIDERS AND WE SEE SOME INDICATORS THAT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE BECOMING HOMELESS IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE'LL DO OUR STREET COUNT IN JANUARY AND HAVE A BETTER SENSE. WE'RE DOING A BETTER JOB OF HOLDING ON AGAINST THE CRISIS THAN OTHER COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. WE ALSO SHARE IN COMMON WITH SAN FRANCISCO AND SEATTLE THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT GROWING ECONOMIES, LOTS OF PEOPLE COMING IN HERE WANTING TO LIVE HERE AND THAT'S CREATING CHALLENGES FOR THE LOWER INCOME PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF HOUSING MARKET DYNAMICS. YOU'RE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT SO WE DEFINITELY NEED TO DO MORE, WE NEED TO DO MORE ON THE INVENTORY SIDE AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO NEED TO DO MORE ON THE SERVICES SIDE, IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THE AREAS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION SERVICES, THAT'S A PARTICULARLY LARGE UNMET NEED. AFFORDABLE CARE IS HELPING AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF THAT, BUT THAT CONTINUES TO BE A BIG UNMET NEED.  Kelly: THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE.  ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I APPRECIATE IT.  Kelly: GOOD LUCK. OUR NEXT AGENDA ITEM IS REPORT 1652,  RESOLUTION 7212, AUTHORIZING A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY REDEVELOPMENT LOAN AND SPECIAL AUTHORITY GRANT FOR SELF ENHANCEMENT, INC. KATE DEANE AND KIMBERLY MORELAND ARE GOING TO BE TALKING WITH US.  I'M GOING TO BE THE MAIN PERSON AND THEN IF WE NEED SUPPORT FROM JILLIAN OR KIMBERLY OR KAY, WE'RE HAPPY TO BRING THEM UP.  Kelly: GREAT.  SO YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.  Kelly: IT WAS ON MY LIST. SO, YOU KNOW. I JUST READ  LISTS.  GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR KELLY, COMMISSIONERS, DIRECTOR BRANAM. MY NAME IS KATE DEANE AND I AM THE MANAGER OF COMMUNITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT  THIS ITEM WHICH LET ME MAKE SURE I KNOW  HOW -- YEAH -- WHICH IS A REQUEST TO YOU TO APPROVE RESOLUTION 7212 WHICH WILL ENABLE DIRECTOR BRANAM TO ENTER INTO A LOAN TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF A PROPERTY WE ARE CALLING THE GORDLEY HOUSE AND A SPECIAL AUTHORITY GRANT TO DEVELOP A BUSINESS PLAN FOR A CULTURAL CENTER TO BE LOCATED IN THIS HOUSE. SO THAT IS THE ACTION THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY. THE PROPERTY IS LOCATED IN THE INTERSTATE CORRIDOR URBAN RENEWAL AREA IN NORTH PORTLAND ON NORTH VANCOUVER -- EXCUSE ME, ON NORTH WILLIAMS AVENUE AT 4551 NORTH WILLIAMS AVENUE. THIS IS A PICTURE OF THE HOUSE, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 1,700 SQUARE FEET. THE LOT ITSELF IS ALMOST 6,100 SQUARE FEET, AND IT'S A RESIDENTIALLY ZONED LOT. WE'VE HAD THE PROPERTY APPRAISED AND THE APPRAISAL VALUE WAS APPROXIMATELY $434,000. THE WAY THAT THIS REQUEST CAME TO PDC, THIS STARTED REALLY BACK IN JULY, 2015, THE PROPERTY OWNERS, THE GORDLEY'S, THE FORMER SENATOR AND HER SISTER, APPROACHED PDC ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR ACQUIRING THEIR FAMILY HOME FOR THE PURPOSE OF UTILIZING THE HOME AS A CULTURAL CENTER FOR  AFRICAN-AMERICANS. OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL MONTHS, WE DISCUSSED THIS ACQUISITION WITH THEM AND ENCOURAGED THEM IF THIS WAS THEIR DESIRE TO FIND SOME PARTNERS THAT COULD WORK WITH THEM AROUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS CENTER. SUBSEQUENTLY, THEY HAVE DEVELOPED A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PORTLAND AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERSHIP FORUM, THE OREGON HISTORICAL SOCIETY AND SELF ENHANCEMENT, INC., WHICH IS THE FISCAL SPONSOR FOR THE PORTLAND AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERSHIP FORUM. AND THEY WILL BE THE ONE THAT WILL BE IF YOU APPROVE THIS ACTION, THEY WILL RECEIVE THE LOAN, THEY WILL RECEIVE THE GRANT AND ACT AS A FISCAL SPONSOR THE PORTLAND AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERSHIP FORUM WILL BE THE ENTITY THAT IS WORKING ON DEVELOPING A BUSINESS PLAN TO SEE WHETHER THIS PROPERTY IS FEASIBLE TO BE TURNED INTO A CULTURAL CENTER. AS I MENTIONED, RIGHT NOW, THE PROPERTY IS ZONED AS A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. IN ORDER FOR THE ENTITIES HERE TO TURN THIS HOME INTO A CULTURAL CENTER, THERE WILL BE NEED TO HAVE A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT  OBTAINED BY THE CITY AND THE ENTITIES WILL NEED TO DEVELOP A BUSINESS PLAN FOR OPERATING THE CENTER. SO WHAT WILL GO IN THE CENTER, HOW WILL IT BE FINANCED, WHAT KINDS OF IMPROVEMENTS MIGHT BE NEEDED ON THE BUILDING. SO AFTER DEVELOPING THE PARTNERSHIP, WE ENTERED INTO A PERIOD OF NEGOTIATION AROUND THE PROPERTY AND SORT OF SET OUT WHAT WOULD NEED TO BE DONE IN ORDER FOR US TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE PROPERTY OWNERS. SO THE TERMS OF THE LOAN, WE HAVE COME TO AN AGREED UPON PRICE OF $495,000, THAT IS MORE THAN THE APPRAISED VALUE. WHEN THE APPRAISAL CAME IN, THE PROPERTY OWNERS DID BRING BACK TO US SOME COMPARABLES THAT THEY FELT WERE A BETTER REPRESENTATION OF THE VALUE OF THE HOME. WE BROUGHT THAT BACK TO OUR APPRAISER, THE APPRAISER DECIDED THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO CHANGE THE APPRAISAL BUT IN LOOKING AT VALUES, THE RISING PROPERTY VALUES IN THE AREA AND OVER THE COURSE OF OUR NEGOTIATIONS, WE DETERMINED THAT A FAIR ASKING PRICE FOR THE PROPERTY IS THE 495, $495,000. THIS LOAN REALLY FUNCTIONS MORE AS A GRANT. WE ARE -- IT'S AS MUCH A GRANT AS A LOAN. WE ARE TRYING TO HELP THE ENTITIES TO OBTAIN THIS PROPERTY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMUNITY TO PUT A NONPROFIT, PUBLIC SERVING USE ON THE PROPERTY AND AS SUCH, WE NEGOTIATED A LOW INTEREST RATE FOR THIS LOAN AND FAVORABLE TERMS, SUCH AS PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST BEING DEFERRED AND THE LOAN DOES NOT COME DUE, EVERY TWO YEARS THE LOAN MATURES, BUT THE ENTITIES CAN REQUEST AN EXTENSION OF THE LOAN AND WE'VE AGREED THAT AS LONG AS THE PROPERTY CAN BE USED AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN CULTURAL CENTER, IT STILL IS FINANCIALLY VIABLE AND IS IN OPERATION AS SUCH OR IF THERE IS ANOTHER USE THAT IS IN SERVICE OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY, THAT THE LOAN WILL REMAIN IN PLACE. SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO SET THIS UP FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT. WE FEEL THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ASSET IN A RAPIDLY DEVELOPING, VERY HISTORICAL COMMUNITY THAT WAS HOME TO MANY AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES. WITH THE RAPID GENTRIFICATION AND CHANGE IN THIS COMMUNITY, THERE IS A DESIRE AND A NEED TO MAINTAIN AND REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THE HISTORY OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS PRESERVED IN THIS CORRIDOR. SO THE GRANT TERMS WOULD BE THAT WE HAVE AGREED THROUGH THE COURSE OF NEGOTIATION THAT FOR THE PERIOD OF TWO YEARS THAT WE WOULD PAY THE MAINTENANCE AND PROPERTY HOLDING COSTS FOR THE PROPERTY AND THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT THE ENTITIES IN FIGURING OUT WHETHER THEY CAN GET THEIR CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT AND HOW THE BUSINESS PLAN WOULD FUNCTION AND THE KINDS OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE THROUGH $50,000 PREDEVELOPMENT GRANT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS WE HAVE A MILESTONE IN PLACE IN THE LOAN THAT THE ENTITIES WOULD OBTAIN THAT CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT. IT'S NOT A ZONE CHANGE. IT'S RATHER A PERMIT TO USE THE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY FOR AN INSTITUTIONAL USE SO THEY WILL NEED TO SEEK THAT PERMISSION FROM THE CITY. AND THEY WILL NEED TO DEVELOP A BUSINESS PLAN AND ENSURE NOT ONLY  US, BUT THEMSELVES THAT THIS REALLY IS A VIABLE, FEASIBLE PLAN. SHOULD IT BE FEASIBLE, THERE WILL BE ANOTHER TWO-YEAR PERIOD IN WHICH THE ENTITIES CAN PUT THE CULTURAL CENTER INTO PLACE, DO WHATEVER TYPES OF IMPROVEMENTS AND CURATING OF THE PROPERTY THAT THEY NEED TO DO TO BECOME A CULTURAL CENTER. AND THEN AFTER THAT POINT, IT WOULD BE OPERATED AS A  CULTURAL CENTER. SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY -- THIS IS PRETTY MUCH THE TERMS OF THE DEAL. WE DO HAVE MEMBERS OF THE PORTLAND AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERSHIP FORUM HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND TO MAKE SOME REMARKS TO YOU AND OTHER INVITED GUESTS. I THINK BEFORE MAYBE ASKING ME ANY QUESTIONS IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO HEAR FROM THEM SO THEY CAN GIVE THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS IMPORTANT  PROJECT.  THANK YOU.  Kelly: IF WE CAN HAVE THEM UP, DR. T. ALLEN BETHEL, ETHAN JOHNSON, JESSE BEASON FROM POWELL, AND  MR. KERRY FROM OUR HISTORICAL SOCIETY. DO WE HAVE ENOUGH CHAIRS UP HERE? I'M NOT GOING TO PUT YOU IN ANY ORDER. I'M GOING TO LET YOU DECIDE THAT.  GOOD AFTERNOON, THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY ABOUT THE PROJECT THAT I AM TRULY EXCITED ABOUT. SUPPORTING COMMUNITY EFFORTS TO PRESERVE AND ENHANCE THE HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF BLACK PEOPLE IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN SAID IN SO MANY WORDS IN THE NORTHEAST PLAN AND THE INTERSTATE, IT'S PART OF WHAT THE PORTLAND AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERSHIP FORUM BELIEVES, AS WELL. WE LEVERAGE THE POWER OF OUR COMMUNITY'S COMBINED RESOURCES TO ADVANCE THE VISION OF A THRIVING BLACK COMMUNITY. WE DO THIS THROUGH SEVERAL WAYS, BUT ONE WAY MOST OUTSTANDING IS SUPPORTING COMMUNITY EFFORTS TO PRESERVE AND ENHANCE THE HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF BLACK PEOPLE. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT BETWEEN PDC, SEI, PALF AND THE COMMUNITY TO CREATE A PURPOSE OF THE TIF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOAL OF CREATING A VIBRANT AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT SPACE. THIS ALSO IS ONE WAY TO STRENGTHEN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY'S CAPACITY TO SUPPORT CULTURAL AND COMMUNITY ASSETS WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROJECT AND THE GREAT POTENTIAL OF A REPOSITORY FOR DOCUMENTS, ARTIFACTS AND A CULTURAL CENTER FOR EXHIBITS AND A KITCHEN TABLE DECISION WHERE WE SIT AROUND THE TABLE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP IMPROVE OUR COMMUNITY AND WHAT'S GOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITY IS GOOD FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS AND AROUND THE CITY OF PORTLAND. I'M ALSO COMMITTED TO THE PROJECT GOING FORWARD. THE NEXT STEPS THAT CONTINUE TO PROPEL THIS PROJECT FORWARD, TO COMPLETION, TO OPENING AND SUSTAINABLY OPERATING AND ON BEHALF OF PALF AND ALL THE INVOLVE PARTNERS, WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN APPROVING THIS PROJECT AND MOVING FORWARD TODAY. THANK YOU VERY  MUCH.  Kelly: THANK YOU.  GOOD AFTERNOON, THANK YOU, MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION, I'M A VOLUNTEER WITH PALF AND TO DATE HAVE SERVED AS THE LEAD ON THIS PROJECT. I WANT TO TOUCH ON OUR NEXT STEPS. YOU'VE HEARD STAFF MENTION, BUT PALF ALONG WITH OREGON HISTORICAL SOCIETY WILL SPEND NO MORE THAN TWO YEARS. NUMBER ONE WORKING WITH AN ARCHITECT AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT PROFESSIONALS TOCRAFT A VIABLE VISION FOR WHAT THE PROPERTY WILL BE. NUMBER TWO DEVELOPING THE LEGAL PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PALF AND OHS THAT MAY OWN THE PROPERTY AND THREE DEVELOPING A BUSINESS PLAN FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS AND PROGRAMMATIC WORK OF THE PROJECT. WE ARE EXCITED TO HAVE FACULTY FROM PSU'S BLACK STUDIES DEPARTMENT ALONG WITH OTHER COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS WHO WANT TO PLAY PIVOTAL ROLES IN HELPING SHAPE WHAT WE HOPE THIS PROJECT CAN BE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE TIME AND THE SPACE NEEDED TO DO THIS PROJECT RIGHT AND WITH THE INPUT OF SO MANY FROM THE PORTLAND BLACK COMMUNITY. I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND THANK PDC STAFF FOR BEING THOUGHTFUL AND HELPFUL THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. THEY ACTED SWIFTLY, AS SWIFTLY AS PUBLIC AGENCIES CAN WHEN WE ALL REALIZED THAT THE TIME THAT PALF AND OHS WOULD NEED TO PLAN FOR THIS PROJECT VERSUS THE EVER-ESCALATING MARKET REALITIES WOULD HAVE THREATENED THE LOSS OF YET ANOTHER BLACK-OWNED PROPERTY ALONG NORTH WILLIAMS. THEY HEARD US WHEN WE SAID THIS PROPERTY MEANS SOMETHING TO PORTLAND. THEY HEARD US WHEN WE SAID THAT THIS HAS BEEN AND CAN CONTINUE TO BE A VIBRANT AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT SPACE AND PDC STAFF HEARD US WHEN WE SAID WE DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS YET BUT GIVEN THE TIME AND THE ENGAGEMENT OF OUR COMMUNITY, WE CAN BUILD A VISION TOGETHER. I BELIEVE THAT THE COMMISSION HEARS THAT, TOO, AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT  TODAY.  Kelly: THANK YOU.  I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OREGON HISTORICAL SOCIETY. FOUNDED IN 1898 THE MISSION IS TO PROTECT THE STORIES, MEMORIES AND ARTIFACTS THAT DOCUMENT THE HISTORY OF OUR STATE AND OUR STATE'S RESIDENTS. WE DO THIS WORK THROUGH CARING FOR AND MAKING ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE OUR VAST COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL MATERIAL THROUGH OUR IMMUNE AND RESEARCH LIBRARY, THROUGH OUR ONLINE PUBLICATIONS TO THE OREGON HISTORICAL QUARTERLY AND THROUGH MANY MORE PROGRAMS. FOR THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS WITH PDC, PALF AND OTHERS ABOUT THE SUPPORT THAT OHS WOULD BE WILLING TO PROVIDE TO A CULTURAL CENTER COMMEMORATING AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY AND HERITAGE IN PORTLAND. THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN PRODUCTIVE AND REWARDING AND I BELIEVE THAT OHS WOULD HAVE MUCH TO OFFER SUCH A CENTER. EXAMPLES OF POSSIBLE COLLABORATION INCLUDE PROVIDING EXPERT COUNSEL ON THE CARE AND ARCHIVING OF HISTORIC RECORDS AND SPONSORING EXHIBITS AND PUBLIC PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON PORTLAND'S AFRICAN-AMERICAN HERITAGE AND HISTORY. OHS WAS DELIGHTED WHEN MULTNOMAH COUNTY VOTERS BY AN OVERWHELMING 79% MARGIN APPROVED THE RENEWAL OF THE OREGON HISTORICAL SOCIETY LEVY. ONE OF THE ORIGINAL PROMISES MADE WAS THAT OHS WOULD SPONSOR EXHIBITS AND PROGRAMS THAT RECOGNIZE MULTNOMAH COUNTY'S DIVERSE POPULATION. WE HAVE KEPT THAT PROCESS IN FORGING A CONNECTION WITH THE CULTURAL CENTER ENVISIONED IN THIS PROPOSAL WILL ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO SO FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.  HELLO. I'M ETHAN JOHNSON, AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN THE BLACK STUDIES DEPARTMENT AT PORTLAND STATE AND I'M REALLY, REALLY GLAD TO BE HERE TO SPEAK TO THE SUPPORT OF WHAT I THINK IS A ?Y NEEDED ENTITY, THE AVEL GORDLEY HOUSE OF BLACK HISTORY AND CULTURE. I'VE BEEN A PROFESSOR FOR 11 YEARS AT PORTLAND STATE UNIVERSITY. I STUDIED THE HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY EXPERIENCES OF BLACK PEOPLE IN MAINSTREAM INSTITUTIONS. THIS WORK HAS GIVEN ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM MY STUDENTS AND COURSES THE CONTINUING SIGNIFICANCE OF RACE AND RACISM IN THE CITY OF PORTLAND AND THE STATE OF OREGON. WE KNOW THAT BOTH THE CITY OF OREGON HAS A LONG HISTORY OF BOTH EXCLUSION OF AND DISINVESTMENT FROM COMMUNITIES OF BLACK PEOPLE AND OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THIS CITY AND STATE, FROM THE INITIAL EXCLUSION ACTS THAT MADE BLACK PEOPLE NONCITIZENS IN OREGON UP UNTIL 1926 TO THE RESCISSION OF THE 14th AMENDMENT IN 1867 AND ITS RERATIFICATION IN 1974 TO THE SUBSEQUENT SANCTIONED RACIAL, EDUCATIONAL SEGREGATION THAT MARKS MUCH OF THE 20th CENTURY AND UP TO THE PRESENT, TO THE POWERFUL FORMS OF POLICE BRUTALITY AND INCARCERATION THAT HAS CONTINUED THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF THIS STATE AND TO THIS DATE AND HAS RESULTED IN THE COMPLETE GENTRIFICATION OF WHAT HAS A CULTURALLY DEFINED BLACK SPACE IN PORTLAND, NAMELY WHAT I CALL THE ALBINA CORRIDOR. THE STATE SENATOR, SOUTH AFRICAN ACTIVIST EMBODIES THE RESISTANCE TO THIS HISTORY. AVEL ALONG WITH OTHER LEADERS IN THE SUPPORT OF MUCH OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS HELPED MOVE THE CITY OF PORTLAND AND THE STATE OF OREGON FORWARD TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL ISSUES. SHE IS A SENATOR AND PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN MOVING THE STATE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT LEGALLY EXCLUDED BLACK PEOPLE FROM THE STATE AND HAD THIS LAW REMOVED FROM THE CONSTITUTION. HE WAS A KEY LEADER IN MOVING PORTLAND MULTNOMAH COUNTY AND OREGON TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS SUPPORT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN APARTHEID SYSTEM WHICH RESULTED IN DIVESTMENT LEGISLATION. SHE HAS CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO HELP AND SUPPORT THE BLACK PEOPLE CAUGHT UP IN THE RACIALLY DISCRIMINATING POLICE SYSTEMS IN OUR STATE AND ORGANIZE AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF POLICING UPON BLACK PEOPLE IN PORTLAND. SHE IS A REPRESENTATIVE AND SYMBOL OF RESISTANCE TO THE POWERFUL FORMS OF RACIAL RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION AND GENTRIFICATION IN THE CITY OF PORTLAND -- I'M SORRY  AND FROM HER ATTENDANCE AT MOSTLY WHITE ALL-GIRL SCHOOLS TO HER WORK WITH THE MOJO HOUSE AND THE BLACK EDUCATION CENTER. LASTLY, I WOULD POINT TO HER EFFORTS TO HAVE THE CITY OF PORTLAND AND THE STATE OF OREGON RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURALLY RELEVANT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WHICH WE SEE IN THE CENTER FOR HEALING. AS WE KNOW THE SCHOLARLY LITERATURE HAS ESTABLISHED RACISM MAKES US SICK MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY. FOR ME SUPPORTING THE PURCHASE FOR A HISTORICAL AND CULTURAL CENTER IS A NO-BRAINER. IT IS HIGH TIME THAT THE CITY DEMONSTRATE CONSISTENTLY AND SUBSTANTIVELY THAT IT VALUES THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ITS BLACK CITIZENS TO THE POLITICAL, CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITY AND STATE AND HE CAN E AND I CAN THINK OF NO BETTER PLACE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT SUPPORT THAN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HOUSE OF BLACK HERITAGE AND CULTURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.  Kelly: THANK  YOU. DO WE HAVE QUESTIONS OF THESE FOLKS? YES.  THANKS VERY MUCH. THANKS FOR COMING TODAY. THIS IS REALLY INFORMATIVE, AND I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PROJECT. JUST CURIOUS. I NOTED THERE'S A LOT OF PIECES IN MOTION AND YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT THE DETAILS OBVIOUSLY, BUT HOW DO YOU ENVISION IT ACTUALLY WORKING AS A SPACE? DO YOU EXPECT TO HAVE TO DO A LOT OF ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BUILDING TO MAYBE EXPAND IT A LITTLE BIT? I THINK SOMEONE SAID THERE WAS 1,700 SQUARE FEET. HOW WILL THAT WORK IN TERMS OF PROBABLY HAVE RECORD STORAGE, EXHIBIT STORAGE AND OTHER THINGS. DO YOU JUST HAVE ANY -- CAN YOU GIVE US A FLAVOR FOR WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND?  I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT REALLY BIG THINGS AND REALLY SMALL THINGS. I THINK WHAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND AND WE HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER IS, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S NEEDED -- WHAT'S ALL THE VISIONS THAT ARE POSSIBLE, WHAT IS THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO DO THAT AND ALSO WHAT'S COMFORTABLE FOR THE GORDLEY FAMILY IN TERMS OF STILL MAINTAINING THE RELEVANCE OF THE HISTORICAL NATURE OF THE PROPERTY ITSELF VERSUS WHAT'S POSSIBLE. SO I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO TRY TO BRING TOGETHER AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO LIFT UP THE HOUSE A LITTLE BIT AND HAVE MORE SPACE IN THE BASEMENT, WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO ACTUALLY HAVE CONNECTED OR NEW BUILDINGS, BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE FEASIBLE. SO I THINK UNTIL WE BRING SOME SORT OF ALL THE PROPERTIES THAT BOTH KNOW WHAT IT  COSTS AND KNOW WHAT ALL THE LEGACIES WE'RE TRYING TO PRESERVE ARE, WE WON'T HAVE A LOT OF ANSWERS.  THANK YOU.  TWO THINGS. I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO HAVE A FOLLOW-UP AS THAT EVOLVES AND AN UPDATE ON WHAT DIRECTION YOU ARE HEADING. I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY INFORMATIVE FOR ME ANYWAY. TWO, I UNDERSTAND THE PROPERTY IS GOING TO BE VACANT IN THE INTERIM? IS THAT CORRECT AND MY CONCERN IS GENERALLY GOOD THINGS DON'T HAPPEN TO VACANT PROPERTIES. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN THERE IN THE INTERIM TO SECURE IT IN SOME FORM OR FASHION OR SOME KIND OF USE, I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SO.  AND WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ON EITHER SIDE. PDC STAFF WAS FAIRLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LIABILITY READILY TO SHORT-TERM USE OF THAT PROPERTY BECAUSE IT BECOMES A LOT MORE DIFFICULT AND CERTAINLY, IT'S MORE STAFF HEADACHE AND WE ALSO UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ABSOLUTELY EMPTY PROPERTIES HAVE THEIR OWN SOURCE OF LIABILITY.  I THINK YOU'VE GOT SOME REAL CREATIVE FOLKS AT THAT TABLE AND THEY CAN COME UP WITH IDEAS THAT WILL SATISFY STAFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  Kelly: SO OBVIOUSLY, AND THIS PROJECT PDC STARTS OUT AS A PRETTY MAJOR INVESTOR. I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT ARE THE FUNDING SOURCES? I THOUGHT I HEARD THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY MIGHT BE, BUT I DIDN'T HEAR AN AFFIRMATION OF THAT. NO? WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT YOU WOULD BE LOOKING TO?  ON THE CAPITAL SIDE?  Kelly: YEAH, OR THE OPERATIONS SIDE, BUT THE CAPITAL SIDE TO GET THE PROJECT TO THE FINISH LINE.  I DON'T THINK WE KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE CAPITAL SIDE AND PARTLY WHY, YOU KNOW, WE STARTED OUT THIS PROCESS THINKING THAT THE FAMILY WOULD OWN THE HOUSE WHILE WE WENT THROUGH THIS FEASIBILITY PROCESS. THAT NO LONGER BECAME FEASIBLE SO WE ARE TRYING TO BE HONEST THAT WE STILL DON'T KNOW A LOT OF ANSWERS AND WHAT THE FINANCING FROM PDC AND LETTING SEI HOLD THIS PROPERTY GIVES US THAT TIME AND SPACE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT QUALIFIES FOR ON THE CAPITAL SIDE. CERTAINLY ON THE PROGRAMMATIC AND OPERATING SIDE, WE HAVE HAD EARLY CONVERSATIONS WITH OHS ON HOW THEY MIGHT SUPPORT THAT PROGRAMMATICALLY AND PALF ITSELF AS AN ORGANIZATION IS GOING THROUGH ITS OWN INCORPORATION PROCESS AND OWN FINANCIAL PLANNING PROCESS THAT'S HAPPENING SIMULTANEOUSLY AND WE'VE ALREADY MADE GOOD PROGRESS ON THAT, BUT THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO AROUND THAT, AS WELL.  OHS'S MISSION IS HISTORY AND NOT REAL ESTATE DEVELOPING, OPERATING AS A JUNIOR PARTNER IN THIS, BUT OUR EXPERTISE WOULD BE PROVIDING EXHIBITS AND PROGRAMMING.  Kelly: I'M JUST TRYING TO PIN YOU DOWN A LITTLE BIT. [ LAUGHTER  ] WELL, AS SOMEBODY WHO'S DONE BUSINESS IN THAT AREA ALL OF MY LIFE I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PROJECT.  BEFORE YOU DO THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT, NOT A QUESTION. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE PROJECT IS TIMELY RIGHT? WE KNOW FROM A NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE, WE'VE GOT NOW THE SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE WITH AMERICA'S RECOGNITION THAT BLACK LIVES MATTER AND THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN CULTURE AND CONTRIBUTIONS ARE TREMENDOUS, AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S VALUE IN PURSUING A PROJECT LIKE THIS AND I COMPLETELY SUPPORT IT 100% AND WANT TO MAKE SURE, I AGREE THAT AS YOU MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT WE GET REGULAR PROGRESS UPDATES BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO START THE PROJECT AND TO GET THE UPFRONT MONEY, AND THEN IT'S ANOTHER THING TO KIND OF BRING IT TO FRUITION AND SEE IT SUSTAINED OVER TIME. I'M INTERESTED IN THE SUSTAINABILITY OF IT AND THAT IT REALLY HOLD THE VALUE THAT WE INTENDED IT TO HOLD INITIALLY. SO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK, DR. BETHEL IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU, KERRY, PROFESSOR. SO THANK YOU FOR THE  TIME TODAY AND I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT WILL COME ABOUT, BUT IT IS TIMELY. I THINK IT WILL SERVE A GREAT PURPOSE AND I ALSO WANT US TO BE VERY INTENTIONAL IN HOW WE SECURE THOSE SUPPORTS FOR SUSTAINABILITY.  Kelly: THE CHAIR WOULD ACCEPT A MOTION.  SO MOVED.  Kelly: WE HAVE A MOTION. DO WE HAVE A SECOND?  SECOND.  Kelly: WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ALL THOSE IN FAVOR SIGNIFY BY SAYING AYE. [ CHORUS OF AYES ] AYE. THE AYES HAVE IT, MOTION CARRIES. THANK YOU VERY  MUCH. OUR NEXT AGENDA ITEM IS REPORT 1653, RESOLUTION 7213, ACTION ITEM AUTHORIZING THE EXECUTION OF A LEASE AMENDMENT WITH SPAR-TEK INDUSTRIES FOR THE PORTLAND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION PROPERTY LOCATED AT 2221 NORTH ARGYLE STREET WITHIN THE INTERSTATE CORRIDOR URBAN RENEWAL AREA.  GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR KELLY, COMMISSIONERS, AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BRANAM. MY NAME IS SUE LEWIS, I'M A PROJECT MANAGER AND I'M HERE WITH STEVE BLANK TO PRESENT AN AMENDMENT TO THE LEASE AGREEMENT WITH SPAR-TEK. I WILL PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION, AND THEN I'LL HAND IT OVER TO STEVE WHO WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE THE DETAILS. THE PROJECT SITE IS WITHIN THE URBAN RENEWAL BOUNDARY HERE, SPECIFICALLY IN THE HEART OF THE KENTON NEIGHBORHOOD. WE'LL GO INTO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER HERE, WE'RE ON ARGYLE AND INTERSTATE. IN 2011, PDC HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE FOUR PARCELS ADJACENT TO TRIMET'S 2.2-ACRE SITE, AND THEN THEY HAD EXISTING TENANTS IN THE BUILDING WITH FIGURE PLANT AND  SPAR-TEK INDUSTRIES. IN 2012, DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS, PDC DECIDED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BUILDINGS RATHER THAN DEMOLISH THE BUILDINGS WHICH WOULD CREATE A VACANT SPACE AND WOULD HAVE DISLOCATED THESE BUSINESSES. SO WITH THE EXPANSION, WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS, FIGURE PLANT WAS ABLE TO INCREASE THEIR JOBS FROM FIVE TO 15 AND SPAR-TEK WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR MEDIUM TO HIGH-WAGE JOBS OF APPROXIMATELY 40 EMPLOYEES. ALSO WITH THE EXPANSION, PDC WAS ABLE TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL TENANT WITH SALVAGE WORKS WHO PROVIDES, SELLS VINTAGE SALVAGE LUMBER AND SELLS FURNITURE. WITH THEIR EXPANSION TO THIS SPACE, THEY WERE ABLE TO INCREASE THEIR JOBS FROM EIGHT TO 12 EMPLOYEES. AND SO IN 2015, PDC ALSO COLLABORATED WITH TRIMET AND CREATED A COMMUNITY FOCUS GROUP TO COME UP WITH SOME DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS AND HAVE A PHASING PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT. THE PHASING PLAN CAME WITH OBVIOUSLY TRIMET WOULD GO FIRST ON THEIR DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE IT'S A VACANT LOT AND THEN WOULD FOLLOW SPAR-TEK WOULD BE THE FOURTH PHASE WITH APPROXIMATELY EIGHT TO 12 YEARS OUT DEPENDING ON WHAT WOULD BE THE MARKET CONDITIONS AT THAT TIME. SO WITH THIS WE ALSO YOU'LL SEE THE PARKING LOT THERE WE ALSO HAD TO REMOVE SOME CONTAMINATED SOIL AND WITH THE COMMUNITY FOCUS GROUP, WE WERE ABLE TO INCLUDE UP TO SIX SPACES FOR FOOD CARTS. SO THESE NORMALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST A PARKING SPACE. SO THEY ARE NOW SPACED FOR UP TO SIX CARTS. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE WILL BE DEDICATING THE NELSON PLAZA, THE NELSON FAMILY. WE HAVE THREE CARTS THAT ARE ON SITE AT THIS TIME. SO PLEASE GO DOWN AND CHECK THEM OUT. THEY HAVE A VERY DIVERSE ARRAY OF FOOD AND, LIKE I SAID, WE'LL BE HAVING A DEDICATION AT THE END OF THIS MONTH. WITH JOB KILLS AND LIFE SKILLS. WE'RE UPGRADING THEIR HVAC SYSTEM. ONCE THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE STORE FRONT ARE DONE HOPEFULLY INCREASE THEIR CUSTOMER BASE. SO THAT WAS KIND OF QUICK BUT I'M GOING TO HAND IT OVER TO STEVE, WHO WILL GO OVER MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE AMENDMENT AND THEN IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS AT THE ENDS WE'LL TAKE THOSE.  THANK YOU, SUE. GOOD AFTERNOON, CHAIR KELLY, COMMISSIONERS. I'M STEVE BLANK. I WORK IN THE REAL ESTATE SERVICES SECTION OF THE INVESTMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AT PDC. WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT A LEASE AMENDMENT. I'M SURE COMMISSIONER EDLEN GETS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THESE KINDS OF TRANSACTIONS. A LEASE AMENDMENT WITH SPAR TECH INDUSTRIES FOR THE PROPERTY AT 2221 NORTH ARGYLE STREET WITHIN THE INTERSTATE RENEWAL AREA. THE RESOLUTION IS NUMBER  7213. ABOUT THE BUILDING, AS SUE MENTIONED, THIS WAS ONE OF FOUR PROPERTIES PDC ACQUIRED IN JULY OF 2011. AT THAT TIME THIS BUILDING WAS OCCUPIED BY  SPARTEK INDUSTRIES. IT HAS 30,000 SQUARE FEET OF WAREHOUSE AREA, 5,000 FEET OF OFFICE AREA. IT'S A WOOD FRAME AND METAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTED IN 1973, PROBABLY A CLASS C TYPE INDUSTRIAL BUILDING. SPAR TECH LEASE WAS COMMENCED IN 2005 WHAT. THEY DO IS PROVIDE ENGINEERING FABRICATION OF HIGH QUALITY MACHINERY FOR INDUSTRIES INCLUDING PLYWOOD, LAMINATED VENEER, LUMBER AND RUBBER PRODUCTS. OUR WORK FORCE IS CURRENTLY 40 PEOPLE. GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. STAFF HAS MET WITH SPARTECH, THE PRINCIPALS, TO TRY TO NEGOTIATE A RENEWAL OF THEIR LEASE WHICH EXPIRES AT THE ENDS OF NOVEMBER 2016. WE WERE ASSIGNED THE LEASE WHEN WE PURCHASED THE PROPERTY IN 2011. IT IS AN ABSOLUTE TRIPLE NET LEASE WHERE PDC HAS NO EXPENSE AT ALL IN THE OPERATION OF THE PROPERTY, BUILDING OR LAND. EVERYTHING IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE TENANT. SPARTECH ORIGINALLY REQUESTED THAT WE EXTEND THE LEASE FOR UP TO TEN YEARS. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FACILITATE THAT DUE TO THE FUTURE REDEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR THE AREA. WE AGREED AT SEVEN YEARS AS AN INCENTIVE TO HAVE THEM STAY THERE AND NOT INCUR A VACANCY ON THE PROPERTY AND ALL THE COSTS INCURRED WITH A VACANT PROPERTY, NOT BEING ABLE TO OFFER A LONG-TERM LEASE. WE NEGOTIATED A $100,000 LEASE RENEWAL INCENTIVE APPLIEDS A A 5,000 MONTHLY RENT CREDIT AGAINST THEIR BASE RENT OF $10,400 A MONTH CURRENTLY. IN ADDITION, THEY HAD ASKED FOR A TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCE AND WE NEGOTIATED A REIMBURSABLE ALLOWANCE WHERE WE WILL LEND $50,000 IN FORM OF A LOAN TO BE REPAID OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE AT 8% INTEREST. BOTH WILL BE USED BY SPARTECH TO RELOCATE TWO LARGE FABRICATION MACHINES THEY CURRENTLY LEASE FROM PDC IN THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET WHERE SALVAGE WORKS AND FIGURE PLANT ARE. THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE EXPANSION OF FIGURE PLANT TO TAKE THE REMAINDER OF THAT BUILDING. THEY WILL BE OUT OF THAT SPACE BY THE ENDS OF JANUARY. SO IT'S KIND OF A DOUBLE WIN IN THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER TENANT BEING ABLE TO EXPAND AND BRING ON MORE WORK FORCE AND RELOCATE SPARTECH INTO ONE BUILDING. THEY ARE ANTICIPATING BRINGING ON ADDITIONAL STAFF DUE TO THE FUNDS THAT THEY WILL HAVE AVAILABLE. AS I SAID THEY EMPLOY 40 AND ARE TOLD US THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THEIR WORK FORCE COULD GO UP TO 60 PEOPLE WITH THE USE OF THIS. THEY ARE LOOKING AT MODERNIZING THEIR OPERATIONS AND THE BUILDING HAS VERY, VERY BLAND FINISHES INSIDE. IT'S PROBABLY THE SAME FINISH AS WHEN THE BUILDING WAS BUILT. IF YOU GO INSIDE IT'S VERY, VERY OUTDATED. HOPEFULLY THEY CAN BRING IT UP TO A BETTER FINISH AND ATTRACT WORK FORCE THAT'S INTERESTED IN WORKING IN THAT TYPE OF BUILDING. THE LEASE INCOME TO PDC OVER THE SEVEN YEARS IS FORECASTED AT $847,148. THAT IS NET TO PDC WITH NO EXPENSES. THAT IS REALLY THE GIST OF THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH THEM. WE'RE ASKING FOR YOUR APPROVAL TO AUTHORIZE THIS LEASE AMENDMENT, AND APPROVE RESOLUTION 7213 AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. I'M SURE SUE IS HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS TOO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.   QUESTIONS?  I'M ASSUMING IT'S NET LEASE. [AUDIO NOT UNDERSTANDABLE] I I ASSUME THE TENANT IS PROCURING INSURANCE FOR THE BUILDING.  THE TENANT, YES, DOES HAVE CASUALTY AND LIABILITY INSURANCE.  IT LOOKS LIKE OUR TOTAL INVESTMENT I ASSUME THE LARGER PROPERTY,  5,807,000? IS THAT CORRECT?  THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLAGE OF PROPERTIES WE PAID IT WAS ACTUALLY WE PRICHARD ALL FOUR PROPERTIES AT A TOTAL PRICE OF 3,657,211.  THERE'S ANOTHER MILLION 650 AND ANOTHER 500.  WE HAVE INVESTED THE BUILDING THAT HOUSES FIGURE PLANT AND SALVAGE WORKS THE ORIGINAL PLAN WHEN WE ACQUIRED IT WAS FOR DEMOLITION AND BUILDING OF A MIXED USE PROJECT. HOWEVER, THE MARKET CONDITIONS AT THAT TIME AS SUE TALKED ABOUT DIDN'T WORK OUT, SO WE AS A CITY AGENCY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO HAD MAINTAIN BUILDINGS IN A GOOD CONDITION THAN MONEY WAS SPENT TOWARD FIRE, LIGHTS AND SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS.  TOTAL NET OPERATING INCOME OFFER THE. [AUDIO NOT UNDERSTANDABLE]  THE ONLY INCOME PRODUCING PROPERTY OTHER THAN THE SPARTECH BUILDING IS THE NELSON INDUSTRIAL BUILDING WHERE WE HAVE FIGURE PLANT AND SALVAGE WORKS. I'LL BE COMING BACK TO COMMISSION HOPEFULLY SOON WITH A PROPOSAL FOR FIGUREPLANT'S EXPANSION. THE FOOD CARTS WE'RE OFFERING A VERY, VERY NOMINAL RATE AS PART OF TRYING TO ACTIVATE THAT AREA. IT'S A COMMUNITY BENEFIT, AN AMENITY. I THINK THEY ONLY NEED TO PAY ONE OR TWO ENTREES A DAY TO PAY THE RENT THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR.  ONE COMMENT I MADE IN STAFFING IS WE GO TO SUSTAINABILITY, TRYING TO FIGURE OUR WAY FORWARD I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF WE CAN BRING THESE TO THE COMMISSION, WHAT THE NET OPERATING INCOME IS, THE WHOLE THING, WHAT WE HAVE INVESTED SO WE AS A COMMISSION AND YOU AS THE STAFF ARE MAKING CONSCIOUS DECISIONS. WE'RE GETTING OFF EACH ASSET, MAKE THAT CONSCIOUS DECISION ABOUT HOW MUCH ARE  WE DOING AS COMMISSION, AS ECONOMIC AND HOW DOES THAT FIT INTO LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY.  ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU.  WELL SAID, COMMISSIONER.  ANY QUESTIONS?  DITTO. IN TERMS OF GETTING THE --  OKAY. IN THAT CASE THE CHAIR WOULD ACCEPT A MOTION.  SO MOVED.  I HAVE A MOTION.  SECOND.  I HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ALL IN FAVOR SIGNIFY BY SAYING AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES]  MOTION CARRIES. THANK YOU BOTH.  THANK YOU. SO OUR NEXT AGENDA ITEM  IS ACTION ITEM DIRECTING SOME NUMBER 1654 REPORT NUMBER 15 -- 1654, RESOLUTION 7214, ACTION ITEM DIRECTING STAFF TO CREATE A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ENTITY. YOU'RE ON.  GOOD AFTERNOON, COMMISSIONERS. I'M JUSTIN DOUGLAS. I AM JOINED BY ALISON SWAGGER. WE'RE HAPPY TO PRESENT THIS TO YOU TODAY. I WANTED TO NOTE THAT SITTING UP HERE PRESENTING IN FRONT OF YOU ALL EVEN FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE DONE THIS MANY TIMES IT STILL CAN BE A NERVE-WRACKING EXPERIENCE. EVEN IF WE LOOK CALM THERE'S A LOT OF STRESS GOING ON INSIDE. ALISON HAS BEEN HERE NINE YEARS AND SOMEHOW MANAGED TO NEVER PRESENT IN FRONT OF THE BOARD, WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLE SKILL TO AVOID THIS. SO THIS HER FIRST TIME, SO WE ARE BOTH GOING TO BE NERVOUS, JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN ADVANCE.  OR IS THAT YOUR --  WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE SPACE. YOU GET NONE. SHE GETS A LOT OF SPACE.  I DON'T DESERVE IT. PARTICULARLY FOR JUST EMBARRASSING HER LIKE THAT. SO THANK YOU AGAIN. WE ARE HERE TO REQUEST THE BOARD APPROVE RESOLUTION 7214, WHICH WOULD DIRECT STAFF TO CREATE A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ENTITY. THIS IS BASICALLY THE FIRST STEP IN THE PROCESS FOR PDC TO BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE AND THEN DIRECT NEW MARKET TAX CREDITS TOWARDS PROJECTS IN PRIORITY PORTLAND NEIGHBORHOODS. SO THE STRUCTURE OF OUR PRESENTATION TODAY IS I'M JUST GOING TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE NEW MARKET TAX CREDIT PROGRAM THEN TALK ABOUT WHAT A CDE IS AND ITS ROLE IN THIS INITIATIVE, THEN AT A HIGH LEVEL TALK ABOUT WHAT ELIGIBLE PROJECTS ARE. THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER IN PORTLAND THAT HAVE RECEIVED NEW MARKET TAX CREDITS. YOU'LL SEE PHOTOS THROUGHOUT THIS ONE EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEHIND THE TEXT THERE IS THE UNION GOSPEL MISSION. THERE WILL BE OTHER SLIDES THAT SHOW THE FLAVOR OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN IN THE PAST. THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO ALISON. SHE'S DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON WHAT OTHER CITY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE PDC, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY, WHAT THEY HAVE DONE RELATED TO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ENTITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND HOW HAS THAT HAS INFORMED OUR THINKING ABOUT IT. WE DID SOME MAPPING OF ELIGIBLE NEIGHBORHOODS FOR NEW MARKET TAX CREDITS. I'LL CLOSE BY TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE FEEL IS THE STRONG CONNECTION TO OUR STRATEGIC PLAN AND WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE IN THIS PROCESS. THE NEW MARKET TAX CREDIT PROGRAM WAS AUTHORIZED IN THE YEAR 2000, SO IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR 16 YEARS. THE INTENTION OF THE PROGRAM ALWAYS HAS BEEN TO ATTRACT PRIVATE INVESTMENT BY  ALLOWING INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS TO RECEIVE A CREDIT AGAINST THEIR FEDERAL INCOME TAXES BY MAKING INVESTMENTS IN WHAT ARE CALLED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ENTITIES. SO BASICALLY THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT AN INVESTOR, TYPICALLY BANKS, MAKE INTO CDE'S THEY GET A FEDERAL TAX CREDIT GUARANTEED OVER A SEVEN-YEAR PERIOD. THE CDES IN TURN THEN USE THE INVESTMENTS TO MAKE LOANS OR INVESTMENTS IN BUSINESSES IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THAT IS SOMEWHAT OF A TERM OF ART FOR THE NEW MARKET TAX CREDITS PROGRAM AND WE'LL TOUCH ON THAT  LATER. YOU'LL NOTE THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT AWARDS SINCE THE PROGRAM WAS AUTHORIZED IN 2000, SO 43.5 BILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED IN THE MOST RECENT ROUND IN 2014 THERE WERE 3.5 BILLION ALLOCATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I WILL SAY, THIS IS A VERY COMPETITIVE PROGRAM AND WE HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT FOR JUST ABOUT EVERY DOLLAR OF REQUESTS FOR ALLOCATION THERE'S PROBABLY -- I'M SORRY FOR EVERY DOLLAR AWARDED FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY THERE'S EIGHT OR NINE OR $10 IN NEED FROM CDES APPLYING FOR IT. BY NO MEANS IT'S A SLAM DUNK THAT IF WE WERE TO CRETE A CDE AND APPLY FOR NEW MARKET TAX CREDITS UH ABOUT WE THINK WE'RE IN A STRONG POSITION TO COMPETE. SO WHAT IS A CDE? PDC CANNOT APPLY TO RECEIVE NEW MARKET TAX CREDITS BECAUSE WE'RE NEITHER A DOMESTIC CORPORATION OR A PARTNERSHIP. IN ORDER TO CREATE A CDE, WE WOULD NEED TO CREATE THE LEGAL ENTITY THAT WOULD BE THE VEHICLE TO APPLY FOR NEW MARKET TAX CREDITS. ANOTHER REQUIREMENT IS THAT THE CDE HAS THE PRIMARY MISSION OF SERVING LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME PERSONS. THE WAY THAT THE CDE MAINTAINS ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT IT IS SERVING IS THROUGH ITS GOVERNING STRUCTURE. A CDE CAN HAVE A GOVERNING BODY OR GOVERNING BODY AND ADVISORY BODY AND THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS ON THE PEOPLE WHO SERVE ON THOSE BODIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE REPRESENTING THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE CERTIFICATION ITSELF IS A ROLLING PROCESS SO IF THE BOARD WERE TO APPROVE THIS ACTION TODAY WE WOULD ACT IMMEDIATELY TO APPLY. SOMETHING THAT'S AUTHORIZED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THE TAX CREDITS THEMSELVES ARE OIN' A MORE STRUCTURED SCHEDULE. I'LL GET TO THAT  LATER. I ALLUDED TO WHAT SOME OF THE PROJECTS ARE. YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS LIST THAT THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY ELIGIBLE FOR NEW MARKET TAX CREDIT ALLOCATIONS ARE ONES THAT INVOLVE THE ACQUISITION, REHABILITATION OR CONSTRUCTION OF REAL ESTATE OR THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING OPERATING BUSINESSES AND IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THEY TYPICALLY ARE WHAT YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN. THEY ARE PROJECTS THAT CREATE JOBS, KEEP JOBS, OFFER COMMUNITY FACILITIES. SOMETIMES MIXED USE PROJECTS. IF THEY ARE THEY TEND TO BE MORE FOCUSED ON THE COMMERCIAL THAN THE RESIDENTIAL  SIDE. SO I'LL TURN IT OVER TO ALISON. SHE CAN TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT RESEARCH SHE'S DONE INTO WHAT OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE DOING AND HOW THAT'S HELPED INFORM OUR WORK.  IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE PDC HAS BEEN IN THE NEW MARKET GAIN. WHAT WE FOUND IS IT'S MUCH MORE COMMON THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED FINDING FOR CITY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO CREATE CDEs. WE IDENTIFIED AT LEAST 20 LARGER MUNICIPALITIES THAT HAVE CREATED THEIR OWN, AND THE CDEs LISTED HERE ARE ALSO CONTROLLED BY THOSE CITIES OR ARE AFFILIATED DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY WON AT LEAST ONE ALLOCATION. SOME HAVE WON MANY OVER THE YEARS, ST. LOUIS BEING A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT. AS JUSTIN NOTED IT'S A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE PROCESS EVEN THE PORTLAND FAMILY FUNDS DIDN'T WIN AN ALLOCATION IN THEIR FIRST ROUND. WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE A SOLID TRACK RECORD THROUGH PDC AND A COMPELLING PIPELINE OF PROJECTS FOR WHEN WE APPLY FOR THE ALLOCATION. WE ALSO DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD BE COMPETING WITH CDEs IN OREGON. CRAFT 3, WHICH IS ACTUALLY BASED IN WASHINGTON, THEY HAVE NOT APPLIED FOR AN ALLOCATION IN A NUMBER OF YEARS. UNITED FUND ADVISORS HAVE NOT BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON THE PORTLAND MARKET AS YOU KNOW. ECO-TRUST HAS A CDE, AND THEY HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT THEY OPERATE PRIMARILY IN THE RURAL MARKETS. WE SPOKE WITH ECOTRUST EARLIER THIS WEEK AND THEY WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PLAN. WE DISCUSSED POTENTIALLY PARTNERING ON PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE. THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO OTHER CITY SPONSORED CDEs IN OREGON. SO WE ALSO FOUND THAT CDEs RUN THE GAMUT STRUCTURALLY. WE'RE PROPOSING A CLOSELY HELD NONPROFIT ENTITY SUCH AS A PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION. THIS TYPE OF ENTITY WITH THE PDC BOARD SITTING AN THE GOVERNING BOARD WOULD ALLOW FOR MAXIMUM TRANSPARENCY SUBJECT TO PUBLIC RECORDS AND PUBLIC MEETINGS LAWS. OUR GOAL IS TO KEEP THE MONEY LOCAL AND WE WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON PROJECTS CONSISTENT WITH CDEs STRATEGIC PLAN. THIS IS A DEPARTURE FROM THE ENTITY IN 2002, THE PORTLAND FAMILY FUNDS, WHICH WAS STRUCTURED WITH A SEPARATE BOARD. ULTIMATELY OPERATED AS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE ENTITY FROM PDC. SO AS JUSTIN POINTED OUT EARLIER, WE MUST MEET THAT ACCOUNTABILITY TEST MEANING THAT AT LEAST 20% OF THE GOVERNING OR ADVISORY BOARD IS REPRESENTATIVE OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN PORTLAND. WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT AS CLOSE TO 100% AS POSSIBLE OF THE ADVISORY BOARD CONNECTICUT OF LOW INCOME REPRESENTATIVES. ONE OF THE MAIN RULES WOULD BE TO VET THE PROBLEM JECTS IN THE PIPELINE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHICH ARE FUNDING PRIORITIES. THE BOARD MEMBERS HOW DO THEY MEET THE ACCOUNTABILITY TEST? THEY MEET IT MOST COMMONLY BY LIVING IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OR BY OTHERWISE REPRESENTING INTERESTS OF THOSE RESIDENTS. THAT COULD MEAN THAT THEY ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN THEORY AREAS, EMPLOYEES OR BOARD MEMBERS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT PRINCIPALLY SERVE THOSE AREAS AS WELL. WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN THE PROCESS OF SOLICITING INTEREST FROM OUR NEIGHBORHOOD ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LEADERSHIP GROUP AND CENTRAL CITY BUDGET ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR THOSE POSITIONS SOME OF THE WHERE ARE OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES? HERE THEY ARE. SO THE PROGRAM IS BASED ON CENSUS TRACKS WITH QUALIFYING TRACKS REFLECTING A POVERTY RATE OF AT LEAST 20% TYPICALLY PROJECTS ARE PLACED IN 30% OR HIGHER AREAS. OR MEDIUM INCOMES BELOW 80% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOMES. THIS MAP ILLUSTRATES THE QUALIFYING TRACKS IN PORTLAND. WE ALSO SHOW THE OVERLAY OF OUR URBAN RENEWAL AREAS AND NEIGHBORHOOD PROSPERITY ISSUES IN PURPLE. A LITTLE BIT HARD TO SEE.  WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS A COMPELLING VISUAL. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE CONNECTIONS ARE STRATEGIC IS THAT IN PLACES LIKE GATEWAY AND LENTZ, ENTIRELY WITHIN NEW MARKET TAX CREDIT ELIGIBLE, IF WE ARE ABLE TO GET AN ALLOCATION IT WILL ALLOW GREATER LEVERAGE AND IT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT FOR WHAT IT CAN LEVERAGE OUTSIDE URBAN RU NEW AL AREAS. EVEN WITHIN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD PROSPERITY INITIATIVE DISTRICTS WHICH AS YOU KNOW HAVE VERY SMALL INCREMENTS OF T.I.F. GENERATION. SO THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY CAPITAL THAT WOULD FOCUS ON THESE PROJECTS PARTICULARLY IN PLACES LIKE EAST PORTLAND WE FEEL IT WOULD BE AN INCREDIBLY VALUABLE TOOL TO US. AS ALISON MENTIONED THIS WOULD REALLY HAVE THE CDE WOULD BE FOCUSED SOLELY ON THE PORTLAND MARKET. THERE'S NOBODY ELSE DOING THAT AND WE FEEL THERE'S A ROLE TO PLAY. AS CHAIR KELLY AND EDLEN KNOW, YOU HEARD THE 50% DRAFT THAT WAS PRESENTED, CREATING A CDE WAS ONE OF THE ACTION ITEMS THAT THE FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED THAT PDC PURSUE. WE FEEL THIS IS IN LINE WITH OUR STRATEGIC PLAN GOALS AND LONG TERM BUSINESS PLAN AND FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY  GOALS. AS FAR AS NEXT STEPS, I ALLUDED TO THIS IN THE PAST. AGAIN, IF YOU WERE TO AUTHORIZE THE CREATING THE CDE, WE WOULD GET RIGHT ON IT AND SUBMIT AN APPLICATION TO BECOME A CDE WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO. WHAT THAT WOULD DO IS IT WOULD POSITION PDC THROUGH THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ENTITY TO BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR THE AWARD. SO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY WE EXPECT THEM TO ANNOUNCE THE NEXT ROUND OF NEW MARKET TAX CREDIT AWARDS IN EARLY 2017. THERE'S TYPICALLY ABOUT A THREE-MONTH APPLICATION PROCESS, BUT THERE THERE'S AS WE MENTIONED BEFORE THOSE APPLICATIONS ARE VERY COMPETITIVE, SO WE WOULD GET STARTED ON THAT EVEN BEFORE THE NEW YEAR AND HOPEFULLY RECEIVE NOTICE OF AN ALLOCATION IN THE FALL OR WINTER OF 2017. SO THAT IS OUR INTENTION. WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS .  IT'S REALLY MORE FOR MY FELLOW COMMISSIONER. I'M NOT A LAWYER. ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE IS DOES THAT PUT US AS BOARD MEMBERS IN A FIDUCIARY ROLE, AND DOES THAT CREATE ADDITIONAL LIABILITY FOR US AS  INDIVIDUALS? I FULLY ENCOURAGE MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS. I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. WHEN YOU GET THAT FIRST AWARD I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US THINKING ABOUT DIRECT INVESTMENT AS OPPOSED TO BROKERING THEM OUT TO OTHERS BECAUSE THE LEVERAGE CAN BE INCREDIBLE. YOU OWE US WHATEVER LIABILITY IT PUTS ON US IN A FIDUCIARY ROLE.  REALLY GOOD POINT.  CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT? WE DID LOOK INTO THAT, COMMISSIONER.  YEAH, I UNDERSTAND WE WERE GOING TO GET A BIG RAISE FOR DOING THIS. [LAUGHTER]  DOUBLE.  20% OF NOTHING. [LAUGHTER]  BOB BET CONE, THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE BOARD WILL FUNCTION ON BEHALF OF THE CDE, SO SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE LLC WE CREATED RECENTLY THE BOARD WILL HAVE A UNIQUE ROLE THERE. IT WILL HAVE A FIDUCIARY DUTY BUT UNLIKE WHAT YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH IN THE CASE OF A MULTIPLE MEMBERS OF AN LLC, THIS BOARD WON'T HAVE A DUTY TO ANOTHER MEMBER OR ANOTHER SHAREHOLDER IF YOU WILL IN THE CASE OF A CORPORATION. SO ITS DUTY IS PRIMARILY TO ITSELF. IN TERMS OF LIABILITY AND LIABILITY PROTECTION, WE WILL ENSURE EITHER THAT PDC'S INSURANCE IS COVERING THE BOARD IN ITS CAPACITY AS A SOLE AND CONTROLLING MEMBER OF THE CDE, OR AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE CASE OF THE NEWLY FORMED LLC, WE'LL BUY INDEPENDENT INSURANCE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S INDEPENDENT COVERAGE FOR ANY ACTIONS TAKEN ON BEHALF OF THE CDE.  THE MAIN RISK, AGAIN I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY, THE MAIN RISK WOULD BE IF ONE OF THE DEALS GETS UNWOUND AND THE INVESTOR AT THAT POINT IN TIME IS GOING TO BE LOOKING  FOR SOMEBODY SOMEBODY WITH BIG TEETH.  I AGREE. IN THE  BOARD REPORT THIS MATTER. TYPICALLY AN INVESTOR BANK WOULD CEEK AN INDEMNITY I THINK. THAT'S A NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP CONTROL POTENTIAL LIABILITY IN THE WAY WE FORM THAT INSTRUMENT.  THANK YOU.  ARE WE INSULATED TO SOME DEGREE BY ACTING IN OUR OFFICIAL CAPACITY? I'M NOT AS WELL-VERSED IN MY MUNICIPAL LAW AS MAYBE I SHOULD BE IN THIS ROLE, BUT ISN'T THERE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PROTECTION THAT WE GET JUST BY ACTING IN OUR OFFICIAL CAPACITY IN THIS ROLE?  YES, COMMISSIONER CRUZ, THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THERE'S A STATUTE THAT GOVERNS THAT WHICH YOU'RE REFERRING TO. IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY HAVE THE BOARD DEFACTO COVERED OR INDEMNIFIED BY ITS PUBLIC BODY IN ITS PUBLIC ROLE. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A QUESTION WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING MULTIPLE HATS ON, HAVE YOU STEPPED OUTSIDE THAT ROLE. WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOU WONDER ABOUT THAT, SO OUR FIRST ACTION IS TO MAKE SURE OUR EXISTING COVERAGE IS GOING TO EXTEND TO COVER YOU. WE WOULD BE BRINGING UP THAT STATUTE WITH OUR EXISTING INSURANCE COVERAGE PARTNERS. THEN IF IT DOESN'T OR IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION, THEN, WE'LL BE BUYING NEW COVERAGE JUST AS A BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY MEASURE I WOULD SAY.  THANK YOU.  COMMISSIONER IS ASKING CAN WE DEFER THE VOTE UNTIL WE GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE INSURANCE? I GUESS MY COMMENT WOULD BE WE COULD PUT THAT AS PART OF OUR MOTION APPROVING THAT WE HAVE SATISFACTORY INFORMATION. I FIRST OF ALL AM FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW I SPENT THE LAST 15 YEARS SERVING ON ADVISORY COMMITTEES FOR PORTLAND FAMILY OF FUNDS AND MY THOUGHT IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS A LONG TIME AGO. THAT THE TOOL IS A TREMENDOUS ONE AND I'M ANXIOUS TO GET IT MOVING. WE DID THINGS LIKE THE COMMUNITY TRANSITION SCHOOL ON KILLINGSWORTH. SO THERE MAY BE PROJECTS THAT WE CAN USE AS FUNDING FOR THE HELP WITH THE HOMELESS ISSUE WE WERE JUST HEARING ABOUT. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES. IF WHAT COULD WE PUT AN AMENDMENT ON OUR APPROVAL OR WHAT WOULD BE THE WAY TO DO THAT?  YOU CERTAINLY COULD PUT AN AMENDMENT OF ANY SORT THAT YOU DESIRE. I WOULD OFFER UP ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE WHICH MIGHT BE TO MAKE -- SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR PLANS BUT ALSO NOT LEAVE ANY COMMISSIONERS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ISSUE, YOU COULD MAKE THE APPROVAL AND ALLOW STAFF TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CREATION OF THE ENTITY BUT TO MAKE CONDITIONAL ANY ACTS OF THE ENTITY CONDITIONAL UPON THE BOARD'S SATISFACTORY REVIEW OF WE WOULD CALL IT LIABILITY MANAGEMENT MEASURES WHICH IS BASICALLY GOING TO BE AN INSURANCE.  SO THE CHAIR WOULD ACCEPT A MOTION WITH A CONDITION TO THAT EFFECT.  SO MOVED.  SECOND.  I HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND. ALL IN FAVOR SIGNIFY BY SAYING AYE. [CHORUS OF AYES]
