 we run our panels a little bit differently at least I do you are the fifth panels or six panels so anytime you have a question stand up raise your hand will bring a microphone over to you and we'll stop mid subject and answer your question and then at the end we'll also have a Q&A these are some of the leading marketing executives in this industry and they have some amazing things to talk about today it's going to be very very interesting direct response versus brand awareness and as a marketer myself as a marketing dort for myself I find that hard to quantify always so I'm interested in what you guys are going to have to talk about but first let's start off with introducing yourself what you do wait who you represent your company and give a 15 second commercial about your company and

not what we do so I was very happy to get to join the panel I do have something to tell you if you looking for any kind of technology for a brokerage all you have to do is walk out the door turn right

alternative investments so very very specific nation investments and your cover name is what invezz.com wow how expensive was that URL I come with the over 20 years experience a lot of popular line i joined invezz.com after a few years with Volga okay no probably no longer I was heading the international expansion of that part great all right let's jump right in unless you have any questions you have any questions please stop me then you given time first question very vague very general how do you believe brand awareness can impact direct response no particular order I think from a sports marketing perspective if I talk about that when I talk about brand awareness we can talk about brand awareness team sports sponsorship then I think brand awareness can have a very important impact on direct response brands that are relatively new forex brokers are quite new in the main who then partner with an organization that might be a hundred years old such as a established football club automatically then how's that synergy of credibility it's building up trust and all of those I think an impact directly on the way that the brand can then use it in die response marketing the other key aspect of brand awareness when you're talking about sports sponsorship is that you have access to a large number of assets use of player images marks things that you can then translate back into your direct response advertising that then creates a direct link so it's a good combination brand awareness been used in direct response but i think the trust elements an important aspect and i think also there's a subconscious in brand awareness it along it's a longer term impact opposite in direct response but i think you're one of the key things that we often overlooked is that you're targeting people for forex trading where they the age is 18 20 years old brand awareness can also target those people who are watching TV or 16 17 years old who might be your next clients and so you're subconsciously targeting your future customers through brand awareness as well so you're saying brand awareness why so let's say sponsor a soccer team sorry football team yes sponsor a football team I get my name on their shirt and if people see that my name is on their shirt now I'm real and they'll feel safer on depositing with me and all my other direct response activities will work better because my name is undershirt it's giving you credibility you'll not only been on that show but you're being seen advertising next to other well established brands as well not also partners at that sports organization and you're part of a family of established credible brands i think i'd like to take the next next approach I'd like you to think about marketing as a as a holistic approach it's not direct marketing direct response versus brand awareness it's a package and i'm going to give an example that's nothing to do with our industry how many people have booked a holiday over the last 12 24 months how did you do it's really simple you start with a level of discovery you find out what's going on who's recommending what how it works before you even got to the point of any direct response you've done your homework you will choose not necessarily the cheapest you will choose the best value for money you would choose something that feels right for you so unless you've built the package around it you're not going to see the the current response that you want so it's not direct direct response versus brand awareness it's all of it as an illicit package it's a story that he gauges with your potential uses your potential clients okay at the end I think it's the questions may be also misleading because actually whenever you do something you want to have a response so even if you make an awareness campaign you want that there is in these response so you're fishing for seniors that shows you there is a kind of attention that can be people who watch the video who opt in or opt out of the video and you can measure the Google molarity indexes so to see so so at the end rh I think it's difficult to say okay there is on one end there is awareness and the other end there is direct response you you should see that you said as a whole and that's course proof of evidence that if you have a higher reminisce there is trust and then you will have better response and this is this is proven again and again okay I think that definitions are very very important so what is brand awareness it means there is a brand and brand is not just sponsoring it's actually to be clear on your messaging clear on your target audience clear the prioritization of messages your USP if you have all those if you've done your research and planning accordingly your direct response materials will be spot-on because there will be consistency there will be a message you'll be standing out with your message and that will be effective you can't exist without understanding your brand or creating a brand I'll give a maybe a numerical answer if you take two brands one with an established brand awareness with a certain level of trust and some brand new company in the market that doesn't have any brand awareness then given the same ads same landing pages and everything you will see and this is something that we've seen in in our company when we marketed different kind of dance that you get you get much better results in terms of click-through rate conversion rate and ultimately cost per acquisition you can be double or triple for new brand without awareness and without trust so if a brand awareness aspect it's not always about sponsoring a Formula One team or I don't sponsoring some big name what other activities can consider brand where even the even running goods on generic terms in a certain respect may lead to larger build recognition and awareness for the brunt even if I'm asked even if I'm giving an offer but I'm blasting it out there and I don't care about my click-through rate I just want I balls on it that's brand awareness correct it's a trend response ed but used in a brand awareness aspect would that be safe to say that response activities are very very effective for brand awareness so there is no it's really the blaring a differentiation between the two it was proven over and over again that whether it's PPC or Facebook mentions or whatever the exposure in the right manner will build your brand so what is that right manner I mean both mediums should be used in effective way we've already agreed that yes we all agree what does that mean to these guys what does that I want to want to take again a slightly different slump from everybody else on the panel I think firstly let's talk about the direct response and in the effectiveness of review earning direct response campaigns you know that the doubt that your remarketing campaigns are working much better than your keyword campaigns that I think most people have heard the same thing and that's their gums some way towards brand awareness but brand awareness isn't about spending money you can use content marketing smart content marketing get your story out to the public and it gets what your message that you want to give in a way that's that's very effective if you can find a way of writing good quality content that's not selling your product but assisting a buying decision then you are creating your own brand awareness so through SEO obviously it's not just SEO it's about providing value it helps you a CEO why does it help us here because Google's trying to achieve exactly the same results that you trying to achieve they're trying to achieve a good quality search result which means I've searched for something and the top results that I get back answer the questions that I've put into the search engine ok so if I've written good quality content that actually matches it then the Google's done its work I don't have to sell my products through my content I need to just provide good quality trusting even even if it doesn't mention my company at all as far as the context is concerned just as the author I've become a brand authority in that area and i think that's that's a way that a lot of companies can recite brand away i just want to stop you guys one second i want to know who we're talking to so how many brands out there how many brokers out there are relatively new less than two years old raise your hands high so ok not so many all right so now we know who we're talking to we're talking to established brands I think that in theory it's it's true that content marketing is a contribution to to brand awareness or reinforcing the brand there is an authority in the field however when you're talking about is saturated field such as Forex or binary options whereas huge amount of contact is written every way and most search results will go to big tatas such as investing.com and others you should build a strategy that is not an inland on common marketing you mentioned marketing which is a great way for doing some kind of Micro Micro maybe micro blending for certain type of audience that already visited you you can be perceived if done right you can be perceived as big is bigger than you are of course if you have the budgets then I would say that definitely sponsoring Liverpool or Arsenal does affect the perception of your brand and a zoo a potential trailer to deposit with you even if it doesn't make sense logically if your name is on the shirt psychologically the trailer will feel more confidence to deposit with you than with an unknown name okay so for the new brokers out here you got a choice to cut through the clutter because there's a lot of brokers let's face it is this market is getting very saturated very cluttered everyone's offering the same product virtually maybe some little tweaks of changes here but you're all the same for the most part you can just change the color of your banner and you're all saying the same thing now your choices sponsor Liverpool finished you're now on the map people know who you are if you don't have the deep pockets the log arms to do that what do they do I think different opportunities if you again talking about sports sponsorship because there's opportunities to look at smaller sponsorships on a regional level and focus on one key market instead of going global so many sports rights holders now offer the opportunity to become the official sponsor in Brazil Mexico Scandinavia and bring the cost down by focusing on one market can I ask you the cost I mean what is the cost of liver liverpool vs i don't know a local team give me a local team and that's so not familiar at the sakura apologize if you're talking about sponsoring a shirt of a top team like that you're talking about 25 30 million pounds a year if you're talking about a smaller level official partnership deal you're talking anywhere from a million pounds upwards that's getting more expensive now because Barclays are coming out of the Premier League so there's more branding opportunities or even a smaller teams over a million smaller teams you can go right down and do deals through the through the levels I've done deals with browns in other leagues for as little as a thousand okay you'll know for a newer brand that's feasible right a hundred thousand 1 million you know when you CEO saying how many accurate soundly actives it's tough to as a marketer so whistling boy we're also seeing a trend now that's you know so many brokers are doing football sponsorship deals that the new brokers I think it's also interesting to try and find a point of difference if you're talking about sponsorship and we're seeing a big trend at the moment for brand ambassadors where forex companies and binary brands are becoming more personal with the marketing and the lining with an individual and those types of deals can be much more cost-effective as well and agents say like our words potentially but they also offer great success if you get it right and this is also content that brands can use in their direct response marketing as well okay that's one side of it if the CEO says no you don't have the budget for that I don't see the purpose of me putting up a teacher with signature of the team in my office I don't care about that what else can you do for these guys I think there are many opportunities and especially with the new media's the social media is where we can really find the targeting so first you have to define what is your brand what other people you want to talk to building clusters and then using the new platforms which are there and here the good thing is actually first the good targeting possibilities that you have and second you can then track and you can based on the tracking you can real-time optimization and really getting better and better we heard we've everything you do we heard retargeting is very very effective yes if you find the right partner with retargeting you can really really super impose your brand make you look much bigger for very desperate that you can do retargeting 14 very small audience right right you can do remarketing on similar groups so I can take like a like an area that that I can match like a search history and I can actually make my brand bigger on remarketing okay you guys are you guys got that yeah remarketing is very very key if you don't know what that means you learn okay now do a method that you can use its first I think Gil you're targeting is very important to you you go off come out is strong in a certain gale and focus your efforts on certain girl understand the Guardians k to give a message towards this geography either it's the Spanish market or whatever so geo-targeting is we're still talking digital yeah yeah I say a traditional we want to take you again in with different route yeah I think that's why I was given at Oscar Wow ten years ago I years ago to launch a mobile because you know from scratch mobile casino mobile casino I was given a huge budget forty thousand pounds a month for four months okay on a market that didn't exist because it was on java nokia handset and there were no other real big competitors in the market and told bring me a hundred grand back and gross win by the end of the four months okay so what what do you do so we put a little bit into a digital a little bit into print we we knew that the print was somewhere in between the direct response and the brand awareness we sponsor to snooker players we didn't sponsor number one and number two we sponsored in the top 16 it was a ryan davis and michael the hit men halt yeah yeah having it man when you're running a casino and we sponsored a gamble style race through through london but most of all we worked the journalists on gadget magazines why because we focus we focused down we talked about geo focus we talked about focus not on just the UK market we specifically profiled who is going to be our number one target audience by age by demographic by what they work at what their lifestyle was like we built a tree we've built we've built our client we profiled our client he had a name his name was jack we knew exactly where we would find him we knew exactly where we would bind them outside our ecosystem as well so that way we could reach out we can make every single dollar count as far as like building the brand incidentally at work got 150 the end of the four months you can do it you can do it on a small budget you don't have to go that far out you don't have to sponsor around the drip from day one you can find your way right through and make forty thousand pounds of a month work for you again I'm hearing geo-targeting geo demographic targeting know your focus market group and you speak to them directly so you stole your data install one area where Jack was and you ignore it everything else yes exactly and from that point on you then build your deeper pockets to go out and find John and then you build your pockets again and you say now I want to find hums we're gonna find peer if you start back in one spot and you make sure that every single dollar you spend you can you can really make yourself bigger than you are okay is facebook here facebook for you out here I took was little facebook webinars the other the other day and they're saying eighty percent of people on facebook now do not click and impose they don't click so they're recommending now they call it brand awareness spend all the money and don't worry about the clip so I'm not a challenge facebook but they're not here so tomorrow I guess well I'm sorry I digress in retrospect maybe just off another opportunity for the audience about about digital brand awareness is today with a great tool that's called Luca like audience ok custom audience if you talked about facebook facebook offers great audience tools these days one of them is look-alike audience if you have a list of people that have very tight if you know your audience as you mentioned only the Jones okay and you have three maybe three thousands of them that you can tag and build an audience out of then you can go out and play facebook give more people like that it's called look-alike targeting if the seed list okay that you're building is tight enough in terms of demographic then Facebook can get you more people so from your seed list of three thousand maybe they can get you 30,000 people more yet have the same attributes yeah right you can retire here after you it's happy targeting because you don't have them in your original list but you you can get them in your expanded list it's called look-alike list so it's another method of doing this kind of micro retargeting but you you get them to click on to you know to get to your website now you got them for exactly yeah push you put ya can do that down and if you're targeting okay I don't know about elsewhere but like in the states you can do it on a block-by-block basis I don't think anybody here markets to the States but there's other locations in the world that you can do that so what my point is to all of this there are many many activities that you can do a brand awareness and direct response for not the multi-million dollar budgets and if you have the multi-million dollar budgets our friend here can help you slender very very quickly in a nice nice what insane but you don't build a brand we with sponsoring their at football club a brand is building they in their minds and hearts of our audience so our what we need to do is just to ensure that we have something special to say to them that is meaningful that touches their emotions and then to keep on banging with the same message over and over and over again consistency across all channels I'm not worried about not clicking on a facebooker is spread or something at you put as a banner because actually it means that these guys maybe don't feel this is advertising maybe they feel this is a social legit organic I don't know natural content okay which has more value than an advertisement that we say click me click me I understand but from a lot of these guys because I worked at a brokerage oh no ma'am I CEO is here so you don't like it I am I work for a guy that used to say how many actors how many actors how many actives Caroline I see you you know what I'm talking about he did not care about the whole brain aspect every dollar he spent I have on his life I agree with him one hundred percent of my budget is diverse forms one hundred percent of my budget is brandy or brand nothing I do is contradicting or not correlating to my brand strategy including sponsorships so if I would be looking for investment come sponsorship it will be something that correlates with my brand values it won't be just you know I don't just to get a t-shirt with your name exactly okay so i will be looking for something that is extremely smart sharp that coincides with my with my brand values will demonstrate what I what I am all about thank you very much whoo yeah maybe I go on because we're going to come to your question right second because we are actually sponsor of manchester united one of the big clubs so it's a huge in well I'm sorry register United Tom I'm so sorry don't be sorry because whatever I want to say is it looks like what you say yeah it's easy when you have the money you can sponsor a club and then you have the awareness this is one side yes it had to immediately 50m various if you're doing the right if you have the rights to have a divisibility but you really have to work it across the funnel so that at the end it also translate into into accounts into into business and that that's hard work so we need that you have first we have to define what is the brand positioning what are the values finding the right partner and then defined any creative team so that you really have a consistent message again and again which then we'll work with you have a formula that says okay we spent this much money we should get this much return for that activity let's cool ROI is called online online marketing it's all numbers all numbers and you do me yes yes of course we do did you say of course but I've seen it not happen so I want to be clear with everyone know what what we do it because sponsoring is its maintenance on television so what we defined is actually we have a brand tracker in place so every six months we're we're checking the awareness the consideration lever the brand fit with the sponsoring that we have in place and on top of that we're tracking the the website and the search results and with everything we do it on of course if you do something if it's sponsoring if its traditional advertising if it's you you have to track it you want to immediate return on investment or a long-term illness return no I think if you invest in branding then you investing in the future because what is branding branding is a balance between short and long term it is delayed says in a way and so so you were here for the long term and you know that when your invest now so you will have lesser cost in the future for the response part okay that that was the point I wanted to make so that CEO understands this is a delayed sales for even you know who I'm talking about when I know I know I know p hi Sonya disagree I know I mean he knows who I went for it yeah my previous this place televisions made the decor the basic acquisition channel I had the opportunity to launch in a few a new regions like a standalone new company usually we started with a beta that included only online channels they reached some point the minute the minute we added television which was for me direct response immediately everything just flew so in the television had a lie there are models econometric models that will will attribute the ft DS or whatever to each other so i will later quite okay hello anesthesia for XP sami i have a question about branding actually you are talking brain in brandon let's make sponsorship whatever and so on but the trends on a web marketing i'm not talking right now about industry but generally in web marketing is that nobody cares about brands anymore so they need personnel some suggestion to salvation of a problem the same is going on in our industry in my opinion what do you think about that so like yes so for example why are those new bloggers who just few years they really has the cherry to have a chance to survive because nobody cares about brands anymore I'm do you think so can't agree with that no no obviously people don't care about brands i think the people are more Brando Gnostic and don't mind spreading themselves over more brains than one okay so for example the example I gave about booking a holiday okay you you've got a booking calm or hotels com and you see which hotel suits you bears but in your back of your mind you know you know that the four seasons is better than Holiday Inn it was only when you I don't know that you are using four seasons for many years and yes but if you are just newcomer you came to I don't know Cuba doesn't matter you go to booking calm and you find the hotel which is nearest to the beach which you know is the best so you will not choose for season if it is far far away or don't have internet access if your new friend you have to know where you are differentiating yourself in the market you before you even spend one dollar you need to say to yourself what am i doing that's different from everybody else if you go me too in a saturated market you did finish I won't say dad but you're going to have a hell of a challenge pocket you can pretty much like a decide when going to put the tombstone on but you know I don't know it's a like a little bit like an exact see the first step you need to say is where am i different where am I going to get my clients who are going to be my clients once you've got there you can build a strategy around him you have a budget you say and this is how i'm going to spend my budget and this is how it's going to come back even if you do one hundred percent direct response it's going to take you three to four months to optimize to get down to truck normal rry numbers doesn't matter i care how you stop the starting point is always Who am I going after why and what's in it for them because you are going to help them make an assisting buying decision you are not going to sell to them no one is also anymore how you retain those customers because brand is also about the other touch points it's not just their position yes but we're talking about brand awareness not so much actual Brandi I'm sorry the brand equity of the company how you build in how you talk and how you coach because we know the brain starts from the janitor all the way up to the CEO correct and everything that you retention is a very very strong tool for branding for brand awareness because you create brand champions referrals okay um so this is a really really cooperating branch another position thank you who in the audience is red longtail the long term the book some the long tail so they're a very non concept in internet marketing by Chris understand as of 2004 I recommend everyone to to read it basically before the internet everything was much more centralized okay it was much more expensive the barriers to entry a much higher to get into any market because opportunities for reaching out early as the cost of everything was much higher now the cost of distribution is lower and you can build kind of small circles and small audiences and and and build those of that just a second so so yes it to a certain degree alright that was in the past the only maybe five six seven players in the market or in certain industries they are only two or three today as we can see the first and industry where dozens and dozens of four players if not hundreds okay each of them as a certain market segment sort of strong in the South America some strong in china etc etc with this type of customers in the UK and some are catering to Germans so so yes people are bland agnostic yet it does not mean that there's no meaning to brand because if you do not have any differentiation if you don't ever use P any consider any message that you that you offer which is unique which is interesting which you will enforce consistently then then you may be picked the conversion and sure will be low because very few people select you're blaming others that are now known more recognized certain value more trustworthy more ever well that's one reason why nunu broke because in brandon's are aligning with these big sports organizations that have been around for over 100 years because it's giving them instant credibility because the consumer will know who Manchester United is you know with respect better than Swiss square was a few years ago but now they will all know swissquote because of the link to Manchester United so they cut through the class they just cut through so too were thank you maybe i can add something here I think what is important is that when you look at the funnel the conversion funnel before wellness we are on the top of the funnel and then with response beyond below where we want to demo accounts where we want to count openings but the real opportunity is in the middle so in the middle there is really an opportunity for engagement giving content on education on research on entertainment stuff so here and I think this is what this often missing that people eaters they focus on awareness so they on the shirt or they do whatever they spend a lot of money but then they don't have the money or the strategy to fill the bridge between the awareness and making the conversion and here if you wake a good good job in content marketing with hero content with hot content if we've helped content you really can build a bridge and and you can be successful how do you quantify brand awareness there if you're called question is understand ojala was all oh I yeah relies on you have a project you have an entire budget okay even if you look at it from the top that we say this is my budget this is what I spent in total and this is what I got back over actually attack okay ever experienced more than just measurement min how you quantify brand awareness is on two levels i think it's measurable ROI but I think it's also in tangible return on investment that you can't can't necessarily measure but perception about your brand how the people are thinking about your brand that's what I let me let me assure it's a few things will indicate that you're doing you're going through the right direction one is the organic search so whether the trend is is going up people are looking for you proactively they heard about you they think about you they want to engage with your brand then you have the conversation in the social arena the engagement in the social arena there are tools to measure that I have one big one so I throw whatever have one big one the number of ids you have if you have a strong brand in high be with much Brett if you have a strong brand and you pay on time and as promised the ids will come to you more than a new bridge yeah that's part of it it's a be right your brand is also reinforced by a fit if you on many affiliate sites then your brand is also getting a lift wet right but let's say you're choosing to sponsored a football team how do you quantify that so it's not an easy solution I would agree but I would still give it a shot at least partially by setting up set of KP is key key performance indicators that I related to a brand for example if i sponsored also now I should look at certain data points 6 months before and six months after for example how many brain surgeries drive with the city are on my generic ads okay how do people respond to my on my ads and we'll get the certain boost of clicks this boost of quakes will generate more clicks to me and also lower to spend on my ads because all men ad platforms today consider the more event as you're getting more truthful rate okay so I established before before you spend it yes before you did before your sponsor Arsenal and after okay here's our KPIs now here's we're going to measure the same exact kpi's without changing anything else because now if you change it it's not the same exactly right and it doesn't matter I mean the research around sports sponsorship now is much more sophisticated than it was ten years ago so quantitative analysis and qualitative studies are going on all of the time and that's available to Brown's getting into sports sponsorship I got a question because looking at a big big question for you I'm Sarah ones like the number of companies that I see binary options and Forex now sponsoring large doing large sponsorship packages is crazy so my question to you is it working because you did most of them know we did a lot of them but I also look to a similar industry which is a betting and gaming industry because it's another industry whose targeting a very similar demographics online they went through similar challenges as the forex and binary companies are going through now so if you look at how the amount of investment from betting and gaming has continued to increase an increase increase not sure it now is about buying share a voice okay I'll tell you what when I was with a tea date we were at the first gaming company to sponsor a football club it was born right that was it that was a big thing because it was innovative it was unexpected that really really drove a lot of attention I agree with you i think that wherever everyone is there so interesting anymore at least in terms of sponsorships memory if everyone offers a bonus you know 10 different just think planet but think about how you are going to stand out don't go with the flow okay we're going to take one question and then we're going to wrap things up we're going to do a little party statement and then okay guys I'm rios dimitri from conversion pros and leaders tree i'm the chief creative director i have i've heard some great stuff about brands that should be applied and should be spread around the industry firm or but i hear you guys talk about brands as if it's an established thing as it is an easy thing to achieve and i also hear about small brands which give the perception of brands they're not quite brands yet because you're not a Brandon unless you have an opinion about what you do at an audience that actually follows you but yet in our industry we have companies looking for leads without even being structured to create and convert those leads what the sponsorship achieve and why do companies still looking for leads beyond looking for brand structure and proper brand strategy and communication in order to influence and emotionally connect their audience to the brands because that's the only thing that really creates sales correct me if I'm wrong I would say you're correct I was going after the aspect they already did all that now how do i get the word out there do i do only direct response or do i do brand awareness or do i do a little bit of both and what can i do with a limited budget or I'm not godly amount of budget this is how i was going yes we could speak for days i constructed for readers program and in everyone up here i'll have there everyone in this audience in this entire building well i have a different opinion now i was going off of they already did that so if i already know i got all my ducks in a row I know how I speak I know what my brand differentiation is I Know Who I am now how do i get the word out what's best to do do i do this do i do this or do i do both now parting words starting with you I was going to answer that question first as well because I think it's a neutral interesting one where we've seen brands that have gone into sports sponsorship with a big sponsorship have come and said well it's fantastic but we're generating too many leads to deal with and is that a nice problem to have well I suppose when I stick my logo on a on a high-profile team I expect to have everything else once i get my brand out there because the high-profile team it will be viewed by millions of people you can actually call these large audience and audience or not you can come and see Leverett will provide you with automated funnels automatic automatic funneling won't give me what I'm looking for but what I'm coming down to is I'm directing audience through your exposure writing to my business environment which is usually the platform or the website or the information platforms that I provide to my audience if that is not aligned what good is the sponsorship to my company it's not which we already know and we said those were already taken care of and we just took it it granted because otherwise we're going to spin this conversation into 15 different directions marketing you know marketing is not just one little piece it's a big pie with a whole lot of pieces to it so final words I'm sorry I was going to say finally I think renault sandero responds work very well hand in hand together I think it provides huge amounts of assets to use in your diary response I think working them together it's about finding consistent message in across the marketing mix I think small brokers as well as big brokers have as good an opportunity to create stand out and I think stand out one of the key messages to do look at what all of the peers are doing and find something to do that's different particularly if the budgets smaller and geo-targeting we touched on as well so I think there's a way to grow by looking at a geo-targeted approach even without thinking you have to go on a big global brand awareness campaign straight off the bat well I think the digital marketing is a bit different than traditional advertising was in traditional advertising you really hard pure brand brain building bender maintenance without the intention of driving sales right now but influencing the mindset towards purchase later I'm digital you should always a certain mix in your ads between dr and brand awareness it can be eighty percent blend blend entered but it still should have twenty percent of offering the collection of offering an action to those that are ready to convert to trade okay you're saying 8020 rule apply for uses that are upstream that are not true it worthy to trade for those that are downstream that show how trading intent it should reverse it should be able two percent direct response with a preposition of bonus or whatever something that is interesting that is a male hard sell and still keep some twenty percent to further brand value to touch on the brand okay so it so that it's it's kind of look at it as any others and mix with certain notes in it for you we're running out of time so I'm just i would say focus find where your value is to your users understand where you're going to engage with them and what better you're going to give to them at that point you can start structuring your strategy and how you're going to go to market that's the key your homework it's you're at your background first okay okay i think you have to understand the customer firmer so really defining the right amount of money you were willing to invest in each part of the aft of the funnel and you have to understand your individual situation so where is your bottle neck and then based on that you have to define your actions there is no miracle solution like eighty percent has to be awareness twenty percent as being conversion because every brand every stadium is different every audience is different so you have to really define for your individual situation maybe in one country it looks completely other than in another country so based on that situation you have to set up your mix I would say the best advice is know your customer understand what are the barriers were what are the fears what is the motivation how can you bring value to their whatever they need their needs are and then help them help them guide them to go through the funnel expect the barriers speak with customers see where people are falling through the funnel do a lot of a bday testing to improve that just support the customer by hand take them lead them where you'd like them to to go it takes some work but it's worth it it's a lot of work it's a lot of work yeah it is okay can I do a selfie with the audience absolutely everyone going does anyone have any questions before he takes a selfie no all right go good idea this is the first I see this one say spaghetti well thank you very much hoping to your eyes all tomorrow thank you thank you thank you for our panel you
