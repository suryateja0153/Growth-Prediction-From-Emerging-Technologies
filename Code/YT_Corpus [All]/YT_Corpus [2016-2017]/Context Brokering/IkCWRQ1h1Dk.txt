 I'm Tom Landy I direct the Reverend Michael C McFarland SJ Center for religion ethics and culture said that all in one breath the McFarland Center organizes lectures conferences and other programs that support our mission in fostering a dialogue on issues of meaning morality and mutual obligation last year the McFarland Center spent some time exploring issues related to borders in the movement of people we have a whole we have a number of lectures related to this online on human trafficking in the global slave trade the tension created by the concentration of Christians Muslims and Jews along the tenth parallel and the creative protests surrounding migration and border control you can find these on our website at Holy Cross dot edu slash the McFarland Center today's talk continues in that vein on global justice and traffic in humans for organs we're really fortunate today to have Nancy scheper-hughes here today we had a truly fascinating lunch with sociology and anthropology faculty and students today and she joined the medical anthropology class after that Nancy is Chancellor's professor at the in medical anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley where she directs the doctoral program in critical studies in medicine science and the body last year she was a member of the Institute for Advanced Studies School of Social Science in Princeton throughout her really remarkable career professor scheper-hughes his focused on anthropology of violence madness and culture inequality and marginality and childhood in the family she's highly esteemed for her Nagre fees including saints and schizophrenic mental illness and rural island and one of my favorite books ever death without weeping the violence of everyday life in Brazil concerned about the global inequities that face facilitate organ trafficking professor scheper-hughes launched the medical human rights project called organs watch with three other professors in 1999 she tells me that when she started calling attention to global organ trafficking she was ridiculed often and very publicly by government officials doctors and others who said she was making this up she spent several years investigating an international ring of organ trafficking based in New York New Jersey and Israel she's also interviewed hundreds of third-world organ sellers who felt that they were being taken advantage of threatened or tricked into selling their organs she serves in advise as an advisor to the World Health Organization on issues related to global transplantation and as a first-rate scholars not only helps us realize the existence of organ trafficking but helps us think about its larger context and implications so I'm very pleased to have her here and please join me in welcoming Nancy scheper-hughes well thank you very much Tom I have a lot on I guess my table what I'd like to present to you and I want to have time for your responses so start thinking about questions right away some of you might have read a couple of my articles it's really hard to summarize a project that has engrossed me for 15 years if I had known that when I first applied for an Open Society Institute grant that I would be dedicating 15 years to going around the world following errant kidneys I don't think I would have done it but once there I had to stick it out because initially there was as Tom said so so much resistance to the topic which was seen as maybe appropriate for Hollywood or you know science fiction but not really part of ethnography but in fact kidneys are good to think with you know we used to say Libby Strauss II in days you know that kinship or totemism or you know whatever concept that emerged that these things were good to think with and what the emergence of what I call transplant trafficking although others have called transplant tourism or commerce and organs or compensated gifting it makes us really rethink some of the the discourses that we use and one of the discourses I mean I over these 15 years have moved from looking at transplant illegal transplants in terms of everything from debt bondage and something analogous to although I don't like the use of the word surgery of slavery to looking at it in terms of the commodification and reification of the body so Louis Volant and I put together a book on the commodified body we began to shift my associates and I towards the trafficking discourse and I did so with some trepidation and so one of the things I want to bring up and I'll be using some clips of films I did quite a bit of work with documentary filmmakers is the question of the dangers and the risks of trafficking which is a dangerous discourse what does it mean about the mobility of individuals and their ability to exercise a certain kind of agency limited though it is is sex trafficking like organs trafficking or arms trafficking in which way is it different so so I have a few things I want to do I want a little bit of a history of how one gets into a topic such as organs trafficking especially at a period when everyone thinks it doesn't exist what were the things that drove it and how you combine scholarly anthropological and public engagements in an example of what pierre bourdieu had called scholarship with commitment and I also want to talk about the question of values and morality 'z because having now worked in a variety of countries and collaborated with international transplant societies with the European Union with the Council of Europe with the Istanbul summit meeting of transplant doctors and beginning with my first engagement with a group that really gave rise to organs watch the Bellagio task force in Oregon's trafficking which was in 1995-1996 I learned a lot about morality and values we all have them everybody everywhere and in all the positions that I've looked at from all the positions I've looked at let me for now just call it transplant trafficking the ethical thinking of the surgeons of the buyers of the sellers of the brokers of the hospital administrators I'll show you some of the people that are involved in this I can tell you that all you know have a cultural moral logic to what they're doing and they are in contention I've also learned in attending these international UN meetings meetings on trafficking w-h-o meetings trying to look at this problem it's impossible to state that there are universal global values there is actually been proposed by some cognitive anthropologists that there is a universal ethical standard or almost like a global ethical grammar that all people share on certain levels and I can say that while people are willing to get together as we did in 2008 at the ýstanbul summit doctors from north and south east and west trying to decide what if anything to do about the problem of cross-border or you know what I call kidneys without borders whether to regulate it whether to prohibit it what to call it what to name it how to feel about it that as I moved around the room for three days I found that the meaning of kidney selling varied greatly the meaning of what can be sold and what can't be sold the meaning of the of the of the body itself and who owns the differs even notions of justice and fairness differ from place to place and yet despite all those differences people can get together and compromise and say just a world that we can all agree we're comfortable living in what do what you know how much can we each give on one side or the other if you live for example in the Middle East it's very very hard to get a transplant it's very hard because of cultural and religious reservations about the handling of the dead body their religious leaders may say no we accept brain-dead it's all right but at the level of local culture at the level of local communities people think it's wrong and so in the Middle East and in many parts of also Southeast Asia and the Philippines if you're going to have a transplant it's going to come from a living donor then you have problems of people who say it's it's too difficult to ask a living person in my family will it always be women will it always be the women that will be the universal donors isn't it better to help out a poor person somewhere else in the world a total stranger and and and give them the opportunity to make some money by selling their kidney so I one of my more interesting moral discussions I've had several one was with a group of Chinese transplant surgeons who were meeting at the International Transplant meetings in Vienna several years ago knowing full well that the u.s. government was about to Sten extend a band on Chinese transplant surgeons coming as postdoctoral fellows or scholars to u.s. medical schools because of the use of executed prisoners for their organs and so I sat down with him and they said we can trust you you're very outspoken tell us what is the problem with using executed prisoners who are felons they are going to be dead anyway this is a way for their families to redeem themselves we don't have questions about consent and informed consent because we don't think like that we're a more collectivized society and we think that medicine knows best it's somewhat paternalistic that's just where we are in Chinese society is it because people in the West disapprove of the death penalty he said it can't be true in the United States because you have the death penalty that's not the problem so really let me explain why we think this is okay it was a very interesting conversation I've had moral discussions that went on for very very long time with some of the brokers including brokers that I helped get prosecuted and in jail one of the most amazing man of which was Captain Gaddy Talbot who was with Mossad in Israel as a child he was caught in a post world war two detention camp separated from his families who were sent to from his parents who was sent to Serbia in the jail cell the two summers back to back every Sunday religiously i sat in the in the jail cell with Daddy Tala and I said tell me why you thought it was okay to team up with a military police buddy of yours a Brazilian who you met at some police conference in Miami and settle in Brazil in order to recruit very very poor Brazilians from the slums and send them as far away as Johannesburg and Durban South Africa to provide kidneys with kidney transplants performed by South African surgeons on Israeli transplant tourists and some European and a couple of Americans over a three-year period why was that morally okay and justified and his answer was essentially that I shouldn't judge him unless I was standing in his shoes he said what if you and your family had been wiped out by the Holocaust what if you finally managed to be brought to Israel when it was just in formation what if you had been in under fire in three different wars and he shows me all of his scars and he said and what if someone proposes to you in Israel one way of healing the damage social body of Israel would be to see that everyone in Israel could get the transplant that they needed what if I told you I did this because I was being patriotic for my country would it make a difference well you know anthropologists don't necessarily buy into the assumptive world of all there are foreign informants but we do have a moral obligation to understand them to realize that the people we talk to are not moral idiots they have it they have their reasons they have their explanations and and what's important is to open up a dialogue anyway since mobility was one of the topics that I knew you were quite interested in I guess I would say that it is the extraordinary mobility of the world that we live in right now and I mean the mobility of populations of individuals the mobility of the Internet the mobility of of advanced technologies all of these have created a situation that was ripe for what kindly phrase transplant tourism you know could could happen mobility of course creates possibilities and it creates constraints often side by side mobility however is always contingent and the ability to move to be mobile is a defining feature for only certain populations and subjects crossing borders and reshaping bodies the transfer of advanced technologies whether it be in vitro fertilisation or transplant technology is available to some super medical citizens and not to others so many others are unable to participate or their mobility is actually coerced enforced so what I'll be doing is talking about the emergence of of transplant tourism within the context of what we call neoliberal globalization global capitalism and the spread of technologies and and these have among their effects incited new tastes new desires new demands including the demands for the organs of the other my colleague Lawrence Cohen with whom I co-founded and with David and Sheila Rothman at Columbia University organs watch Lawrence Cohen refers to the awesome bioavailability of some bodies in the world and I think that people have said to me you know is there a slippery slope and transplant I'll tell you what my surgeon friends say they said there was always built in to transplant a slippery slope it was there from the start because number one as many of you know perhaps those of you that read Margaret Locke's book transplant had to reinvent death in order to get organs that they could use from deceased persons who until brain death was accepted as a second form of death it would have been homicide for the doctors to have taken those organs so you have law crime and the nature of the definition of death being defined by a need so that put transplant surgery on what you could say is a kind of a slippery slope and then second when there was still pockets of strong resistance to the definition of brain death then the second problem was the introduction of living donors initially family members siblings because of tissue matching and when with development of very very strong immunosuppressant drugs then the ethics change with that so the technology was really guiding the development of ethical reason and moral reason and so then it was possible that an unrelated person could donate while alive a kidney half of a liver one lung and some of the transplant surgeons in the United States told me who would become involved in international transplant trafficking they said it isn't our fault the standards just kept changing and one of the doctors involved has now retired he won't give his name said it went from absolutely only you know certified brain-dead then relatives then it could be someone in your church then it could be somebody you met at the local bar and then it was hey I just had a cup of coffee at Starbucks and this person wants to give me a kidney and he said at that point it put transplant surgery at risk he said because surgeons are not detectives and although the law says that you know the law is very clear Notah the national organ transplant Act says that everything about donation of organs has to be voluntary uncoerced and free and he said but you know there really isn't a way of supervising that and if two people come to you and say that they're related okay that has to be good enough for us we don't know what they've exchanged behind the scenes but as long as I don't get part of it it's okay and from there he said this then it would actually fall to the point where you said well if it if more people will have their lives improved we won't even say saved by transplant from coming overseas and paying us and bringing donors that they say are voluntary or will do that as well and so this one surgeon in particular said we just got caught is what happened but anyway I think I'm going to tell you the story and then through the beginnings to where it is now and then open up for questions and then we can sort of also talk about some of the moral and ethical dimensions and what some of the solutions might possibly be so the question initially was whether or not organs trafficking was even possible or was it a kind of a blood libel against certain populations or was it appropriate simply for Hollywood film and organs watch was in fact founded to decipher rumors and what would be seen as moral panics or hysterias from the really real spread of illicit networks of international organs trafficking so this is where my work began in Northeast Brazil and in the middle of writing death without weeping here I was studying a population that was among the poorest in Brazil sugar cane cutters wage laborers debt peons people with an extraordinarily high infant mortality and maternal morbidity which I should have studied more of death squads operating it was during the military dictatorship bodies were disappearing and what were people telling me they were telling me boogeyman stories that's how I understood it of organ thieves who were after their children and that the children would disappear and sometimes they'd be found in dumpsters but then I found when I began following their stories that the real the unreal and the uncanny could often collide and one of the first realities was the fact that bodies especially bodies of people that are sub citizens either because they don't have the proper registration materials or because they were killed in an accident on a plantation and were brought to a hospital that it was very easy for people to be designated as unnamed persons in the police morgues or in the hospitals even and they would very readily be used for what would be technically illicit organs harvesting I heard many many stories this goes back you know to the early 1980s and followed up on them and visited the morgues and the hospitals and found out that there was this gray zone whereby if a person came in and you couldn't immediately find who they were within 24 hours you could begin to start harvesting at the same time there was this problem of street children in the 1980s and 90s they were being disappeared they did sometimes show up with organs taken but I believe that the death squads that were in operation or sometimes mutilating these children and older kids just to give a lesson to people and so this was a march in timbala the town I call bon Jesu stomata where children who lost siblings and in a couple of cases their playmates you know making a protest in the community about it another thing that stirred these rather extreme you might say versions of the organ trafficking panic really was the intense operation of international adoption networks in Brazil until they were began to be closed down in the 1990s and so one of the chants that would go up during these processions and and protests would be where are our missing brothers and sisters and the fear was they were sold you know that sometimes babies who were adopted were adopted by doctors some of the places that produced these babies were illegal orphanages I closed one down in the 1980s but the rumor that somehow these disappeared babies that went into the international networks of adoption were being used by you know for organs donors I said no that's absolutely a rumor this is a meeting with Deborah booty who's a medical anthropologist who works on trafficking myself and a Philippine doctor who's been trying to crack down on trafficking there and captain hilberg from the south african police force now what makes this these fears that I seem so irrational people are not grabbing children and taking their organs was the the appearance on the internet of of various agencies that were providing organs or promising to provide organs one of the most awful was one called medical adoptions the organs you need and the home they deserve this was put down I believed this was totally a ruse but it was it was really quite lethal they were claiming that they had representatives in many countries from South the south of the United States to Southeast Asia from Africa and they said look these children are guaranteed orphans they are homeless they they are being offered to you for adoption in exchange since you will be keeping them you may take one of their kidneys that's what they were arguing but I believe this was meant as a as a spoof but it really frightened people enormous Lee so what many of the transplant surgeons will tell you is that Trant that transplant is a victim of its success that is and really we're talking about kidney transplant because you know if you go on to the Yunus website every day you'll see that the demand for especially kidneys goes up and up and up a hundred thousand people I remember when it was just sixty thousand people were needing the average number of kidney transplants in the United States and a year is no more than 15 to 20 thousand so that means an awful lot of people are stuck on waiting lists without getting their organs and it is because of the the fact that the demand is exceeding the deceased owner and the reluctance of relatives to to donate organs which i think is a reasonable one what's happened is that people say I'm not saying relatives should not donate but I think that there have been some changes in the patterns of donation within families that I do find alarming one is the fact that very old people over and I'm pretty close to myself at the age of 68 people over 70 and 80 are allowed to list on the waiting list so I call it a kind of an artificially induced scarcity because obviously when you're in your 80s your organs begin to fail the but the issue is with somebody's kidney you can live longer and now some doctors at UCSF because it was studied by my colleague Sharon Kaufman have been telling their elderly patients you have a harder time to get an organ can you ask your grandchildren that is grandchildren over the age of 18 but still it seems to be an inversion of what family relations are if you follow david schneider and his understanding of american kinship models to have grandparents looking to grandchildren for their organs so the other solution is some is is is the the black market in kidneys which begins to arise really in the early 1980s but it was at that point pretty much limited to to South Asia and the Philippines but then it began to now show you some of the countries so what were the questions that or that I raised in this in this very very simple ones who's Oregon where did you get it was it a gift was it paid for or did it involve something that you could call theft and that it was coerced so here from the internet is one I picked up from a newspaper injuries the other from the diario de Pernambuco in Recife there are wanted and there are four sales and this is still probably the main medium because the internet is a little bit dangerous you could get caught you could get stopped even Google has been asked to you know try to cut down people posting trafficking notices but in little newspapers the kind you get when you go to the grocery store these these of these appear so you do have both a demand and a supply you might say that is at work here and so these are some figures that I had published in foreign affairs and so this was a an unemployed musician advertising his readiness to sell a kidney in San Paulo and these are just some of the countries that are involved more since this time it's an extremely mobile I won't say or there's a series of international organizations and companies that operate but as a practice it all you need if you get into trouble in one country is to just find one clinic in another country that will set you up and some of the brokers and brokerage firms I've been working with say that they don't stay in a new country a fresh country for more than a few months before they've got another country to go to and now Central Asia is one of the places to go so this is not black and white as the judge Thompson proceeded over the first ever prosecution in the United States of an organs broker last July 11th I was there for the sentence took a full day because there were witnesses on both sides talking for and against the company that mr. Jacques Rosenbaum who is an Israeli citizen set up in Brooklyn but that serviced international transplant patients with with illegal transplants with poor people who were initially brought primarily from Israel new immigrants from Russia Moldova Romania Bulgaria who were kind of being offered a deal that is you may have a hard time settling into Israel you've come from a very poor economy you don't have the education of our you know long-term citizens in Israel so we'll help you out if you serve as a kidney seller and so the Rosenbaum specialized in bringing these so-called new immigrants into US hospitals I learned about his activities around 1999-2000 and I didn't know what to do do you share the information or do you say no this is your obligation as an anthropologist to respect all of your informants actually mr. Rosenbaum would not be he did not agree to tell me about his organization but many of the buyers and the sellers did then one day I decided maybe I would have to go public about it I think it was in 2002 when I had a series of email exchanges with a man who I knew was using a pseudonym named David Hamilton and he wrote to me and he said I've read your work and it really gave me the freedom to write to you he said I work for an organization in Brooklyn that is setting up elicit transplants mainly with Russians and he said I originally this organization was a charity organization it was meant to help Israelis get operations and surgeries that they could not get in Israel but once it went into kidneys then it became a criminal organization because we were breaking the laws in the United States we were bringing in people who would esprit equally desperate were of course the buyers many of them too old to be transplanted in Israel many of whom had been rejected for transplant so it was putting them at risk but they had insurance that would pay for this we could recruit these people so we brought them into the hospitals and he said but the problem was they might have been willing when they were you know first contacted to sell a kidney but once they got to New York they got frightened and they couldn't get out of the deal so very much like trafficking they would be harassed and really coerced into getting up on the tables so very early on in my writings I saw that the sale of kidneys and other organs followed the normal routes established routes of capital so these kidneys moved with inside the bodies of the sellers you know from southern countries to northern from east to west from poorer to more affluent bodies no surprises here from black and brown to white from poor males to more affluent males and although women in some parts of the world our primary sellers especially in South Asia in the in the dozen countries that I've worked in it's mainly young men who are the sellers of kidneys but women are rarely the recipients of purchased kidneys so I call these young men Universal kidney donors areas of Bangladesh and India and as I said also the Philippines now this is very very low statistics because the fact is it's illicit behavior it's illegal everywhere in the world except in Iran which has the only regulated kidney sale program and it's had it for 20 years but so working with the w-h-o going over all the statistics that I could produce and my associates and organs watch which include many anthropologists and human rights activists from all of the countries I've mentioned who usually work as volunteers sometimes just a small amount of money that they need you know for their subsistence we've decided to say that more or less a low estimate is that 15% of the world's living donor transplants are sold through brokers but you could break this down and say well but how many of these are truly coerced sellers how many are consensual sellers or just contracted sellers how many of these elicit transplants are organized through crime criminal networks how many are purchased between buyer and seller on the Internet as for example Craigslist or med to go and how many are legal and of these transacted and that really is Iran and I'm happy to answer questions now if the kidney is as a as I like to say the Blood Diamond of organs trafficking it's a strange kind of commodity because unlike pork butts or another commodity kidneys vary in how much you'll be paid as as the seller depending on the biases of the buyer populations who often say that they'll you know they'll pay pay more and it also it depends on the brokers the local brokers that handle it so you can get as little Iraq pre-war was one of the best deals in the world Saddam Hussein was actually involved in it and many military governments get involved in it why I guess it's because they can and because they control the bodies of the population they can also control and monitor and and and make a profit from organs trafficking okay so the question is really what do we call this because there are many different kinds of behaviors happening some people like to see it as more normalized as another version of medical migrations others just focus on the commerce and organs or trafficking in humans for organs I say what's being sold is not the kidney what's being sold as the illegal transplant that's what people pay for the average price if you want it to go on an Internet and find out where to go I could tell you and I mean I'll tell you not to do it but I can you can find out for yourself the average cost is about a hundred and eighty thousand dollars to get a fresh kidney it's a lot of money and so the to say that oh well a hundred eighty thousand dollars for a kidney no you're paying to corrupt hospital's transplant surgeons translators safe house operators the blood workups in the labs all of those people the visa and passport control people they're all being bribed in order to do this so whereas I began thinking of transplant trafficking as in terms of ethics I read a lot of Conte I read a lot of leve nos in trying to imagine how I would think through the ethics of this and then I began to think of it as hmm medical malpractice and then I realized that for a large part of the true international trafficking it is organized crime and their human rights abuses okay the UN office which I work with on drugs and crime took the most strong stand one that only in certain circumstances I would ever use myself but they have declared it when it's transnational involving exploitation and often as happens targeting an enemy population that's where this question of crimes against humanity come as in Kosovo after the end of the the war the Kosovo war and because in in response to the genocide in Bosnia what happened and I am an advisor to prosecutors in Kosovo is it still has not been proven to I'd say my own standards let alone I think the legal standards but former KLA operatives like David Hamilton who called me and said help me who do I talk to how do I get out of this my I have a crisis of conscience and in that case with Rosenbaum I went to the Commissioner of Health in New York and after that they told me I had to talk to an FBI agent the FBI agent did very very little I said good I just I didn't I was I was past my comfort zone in Kosovo something similar happened some former KLA militant spoke to journalists including journalists from the Center for Investigative Reporting at Berkeley and they said that it was well-known that at the end of the Kosovo war about 400 to 500 serbs civilians possibly former militants disappeared it may have been revenge killing it looks like it it may have been still some unresolved conflict but essentially they were they were removed they were quote disappeared to use the language that we were used to from Central America and South America but what's amazing is their bodies have never been found and there was very little political will in the world left after the Bosnia events after you know the war in former Yugoslavia we just now have this newly formed state nobody wanted to look into what happened to the Serbs but the stories of the militants were and one of them was murdered and now the people that spoke are pretty much in protection witness protection programs they said that they were delivering serves to transit detention centers and then to some medicalised centers in Albania where they were told that the people would be killed executed but that there would be surgeons there that would remove their kidneys which would be sent to Turkey so that's the story essentially that now is being untangled going on in Kosovo so the UN protocol really was developed around the problem of sex trafficking when you think of trafficking everybody thinks sex trafficking and I've had many wonderful conversations with I am a feminist myself but with the feminist take different positions I don't think that all transacted sex cross borders is trafficking and I agree with Elizabeth Bernstein that from Columbia that using a trafficking discourse can be very dangerous because the wrong people get caught up in the case of sex trafficking it's invariably the women who are trying to escape often dire economic situation say in Eastern Europe and going to Turkey and often they're brokers who may be very poor people themselves and somehow not going after the networks that organized it and so forth but so I agree with the critique of sex trafficking always you know or sex work across borders always being viewed as as as trafficking but I actually think that although human organs was added on as an afterthought it actually fits very well the description that is that what is that at work is fraud deception the abuse of vulnerability and the fact that it's easier in the prosecutions there have been about six prosecutions for organs trafficking they know not to go after the buyers and the sellers they see them both as victims of organs trafficking so it's a little less dangerous we might say so why it's it's a protected crime in a sense or at least the perfect crime might be another term is that it involves three or four different countries for any one transplant the surgeons could fly in from one country the the buyers from another country the hired hospital ward or the little clinic would be in another location and the sellers are brought in from yet another country so you take it out put it in get everybody out of the country fast and it's almost impossible to track so very very difficult so it has a lot of requirements you need to have people that are sick and willing to travel great distances take enormous risks there are many deaths of people who have traveled to China to Turkey to Azerbaijan to Kosovo to be transplanted without sometimes even knowing what their destination is I had a man a few years ago in my living room I'll call him David and David was a wealthy small businessman no children and he was tired of being on dialysis he was in his late 50s and I know his doctor well doctor gave danovich said you're not a good risk for transplant David you're low on the list and you should be happy with dialysis you're able to work you do your dialysis at night you're still making your business he said it's not a life for me and so David got in contact with a team of very very active brokers who I'd been following for years their transplant surgeons who broke her and he ended up on route via Israel to pick up one surgeon from there flew with that surgeon to Turkey to pick up the other surgeon then the three of them were on route to Kosovo Kosovo as they were getting on the plane they were told that the police had stormed this medic Medicus clinic that they couldn't go to Kosovo the broker is there a guy named moisture el his name is okay because he's wanted and wanted by police so I don't you know reveal any names that I shouldn't Maurel says David that's the brakes I mean these clinics they closed down their fly-by-night I can't promise you anything but if you give me another hundred and twenty with a discount not one hundred and eighty one hundred and twenty I'll get you a kidney in the next week and sure enough in Baku in Azerbaijan this guy got his kidney so just in terms of mobility imagine this kind of mobility it's almost unimaginable so here you have Alberti de silva who ends up being taken from the slum in Northeast Brazil to Durban where he meets up with an african-american woman from New York City married to an Israeli and that's how she got in because this particular or criminal syndicate originated in Israel there is plenty of Oregon selling and brokering in Egypt in the Gulf states in South Asia but the most international and well-organized one because of the diasporic community and because of the education and because of the ability of medical insurance to pay for Israelis have been able to set these up and it really is a marvel so here's you know what happens to Alberti and these are some of the people that were necessary to the scheme you have to have aftercare people surgeons you have to have translators you needed to have the coordinators you needed the hospital administration everybody had to be in on it and so what makes organs trafficking different from let's say arms tracking trafficking or drug trafficking is the thing that makes it so protected that it unites and links people at the highest levels of their career some of the most famous transplant surgeons in Turkey in Israel in the United States in Colombia Bogota in in Azerbaijan people who are known because it's a small profession they go to these international meetings have been willing to get involved with brokers kidney hunters money laundering schemes and so it really again it kind of is amazing to me and I think it's protected because people see it not as a traffic in badge not as a rotten trade but as a traffic in goods in life-saving organs so there's a reluctance by prosecutors by police by governments to really crack down on this because they say as dr. Thompson said in Trenton this is hard she said this is a very hard case somebody's getting their life saved at the expense of somebody else so anyway and I more or less went over these things these are that the prosecutors I've talked to say it's the biggest headache in the world there have been these prosecutions since 2004 in India South Africa Brazil Moldova Kosovo Israel the US so forth but they're very very difficult to process it's very expensive to do it you have jurisdictions that don't match you have countries that you're trying to extradite people that don't have treaties for extradition and you have different legal resources whether or not you have any precedents makes a difference who are the victims who are the perpetrators who are the collaborators who are the bystanders who do we go after so it's been very exciting working with some of these people to try to sort it out but there are many many complications involved in this that is we know of the deaths of people who have sold kidneys and come home quite sick with infections and have died many of them don't have medical certification so we can't prove that they died as a result we know that many buyers have died their doctors back home do not want to say on the death certificate that they died is a consequence of having gotten a quote poisoned kidney so the data are often lacking the other thing is do you include in this crime of trafficking the fact that people who have sold their organs go back to Moldova you know they're blamed by the communities and are sometimes beaten up and cases of being beaten up to the till they're dead because you've brought shame onto our community there's revenge killings as the parents of kidney sellers go after the local brokers and try to kill them kidneys selling in Eastern Europe with connections to both Turkey and Israel have our political problems they they set off old biases old prejudices and blood libels they say well the Israelis are the surgeon so they blame the Jews the Muslims are the surgeons that's because his connection is Turkish a lot of these things a lot of these transplants took place in Turkey so very dangerous in terms of global political relations okay if it's a crime the question raised is who's the felon is it the kidney seller I was shocked when I had one of several organs watch conferences and a doctor at the conference said I don't make me sit next to the felon and I'm thinking well who you talking about they were talking about Nick Rose and Nick doesn't mind that his name is is he was cleared for illicit harvesting by the famous transplant team at Mount Sinai Hospital he was brokered in Israel by a broker came to New York City met another broker who he was handed over to he met the person who got his kidney an hour before he was cleared for transplant with a he made just little snapshots I mean not the broker meeting the person who's giving the broker wouldn't allow his face with religious objects now they're inside Mount Sinai and get a very cursory a clearance by these two doctors very important we're kind of life or death issues that we need to discuss yeah okay really okay you want me to put this down you can see because he's us and Hadean so he's getting kind of nervous trying to get stressed so he's kissing goodbye his kidney in the hospital and the next thing is maybe x-rated but he's showing you his scar that he unless if I want more feel the morphine I I want and yes your medal of award for being a kidney donor and then a huge huge scar and now in the film that he made he begins to have doubts about what he did realizing that every all the attention is being paid for he take a good price and that's the now okay in that case we could say it was contracted but with regret afterwards okay that was not the worst possibility but here's a case of a man Salah and I this person would probably not like to have his picture shown who was actually a worker for a royal family in Qatar and he was taken under deceptive auspices you might say to the Cleveland Clinic for the family where he was where he was forced to give his kidney to a family member of this family that he worked for he had no idea when he was flown to the United States that he was doing anything other than being a servant to the family he didn't realize that his period of servitude included being a a kidney donor I made a complaint I launched you know an investigation because the man was very very angry afterwards and he was also looking for political asylum and I'm yeah political asylum in the United States and the director of the transplant said well you know you know we're gonna hide behind the fact that we're protecting patients you know that we have no right to tell you exactly but what we're content that everything was fine so I think one has to question our hospital operating instructions is it a question of really due diligence is it Don't Ask Don't Tell which doesn't exist as a transplant policy don't care to know don't care at all you know whose responsibility is it so then the other question is is the buyer and the family the felon and some people have suggested that and you know I've tried to say no because here's Larry taking I mean here's Daniel taking his black sheep cousin to China and Larry dies a year after the operation and you know here's Gaddy Talbert who I spoke about are the brokers the felons Gaddy got an 11-year sentence pretty stiff for brokering the sale of Brazilians to South Africa for Israeli transplant here's a piece of underground is 39 well he would like to make there as soon as good he can make it in the pistol make you feel to see two weeks I can't tell you for sure we don't make the cross we only have to push on the cross match and everything will be okay and how much is it okay the cost is $140,000 is a favor whistle a thousand okay he's done more than a thousand illegal operations in fact dr. Joseph some nas has done over 2,500 illicit operations and I guess if you asked me who the felon is for me it's the outlaw surgeons because without them nothing would happen so this is the famous Joseph some Nez his pay his picture has been in the newspapers so I'm not revealing anything but he was and still is at large and for many years the Turkish surgeon to go to for illicit transplant he's called Robin Hood by his patients doctor vulture by the providers of kidneys and I'm going to tell you a little bit about this is a slide presentation in 2008 at an international Transplant meeting where doctor some nez although he's wanted by several countries was allowed to give his presentation so I have to say that the transplant profession is not as organized around this as they should be and he was arguing that in urging his colleagues to do what he did he said I have two of his powerpoints and they were locked but I unlocked got them unlocked that basically he said this is the most scientific thing to do he said you'll never be able to get enough deceased donors there are more people than you can imagine willing to sell so the the best procedure the most scientific procedure is for the surgeon to be both harvesting and transplanting the kidney you can you can look at it you have in your hands in Oregon that you just got out of the body of a provider no time is wasted and he says my 2,200 transplant patients have excellent prognosis with without HLA tissue matching so there is something interesting that's come out of this in fact that's true of all the illegal transplants basically they'll match up half of you with half of you here they'll make sure that you're the blood won't kill you but even there they take some risks and pump you up with all kinds of immunosuppressant drugs the idea is immediate return is will send you home with a kidney but there's no guarantee of what happens afterwards when some Nez was contested by a Moldovan surgeon who said well you're saying that you have good outcomes for your transplant tourists what about the donors and he replied they're not my patients they're contract workers in a developed so here's one of his go back as a poor person they could put this up a little higher this is the last I have to vary that's what happened to Vladimir diminutive he was one of the young kidney sellers scheper-hughes met on her last visit to mensier in 2003 at that time he was still suffering from complications from his operation four years earlier scheper-hughes wanted to check in on him but shortly before our visit she found out he had already died she met with vladimir father bossy but the father did have some urgent questions for scheper-hughes he wanted to know what had happened to the woman who had recruited his son for the kidney traffickers the same woman who had coerced Nikolai Barden whom we met earlier and dozens of other young men from India into selling their kidneys just that she's a criminal and she was part of a mafia and she deserves to be in jail and she deserves to be punished he knows that initial point of view is it yes oh he said tall boy he's handsome like his father so stop here and say no what he was in the cemetery we're talking about the aftermath of the death including the fact that the community has organized and ran the broker out of town but they tried to kill her so it really became a mob scene but not only do the sellers die but I have many many of victims of this international traffic like mr. Tati and I've written an article to tease holiday which was not much of a holiday because he was brought by some nez and Shapira to Adana in Turkey and was told that he would be transplanted with a kidney from someone who was like a brother to him because mr. Tati was in an Iraqi Jewish person okay and the person they got was an Iraqi soldier that was a wall crossing the border and they did not match at all and Tati he had to be taken by emergency airlift back to Israel where he died a few years later he never got over it basically so I mean really the ones that get caught up the most easily in the prosecutions are the brokers they're not innocent people but they're also the most visible and they don't have the protection that the surgeons have and so some nez was involved in the Kosovo clinic in 2008 this man triggered a prosecution because he fainted in the airport and he was they found a fresh wound they found under the bandages that he had a few thousand dollars that he was given to get away and that launched a prosecution that's ongoing and maybe just the last slide - this is an earlier film that I made with a French investigative reporter and my first trip to Moldova and this man is esteem translated an explanation for why do you know because of untreated hypertension because of the scandals about kidney selling and brokers and prosecution's in romania and moldova moldova no longer does transplant in the public sector i believe there are a couple of private doctors to do it but and something like 30 dialysis machines for the entire population so telling this man he has recipient kidney failure from untreated hypertension is essentially telling him you know a fatal disease and yet here he's the provider of kidneys so just a few pictures of mr. Rosenbaum who was our kidney broker when he was arrested in 2009 and who had worked with dozens of our best hospitals there part of the indictment and the hospitals were from Johns Hopkins to Albert Einstein to Mount Sinai to Cleveland Clinic to University of Minnesota to UCLA just about anywhere he could place people so I think one of my my problems is that mr. Rosenbaum guilty as he was stood alone in the courtroom in Trenton New Jersey I got to meet him at the sentencing and I was a little bit frightened to go because he had known that I had shared information with the authorities about what he was doing and I was shocked at the response in the courtroom there were about 300 community members from the Hasidic community in Williamsburg and park as well as from deal New Jersey all supporting him in a very very decorous way and when a break was taken mr. Rosenbaum came up to me and it was like Livingstone or whatever he said I think I know you Nancy and I said mr. Rosenbaum I think you do and put out my hand and he gave me his fingers his wife rushed over and she said you may not touch my husband's hand we're Orthodox Jews and women are not allowed to do that I said well we've touched hands and many you know and through many communications we've had a relationship for a very long time and it was an extraordinary trial because the community was saying your work is excellent it's noble work but mr. Rosenbaum was a saint you got him wrong he never exploited now I actually know that he was not a saint and that people were forced to give kidneys who didn't want to but their answer was to say what about Iran what about Iran why can't we have a regulated system like Iran could I imagine that I'm talking to an Orthodox Jewish person who was thought to be a rabbi about let's go the Iranian way that's globalization you might say and I asked I said mr. Rosenbaum why are you alone in his courtroom where were all the surgeons and the hospital administrators who were who are collaborating with you who who were who you were your conspirers he said it was a decision that was made by my lawyers to not go there it seemed to me that it was a very weak prosecution one of the persons that was brought in as a witness for the prosecution was one of his sellers who was an African what's called a black Hebrew in in Israel who had his family had migrated from Chicago as Steel Workers and had been part of this organization in Israel and Ilan quick who's a beautiful 6 foot 2 F can American now converted to this group got up and said that he was going through hard times in Israel he began to disengage from the black Hebrew movement he thought that they weren't thoroughly integrated into Israeli society he met a man who said I have a solution for your problems Ilan was a locksmith he said you know come to the United States you give a kidney it's like having a tooth extracted you'll be back to work you know in 24 hours and in fact when he arrived to New York it was such a rush job because the transplant patient was waiting and the hospital which was the University of Minnesota refused to give the kidney of one of mr. Rosenbaum other brokered you know donors and that person was schizophrenic so the fact is that you know in looking for people to sell sometimes the people that are selected are not fully mentally competent or they're in such bad straights they're willing to do almost anything so Ilan was rushed to Minnesota but AB before they got when they were on their way to the airport mr. Rosenbaum asks the escort who's actually the enforcer to make sure that Alon will actually get on the table not really a protector of Ilan and Rosenbaum says where are the blood we have to have the blood tests and Ito the broker said I didn't have time we had to rush Ilan out of Israel to get to Minnesota so they stopped at Rosenbaum's house and brought down syringes and took you know five vials of blood from you lon didn't even bother to go to a clinic so if anyone thinks this isn't trafficking I would be hard-put you know to defend the system as it is so in the end what can we expect I I found that although I'm not generally I'm certainly not in favor of high penalties and prisons as solutions I think that these first prosecutions in Brazil in South Africa in Kosovo in New Jersey have put a damper on the the traffic it has certainly stopped the traffic in South Africa without a doubt because that prosecution didn't just go after the brokers it went after the medical insurance company it went after the net care private Medical Corporation and it went after the surgeons and I think that Brazil too is extremely vigorous in going after all the people including the blood lab work up people and put people you know behind bars for pretty long time now these are to me just a kind of a message I guess to the brokers and to the buyers and the sellers that you know this is not something that you know is is being taken as a win-win situation that now what the solution will be after these prosecutions we all hope that there will be I I don't know if you read the newspapers lately but there are promises that biotechnology is now going to work on these 3d print kidneys from you know using a combination of genomics and personalized medicine to actually grow kidneys I doubt that's going to happen very soon that's one solution to the problem another is that there be presumed consent which works in Europe very well I doubt we'll be ever accepted in the United States the idea that everyone is potentially a donor to everyone else that only works I think in a society where you have National Health Service where people feel their bodies have been taken care of well while they're alive so that they can be generous at death it's harder in a country that has many divisions political divisions racial divisions ethnic divisions so there is a lot of suspicion in some communities in the United States about whether at the time a person is in an ICU whether if you're of a certain ethnic group that maybe the doctors will be a little less is about trying to revive someone or a little bit too zealous in declaring someone brain-dead so that's Manoa nother problem obviously prevention obviously because so much of transplant is the result of diabetes in the United States that is a preventable disease but it's hard to talk prevention to people who already you know have diabetes or have lost limbs and or on you know and want a transplant so there isn't a magic bullet to this the magic bullets are possible but they seem to be years away so in the meantime what I've done is I've printed and I'm happy to send to any of you what I call a donors or an organ donor or an organ seller whether it's any living person basically a Bill of Rights and I'll just end by reading what the Bill of Rights I think should be and I have to say that I don't think money is the problem in all of this that would be just to medieval an idea I think it's buying from a stranger that's the problem and it comes out of my readings of Emmanuel Levinas and Martin Buber you know the sort of I've our relationship so I will pull out this bill of rights which is attached to a letter an open letter to people who are considering buying a kidney and I asked just one thing if you can't get a transplant any other way if no one you know you're low on the list you're too old but you have a lot of money then if you feel you must buy a kidney buy it from one someone you know someone you love which kind of is like a strange thing to say but it's simply because it's the question of responsibility for the body of the other that is that you both have responsibility for each other and in fact I learned that from my work in Brazil where where there is payment often within extended families the payment may not be in money it may be in-kind college education a job a house and while it seems bizarre at this point I don't know quite where else to go but I think that the living organ donor Bill of Rights should begin with a couple of basic principles one is that all humans have the right to bodily integrity that organs are every person's birthright yet a person's patrimony humans both are and have a body and I guess I think in terms of a post Cartesian notion of the person not Co Jeeto ergo sum I think therefore I am but rather embodied therefore I am I think that medicine has to recognize I believe that living donation is ethical can be heroic but that there are no spare parts there are no spare kidneys there are no spare lungs there are no spare part livers that way of thinking is rhetoric and it's simply not true so I think that both parties have to be aware of the fact that that this is a huge sacrifice and it's still honorable and ethical to be an organ donor and even to be a paid donor but it's never an obligation that someone should feel and that green donation which I call deceased donors should be the the default system red donation because it involves the blood of living persons should be the exception and not the rule and that organ selling is very rarely a win-win situation so one has to acknowledge that there are vulnerable populations populations that are all too eager to sell but they may be unemployed prisoners the mentally ill the mentally deficient undocumented guest workers those are almost an order the populations that sell their kidneys in my study and so recognize the role of power and powerlessness that that based on gender race class education and establish a principle of solidarity solidarity with the sick and solidarity with the weak and the displaced and the dispossessed in equal in equal measure understand that living on Dyna dialysis is suffering so not to exclude empathy or solidarity with the sick but also to have that same kind of solidarity extended to the kidney provider and recognize that many of the consequences of kidney selling the scars are on our invisible it's not just the disabling scar that I talked about in the classroom a couple of hours ago one of the things I didn't say when I was talking about the meaning of the scar in different countries and it can be a sign have you done something good or a Stein sign that you've been you know exploited or it could be decorated people in Manila as well as in Brazil decorate with tattoos their scars and you know try to show it but no one talks about the scar of the recipient and so you know there's somehow a lack of congruence and the way we look at buying and selling and scarring and the body the last thing is that the thing that most irksome a about the United States is that our hospitals allow people who are anonymous who may be paid on the side I'll tell you if I told you one last story you would not believe it but I got a call from a guy who said come tomorrow to the hospital I just bought a kidney I was counseling him on not buying a kidney he was a young man in his early 30s in LA I was telling him that since he had a grandfather who was Iranian he could go to Iran he could do it legally I told him how if he had money in his family he had money that he could double triple quadruple List in a variety of we don't have a single wait list and you could be like the bingo lady in the church who has five cards rather than one I told him all those things and he called me up and he said I went on Craigslist and I found I found two donors and I took the cheapest so I want me to come and see how it's done I was at the hospital of the star Cedar sinai and the donors were to undock with a brother and his undocumented both from South Korea younger brother younger brother was brokered by the older brother the younger brother didn't really want to do it but he was unemployed had no you know so he was meanwhile being sent up to the o.r and the money which was a decent amount of money twenty thousand dollars went up in a backpack by the uncle of the patient and the money was exchanged on the surgical floor possibly in a closet or a bathroom that part wasn't clear but after both parties were put under anesthesia and the young man I'll call him Shawn was saying we just want to know how ethical it is we were not saying that the kidney had to be decent or it had to work we were just saying you couldn't take the money and run you have to go under anesthesia then you get the money now here I was a professor of the University of California with all my ID and I had a hard time getting up by the invitation of the families I want to know how that uncle with a backpack with $20,000 got up in the elevator to the surgical ward and was able to square the dead if the surgeons weren't involved so my final one is no transplant with living donors if that donor does not have medical insurance and that was the case of course with these young men a young man and his brother they were undocumented they you know needed money fast they were in desperate straits but it seems to me the height of unethical behavior for a doctor a surgeon to allow someone to be harmed by their surgery and not even worry what happens to them if they should happen like Nicolai or like Vol or like any of the young men in Brazil who afterwards had problems because of untreated medical conditions that were pre-existing and were not properly cared for so I would end here and I'm sorry I went overly long and I hope that you're still willing to stay with me and contest or raise questions or give me ideas that might help me and where I go next but thank you very much for your patience oh yeah yeah well well some doctors will say no but Spain has done it Spain has no waiting list yeah that you have to opt out it's called an opting out that you're in unless you have personal reservations no one will question it you're out now Israel has done that in response to you know the fact that they were so stigmatized by you know all this reportage about the Israeli organized criminal syndicate and so forth that they have first gotten a law that passed the scrutiny of the Orthodox community that there will be kosher brain deaths whatever it is they're going to do is going to be kosher because they know it wasn't it probably means that and I remember the transplant surgeons in Israel telling me in 1999 I will not have you know a rabbi when I declare a brain death present but I know that's what the community wanted I think that they've simply had very very strict protocol for declaring brain death that could be trusted by everyone second something that I'm not sure I think is actually within the realm of you know medical justice that is if you opt out of what is essentially a universal donation system then you are low waitlisted if it's your turn for an organ so a balance what Marshall Sahlins would call a kind of balanced reciprocity you you don't want to give you're going to be very low in getting but doctors you see surgeons and I could talk forever about the moral thinking of surgeons I mean one of the things is that they feel absolutely obligated like every other kind of doctor to treat you whether you're Jack the Ripper or not and the idea of equity is not a tit for tat equity but rather those who are most in need should be taken care of so that would be a problem but you know we kind of have that system an NGO called Organ Sharing has its own its own waiting list and it's only for people who have agreed to give organs and then with it and those then can get organs from anybody in this circle because they believed so strongly either we're all in it together you know one for all or all for one or forget it because the wait list is very hard to decipher - I mean it's it's called Oregon sharing yeah yes yeah yeah in China liver half liver and I have many more slides I could show you and and also it's very very dangerous that I mean not I mean it's dangerous in the United States it's done under very in fact some liver transplant units have been closed down because they didn't think that the care in fact donors have died that there wasn't you know enough premium care for the for the donor but in in in China it's pretty it's really pretty risky and there was a website that now is closed down that was advertising kidneys and I thought oh is this a scam because some of these they just want some down payment money can they actually do it and they had the pictures of the patients with their phone numbers who you know and showing them standing next to their donor or whatever of a half liver and their names and the serial numbers and I thought wow that's pretty impressive I guess they just took their medical records and put it up so the other no the other organs that are sold are basically tissues and solid organs from the the truly dead not even the brain dead but the deceased dead and that's not for transplant except for cornea which are become a commodity tissues his tissues are sold around the world just around the world and when the w-h-o committee that I was part of which met for about five years they finally decided we're gonna focus on living donors because the the deceased tissue problem is impossible to manage that is the by the time tissue bone including skin whatever it's taken from a dead body legally really let's say legally even and then sold it becomes a product because it's alienate it's so alienated from the body get back to Kant it's been processed it's been frozen it's been you know just processed it has become a product and that product you have the right by various bills and whatever legislature to sell these things for the handling fees not for a profit but of course everyone knows that this profits being made that that I banks and blood banks and all they they made quite a bit of money but so but they the w-h-o decided they would they would not pay attention to it it was just too thorny an issue yeah yeah that I have to upgrade that Africa Central Equatorial Africa has very little transplant there is organs trafficking in parts of West Africa there always has been in North Africa of course South Africa because that's one of my main cases which I didn't get to discuss at a very interesting one Europe yes should have been there but you see it depends on one of the problems with talking about who's involved in trafficking is that often the transplant international transplant society only names the donor countries the countries where you get the sellers from so it'll be Egypt and it'll be you know Pakistan and it'll be Panama actually Ecuador oh there's a lot of countries that have come up but Romania Moldova Bulgaria have been providers but then if you add on what are the countries that facilitate that do the operations then you have the United States and UK and South Africa and whatever and if you have the countries where the buyers come from you know then you have almost everyone is is it's it's a real global game and sometimes I'm questioned about the fact that I spent some so much part of my work in organs watch following this one very extensive Israeli brokerage firm that I was picking on Israel and I said no it was really accidental it was that I would you know there's a technique in sociology called snowballing where if you're if you're studying a topic especially if it's somewhat stigmatized let's say incest in the family where people don't like to talk about it but you talk to one person and then that person says well I know someone else and then that so then you kind of snowball and you get your convenience sample that way well I was snowballing by country so I would go to South Africa and I'd say I hear you have some transplanter and they said well but you've got to go to Israel because that's where they're coming from and so then I go to Israel and they go well you've got to go to Moldova that's where we're getting or Bulgaria or here or there so I was just filling in the dots by traveling as my I go to Turkey because that's where the transplants so I followed all of those leads by the time I was done ten years later I realised I was following the same group I mean those two surgeons are not alone but they were very very powerful and they did thousands of together or separate or with other collaborating with others so it's a small form of trafficking that could be stopped if that's what we want to do the other thing is the question of can we regulate it and they're all I have to say if that's where if that's what it has to be self-sufficient fine by nation the way Iran did it that is you can't have people coming in and you know buying the organs of your people which is happening in the Philippines it's mainly there are another universal donor nation because it's it's degrading to the nation it's it's not a healthy political situation I may not like the idea that in Iran you know you buy and sell it's still poor to better off people even though supposedly everyone who needs a kidney in Iran gets it it turns out of course you have influenced the doctors it's the same thing where people that are working class and poor are not the best bets and so they don't always get recommended for transplant and brokers have stepped into Iran so behind the the nice the very nice regulatory system I have to say I've met many Iranian surgeons and they've explained the system to me a million times but what they couldn't anticipate was that the system was based on anonymity so that is you went to a place that would look like the Department of Social Services and you register yourself as I will give my kidney to the next person on the list and you get a compensation not a payment this is you know a religious thing and no no but you will be getting something like $1,500 - thank you for being a heroic organ donor so it's it's not a payment what happens is that the buyers want to know who they're getting the kidney from if it's living they don't want a person who might not have lived a very healthy life who's maybe not a healthy young man between the ages of 23 and 29 it might be somebody older maybe they didn't really check really carefully to see if this person is a vegetarian or is whatever that whatever it is they want college educated a college educated kidney so the brokers behind the scenes yeah they they give up to $25,000 to get you the designer kidney of your choice well once that happens then all of my reservations you know come back and I say how can this be done so that it's fair that it's compatible with medical ethics compatible with equity justice fairness in a country and you know possibly it can be done but I'm not satisfied with what Iran came up with although I know that their intentions were were right I know that it was but it just didn't work out so well in the end
