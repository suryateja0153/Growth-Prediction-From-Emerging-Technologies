 Today's session is about the ICO's amended guidance for charities around direct marketing, and will be presented jointly by senior policy manager Ian Inman and enforcement group manager Andy Curry. Ian is going to kick things off so I'll hand over to him IAN: We wanted to take a as the opening slide says and provide a bit of an update to the charity sector on direct marketing and particularly in light of a lot of things that have gone on over the last 12 months culminating with our recent data direct marketing guidance. So in terms what were actually going to cover there's a quick introduction around why we're doing this some of the main drivers behind it and I'm going to talk a little bit about some of our advice and guidance that we've got out there because obviously although as it says on the slide later on we will enforcement or my colleague Andy is going to talk a little bit about enforcement, we'd rather that it didn't get there, we'd rather that no organizations, charity or otherwise got to the enforcement stage. A lot of things have happened in the charity sector over the last 12 months, from The Daily Mail expose right through our direct marketing updates so in terms of the first question you know why an update well as I mentioned earlier on, It all started about 12 months ago with the Daily Mail stories around fundraising practices among certain members of the charity sector, not just about fundraising, but also the the information sharing issues and data sharing issues that the Samuel Ray case brought to mind. We've had a lot of parliamentary committees we've had a review carried out by Sir Stuart Etherington and obviously the ICO has been quite heavily involved in a lot of this we've given evidence to the committee's we've engaged with the Etherington review and made responses to that as well but also I think part of the issue is that there's been a lot said and a lot written about the ICO's desire to engage with the charity sector and I ve personally been involved in quite a lot of engagement over the last 12 months We know there's a lot of people out there a lot of charities out there that are following the rules or want to follow the rules you know and we see it as our job to try and help you to do that and so one of the reasons we wanted to run this webinar was that's this is one way that we can engage with you as a sector and to provide you with a steer on the kinds of things that you were you should be doing in order to comply with the law and obviously gives you an opportunity to ask us questions as well. We were already working on reviewing our direct marketing guidance over the course of the last 12 months anyway so that's proved quite timely in terms of some of the calls that come out of some of the recent reviews for us to do updated guidance I'm going to speak to a little bit about that as well. So in terms of our updated direct marketing guidance I just very briefly wanted to touch on it, in terms of some of the things that we've changed so we've got a in the new revised guidance we've got an expanded section on charities and not-for-profit organizations I mean it's always been our it's long been the view of the ICO that the promotion of aims and ideals as well as the promotion the more commercial themed promotion of goods and services and things like that forms part of the definition of direct marketing and that's why we have long-held the view that charities are covered by this but we've now put that explicitly in our guidance that we've extended the section on charities so there are new examples even one specific to fundraising and things like that. There's an expanded section on indirect consent and clarification on when it will and won't be valid specifically in the context of list brokering and things like that, and we've put in loads of new examples not just work in terms of relevant to charity but also about explaining what the definition of consent is and you know what the different aspects of the definition of consent might mean in practice. So just to give a brief overview very quickly in terms of the relevant legal provisions which won't be new to all of you but might be new to some of you, the primary vehicle through which we engage with them certainly the direct marketing sphere if you like is through the privacy and electronic communications regulations or PECR. There are various different regulations the main ones that were concerned were the ones that you can see there is out on the slide, so they basically prevent organizations from making direct marketing or communicating direct marketing messages to individuals by different means so you can't make direct marketing and automated telephone calls unless you've got prior consent of the subscriber. You can't do to people via fax or individual subscribers by fax without prior consent, slightly different to coporate subscribers that you can't do live telephone calls for marketing purposes to any number registered on the TPS or CTPS unless they've previously consented to receiving calls. I know that's been a particularly hot topic in the charity sector over the last 12 months and then finally you can't send marketing messages via electronic mail without prior consent electronic mail of course includes text messages and email. There is the kind of soft opt-in aspect there but its important to remember that that doesn't apply to charities and then I ve just very quickly put at the bottom there because some of the issues that I've raised do cover data protection as well so don't forget people have got section 11 rights to object to a direct marketing and also their issues around fair processing and principle one . Just to say they're the last point on that slide don't forget that whilst we're going to talk a lot about the privacy regulations the privacy electronic communications regulations during this I'm going to touch very likely in some areas on issues around data protection and fair processing and you know you don't want to forget people section 11 rights to object to having their personal data processed for direct marketing purposes so it's not all about PECR but we are going to focus on that more than more than data protection during this particular webinar. Just to move very quickly on to consent because you'll have gathered from the last slide that consent is obviously a very important aspect of marketing by electronic means because in almost every regulation there some reference to needing prior consent or someone having to have given you prior consent before you can make marketing calls to them on the TPS and that sort of thing so I didn't really thought might be useful and spend a bit of time going through the different aspects of the definition of consent because of course although it's not defined in the Data Protection Act it is defined in the directive and the reg relations basically use that same that same definition so I tend to I think it's helpful to split the definition down into four different parts so you've got the need for consent to be fully informed, you've got the need for consent to be specific, You've got the need for consent to be freely given and you've got the need for consent to represent a positive indication from the data subject by which they signify their agreement to their personal data being processed in that way.There are some quite close links between certainly the first two aspects there in terms of fully informed and specific because the way that I would describe that to everyone in terms of how that should work in practice is that and again there's also some quite close links to the notion of providing fair processing information under principle one so there you've already got to tell people who you are, what personal data you're collecting and what you're going to do with it and this notion of and you've also got to give specific purposes in terms of what you're going to do, so there's already some very strong similarity there and what we're basically saying here is that as part of that you have to to get consent for marketing you would have to actually clearly and explicitly state that you would use the personal data that they've provided to you for marketing purposes so if I'm making a donation to a charity and as part of that I've given you my email address and telephone number then at the point at which that information is collected there should be a set of information that you have to provide to them under data protection anyway In terms of the specific aspect, it should be specific as to how you will market to me so particularly if you're going to do my electronic means you need to make it clear that you know you're going to market me via email you're going to market me by a telephone call whatever that may be. In terms of the freely given aspect of consent it's really designed to address two areas but the main one is this area where there's some kind of obvious imbalance in the relationship between the individual and the organization but also I think where you're making agreement to receive marketing conditional upon the receipt of your your product or service or whatever it may be or in this instance if I basically can't make a donation to the charity without basically agreeing to be marketed then there would be questions there as to whether or not that consent was whether or not that consent was freely given and the last aspect possibly the simplest one well, the image kind of gives it away there you know we are all familiar with the notion of having check boxes of opt-in or opt-out what we would say is that the positive indication would be the submission of a form that you can argue the making of the donation but certainly the filling out of the form to agree to sign up to a regular donation, that would be a positive action if I've been given the opportunity to opt out and I've not ticked that box and submitted the form then as long as you also comply with everything else i.e you've giving me the clear specific prominent information about what information you're collecting, what you're going to do with it specifically that you're going to market me and how you're going to market me and who's going to market me and what you're going to market me for then that submission of that form alongside all that would be your positive action , to show that yes I've read all that I've and I'm happy that I'm signing up to that. Rob: okay so a couple of questions what classes as evidence of consent if it was given orally e.g if I say to a charity that I'm happy for them to call me what evidence is needed? perhaps I'll do two questions so that's the oral one and then does PECR cover marketing messages on social media instant messaging and in-app comms like pop-up messages? Ian : okay well there's a couple of interesting questions, on the topic of evidence of consent it's handy that that's come up, it was something I was going to touch on very briefly later on but as it's come up in a question it gives me a chance to deal with in in more detail, we accept that there are lots of different ways in which people try and get consent and sometimes people might just have a tick box on their computer that says oh yes well we spoke to this person on the phone and they agreed to marketing, I think my concern with that would be and it's something that's actually been borne out in recent case law that we've been involved in is that realistically although you might think at the time you've got consent if when it comes to standing in front of the tribunal if we were to take formal action against against an organization say we issued an enforcement notice as we did in the in the optical express case which was heard at first-tier tribunal recently now in that case the tribunal was very clear that the onus is on the organization to be able to demonstrate that they had consent to send the marketing messages in question now against that backdrop I would suggest that once you end up in while it's effectively a call you know you're going to want to be relying on something a little bit better than well we spoke to them on the phone and all we can say is that they said yes they didn't mind. I think we'd accept as an office there you might not necessarily have a copy of the original signed form that someone sent in where you can show yes this is exactly the information that we gave to them, this is exactly how it was phrased, this is how it was presented, you can see that there's an opt-out box so they had a genuine choice etc etc but I would say that you need to have something a bit more substantive than just a tick box on your computer that says well we said to this person on the phone do you consent to marketing and they said yes, if because once you get into the tribunal you've got to be able to demonstrate that all those different aspects of the definition of consent were satisfied, you've got to be able to demonstrate that you gave them clear and specific information about how the information was going to be used, that they had a genuine choice in order to sign up to and if you can't do that then you're going to struggle in that environment to show that you've got consent. So I think that what was suggested there in terms of evidence of concern isn't going to suffice really. On the second question on the issue of social media that's quite an interesting one and it's something that we've actually been looking at internally recently so I don't actually have a specific answer on that at the minute but it is something that we're looking at. My initial view would be that they probably wouldn't constitute electronic mail as is defined by the regulations but as I said our formal view on that is still pending. ROB: okay one more question before I let you get on it's about soft opt-in Does soft-in apply for activities other than fundraising? the questioner says we run events that we need to promote and we have also to recruit extra volunteers, there's another one on soft opt-in may be similar but what is this what is the soft opt-in and why does it not apply to charity fundraising? another one on soft opt in , can charities use soft opt-in for email addresses gathered through sales EG tickets, merchandise so want to pick them up and then you can you carry on. IAN: so just to clarify the question about what the soft opt-in is that seems like a good place to start so there is a condition whereby if you obtain someone's details during the course of a sale or the negotiations for the sale of products or services and then you're only using it to market your own similar products or services that you gave them a simple means of opting out at the point at which their details were collected and that in each subsequent communication, they are provided with a simple means of opting out, so quite often on a mailing list emails you'll just see a simple and subscribe link at the bottom that's one example of that then basically what the soft opt in is that actually you can send those marketing messages so only the marketing messages that are for similar products or services and I think the issue here is that you've got to obtain them during the course of a sale of a product or service or during the negotiations for the sale of a product or service, Now I know that some charities have a commercial arm if you like, I mean that we see charity shops on streets all over the place and I think where you're selling goods in that context it is a commercial sale and and if you were to obtain someone's email address as a result of that sale then you could probably put claim the soft opt-in. I think where you have difficulties is when you've then got to be able to say well the only thing we can market is our own similar products or services and I think our view would be that fundraising is not in and of itself and product or service, and that's why charities can't actually apply the soft opt-in. So there fundraising activities even though they could potentially do it to market some of their more commercial activities.  okay so in order to move on from the definition of consent because I'm sure for some of you it won't be new ground so what we're going to look at next, I've just got a couple of examples really now where I'm going to try and put some of this and put some of what I've just said sort of into some context and actually this is one of the examples that was put into our direct marketing guidance in our expanded charities and not-for-profit section or at least a variation I don't think it talked about Jonathan in the direct marketing guidance so you can see on the slide there we have this example so Jonathan's seen this advert in the newspaper seeking donations and it provides a number to text in order to donate so Jonathan decides to donate five pounds, obviously in doing so the charity is going to get hold of his mobile number there because he's going to send the text message using his mobile and what I've said there so in that situation the charity are going to be in breach of regulation 22 which is the one about sending marketing messages via electronic mail ie text message be cause you've got to have the prior consent before you can send the marketing messages and what we've seen or certain what charities have said to me quite a lot is well if someone sends me a five-pound donation then surely that's that's basically implied consent to market them but actually if you think back to what we just said in terms of the definition of what consent is it talks about being fully informed ie that the individual has to be given very clear and specific information about how their information will be used and specifically they'll be used for marketing purposes, the means by which they're going to be marketed, what they're going to be marketed about they've got to be given a chance to opt out so that it can be shown that they've got a genuine choice otherwise you're basically making the ability to donate dependent on on me or Jonathan in this case signing up to agree to marketing yes you could argue that if all that had been in place that the act of actually making the donation is a positive action but the difficulty here would be because there's no even if you had all that clear and prominent information because there's actually no effective means for Jonathan to opt out you'd still be struggling to demonstrate that that consent was freely given and that you're not actually basically making the his ability to make that five pound donation dependent on him accepting marketing you know so the key thing there is you can't just assume that because someone's decided they want to make a donation of five pounds or whatever it may be and that in doing so and as a result of doing so you come into possession of some of their information their mobile number in this case that it's therefore implicit that you can then start to make fundraising texts or calls or whatever it may be to to that number, you've still got to make sure that you've satisfied all the different aspects of the definition of consent and in that case I have specifically left out the example because you know I want to say it's not there it's all that clear information about how his information will be used that is something I know I've been asked recently when I've been out speaking to the charity sector, it's also come up in the context of television adverts where you have the same issue then about a number comes up to donate but actually there's no associated information within the advert about how the information will be used or how to opt out or its presented in a very fragmented & unclear way so I think the same issues will arise there for it but a television advert but not just a newspaper advert  ROB: there's a specific question if you could take that as far as positive indication goes is it fair to state if you're happy for us to keep in touch with you including fundraising communications please provide your email e-mail and somebody sent me an email box or telephone box that is providing like email and telephone box as the opt-in I think that's the question as opposed to a tick box would that do the job ? the job if what they're saying is well we're going to tell them how we're going to use this information and we'll give them a choice as to whether they provide that information or not then I still think the tick box is a better way to go because I think sometimes individuals might be confused about whether they do actually have to provide their email or telephone number or not whereas I think if they basically make it more dependent on what have they or havent they ticked our opt-out box that's a bit clearer I have always said whenever I've spoken to people that we are aware that tick boxes are not the regulations and the directive are not so descriptive as to say tick boxes are the only means that you can use but I think I think we definitely think that's the better way a clearer way of doing it than just hoping that they've kind of read some small print at the bottom when they may have given you information because they felt like they had to not because they wanted you to market to them and use it. Rob: there are a lot of questions and thank you very much for them I think I do know now that we won't unfortunately get to all of them in this webinar but we will be publishing our responses to them in the days ahead but just one more specific one Ian if i can. Can we source tele match phone numbers for outbound phone calls for people on the supporters database who have previously made a donation transaction they would have been given an opportunity opt-out of telephone contact in direct mail communications containing opt-out tick box IAN: I'm going to assume that what they mean by that is can we if for some reason the number that we have om record ends up no longer being accurate in terms of they've moved or got a different number or that they didn't provide it to us when they got a new number or something like that when they say reverse matching or tele matching and if you actually I'm just moving move the slides on on that point because the next example that I've got as I as I recall is very much about this notion of going out and finding somebody's number if you don't already have it. It's a slightly different context so I might just have to address both sides of the story. in this example what we actually have is Jo so we've got a door-to-door campaign there so a charity representative has come to Jo's door knocked on the door , got a load of the paperwork out and said to Jo do you want to sign up to donate to a charity on a regular basis? Jo's quite happy to do that the paperwork clearly explains that unless she ticks the opt-out box then the charity will use her details to market to her by telephone or email she doesn't tick the opt-out box but she doesn't actually give the telephone number or the email, the charity then decides after the event that they're going to go to a publicly available source such as the phone book or something else and basical obtain her telephone number because they have her name and address and then proceed to market because of course she hasn't ticked the opt-out box. In that set of circumstances again you could argue well we've given them clear and specific information, we've told them specifically that we're going to market and we've told them specifically how you know we've given them a means to opt-out now Jo hasn't ticked the opt out box but she hasn't actually given you her information so I would say that if you were to then go and find that information from somewhere else and basically proceed to market Jo off the back of that then you're going to have compliance issues with PECR, you're also probably gonna have compliance issues with the Data Protection Act because that I would say that it's not going to be within someone's reasonable expectations where they haven't provided you with their number to then for you to go and obtain that number from somewhere else without their knowledge basically and then start making phone calls to them for marketing purposes that they wouldn't reasonably expected to receive because they didn't actually give you the number that you're phoning them to market them on so I don't think you could say that someone's consented to marketing calls on a telephone number that they've deliberately not given to you so that you can't market them but I'd also say that you've got compliance issues on the principle one of the data protection act in terms of fair processing in there as well because you've actually obtained personal data in a way that they wouldn't reasonably have expected. Rob: I don't know if this is closely connected but it's an interesting question why can't charities contact their own supporters who are on the TPS and is the private sector bound by these rules and if not, why not? well to answer the second half of the question first the regulations are not really about sector there are about activity so basically if you're if you're making telephone calls automated or live if you're sending faxes ,if you're sending emails text messages, if you're sending any direct marketing material that's covered by the regulations it doesn't matter whether you're public sector or private sector or a charity you're covered by the regulation so yes the private sector are bound by the same rules as are the public sector and charities are no different in that sense. so what well what I would say to that is what if you have if they have previously consented to you to receiving those fundraising or marketing calls then you can because that's what the regulation says the regulation says that you can't make live marketing telephone calls to people to numbers registered on the TPS unless the subscribers previously notified you that they do not for the time being object to such calls being made so our view on that is that basically if you've got the prior consent of your donor if you like to make those calls even if they are registered on the TPS then you can do so in my experience over the last 12 months the issue has come from what actually you know constitutes consent and charities but charities perhaps have a bit of a misunderstanding of what consent is and believing that they have the consent to make those phone calls when in reality they don't. So I would say that you can phone people you can make marketing calls to people registered on TPS as long as you do it in line with what the regulations say which is that they have to have given you their prior consent that despite the fact that they're on the TPS you and maybe a given make your consent to you can phone them for marketing purposes, ROB: one more question in and then just just for now if records have to be destroyed after six years of storing them how would we have proof that a donor has given us permission to use their data well? ian I'm not entirely clear where the where the retention periods come from where I'm aware there are certain records such as tax records that have to be retained for us for a six year period but to my mind you would need to keep that record of consent as long as you were going to rely on it. It's worth pointing out at this stage as well that the regulations say that they consent for the time being so the ICO view is as that consent doesn't last forever so I would perhaps suggest that in the absence of any other indication from the individual beyond a six-year-old indication of consent that you've probably relied on that consent for too long anyway. the direct marketing guidance does talk about six months in certain areas, it's not really for us the law or doesn't give us any grounds to state specifically how long consent should last for but I do think that you know you've got to retain a record of consent as long as you're going to be relying on it but also I would say that you can't rely on it for too long and you'd need to seek some means of refreshing that consent probably before that six-year period actually.  just in terms of moving on to some key points before I hand over to my colleague some of these we've actually covered off in some of the questions but that first point is quite important so you know remember the definition of consent is important and making sure that you've satisfied all four aspects of it is essential if you if you've satisfied three but not the other then you haven't got consent and and I always make the point to people you know you if you're assuming that you've got consent and you're probably on sticky ground which goes back to that notion that really you should be able to demonstrate that you've got it and in fact sort of whilst I don't want to get too much into the detail of thinking forward under the GDPR today there is actually an express obligation on data controllers who are relying on consent to be able to demonstrate that they have the consent of the data subject so in terms of future compliance that's going to be something that you all need to bear in mind anyway but basically the fact that someone's not objected to receive marketing calls in doesnt mean they have consented what I mean by that is you may well have been calling a long-standing donor for some time with fundraising calls and they've never complained I mean that's something I've had said to me a lot over the last 12 months, the fact that they've never complained does not constitute you having consent to having made those calls, what matters is have you told them what you're going to do with their information? have they been given that clear specific prominent information about who you are ?what you are collecting the fact that you're going to market them how you're going to market them what you're going to market before and were they given a realistic viable choice? Was the consent freely given? have you got that positive indication that they that they agreed to that those are the really important things it doesn't matter that you've been phoning them for a long time and they've never complained. Some people find it very difficult to complain on the phone some people to be fair might not complain as they don't you know they're not bothered but that in and of itself is not sufficient to get consent you need to be able to demonstrate that using all the factors that we've talked about earlier on and the second part really just leads onto that you should be able to demonstrate in evidence that you have consent and like i said earlier on that's going to be a slightly more detailed process than just pointing to some box that you've ticked or a comment that's been logged on a computer screen somewhere in terms of the third point again you know calls made for the purpose of seeking consent to market to make marking cause they are classed as marking calls themselves and they contrivene the regulations the reasons for this is that the regulations basically say that calls cannot be made for direct marketing purposes well they don't say they can there can't be made purely for direct marketing purposes are dominantly for direct marketing purposes the only thing that really matters as far as the call is concerned is that it is for to an extent for some purpose a direct marketing call and our view is that seeking consent to market somebody is a direct marketing purpose and therefore that call in and of itself will become covered by the regulations and the last point I want to make just before I hand over to my colleague is and it links back to that example we gave in the issues with newspaper and television ads but also things we've started to seeing sort of radio ads and things like that as well is this notion of the clarity of the information that people are providing so you know I've used the example they have compressed audio where the fair processing notice is basically read at incredibly high speed and in basically an incomprehensible stream of audio or you get things on television adverts where part of the fair process and notices at the start of the advert it's in very small print compartments at the end and then in the middle you've got a number to text for a donation and it should all be nice and together and clear it needs to be clear so when they read it needs to be clear to the individual that it all links together that's all part of the same thing and that actually in all links to the idea that if I do this if I make this donation is what's going to happen this is what I'm agreeing to and this is how I can stop that from happening if that's what I want. helpful obviously you know if possible I pick up some of the questions later on but now I will hand you over to my colleague and it will speak to you a little bit more about some of the enforcement action the new and everyone have hoped you find in the session interest in mine is probably going to be the least interesting bit I can tell you this presently just to provide a short update on what the ICO has been doing in respect of this sector following the allegations made in the Daily Mail in July 2015 and where they made them Andrew allegations but unlawful marketing and named the number of charities and obviously following at that and those newspaper articles in July and August we started investigation into the allegations and the main aim was to prove or disprove those allegations that charities that contravene the data protection act or the privacy and electronic communication regulations and so since then our investigations been ongoing we've been in contact with all of the charities that were named in the newspaper articles and in respect for any action that we've taken we have concerns about three charities and their approach the law that resulted in us and second assessing one that's having an amber compliance rating which is a system we use publish on our website where we had any organization that we're a bit concerned about in terms of complaint volumes or their policies or procedures and we will place on a three-month monitoring program now this is to give them time to remedy the situation and to take action to get themselves back into compliance and for us to look at what they're doing those three charities were Greenpeace are an i-beam Christian Aid and now pleased to report that all three charities have made significant improvements and in the next update that will produce on our website you'll see that they've been created to reflect the action that they've taken to comply with the law the investigation into a number of the other charities continues and I guess what I want to stress is that we haven't ruled out any option and from no taking no further action because we're happy with what they've done through to a formal enforcement action okay so that's that's the end of my Enforcement Section and we're happening they're taking further questions oh okay so thanks very much and it will take a couple of questions and then we'll close it because the repeat for people who come in later we will be responding to the questions we haven't had time to get to and it needs some of those that we have on it I just want a couple more perhaps fries or whoever wants to pick it up yeah but it there's not a lot of social media media could but to use tools such as custom audiences on facebook you need concept to market our channel of social media I mean really again I can really say on that is that we accept the social media is a bit of a new thing in the perhaps was as probably if indeed it's all one of regulations were first draft didn't I think we're still taking a look at the extent to which you know a private message on facebook or something like that would be a redirect sorry would be electronic mail as defined by the regulations I mean really it's very difficult to answer these questions on social media I think it's something i'd have to take away from this webinar and and and feed into the work we're already doing in terms of looking at social media and how that actually interacts with the regulations okay thank you everybody for joining the webinar the sun on it that's all we had to have time to repeat once again we'll be putting the recording of hoarding webinar on website surely an awesome the responses to questions so thank you very much about your time this afternoon
