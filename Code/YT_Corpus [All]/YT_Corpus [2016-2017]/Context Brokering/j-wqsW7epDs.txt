 hello and welcome everyone my name is Bill calorie I'm manager programs and knowledge exchange at CPAC I'll be moderating the webinar today and for those of you aren't familiar with CD pack or the chronic disease prevention alliance of Canada we're a network of many of canada's largest national healthy living and chronic disease prevention organizations who have come together really to work on the common determinants of chronic disease so for your interests are our website our social media coordinates are at the bottom so you can learn more about us check out our resources upcoming events etc today's webinar it's part of a series of webinars being co-hosted by CD pack and the public health agency of Canada Centre for chronic disease prevention it's entitled enhancing healthcare professional capacity to integrate evidence-based smoking cessation interventions and we're extremely pleased to be co-hosting the webinar and really looking forward to hearing from our presenter today we're also pleased to be continuing to offer an ongoing series of webinars on a range of different topics this year so on behalf of CD pack and our co-host the public health agency of Canada I'd like to issue a warm welcome and thanks for joining us today so our Q&A moderate and pleased to introduce julie greane she's going to actually be introducing our presenter today and she's going to be chairing the questions and discussion with our presenter Julie is currently part of the partnerships and strategies division at the public health agency of Canada and she's worked in various positions in the health portfolio for over 17 years her current files focus primarily on diabetes prevention and tobacco cessation and building partnerships and programs to advance our thinking and progress in helping canadians to be healthier and more active in the places they work live and play over to Julie thanks a lot bill I appreciate the introduction and welcome everybody to the webinar so I think we've listed a bit of an agenda here and Cheryl if you wanted to speak to any of that feel free to jump in so we're going to talk a little bit about the CNR see what we really want to get into is the project that we've developed here which is the competencies and the accreditation we're going to talk a little bit about tobacco competencies why accreditation of what the process looks like recertification etc so those of you who are interested in her working in the field of tobacco cessation this is really a good chance for you to discuss listen understand what those current competencies are in developing and delivering tobacco cessation so by the end of the webinar we would like participants have a good understanding of the certified tobacco educator program and how it can assist you or your clients in carrying out more consistent more effective cessation across the country so that's really what the project objective is and the learning objective is for you to understand the objectives the outcomes the process so I want to toss you a little bit about the context in which this program is situated so we are the chronic disease prevention center at the public health agency of Canada and part of what we do is a grants and contributions funding program so those of you who are familiar with grants and contributions know that this is the way that the government partners with and contributes to initiatives that are happening on the ground and in communities but from a federal level so our funding program encompasses a number of issues and funding programs and they range from cancer cardiovascular disease diabetes tobacco healthy living of eight public access defibrillators injury prevention and of course tobacco which we're here to talk about today so our want to tell you a little bit about the context in which our program works some of you may be familiar with our program or how we fund but a few years ago we had the opportunity to take a traditional grants and contributions program and to turn it on its head in some ways to figure out how we could do things better how we could get projects that had more mutually agreeable objectives and outcomes how we could get better value for our money how could we get more people working in chronic disease prevention and so we decided to take the existing lever that we had and the policy authorities that we're given with this funding program and figure out how we could turn this into more of a shull innovation social finance program so looking at the some of the items on our pictographs here we would say one is we are open 365 days a year and what we mean by that is that we have a continuous intake of letters of intent in our program that means at any time during the year you can send us a letter of intent which really outlines the idea for your intervention and the reason we've done that is we've discovered that it takes time to develop the type of ideas and partnerships that we need and having a window open for a month at a time with not going to get us to where we needed part of what we do in terms of the way we work as well as we really focus on reciprocal capacity-building what we bring to what most people think of the federal government is bringing to the table as money but we like to think of what we bring to the table as smart money and that's money that comes along with expertise with resources with connections with access to networks and we really look to understand what we have to offer to partners to develop a program and what different partners have to bring to the table there's been a much stronger focused on the role of the broker in finding the projects that we want we work in a one-to-one match funding model that's the leverage part that you see that means for every dollar that we invest another partner invest a dollar and those dollars come from non taxpayer-funded sources we're looking to bring new money into chronic disease prevention and this is a way to do it and finally I'll say that we work on a pay-for-performance system which means that no money has given up front to run an intervention but that the applicant is paid upon completion of outputs and really that's just a way for us to have assurance that the government and taxpayers are getting what they pay for in terms of making a contribution to a program so that's a little bit about how our new program works I'm happy to have more follow-up conversations on that so just briefly talk about some of those chronic disease that chronic diseases that we deal with and really our program focuses on on three common risk factors for chronic disease and that's physical inactivity unhealthy eating and tobacco use so you'll see that all of our projects will report against one or more those indicators you'll see on this slide we're more of our funding has gone and you'll see the match funds that have been leveraged since the inception of our program and I will say that this number changes almost on a daily basis as we continue to negotiate new projects and there are a few projects where the government is now a minority funder and not to say we are providing less funding than other partners to the intervention so that's certainly a change in the way that we work you'll see that the majority of our projects fall into physical activity or inactivity and addressing unhealthy eating you can see the funds that have been invested here in tobacco control and tobacco cessation we received two million dollars a year from the federal tobacco control strategy and we look to leverage those funds to make that pot grow some of you hopefully we'll have seen some of the media around our running rerun to quit project this week I believe it's been in almost every every major paper that we've seen across the country has carried some mention of our run to quit project and so those are the type of investments were very proud to have made at public health agency you can see some of the partners that we work in we do work with traditionally traditionally government grants and contributions programs work with not-for-profits and academics so you can see that we've added another sector to our partnerships and that's working with the for-profit or charitable sectors some of the partners you'll see listed here I've never worked with government before I've never considered working with government weren't sure why they should or would need to work with government so when I talk about co-creation brokering and reciprocal capacity-building you get a sense of the amount of time energy and commitment that it takes to bring new partners to bear on these issues so I just want to tell you a little bit about the funding program that we work in and the CNR see project that you're about to hear about was one of the first investments that we made in the tobacco program when we started to receive the tobacco money in 2012-2013 and we felt that it was a great project that brought together many of the stakeholders in the tobacco long health respiratory communities under one objective which is really to improve how we liberalisation in this country so on that note I'm really pleased to introduce you Cheryl Connors who is the executive director of the Canadian network for respiratory care and is the project lead the passionate engine behind this project the enhancing healthcare professional capacity to integrate evidence-based smoking cessation interventions so over You Cheryl great thank you very much Julie and I know the title of our project is that is a mouthful I'm going to start off by just introducing the Canadian network for respiratory care to those of you who may not be familiar with our organization this is our mission statement and you'll see we have added because we were founded as a respiratory organization but we've added tobacco use disorder to our mission and I'm going to talk more about that as I go through the competencies see NRC was founded in nineteen ninety four we are a nonprofit into registered charity and we have a combination of individual members who are our certified as a respiratory COPD and now which is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and tobacco educators and we also have organizational members and and our organizations are organizations with an interest in respiratory care and tobacco use disorder and we've always been funded because we were originally an umbrella organization and we are a unique example of corporate cooperation and collaboration amongst numerous health care professionals and organizations and really that spirit of being an umbrella and collaborating is one of CNR see of core guiding principle so when we have the opportunity to work in a public-private partnership that was very much one of our essential principles this is a list of our current member organizations and you'll see that initially very strong foundation in respiratory care and will continue to expand to bring other organizations that are more traditional in tobacco prevention and cessation into our umbrella I'll talk a little bit about our current credential so we were we began as the Canadian network for asthma care so the very first credential that we offered was a certified asthma educator credential and that first credential was in 1999 in 2007 we started work on our new certified respiratory educator credential which included both asthma and COPD and the framework that we are building will continue to allow new chronic disease modules to be added into our credentialing framework so I'll speak more to that as we talk about the competencies this is a current makeup of our educator so there are almost 1,800 certified respiratory and tobacco educator over a thousand certified respiratory educators 452 certified asthma educators to explain the difference between those two credentials or certified as an educators work primarily in pediatrics and we recommend that any healthcare professional working with adults would do the certified respiratory educator prevent credential so that they can cover both asthma and COPD we do some COPD certification in the u.s. only because there already is asthma certification there but we were asked to expand into the US and in fact you're doing that internationally because we are the only organization that does that have major programming for COPD and then we have our new program and today we have 138 certified tobacco educators and you'll see there a broad range of healthcare professionals the majority or respiratory therapists we're at forty-five percent fastest growing group or far twenty-five percent nurses twenty-three percent in a wide range of other types of healthcare professionals we do anticipate that with our new certified tobacco educator credential we will start to get a broader range of health professionals educate this is some of the great things that our educators do and why my patients seek them out and they really do extend the services of a physician one of our core key messages is that education takes time in a busy physician doesn't always have the time to to do education with patients and not something that our educators are great at so I'll speak now to the project again this is a multi-year project and there were main deliverables of the project the big components were that we created the current evidence informed competencies for tobacco educator and then we also created a training program for healthcare professionals that can be delivered both in person in online and the National certification exam our secondary deliverables was to look at the state of tobacco use training and training materials in the country and we did a comprehensive needs assessment on that and we've created an online collaborative network for the tobacco educators we have we were very fortunate to have a wide variety of thunder sponsors and development partners on the project that in some provided cash and other provided knowledge and resources staff time our main development partners on the project were the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health the teach project cam 8 and also Alberta Health Services and they were wonderful and generous and in helping to develop the competencies training program and certification exam so the program objectives are supporting clients with tobacco use disorder creating that current comprehensive pension in evidence and form training for healthcare professionals and also to recognize the skills and knowledge of healthcare professionals providing tobacco prevention and cessation and to bring greater consistency to existing tobacco prevention and cessation training programs across the country our target audience is a broad range of healthcare professionals the the in order to qualify to become a certified tobacco educator you must have a degree or diploma and recognized healthcare profession that includes counseling within its scope of practice and that's some of them we we do we are recognizing health in its broadest sense so not just regulated health professionals and we do have an alternative pathway that our certification management committee will review recognizing that there are lots of people that have been working in a tobacco community that may not fit into that criteria were they where we would look at if they've been working for ten years and have a certain him and spend at least fifty percent of their time doing cessation that we would also look at those folks and allowing them to challenge the exam so why certification so so this is our answer to why we do certification but they do have a well-defined purpose which is to protect the public by cheering that those who are certified possess sufficient knowledge and skills to important perform important activities safely and effectively this is an overview of what a competency and certification program will include so the competencies and I'm going to speak a lot more about them gets divided into two parts which is the curriculum on the left that's the the training part and then there's an assessment part on the right side so the curriculum has been divided into two parts to follow the competencies which is that core foundational health education course and then a tobacco education course the assessment happens for comprehensively so they'll be tested on both the foundational health education competencies and the tobacco education competencies because together they create the certified tobacco educator credential and that assessment includes a standardized k-space course assignment that everyone taking the course has to do and there are performance competencies that are evaluated by observation the certification exam is a multiple-choice exam some competencies for example how people teach whether they can perform motivational interviewing those types of competencies are difficult to measure in a multiple choice exam so those are done at the course level and that's why the courses are requirement they're not optional so this is the certification process people first have to qualify then they take both the education course and tobacco course they complete their assignments and are successful in passing the course and then they can challenge the exam once they certify they have to participate in continuous learning follows enrc's code of ethics and professional practice and then recertify every five years and we have two pathways to recertification which I will speak to when we get to the recertification section right now I'm going to speak to the competencies so competencies are observable and measurable abilities skills behaviors and knowledge and they define what our new tobacco educators should know and can do within their job role and they also define both the importance in frequency of the competency area so as we go through the competencies you'll see that some of those competencies are weighted as being more important and/or performed more frequently so for examination purposes those those that are rated as being more Gordon would would be weighted more heavily on the exam there would be more exam questions for those higher weighted competencies for each competency this is this is the formula that they follow so you'll have the general the block category is the general title for this section it will state the competency there will often be behavioral indicators that will explain what that competency means and sometimes there will be examples or requirements to the competencies and well you'll see that as as I go through so the how we developed a certified tobacco educator competencies we had a wide group of we created a an expert advisory group that worked on the development of the competencies and I went on that was you know well over a year we spent on developing the competencies working with y consultation with stakeholders folks working in tobacco control professional associations our own educator community to develop the competencies and then they were sent out to four wide validation in the competencies have gone through continuous revision and improvement in and and they will continue to be living breathing documents they're not stagnant it's not we build the competencies that's it as as we learn that there are new skills or knowledge for tobacco educators to learn will continue to modify those documents and then after we do that at exam blueprint is created and that's where we they create a rating of importance for each competency and then they we also look at the frequency so how frequently it's it's performed in a criticality so and that's how after the blueprint is performed we might say twenty percent of the exam questions are going to be in area of motivational interviewing communications and ten percent are going to be covering tobacco use disorder that's that how that works so the first set of competencies that will speak to our foundational health education competencies that are consistent for all CRC credentials in a wide application to working with a broad range of chronic diseases and the reasons that we did this is in approaching tobacco cessation we are expert advisory committee really looked at that each patient each client you have to look at them in a holistic way and it and it's not logical to sit down with someone who is who has tobacco use disorder and say okay well today i'm working i'm i'm wearing my smoking cessation hat and we're going to talk about your health goals in your cessation and not talk about all of those other factors and comorbidities that may be impacting that person's tobacco use we're not going to talk about your your COPD or your diabetes or your lack of physical physical activity so we really want it to arm our educators with as wide a variety of skills because we are dealing with complex patients today with multiple comorbidities and and you need to have the skills to be able to deal with that so the foundational health education the broad areas are health promotion and education communication educational interventions resource management professional practice and program evaluation and I'm just going to go through those and then and then if you have questions about the specific competencies will take a little pause there and answer some questions so you don't have to just listen to me talk and again just a quick reminder this is these are the foundational health education competencies consistent for all of the credentials and then it folks take a disease-specific module to become certified asthma educator certified respiratory educators today we are just talking about our tobacco credential to certified tobacco educator credential so the first in one of our fundamental core competency areas of health promotion and education so the competency it's is practice health promotion and then the behavioral indicators so that would be one point one is the competency area and then the behavioral integrators a behavioral indicate indicators are apply social determinants of health from working with individuals and communities apply the principles of primary health care defined by the World Health Organization differentiate amongst the three levels of health promotion and disease prevention and and that's primary secondary and tertiary and then four is integrate theoretical frameworks of health promotion and care into practice the expanded chronic care model to proceed proceed model social support and identify the role they educator an overall health promotion strategy and integrate principles of client centered care in practice and that the individual family community so these are really this is the real theoretical core of what we're doing this is the framework for people to understand the role that they play that education plays a really important role in health promotion in developing the course to support this because a lot of these concepts are more challenging for clinicians we've really spent a lot of time not just you know making people understand you know these theory but to create education strategies the real clinical application so what does that mean to you as an individual clinician because they're really trying to drive health professional practice that as individual clinicians they do have an important role to perform in health promotion and understanding how you fit into the broader health care system is an important piece of understanding health how health promotion works the next competency apply education theory and this is really for cessation which was heavily founded in coming out of the psychological practice using national interviewing and maybe a little transtheoretical model but we've really merged our education approach with that traditional approach that was being taught in cessation programs so we're we go through education theories behaviors of constructivism humanism cognitivism and so that folks understand how people learn and how to teach them and then looking at the models and theories of behavior change the health belief model social cognitive theory self-efficacy theory the theory of planned behavior transtheoretical model and the confidence and conviction model and the reason that we have this strong foundation in education in the same way that that you practice evidence-based medicine in your practice we are also promoting evidence-based education again in the course that we've designed we've really worked very hard to take those theories and show people the practical application so what we say is that we're building a toolkit of strategies for educators to use when they're working with their their clients who smoke so it's not just relying on this is there's just one way to approach this client at the end you're going to have a much more comprehensive comprehensive range of skills and knowledge and abilities to be able to help your clients as they're all individual communication is the next major competency area and this is to use communication methods and techniques and implementing motivational interviewing so verbal and nonverbal communication we spend a lot of time on motivational interviewing it's a very powerful counseling method that can be integrated into practice with a wide range of diseases and then the next section is educational interventions and the first one is assess the client and this is the list of all of the the client characteristic it needs relevant to learning so that when you work with your client you take look at their determines of health or motivation their preferences their developmental stage we talk about health literacy their abilities or health looking at concurrent diseases and disorders culture and their previous health education and experiences in the next section would be designing a plan for learning objectives I'll speak to this a little bit in the training but this is one of the pieces that were very excited about but but how were we want everyone to start off creating health goals with clients that are smart which is specific measurable achievable relevant and time-bound and in creating learning objectives to support the clients health goal responding to their client learning characteristics and needs selecting instructional methods selecting resources identify any required client accommodation and identifying factors that are barriers support to their potential then we would implement an education plan and that would be demonstrating effective instructional methods for individuals and group addressing barriers and supports to enter into implementing that plan and then always evaluating the client learning objectives by developing the smart client learning objective we we want health care professionals to consistently be revisiting those learning objectives to see whether the client has achieved those outcomes the next section is resource management and this is with a wide range of information that is available to clients stay and we always laugh about dr. Google we want our health professionals to understand and also be able to teach their clients how they can discern what are good resources that they should be sharing with their their clients and and then on in the same note we've put integrating technology into practice because certainly with our certified respiratory educators technology was a new company see for them as it was an area that we had identified as being a weaker for our clients for instance professional practice this will be common for many health professionals so so acting ethically and professionally so this is not different but of course we would want to certified tobacco educators to follow good ethical professional practices and collaborating with others so at the spirit of cessation and why we teach the expanded chronic care model is that our educators are interdisciplinary and work in interprofessional work teams and collaborating with other members of the team is really important and then and then to do formal program evaluations you are taught how to measure whether your outcomes are successful Julie should we start stop there sure I've got to question okay so the first question is from Tracy hoskin and she's asking do have a provincial or regional breakdown of tobacco educators yes I do and I can provide that afterwards of the hundred and thirty-eight you don't have it off they're there right now right across the country and I end and I'll explain them where we piloted the training programs but probably a little more in Alberta because we're we're a in one of our big programs Alberta Ontario but they really have been am right across the country so far the second question we have is from an deep Kalra she says do the CRE has to repeat the education module for CTE I know least developed because they've already been evaluated on the education competencies because that would have been included in their certified respiratory educator credential they do not have to do a new course but they are tested on the new competencies because the new foundational health education competencies are quite different from the education content in certified respiratory educator credential occurs we've really moved in a lot of really new and exciting competencies with her with the new program okay and so the second part of that question is is the education module different than respect rec rest truck so rest wreck is the program run by one of our training partners a long association of saskatchewan and not a national training program that many health professionals may be familiar with they have already integrated the new competencies into their new education for chronic disease management so it is it covers the competencies thank you those are the questions I have right now okay great so we'll move on to a tobacco now so the tobacco education competencies and I'll just start off by saying you know one of the reasons it took us a long time to develop the tobacco education company was looking at the process it's not a linear process so we really struggled with how do we organize the competencies in a logical way so so it's it's this is what we finally have have come up with and but it's not a you know you don't go from step one to step two step three there there would be there are some things would happen organically throughout your time with your clients but we're going to look at the tobacco epidemic tobacco use disorder and other substance use tobacco control assessment interventions pharmacological alternative and complementary treatment client centered approach and then tobacco programs and systems so the the first part of the credential we look at examining the tobacco epidemic and I have to say this was one of the art aback Oh educators were doing prevention and cessation so we also want them to educate a high at risk groups before they start smoking and even working with point their clients who do smoke having a high level understanding of the tobacco epidemic is why we've included this competency it is a very very small part of the blueprint because we don't want people spending a lot of time memorizing statistics it's it's challenging to manage because it's just statistics change all the time but having some sense especially in your own community are your smoking rates going up are they going down we've seen that coast to coast while overall the tobacco numbers are coming down there are sections where parts of the country where particularly in the twenty to forty five year age group we're seeing some increases in smoking rates and that should be a particular concern for the health professionals so that's what that competency means that's what we want you to take a look at and have a sense of what's happening globally as well as it will impact you here when you look at immigration having an understanding of the culture of where people are coming from what the Global tobacco works at the second one would be that explain the biological and environmental harm associated with a tobacco use so that's looking at the effects of tobacco use on morbidity and mortality describing the health impacts of the toxic components and carcinogens and tobacco products harm associated with secondhand and third hand or latent types of tobacco smoke exposure looking at the impact of stock use on the environment and also looking at the harm associated with contraband tobacco products then we look at tobacco products themselves and I'll just a backtrack a minute here to say we have included marijuana in our tobacco educator competencies we spent a lot of time going back and forth when we did when we decided what we were going to call this credential and we had start off calling it the certified smoking cessation educator because we want it to be inclusive and include marijuana we did extensive marketing research and and they're just the word cessation didn't wasn't a patient friendly word and we wanted to try to make it shorter and tobacco educator ended up being the clear winner but it does include marijuana and and one of the prime reasons was we knew we couldn't talk to youth about tobacco without also talking to them about marijuana so so you will see marijuana when we look at that tobacco products here and and then you'll also see he so we've divided divided it between combustible non combustible and then we talk about tobacco like products and then we look at tobacco industry tactics and what the taco industry is doing to promote tobacco use their manufacturing tactics advertising lobbying and public relations and the tactics that target specific high risk and high youth populations and it didn't hate the Prague ministry before you do that read through that section you certainly will at the end of it so now we're on the second big company of tobacco use disorder and other substance use and this is also one of the big changes that we wanted out there when we did a comprehensive needs assessment even amongst their own respiratory educators we learned that there was a lot of misunderstanding about tobacco use that even amongst those health professionals a feeling that tobacco is just a bad habit and that just telling people that they should stop smoking is sufficient we wanted to take a disease management approach to tobacco use and in one of the ways that we've done this is that we're using the dsm-5 criteria to teach about tobacco use disorder so tobacco use disorder and other so that's what we look at here we examine tobacco use disorder look at the biological psychosocial too high behavioral and environmental there's that influence initiation and sustainment of tobacco use we explained it nicotine addiction explained nicotine withdrawal so we actually look at the neurobiology of what happens in the brain with nicotine or tobacco educators have to understand that and then we look at the both the diagnostic criteria and withdrawals criteria we examine the relationships between tobacco use and other substances including alcohol and marijuana we are addressing misperceptions of marijuana as a safer alternative to tobacco and we look at that neurobiological interactions between caffeine and tobacco and then we the next competency would be implementing health promotion strategies so we would so the next section is story tobacco control and then we're desert this is the high level what are the elements of tobacco control so the first one would be implementing health promotion strategies and that would be looking at the prevention protection cessation and denormalization that occurs in health promotion identify the role of an educator in tobacco control so what is the role of a clinician working in tobacco control and then support primary prevention activities and organizations in the community and an example is listed there to explain that competency organizing a school prevention program we describe tobacco cessation these are high level competency items looking at this benefits of cessation and we explain the different approaches to cessation so self-directed people are quitting on their own brief minimal many of you'll be familiar with programs such as the Ottawa model that involves brief and minimal interventions and then intensive interventions and our program is really training health preventional professionals to do those intensive interventions we they are also taught about brief and minimal interventions because there are many times tobacco educators simply aren't going to have the time to do the intensive interventions with their clients we look at the 5 a's and also look at harm reduction on the next session is assessment and this is a comprehensive assessment that they would do with clients that links very much the assessment section that they've already learned the more general client characteristics types of assessment they learned in their foundational health education training and now this is assessment specific to tobacco so they would document client healthy history and document clients values history one of our key teachings is that many health professionals don't even ask about tobacco use every visit and their emrs don't have any place to even record whether clients are smoking or not and and we are pushing health care practice so that our educators can go back to their family health teams or community clinics and really advocate for those formal processes in that would allow the documentation to occur so so through that we look at tobacco use the quit experience the readiness to quit environmental environmental exposures and triggers for tobacco use the level of nicotine dependence and the severity of withdrawal symptoms triggers cravings coping strategies barriers to cessation client supports and client preferences for treatment and then we would also assist the client in identifying the factors that influence internal and external motivation for cessation we go through evidence-based assessment tools so so you're taught a lot of people are familiar with faggotron but there's lots of other tests that are available so those would be descriptive assessments and then we would you're taught to interpret the results of the descriptive assessments and then also to interpret the results of objective test carbon monoxide levels caught nine levels and spirometry and then the next section will be creating a quit plan in collaboration with the client and we are big on the use of written action plans for or managing asthma and copd and we've been working really hard on creating a quick plan template which we have done that would be a very short written quit plan that our tobacco educators can share with their clients so that would start with them creating a SMART goal for the quit plan and and then looking at the therapies and treatments recommending strategies to address the impacts of tobacco cessation and developing relapse prevention plans the next thing would be counseling clients so they are taught both motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy motivational interviewing is taught in the course foundational health education in the tobacco course it is really reinforced and applied very specifically to tobacco describes therapeutic relationships with clients and then looking at the different types of counseling methods telephone one-on-one group and internists internet-based counseling the next section would be support the client through relapse and this is where it's really doing really encouraging the educators to do that formal follow-up and and evaluate and continue to reevaluate their success and if the clients relapse to continue to work with them to get them right back on their quit plan so adjusting intervention and relapse plans and then pharmacological alternative and complementary treatment this could have been part of interventions we pulled it out just because interventions was too long of a section so pharmacological interventions is looking at contradict contraindications precautions adverse events doses administration interactions costs in combination and I will just briefly say that this said this is discussed pharmacological interventions it's not recommend prescribed so we have sort of a big black box warning for tobacco educators here that they must still act within their scope of practice so if if your scope of practice says that you can recommend or advise on pharmacological interventions that's fine but if not discussing it all tobacco educators should still be able to discuss it and then urge their clients to see an appropriate health professional that can recommend or advise so the only recommender advise if it's within the scope of practice of being a pharmacist or a nurse but not as a tobacco educator the credential doesn't award any additional scope of practice to do recommending or advising on or prescribing pharmacological interventions and then we evaluate alternative and complementary approaches and treatments for tobacco cessation so it does examine the evidence on it and and we do a lot of work on the course on what do you do if your client wants to use alternative and complementary approaches but we look at the evidence everything that we do is evidence-based so all all recommendations anything we would examine always has the references related to it and then client centered approach we have to call this diverse characteristics but we've we've called this a doc approach to client characters and these are just Valle noble high risk and diverse populations and and then we also look at the interaction between tobacco use and other chronic diseases and how to adopt treatment and therapies for clients with other chronic diseases and then our final section is tobacco programs and systems and big section really came out of that we had a lot of people who said you know although I took you know this great tobacco cessation program and then I went back to my family health team or my communicating and I didn't really do anything and I never really did any cessation so we have teaching our educators on how they as individual clinicians do have the ability to impact system change so they can go back to their organizations and speak to their management and start having some real skills and knowledge how to cost effectively implement a formal tobacco cessation program into existing practice and and not set that's a competency that I'm pretty excited about advocating for an organizational tobacco cessation system because we know and especially with our first group of certified tobacco educators that these health professionals are pioneers and champions and they an individual clinician can really impact their the broader system in which they're working so also there Julian see if there's any other questions hi there we don't have any questions from participants right now where I've actually just asked a question to participate asking whether the approach that you're describing is similar or different to how they work now but a question that I have for you is for people who have been trained in cessation counseling but not recently what are some of the new and emerging issues to be aware of that's a great question Julie so first of all the whole electronic cigarettes electronic delivery systems is huge and if you had your training five years ago you wouldn't you know we certainly wouldn't have talked about that at all how we're approaching that is if anyone goes to any tobacco control conferences know this is really controversial not everyone within within tobacco control agrees is we will continue to follow the evidence in and whether we're recommending or not recommending it as a cessation tool so it's fluid and we'll adopt and not the great thing about a certification credential is with the continuing education element were able to keep people up to date and then and then also you know all of the new integrating all of that education and behavior change what we've had a lot of people who took the training say to me oh I was kind of doing that but I never really understood why I was doing that that it's if it's much more comprehensive certainly using smart health goals people that got something new that's really also resonating with people that they're finding it works really well with their clients to to frame that so so those would be sort of off the top also there there is and I and I will say this about Association a lot of folks are really familiar with the transtheoretical stages of change unfortunately that which is like that people go through stages of change to make behavior pre contemplation contemplation and you'll see that a lot of smoking cessation materials are framed in you know for smokers are ready to quit versus smokers who are not yet ready and we've really taken a look at that evidence and by putting a disease management framework to it that that that really became a reason why healthcare professionals were treating tobacco use as a disease by saying oh well this client is pre contemplative so there's nothing I can do we think that there's lots that you can do and we're giving you all kinds of tools and skills that you can still have impact with clients who you might have formerly classified as being pre contemplative and not for its really looking at the evidence of what works what doesn't work great Thank You Cheryl I have two questions that just came in one I think you might cover in your next session but I'll ask it is from Gail Hollis trained healthcare professionals what is available for ongoing support in terms of the training courses julia is that the questions it just says trained healthcare professionals so perhaps if you're already trained what's available for ongoing support right so so and you can go to our website after and I'll talk to the training programs that are available now but if someone has already taken comprehensive tobacco training and and education that would cover the foundational health education confidences they go right to challenging the exam so they don't have to take a course if they already have taken a program so if you've already taken teach or track in Alberta or the Mayo Clinic program then no you don't have to retake a tobacco course thank you and Gail a letter self that answered your question if not just send me a note here on webex the other question comes from Jimmy joy how does this program compared with other chronic disease management credentials such as the certified diabetes educator great question and so I mean we're really quite familiar with certified diabetes educator credential because it's sort of a sister organization to what we do so obviously that credential focuses on diabetes I will say that our credential has a much more comprehensive and robust education competencies than the diabetes educator credential and you can look at their competence to see that we have really expanded and made it much larger that's just a figure part of our credential is the health education competencies they have a different pathways to becoming a credential in that they don't have a requirement that you must take courses the way we do there you have a certain amount of hours where your have to be teaching working at the diabetes educator reports council exams well in our case you we have accredited courses that you must take as part of the assessment process because percent elevated thank you we do basic tobacco educator credentials on clinical guidelines and then I'll just speak to the curriculum and this is probably what people are interested in but we have created a national collaborative and these are our trading partners so all of these organizations will are delivering the course or we'll be adding the tobacco training in and in the near future and links to all of these programs are on our website the training program has been designed as 2 2day courses that's the program that we've designed so two days four foundational health education two days for tobacco we also have created pre-course comprehensive workbooks for both foundational health education and tobacco education and they again show best education principles for adults so they're full of activities reflections quizzes key terminology and a practical application of education strategies the training program that we have designed is so how it's how it's designed as people will review the workbooks ahead of time do the reflections through the activities do the quizzes and then come to the workshop and the workshops are designed to apply the skills very little lecture very little deductive content you'll be engaged in activities case studies peer teaching role plays games because that's how learning actually takes place by by working these are the two participant workbooks foundational health education and I've just got a couple of slides to show you what they look like so you'll see we have reflections throughout that where you can apply the concept to your own practice and they're what so what and now what reflections here on the right side you'll see that there's some activities we do have answers to the activities and there's a couple of pages from the tobacco workbook and here's an example of a quiz and an activity and then so at the end of every unit there will be a quiz the key terminology in the activity answers and here's here's a unit review with the key concepts and key terms on the left there and then you'll so should see that we have answers to the activities that are found in the work workbook and now the workshops as I said you're going to apply the knowledge you learn from completing the pre-course workbooks they're participatory because we know you learn from doing and not watching I'm just going to show you here is a sample activity that occurred that the workshop here's one on responding to change talk and in this case they work in in pairs we always have spotlight and instruction so you'll see the little yellow posted at the top so we you'll learn about instructional methods by the way the workshop has been designed and then and that goes back to debriefing and then we always show you where in the workbook the activity relates to because the workbook should be are used through it here's a one of our key teachings and the courses about health goals and learning objectives so here's the activity that we've done here and we explain what a learning objective is and how to set them and here we describe what a smart health goal is and then we do an activity so here's the activity right a smart health goal for something you would like to achieve everyone takes a few minutes they write their own health goal and then we debrief on the health goal and then here's an example of someone having a helpful I would like to take my dog for 20 minute walk three times a week and then we would have a group discussion about whether that smart goal is it specific is it measurable is it achievable is it relevant in is it time based and there are elements missing from that goal and then here we look at how to make that goal better to make it more specific starting this Monday it will walk my dog for 20 minutes every day because it will help me have more energy and because we've added to our smart health goals because we found that by having people right that because statement it really helps to bring the relevance of the of the health goal so for someone wanting to quit on Monday I will quit by using NRT because I care about my grandchildren want to be here for them so really just start to be able to have those conversations about the relevance is important and then again further activities on practicing writing health goals and learning objectives and we always have a client case that we work with and so that's an example of an activity that occurs in the course you can see how that's very different from sitting a room listening to someone lecture as you're all listening to me talk for so much and then and then we would follow up that activity by having a conversation about and the higher learning about what happens when your goals are different so the client here wants to walk up stairs without coughing doesn't want to take any more pills once to spend as little time as possible talking to a healthcare professional and inter interested in reducing but not quitting smoking or the educator wants the client to smoke by using karma combination pharmacotherapy and intensive Cal accounting counseling and then we work on having a discussion about what to do when your goals different for you from your clients so that's so that's an example of how the course is designed we always finish each section of the course each element with what do we what do we learn so rule recap what they've learned there and then the assessment and I'll talk briefly about the assessment because I've mentioned it earlier during the course there's a standardized case based assess assignment and we must achieve seventy percent to pass that all of the program providers will be using the same case based assignment and we really work with the participants and it's not oh you failed that's it we really go back and forth if there's a key concept like they didn't understand health goals learning objectives then we'd ask the participant to resubmit that section and the trainers will work with them to really make sure that they understand the key concepts so that they'll be doing great cessation and that they'll be able to be successful on the exam the exam itself is between 145 160 multiple-choice questions it's three and a half hours at computer-based exam centers that are proctored throughout the country we have tremendous flexibility to be able to add exam centers anywhere where there is a secure internet connection and appropriate room and doctor we are able to add exam centers our standard is that we like people to not have to drive more than an hour to attend the exam the cost is 450 350 if you already hold another C NRC credential and the persons are combination of knowledge based application and critical thinking questions both independent and k space we work very closely with psychometrician stood developed our examinations so they are defensible and each item will have one two three references as well as what the rationale for the correct answer is and then recertification every five years there are two options to be certified that people can show a combination of 500 teaching and learning hours or they can retake the exam we're taking exam has a little higher cost because we pay an exam company for that we recognize learning takes place in lots of different ways so we don't have formal approved ceus we really educators submit their recertification application they list their this is what these are my teaching and learning ten percent or randomly audited and what that would mean is if you were audited it would be up to you to explain why that teaching or learning activity is relevant to your continuing education as a certified tobacco educator so we think we have one of the most flexible recertification processes of any of the process of the any of the Health Professions continuing education crc also provides that we do webinars we do a fantastic conference every two years we do nua newsletters and we have a really robust online community at timed writes is one of our private sector partners so there's a community for tobacco educators people can ask questions share resources we get you know if we see new evidence will share it in that community and and people can you know we see connections from across the country we're working on putting together a group program does anyone have any resources and some from the other side of the country could go great I'll share and they need connections and share with resources it works really well this is what our online community looks like and then I'll just show you here is a typical conversation so that it was a new study on e cigs so someone posted a question like showing a new study that was out so I'm not really sure about the study can't find the actual data but it was released today and then somebody responds with more information about it that would be a typical conversation that occurred and I did receive permission from both of those people to share their conversation on the slide today and then outcomes of the program we have just completed our performance a preliminary performance measurement from the first group of certified tobacco educators of 135 questions that were asked has the tobacco educator training including the course and preparing for the CT exam change your tobacco cessation in practice 87.7 percent said yes and the 12.2 percent it didn't said they were not providing cessations didn't work with clients which is why they said no there or felt they were already working to best practice and use the examination to confirm that and then this is the one we're really proud of it said if yes do you feel that this has allowed you to help more of your clients quit or attempt to quit and a hundred percent of those people said yes and if yes to feel this has allowed you to help more of your clients be more successful in their clubs quit quit for longer periods and ninety-two percent said yes so we're seeing some fantastic preliminary data very early in the process and will continue to measure that more one of the issues that we do know is over sixty percent of our educators also responded that they do not have a formal follow-up in place to actually measure whether they actually go back and measure you know six months later you letter have their clients still quit so that's certainly something we'll be working with our tobacco educators to see what we can do to address that problem so so that's it in an alternate Julie talk to you for any more questions we've got a good question here from Jimmy joy he says more chronic diseases are included such as allergy sleep apnea etc is there a plan to have a comprehensive credential that encompasses all respiratory chronic diseases yeah so we certainly you know certainly have had conversations at our certification management committee level about you know is is there a certified chronic disease educator and and I don't I don't have the answer to that I'll tell you if it makes people afraid to have you know oh my god I have to know about all of that so so we would we would have to do a lot more work to see whether that's something that health professionals are interested in we we think that makes sense and you'll see that in our foundational health education why you're seeing with more comprehensive because we have you know so many of the chronic diseases are related to those same factors and Julie you explain that with your public health agency funding priorities the lack of physical activity unhealthy eating and tobacco cessation sold sorry in tobacco use those are common factors that contribute to the development of multiple diseases so so working holistically with your client to deal with you're going to cover a lot of the chronic diseases by creating collaborating with the client to motivate them to take control of their own health because that's ultimately all our educators are doing is to is to try to that their partners with their client is client centered care that that they collaborate with the part with the client for them to be motivated to take control of their own health thanks Cheryl I think what Jimmy was asking as well as is a certified comprehensive respiratory educator so rather than all chronic diseases is there a comprehensive respiratory educator credential right so we're still at the needs assessment phase because we've been for the certified russ berrie educator on what to do with other lung diseases so I don't have an answer to that yet we'll certainly we're not sure at this point whether whether we would add some specialty you know sort of credential on or whether we would integrate that into the existing certified respiratory educator credential which now is just asthma and copd we're going to we're going to continue to figure out how we're going to do that in the future I just don't know just yet because we haven't we haven't got an answer well I think Jimmy's question says that people are interested in it we have another question sorry I've got to hear okay this one is from bridget is the curriculum developed to adapt to different age groups young adults women and have you seen a need for this to run to run no I think it's to counsel oh yeah yeah so if you saw in the client characteristics one so we we initially I think we called that diverse populations but you'll see that that competency and I'm just like what do we call it the deploy it says adapt approach to client characteristic so we have to spend a lot of time doing that vulnerable high-risk Aboriginal indigenous clients from drivers language so we have women who are pregnant or breastfeeding youth children adolescents and young adults older adults so it's a wide range of client characteristics oh so you're taught how to adapt your practice to those different groups thanks for sheep that's a good question and thanks for response Cheryl and here's a question I think you had addressed earlier on Susan Haskell is asking how many crs are there in Newfoundland and Labrador yeah I could I can I can provide the breakdown by province and credential yeah I think that's a good idea sound like people are looking to understand who is working in their province and has been through this credentialing process you have two questions here one about what is involved in setting up a training program in a particular region okay so we have an accreditation process for training program so if you're because i'm not sure if you're interested in being a training provider then contact me and we can talk about that if you wanted to have training in your community see NRC has been working with a different training partner so what will come in and do train the trainer sessions the models designed that we've created the training program and then we basically gifted it to our training organization partners so that it's it's sustainable so for example we're working with folks in British Columbia Nell Vancouver Coastal Health we went out there we trained we ran a training session and and they developed trainer so that in the future they don't have to fly people out to do it they'll have their own folks that will be able to deliver the course in British Columbia we're just we're going to be doing one in interior health we were doing a similar one the first week in February in Manitoba so will certainly work with you if that's what you're interested in and there may be an existing training provider that already offers courses in your community so I would suggest if you're interested in that just contact me directly and we can talk about what your needs are our goal is that there are people have access to in-person workshops right across the country so I a similar question Cheryl are there any exam centers established in the Northwest Territory specifically we're wondering about Yellowknife yes yes we run exams me lo nice all the time okay awesome great so it's better I don't see any other questions that came in by email or or otherwise I don't know if maybe Cheryl and Julie if you want have anything else to say or any kind of takeaways or last thoughts that you would like to share I just wanted to ask for the help of people who are on this caller who work in this area in spreading the word about this program really a program like this can only be successful when we have people doing the exam and studying the competencies and going through the process so that we can bring a level of consistency to how people are counseled to quit smoking we feel like that's an important federal role that we can play so I do I want to ask for the participants on the phone to help with spreading the word about this program yes in if you have if any of you are working in organizations where we have the opportunity to promote it please contact me my email is up there as is our website and if you're interested in becoming certified feel free to call us on our website there are links to all of the training programs that are offering that the tobacco programming and they're there you'll have an opportunity to devote to do in-person workshops across the country and there's also an online program by one of our private sector partners pair healthcare so for those that aren't able to take the time off or live in places where you aren't able to come to a course you can do it entirely on online and you'll still get a lot of direct feedback and interaction with the trainers in that program thanks very much so I guess well we'll start to close down the session today I definitely learned a lot the training certification for tobacco prevention and cessation and really how to move ahead to reach tobacco users so this has been great I hope as well to all our participants have have learned a lot and I've enjoyed this session I want to thank our presenter Cheryl Connors for sharing your work and your knowledge with us all and as well for the ongoing work that you're doing at the Canadian network for a concurrent care also thanks to julie greane you've done a fabulous job moderating the participant questions and thanks to the public health agency for being a co-host on the webinar with us okay yeah a special thanks to all of you in the audience as well really appreciate your attention to interest your great question and we're so glad you could join us want to mention we're going to continue with our webinar series with the public health agency so keep keep an eye on your inbox to watch for upcoming events and where we hope you'll join us for our future events and with that I just like to thank everyone and hope
