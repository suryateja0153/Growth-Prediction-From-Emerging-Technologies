 good afternoon everybody and I'm delighted to welcome everyone here today's webinar on overcoming barriers to international trade and introduction to export controls and export licenses this is the first of a four-part series we're hosting with beef export controls organization on the topics of export controls and an over-the-top it's advertised my name is William Barnes Graham and I MP digital content manager at exports we are a government supported online community helping small UK businesses get ready to sell overseas we do this through our step-by-step guides in articles our regular webinar program are the experts forum and are relatively new exploitation plan tool you can ask questions at any point during the webinar using for question box on the right hand side of the control panel you'll get as many ways as you can at the end and any of the questions we don't get to session today we will be posting to our osteitis forum and we assigning them to your users give you edited with us in the week will say following the webinar this should allow you to get on stand straight to your email inbox within a few days we don't typically share the slides in a presentation but we will be recording today's session and then your copy of it within the next few days and also running it to our website so please have a look on the site for for the recording so leading the presentation today we have Claire howson and Trevor word from the export controls organization Claire is head of business awareness ivca delivering training courses across the UK force for UK business is working closely with you Katie I your Android associations Trevor it's also similar experience has been working in 25 years live export controls in this former head of a licensing group obvious or control organization he wants a workshops on how to use checking tools and after you spy as well so deftly to very expert speakers covering what is actually a very important topic for first-time exporters to to really look into and make sure they they know about and make sure they put it in the right way because otherwise you can get some hassle later one as you actually come to nitty-gritty of exporting the product so hopefully this webinar and as well have in our series would be very Lisa for you and without further d I'm delighted to hand over to care and trouble hello it's very much that introduction we must record it's very helpful and hi everyone with this is the first time I've done one of these webinar production so I'm hoping every people go well and what we're hoping to do this afternoon is to give you a very good high level overview of what export controls is all about the first to say on the first slide please William and I'm put it opening up an overview here of few items of export and fair to say that exports leave the UK every single day of the year in 2014 the value of the total of UK exports was something in the region of 500 and Vili 515 billion pounds only 15 billion of that was subject to export control so it's fair to say there's only about three percent of exports that actually do require export lies that's coverage however what we're going to do today is to take you through what types of items and what types of exports actually do require a license and give you some really good practical advice as to how to update obtain those licenses and to find out whether you need a license in the first place on top of those defense and security exports we've got something caught you'll use exports and you'll use items some of you may have heard this term some may not so today Trevor and I going to explain full detail what your use exports are okay next slide William please this is this is my first introduction for you to the website of Export Control it's on the Gulf a platform we've got about 50 pages and export control that you can use to help yourselves to understand more about the subject this page is all about customs Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is responsible for enforcing export control legislation and one thing you must bear in mind that if export control procedure is not followed your shipments can be detained for inspection by UK border force this particular container in the slide I'm showing you here is being detained for search and if required customs will refer to the export control organization to see whether a license is required what we don't want to happen is that this happens to it is that this happens to your exports what will happen obviously is your goods will be delayed while they are being and inspected at the port and if there are if the goods are detained you could also be liable to some sort of customers charge next slide william and we'll have a look here at other types of enforcement for HMRC are put into place this is dependent on whether it's a first time breach of export control or repeated breaches of export control but HMRC and the Crown Prosecution Service have got the powers to enforce the export control legislation some of these are quite serious some of them start with penalties financial penalties based on the value of the goods that are in the actual shipment which could be quite high and serious cases of breach of export and control can result in high fines and in some cases prison sentences suffice to say we don't want this to happen to you so let's take you through how you know whether or not you need to have an export license next slide please William I've already showed you what the govern light looks like this is another page on the gov you k website it is where you can start to find out whether you whether you need to have an export license or not and export controls something that you should build in to your export markets and your export marketing strategy right at the very beginning when you're thinking about what what markets you should be trading with whether or not you need an agent to get your goods into those markets and determining how you're going to get paid you also need to be thinking about an export license and because you have to apply for those you should ensure you've got plenty of time to get the license and please don't leave it to the last minute one of the things I always say to the exporters that I deal with is make sure that when you're actually negotiating delivery times you have in mind the question of whether you need to have an export license please don't promise an unsustainable delivery date if you haven't got your license in place next slide please William so how do you know whether or not you need that license in the first place it's all based on a series of something called X or controls and what we're looking at here is a series of elements it's a question of the items that you're actually going to be exporting you need to know whether any of the goods all the your items or the software are on a control list Trevor will be taking you through that in some D you tell in a minute also need to bear in mind where your export is going to be going to there are several countries in the world which are subject to sanction an embargo if you're exporting to a country that subject dysfunction you'll need to know how to trade with that country another thing you need to bear in mind is who's going to be using your goods who the end user is have you checked to see whether your end user is on a designated party list if they're on a designated party list there will be issues about whether you can export to them and finally you also need to have a think about the actual intended use of the export though maybe concerns about where the goods are going to be going to who using them they may be may be ending up in a terrorist cell and they may be concerns about such things as weapons of mass destruction next slide please William I work for the export control organization and the export control organization is part of the Department of for business innovation skills we're based in one Victoria Street in London and we are the UK statutory authority for military export licensing if you need to get an export license you can only get a license from control organization under the EU dual-use good regulation 428 of 2009 the export control organization is also the competent licensing authority for sure dual-use exports and we will have a look at what those dual use goods are in a minute when you get your license from us all licenses will be issued in the name of the big secretary of state we're now going to have a look at some of the controls that you will need to be considering next slide please William okay thank you clear we're going to look now at the control lists and the starting point if you need to know with your goods leading export license is to look at the strategic export control lists and you can stay on the screen PDF document you can download from the Export Control organizational website and that contain all the goods that are subject to export control the lists are updated at least twice a year and you can see from the slide the current version was updated in December 2015 the list contains several different types of goose we have military goods we have jewel newsgroups the clear has already spoken about and will be going into that and then slide there are also some controls on what are called torture goods things that could be used for human rights abuses and some radioactive sources that are subject to control you can also see them this slide that there are almost 300 pages on the electable control lists so sometimes it can be a little difficult to navigate your way through but in essence the message is if your goods are listed somewhere on the strategic export control lists then you will need a license for them to send them two most most parts of the world next slide please will you so let's have a look at the types of goods that are subject to control the easier to understand our military coups so I've shown a picture there of a battle tank that is going to be sucking to control it's a military item it's been originally designed for military use and will need a license for exec sport as well as items that have been originally designed for military use any item that has been modified for a minute reduce where we listed on the military list as well so we may have a commercial item the military has seen it I think this is really good we could use this if you could only change something in it like the frequency of operation or some of the physical characteristics if they define a change to that then their item has been modified for military use and would also be considered on the military dist the way the militarist operates is that if your main item is controlled then any specially designed part of that would also be controlled so while the tank controlled so will any other item perhaps in the driver's cockpit whatever it may be and however small it may be will also be controlled a dual use item is something that's been designed for commercial use but then can be used by commercial end users or by military end users hence to uses jewel youths that's why it's called curious now these tend to cover the highest technology items are the fastest the latest biggest whatever it may be but again it covers items that can be useful to the military or can be used in weapons of mass destruction applications and that's why we have items on the list we can find that a dual-use item of this type can even have higher technology content than the equivalent military items and that's why they are subject to export control also all of the dual-use items in the Julius list is written with technical specifications and so you will be having to compare the specifications of your groups against the list to determine whether your items are actually starting to control and this means that only about 1% of dual-use items I'm out of them all of them are available will be subject to control next slide please when him so then we see the military list we won't drill on this too long but there are 22 categories in ml 10 ml 22 the first 20 cover actual good central items so air tank that we just saw would be controlled on the ml 6 as a vehicle there are some other larger categories there FML 19 covers all military vessels and any specially designed component ml 10 covers any military aircraft and specially designed component and you may even just be providing something that's going to be turned into a military items such as a 4G or a casting if it's already been designed to become part of a military item even if it isn't in its final form that could still be subject to export control and then in mm 21 any software that relates to those military items is controlled and equally ml 22 any technology the relates that those items would also be controlled next life Israel but let's have a look at some of these dual use goods now the Julius list is split into 10 categories and I've got some examples here from each of the categories now some are quite specialist for some will be more likely to relate to some of the businesses that you think you're involved in start Academy of 0 this is nuclear and it is quite special it's things that are specially designed really for a nuclear reactor and we see a fuel rod their calorie one covers special materials I've shown there some aluminium tubes now not all aluminium tubes are controlled is only those that operate a certain strength and can be can operate at a certain speed turned speed which is why they need their strength so you if you had some of these you would have to look at the specification and then go and look at the control list and compare them against the parameters on the control list and obviously if you met or exceeded those parameters that's when you would need an export license category 2 is materials processing this is looking at machines that can process normally metals but other materials to to form another component and the most accurate machine tools are subject to control and this is because they can be used for making parts for religious systems or parts for weapons of mass destruction systems for category 3 which is electronic time china map pro processor if that operates a certain temperature ranges then that will be controlled and other integrated circuits were subject to control as well category four covers computers these days it tends to be very high-performance computers gone are the days when obvious laptops will be controlled but if you've got a very high-performance computer or a parallel computer then that may be subject to control you may need to look on the control list category 5 is split into two parts the first part lots of telecommunications and equipment that can be used there I'm showing some optical fibers now so again it's not every optical fiber the types that are used in standard transmission systems you won't be controlled but those are the very high strength and could be useful in military systems are on the control list next slide please fill in and then in the second half of category 5 could reply part 2 we have encryption systems and this can cover lots of equipment that contains encryption we have computer service Reuters and some other basic equipment if he has encryption you will probably need to look at the encryption controls in category 5 part 2 kateri six covers sensors and lasers and one of the things that covers our infrared cameras on night vision cameras again this is quite a key military technology and so there are parameters on commercial systems that might meet those levels and they will be subject to export control category 7 covers navigation and avionics and that is basically accelerometers gyroscopes that we're showing there or an inertial navigation system that can help to guide an aircraft or other type of vehicle category 8 covers marine and it's mainly submarine equipment in the picture there is a submersible vehicle that will be used for undersea exploration could be used in the oil and gas industry but equally could be used by the military and the accessories for it so we succeed some manipulator arms on the ER submersible you have there and then finally category 9 is the aerospace and propulsion so that will cover aero engines guest turbine engines covers rocket motors and other things associated with propulsion now all those items that I've shown they're all controlled by the parameters of the equipment and typically there are quite a high level they have to be useful in some military or weapons of mass destruction application and so you will need to look at the specifications of your items and compare them to the relevant entries on the control lists next slide click on it in addition to the goods software and technology is also controlled and as a rule of thumb you could say that if the goods are controlled any software or any technology related to those groups would also be controlled and we're controlling here both tangible software and technology any documents you might same through the post or software you might send on a disk or on a stick as well as intangible suffering technology and that's how most of it is transferred these days through the internet or through emails etc so again any software technology relating to licensable which would also be licensable next slide please rahenge so here's a few examples question which of these do you think might need an export license so I've got a computer server the first item a laser second item an industrial pump an integrated circuit and we've got a commercial land rover fitted with the military gear box and the last one a motor controller using a frequency changer you may have some ideas from your business as to which things you might think of control in which things won't be controlled in fact all of those items could be controlled it depends on their specifications it depends on what they can do but you would need to compare them against the control list that I showed you earlier and see if they're listed on any of those 294 pages next slide basically and this is really one of the issues of having you'd find your items or you have the PDF fist you can search but there is another tool that you can download from the Export Control organization website which is something called the goods checker and this uses the same control lists but gives it to you in a form where your concern choosing keywords or stringing words together to try and find the item in the list and it will perform that search and will return any results that relate to the words that you've entered to try and narrow down and find the actual entry that relates to your goods we will be having another webinar where we go into a bit more detail about searching and i'll be showing you how you can use this tool it also incorporates something called the Ojo checker the open general export license checker and that's the type of export license clear is going to be talking about there's a little bit more detail in the next few slides so thinking back to you there it's likely again what we want to look at now is how you can plan ahead and determine whether or not those licenses are required I mentioned earlier something about functions functions are imposed on for a variety of reasons the collection is put into place but it can often mean is there is a trade restriction with that particular country but please bear in mind that as well as trade restrictions for sanctions also do cover such things as moving money around that's unnatural sanctions it can also cover and something called an arms embargo and various other forms of trade and restrictions if any of you don't know what an arms embargo is I thought I just give you a bit of a hint in the tip here and we have a on the military list that Trevor was talking about we call that the youth that's the UK military list and fundamentally any item which is included on that UK military list would be something that this subject to an arms embargo so fundamentally anything on the military list can't be exported to a particular destination as its subject to arms embargo there are other issues which do affect such as a loon and trade restrictions there are a number of countries around the world for which the UK the EU don't necessarily agree on the way some of the human rights abuses are affect people in that particular country and we have a human rights register if countries are a human rights register there will become some concerns about what types of equipment is actually going to be exported to that particular country so first and foremost I think the the issue here is to actually find out whether any of these these areas a court by to your particular intended export what countries do you want to export to and if they are subject to sanctions and embargoes or something like that you're going to need to apply for an export license next slide please William we have a little bit of help help is at hand again using the WK website we've got about 20 or pages which lists all of the countries and their relevant sanctions and involve owners this is a listing of what all of those different types of sanctions could possibly be and it will tell you which of that which licenses you will then need to apply for so please when you're looking for details about where those sanction destinations are have a look Oh got UK sometimes you might find with WK it's quite a difficult site to navigate around and a little bit of a tip from me is to go into your favorite search engine I know which mine is I don't know what yours is and and just put your preferred search term into that search engine put those UK on the end of it and you'll come up with the page that you're looking for and it's as simple as that ok William next slide please we've mentioned a couple of times during the course of the webinar about this thing called weapons of mass destruction it can sound like quite a scary thing and in in lots of cases WMD is a scary thing but to put it into a little bit of context what is a what is a weapon of mass destruction it's basically ballistic missiles and the launch systems for a ballistic missiles so it's all the equipment that goes into all of that and it's all of the things which are counted as anything that can be can make a chemical weapon a biological weapon or anything of a radiological or nuclear nature there are obviously some regimes around the world that have got nuclear programs some of those programs are not civil programs but they are and non civil nuclear programs and all of those things together are counted as what we call weapons of mass destruction now clearly if you're exporting to different countries or different parts of the world you're not necessarily to know that your items are and going to be for WMD end use and they won't necessarily tell you that when they're targeting you to actually supply them with items so what you can do if you've got suspicions about the end use of your equipment you can apply to the Export Control organization for our angels advise service and we will tell you whether or not you need to apply for a license other ways of finding out about WMD and juice is if we actually approach you directly because of information we've had about your specific end user and but certainly please do take the time to have a look at the pages that we've got on WMD next slide please William because what I want to do now is to really have a look at if you have got a requirement for a license you've worked that out it works out you've got an item that's on a control list you're exporting to a country that is in sanction and you want to know what do I have to do next there are a number of licenses that you will need to apply for in order to move your goods your software or your technology if any of those things applying to you and these are the main types of licenses that you can apply for open general licenses standard individual or an individual i'm going to start this off by telling you a little bit about the standard individual licenses these are by far the most popular types of licenses that companies will apply for last year we had something in the region of our thousand applications for licensee sorry about that I just had a bit of a brain freeze there we had about 15 and a half thousand applications for these types of standard licenses the licenses and are fairly flexible for you they are valid for a period of up to two years and they are specific to your particular export so if you have a range of goods that you're exporting to one particular end-user in a country you can have up to a hundred items on your xbox license and you will simply list those items that need to be lights licensed on there please remember that the licenses have to be supported with a number of different types of documentation and one of the most important types of documentation that you are only required to supply is something called an end user undertaking which fundamentally is a certificate from your actual end user to verify that the items will be used for the purposes which you're sending them over will not be used for any weapons of mass destruction purposes and will not be reacts ported and for any of those particular uses all to a country that's in sanction or embargo the open individual licenses are similar types of licenses to the standard they give you a bit more flexibility you can apply for a number of countries to be added to those licenses and they're valid for a period of up to five years so they are actually very very flexible types of licenses that you can apply for next slide please William X like that we're actually going to be talking about we'll give you another shot of the got UK website it's going to show you the site where we've got open general licenses and we list all of the licenses that we have that you can register for on open general licenses to give you an overview of what they are they are a predetermined license so they're not bespoke to your particular export they are predetermined license they operate on the basis of permitted groups so there will be a listing of control list entries under which if your item Falls you may be able to use that license you will also need to check that the country to which you want to export to is either a permitted destination or is not listed as a non permitted destination you need to check all of that out before you can decide whether you can use that license fundamentally you need to check that your own items are actually as permitted goods now if you want to use these licenses what it actually means is that you haven't got a an export license to show to to customs so you'll need to annotate on your single administration document that you're using these open general licenses to export your items it's a registration that's made on our spire system as via electronic licensing system and once you're registered for them you can continue to use them on my leg slide if I've actually got a picture of what an export license looks like one of these open general export license there's it's a my advice to you on using those licenses would be to say please download the license that you want to use and read the terms of that actual license you'll find that the licenses will cover different types of activity so for instance if you'll check if you're sending your items out to an exhibition you may be able to use these licenses if you want to amend some items for goods that you've already and exported and you want to react sport the items after you've mended them there will be a particular license that you can use for those who the range of licenses that you can actually use for the open licenses the benefit of registering for these licenses is that you will get a regular visit from our compliance officers so you can have a chat to them about how you using those license there's and the other types of licenses and they'll check that you're using them in the right way if you're not the compliance officer will advise you of where you've actually made a mistake and they'll send details after the visit of your non-compliance and will advise you what you have to do and to become compliant if you've made a very serious error on the use of those licenses they will advise issue how to who and how to make a voluntary declaration to customs if we can go on to the next slide the next slide is a screenshot of applying on spire and inspire is the portal through which all license applications are actually made and where you actually register for open licenses my main tips on this the use of spire are that you should always complete the screen that says manage my registration because by then you can get all details of your company downloaded into spire all at the same time and then spy will automatically use that information to populate your licenses as you make your license applications you should also allocate one or two main contacts to use and who will be making the license application so that you can keep a track of what license applications are in this system and whether you've got any follow-up inquiries and if you're if you know that that one person is going to be out of the office for a while to move this spy responsibility to somebody else some of you may have heard that we are looking at the moment at and another another addition to spire and that this isn't coming online for the next few weeks for you a few months and so will be available in 2017 if you need training inspire and we actually go we are actually going to be doing a webinar it later in this series on how to use fire just to let you know the next slide is actually a screenshot of our training that we've got on YouTube you where we've actually got some elearning on youtube on how to use licenses open licenses and and you're very welcome to access that information and finally the slide that I got a bottom a noble is one that's called help and advice and this is actually quite valuable because I recognize that Trevor and I have gone through quite a lot of information and this afternoon fairly quickly and we've covered a lot of things and what I would like to do is point you in the direction of the got UK pages and you can access all of them using your search engine we've got a page on export control itself export control organization and you can actually get access to all of the different guides that we've got on the gov website we also have a subscription service called lotuses to exporters these are notices that we publish on and and and not regular base you probably get about 40 a year so you're not going to be down with you're not going to be I'm overloaded with them but they're quite useful tools because they'll give you information about any changes that are being made to the control list whether there are new open licenses that have been put into the system and will keep you updated on the legislation and element of Export Control it's a free subscription service and we also run quite a few training courses and these are generally classroom-based and we run them in London and in the regions so if any of you want to apply for those we've got a training site on the Export Control got UK pages and the next thing we have which I think could be useful to you is statistics when you're doing your market research we've actually got a field of Export Control statistics so you can see the level of licenses that were on the number of licenses that we are issuing to particular countries and the types of control list entries which are being sold to those particular countries anyway I think I think I've completed all of that now in terms of the help and advice that we can give that's that I'm sure that we can now throw it open to question right we've had a question form Peter sat well and he's asking is the end user advisory service now rang and running on spire again yes the end user fire service is up and running on spire you can use that at any time the service that we heard that we had to take down was actually called the UM the classification service and we can't run that at the moment the end user advice service is definitely available so when you go on to spire go into the portal that says other services other than export licensing and just register for the ngos advice service will discuss true for some basic information on the end user that you want to check out and with some details and then we'll get back to your inspire pinky or very comprehensive right I've got another question from a hub in double girl it's asking um what if we are exporters of Julia's goods that do not originate in the UK and are shipped from another country do we need easy approval um I've got two answers really to that question the first one if goods in the UK that would come from another country it doesn't actually matter where they have come from if you're exporting them from the UK you need to make sure you are fully compliant with UK export rules and if they're on the Jewish list then you will need to decide where they're going as to whether you would need a license on under the EU or easy to use and items regulation for most Jewish items you do not need a license for transfer within Europe within the European Union but you will need a license if they go outside the other possibility in your question is if you are what's called brokering Julius items that would mean they're coming from one third country and going to another third country the controls on that would only apply if they are destined for weapons of mass destruction induce but apart from that there and the doing use items regulation doesn't take up any other powers on broken number type I hope the answer the question thank you very much right I'll try go through these ins and the order with people I got them through Michael Rican asks with regard to software or technology exports does use of remote servers based overseas account as an export well that's a complex issue that's being discussed right now it would depend on who has access to that information when it goes on to the server that is abroad if the information that on a server is protected and it has not been downloaded to anyone other than administrators who are based in the UK then it probably would not be seen as an export but in all other cases it will be seen as an export I think really what best practices at the moment here's the companies who have any control software other technology are tending to keep it on servers that are based inside the UK just to be certain but I say it's narrower that is currently being discussed as far as export controls are concerned it's something that is moving obviously with cloud computing coming on board more and more it's something that is being discussed in determination to be making it so this as a rule of thumb that's it but if anyone from abroad can get access the information on server then it's generally seen as an export of that point we did actually run the trading ports on something like this last year and we ran it with CSG we are anticipating running a training course again this year and it will cover the issues of cloud computing and we'll have a couple of our regime and experts that will be coming to talk about it I can keep you informed of when the trading course will take place and will also be issuing it in our training bulletin right we've got another question from Peter can afford he's asking why having obtained a license to export a product which money speaking country why didn't then necessary to obtain a new license for a second english-speaking country possibly with the same customer and for the same application so your license has been obtained for one particular country yep and one particular end user and the question just a clap by that you've got another customer in the same country asli the same cast but it but in a different country possibly the same customer but in a different country well that the license will be valid for an export to a particular end-user in a specific destination so if the goods are going to be going to two countries you will actually need to have two different licenses yeah I mean I think the point here is if you have that situation so you would plan to stand an individual license for your groups so that one customer in a country that's fine if you then want to export the same goods but to a different country that's a different application and you would need to send in a completely new standard individual application the other type of license that Claire spoke about the open individual license is something that may be more suited to this circumstance where the license will allow you to send certain goods and it can be more than one item to certain destinations so you might give a license to send five items from your product range to 10 different countries and then once you have that license you don't need to refer back to the Export Control organization each time but you will need to keep records and they will be checked by a compliance officer periodically so it sounds as if you might find it available to try and find out if open individual items would be the right type of license for you if you're exporting in this way that's far sounds good all right just a bit to add to that because this is a very high level and webinar today what we haven't done is is gone into any of the criteria that these licenses are actually assessed against and and it's fair to say that each of the licenses that come in get assessed against the issues of whether there are any in national obligations that the UK would be reaching in issuing the licenses whether there's any human rights issues in the country of concern whether there's things for example like a risk of diversion moving the goods from a particular country to a different end user completely and there's a risk there about what they're going to be using it for and when those risks are at play that can all have an impact on whether license is issued so they are very much issued on the basis of whether of who's going to be using the group somewhere they're going to be going to but this was why I really wanted you to have a look first of all at the open general licenses and see whether or not any of those licenses were applicable to the markets to which you want to send your goods to bank it was really great oh right we've got Stewart farm who's asked quite specific question here but I think it's quite interesting he's asking if an item which was originally desing is ordered for a military application the specific specification change relating to changing color only with this I item subsequently be considered a military item requiring an export license yes that's an interesting question that comes up quite often actually and and it really depends what the change is you know as soon as a general rule if all you've done is changed and item and it was painted white and now it's painted green there's nothing special about the paint then it would still remain as a commercial item and I just take the view that think about what would happen if you export of the item and then your exported the paint was going to go go on it and not provide a license for then that would say the same however there are some caveats to that because in some instances if you change the color of an item it can change its functionality and so if you think of something like a um aircraft hit up display which may have a green sauce pot on it for one application if someone asks for that the B and amber or some other color that can change the operational characteristics so you know it's difficult to give a complete answer there are total a statistic will depend on the circumstances but in general just an ordinary change of a color painting something different if it has no material influence on how it's used probably wouldn't change it if it does change our operates then then it would be a modification two militaries and Mabel push the item into being a military item alright thank you very much might have a question I don't I'll read this one out to you as well it's with reference to human rights records what are the trade procedures to supply countries like Saudi Arabia for instance that are under no sanctions it have a massive human rights violation record yeah it's actually a very good question and it's got it's quite topical a Saudi Arabia moment and I'm going to bear in mind with a country like Saudi Arabia obviously is its geography whereabouts it's based who its neighbors are situation and it's got a free port in Saudi Arabia those are such as some of the things to bear on that in mind about Saudi and there are licenses which are being issued Saudi Arabia but all of the licenses that come into the export license system are actually assessed as i said before against the set of criteria and it's quite a robust set of criteria that they're all assessed against and one of those is whether or not there are only risks for those goods being used against against the human rights agenda we will look at every case on a case-by-case basis and so certainly for someone like Saudi Arabia that is an issue and the unlicensed will be assessed on that basis thank you very much on that very similar topic we're getting quite a few people asking about the Iran situation like nappy know that ironic appears to have come in from the cold recently and they're wondering you know what they can and can't do with regard to around okay um yeah again a very topical and very topical issue in it and I myself was in Cardiff last week actually talking to a group of big group of exporter's over there that had interesting around UK 2-yard a at the moment are working very closely with us and with the Foreign Office to have a look at the opportunities that are available in the Iran market I think it's fair to say with Iran what we've got here is a market that potentially has great opportunities companies and following the implementation date of the agreement on the on the sanctions the nuclear sanctions that was in January it's meant that there have been a number of sanctions which have been reduced and eliminated some of those sanctions are fundamentally related to things like the oil and gas sector and there because there was a whole load of sanctions put on Iran as result um the nuclear sanctions that related to oil and gas equipment and materials those sanctions have now been and relaxed and but there are still quite a few other sanctions that remain in place on Iran and that's something that we do need to bear in mind the there's an existing arms embargo and there's a number of other different sanctions these these things change all of the time and I think that what you should do if you're looking at trading with Iran is really keep up to date with what's in the gov WK pages we update those fairly regularly one of the one of the big things about trading in Iran and actually is the question of getting paid and to be to be brutally honest and the financial sector sanctions have moved on and but the banks themselves are cautious about the Iranian market and therefore and you would need to find ways I've actually been able to financial export and although n stand that UK export finance the oldc GD has actually raised its cover for Iran so these are all issues that if you're interested in that particular market I would say keep up to date with the latest things and have a look at the Iran page owk thanks very much having that answered norful of people's questions um got another question here from smart missoni and they're asking there are times when an item or kit does not fall into a list category but have components in them that may make them controlled how do you deal with you such things okay so i think i'm understanding that there is a kid apart for something and the you're exporting it really first point is that whenever you're considering something into the control list you first of all look at the item itself and so you don't always need to for a larger I to drop it down into its bit of material and then look at each and every partners on there to see if it requires an export license you're looking at what the overall item is where this sometimes causes a problem is where you may have a kid a pass there's exported at different times in different places in that case what the airport would appear to be is perhaps one part of that kit the visa licensable item if that's the case then generally you will probably need to make sure that you have actual cover for those those particular items because they will always be seen as a separate separate engineer separate export the other way of dealing with that is that you may be able to give an overall license to couple the whole of the kit the whole of the item as an overall item i give a license of that which case you could then export the several parts from different port or different times against that license as one of the one but part of the kit but it depends a lot on what that Kitty's wanted the overall function of it is and then comparing that against the list and then deciding whether you need a license for it whether you don't does that help yeah not sure I'll ask the question that's my own well hopefully that was the question you know somebody's NT right on something with off time for one more question before we wrap up Kathleen pellet asks is military training design know how manufacturing and so on included under the definition of Technology and controlled under the military goods list as well as the dual-use items list yes is the short answer to that any technology that will relate to the items themselves and that could be a technology is generally split into three it's in development is in production or is in use and they are terms that are defined in the export control list and so if you want to take any of those activities that relate to that then they will be controlled so I think you mentioned train in any sort of production advice would be controlled so as anything in which you're assisting someone to manufacture or to use that particular military item and that's where the technology book would be covered great thanks thanks very much fat one final what seth right we've just about run out of time um i just like to act will be putting all the unanswered questions on our ask the export section in our forums on open to export our next webinar will be on april the 12th at two
