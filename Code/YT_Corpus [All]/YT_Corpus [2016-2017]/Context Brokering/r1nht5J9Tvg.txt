 alright hello everyone I for those of you don't know me I've actually just joined the center as a visiting scholar and I'm really excited to be here today because of that to be able to share some of my research with you but I've also been pretty fascinated just to see what all of you guys have been up to so I just thank you for sharing your research with me without further ado I'm just going to jump right into it and I want to begin this talk with a very simple statement social networks matter right the interactions that we experience with our friends family and colleagues essentially influence our exposure to ideas information and also resources which can influence our attitudes and beliefs perhaps most importantly social networks have been shown to have a profound influence on our behavior and they can also shape our opportunities for action this is precisely why they're so intimately tied to the theory of social capital right which captures this idea that the social bonds that we form with others essentially help to build trust and reciprocity and shared norms and values which can be valuable for both individuals and communities one thing we might all be familiar with is the idea that social capital can help to facilitate collective action among communities toward effective resource management at the individual level social capital can also be considerably important for influencing outcomes in this case it's typically measured with social system structual traits such as how well-connected or prominent you might be in a network or whether or not you bridge or broker between diverse social groups right now being prominent in a network or having lots of friends can be beneficial because it affords you a sense of power and prestige and if you need something chances are one of your friends has it now on the other hand if you're bridging or brokering between diverse social groups you're able to access diverse sources of information and also resources as well and you can essentially bring divergent groups of actors together behind a common goal so taken together this implies that the distribution of social capital among individuals and environmental systems can influence things like is more productive at extracting ecological resources but also who emerges as influential and guiding their management now in Marine Fisheries and particularly prologic marine fisheries which is where I've been doing a lot of my work social networks and social capital can be considerably important right pelagic fishers operate really far offshore in a very dynamic complex environment now I think this picture might be a bit of an over exaggeration but I think it does also work to capture this dynamic complex environment now the handle this complexity Fischer's not only learn from their past experiences but they also rely heavily on sharing information within their social networks in order to mitigate uncertainty and enhance their decision-making yet these are competitive environments right so we actually know very little about who decides to cooperate by sharing information and we know also very little about how these cooperative networks might scale up to influence outcomes so to explore these dynamics I spent a combined 18 months in the field with Hawaii's longline fishermen collecting both social network data and detailed socio-economic data Hawaii's online fishery is a multi-million dollar commercial pelagic fishery it's the most important commercial fishery sector in the Hawaiian Islands they target predominantly tuna and swordfish it operates year-round under a total allowable catch so it's quite competitive the Hawaii has a very diverse multicultural background the fisheries actually comprised of only three distinct ethnic groups mr. grouper vietnamese-american fishermen a group of European American fishermen and a group of Korean American fishermen and I'm going to be using these abbreviations that you see there throughout the rest of this talk so please take note of them now when i was talking to fishermen I specifically asked them to identify who they shared useful information with about fishing that they felt was valuable for their success in the fishery I also asked them to think about different types of actors that they interact with rather than just other fishermen I was really really fortunate to get a very high response rate in fact almost every single fishermen operating in this fishery participated in this project which essentially gave me a very rich detailed data set that enabled me to ask lots of interesting and novel questions today I'm going to focus on to specifically looking at how Fisher's information sharing networks influence environmental outcomes here looking at rates of bycatch as an example and economic outcomes here looking at Fisher productivity as an example so what's the significance of bycatch and Marine Fisheries although many of us may be familiar with it for those of you who aren't especially in longline fisheries it involves placing thousands of baited hooks across vast portions of the water column in this case up to 45 nautical miles so though the hooks are intended to catch a particular target in this case tuna or swordfish they also catch lots of other things and said entally right such as sharks in this case that can catch up to a hundred sharks on a single fishing set now this is a significant ecological issue as many species of shark are in decline globally but it's also an economic problem because in Hawaii sharks are generally unmarketable right so fishermen don't really want to catch them it's a waste of energy and time they can lose their gear they risk injury to the caption or crew and on top of that increasing concern over bycatch is essentially really pushing a lot of regulation and Fisheries as well which can have adverse economic impacts on fishing communities also so assuming then that fissures in this case have an incentive to avoid shark bycatch do they potentially utilize our information sharing networks to do so well let's take a look at the network let me explain what you're looking at here because it can be a little bit overwhelming sometimes I think when you first see a network graph so all the shapes or nodes in the graph are individual so they're either a fisherman that I talk to or someone that they identified as important for information sharing and that ties between them represent the information sharing ties the lines now each node is sheep to represent different types of actors and they're also color-coded by ethnicity so just simply knowing that taking a quick glance at the graph the one thing that you might notice immediately is that fishermen tend to kind of primarily interact within their ethnic group right essentially this is what we call a network homophily effect which captures this idea that people tend to proportionately form ties with others that are more similar to themselves but it's just idea that birds of a feather flock together now there's a substantial amount of theoretical work especially recently that's been arguing that strong am awfully effects like this and networks are likely to have significant implications for social and economic outcomes because it creates these fault lines and the network right that can inhibit the flow and the diffusion of different information and resources between groups now I sought to test this empirically by looking at shark bycatch to do this I linked to my social network data with detailed fisheries observer data over a period of five years and I looked at a series of negative binomial regression models testing whether or not there were any significant difference is essentially among these three neff network groups in shark bike hutch I'm not going to get into all of the modeling today because what I really want to focus on is what I found I would be happy to take questions about it though later of course so what I found was that there was a significant difference in shark bycatch among the three network groups now as you can see here it looks as if the European American network and the Korean American network both have similar rates per 1,000 hooks which are listed there actually when you control for all the other factors that we know affect shark bycatch like fishing location the vessel size or seasonality it turns out that actually the vietnamese-american network and the korean-american network both had significantly higher rates of shark by patch which indicates that this network from awfully effect is indeed affiliated with these fishing behaviors however there is one problem here and that's the fact that this small effect in this case is largely driven by ethnicity so is it perhaps possible then that what I've captured is actually a cultural effect right so perhaps it's a cultural norm that's influencing fishing behaviors regardless of who's talking to who well there are these few individuals in the wrong network so to speak right so they have a majority of ties outside their network so are they acting more like their ethnic group or more like their network group if they're actually more like their ethnic group it would suggest that what I've captured is potentially cultural effects but if they're actually more like their network group it would provide much stronger evidence for an explicit network effect right the effect of individuals actually utilizing these ties to mitigate shark bycatch now when I looked at their rates of shark bycatch of these particular individuals I found that for those who had a majority of ties outside their ethnic group they had significantly different rates of shark bycatch than their ethnic group but not significantly different rates than their network group in other words these outliers so to speak or acting much more like their network rather than their ethnic group providing much stronger essentially evidence that social affiliations are indeed related to fishing behaviors that can scale up to have an impact on environment now what impact exactly are we talking about this is important I think to kind of put this in context again what I've found is that one information sharing network group is catching significantly less sharks and they've maintained this over a period of five years now this is significant because we estimate that if everyone had the same by cut rate is then over this period that I studied over 46,000 sharks might not have been caught essentially resulting in a twelve percent reduction in overall shark bycatch now if I still haven't convinced you that social networks matter I'm going to briefly show you how I also found in to play a role on economic outcomes to look at this I estimated a very simple fishery production function essentially including social capital as an additional input now controlling for the other factors of production and individual and vessel specific characteristics i found that network prominence which is again how well-connected you are had a significantly positive relationship with fisheries revenue so in other words the more friends you have in your local network the more money are making now on the other hand i found that bridging or brokering between diverse social groups or across ethnic groups had a significant negative effect on fisheries revenue so in other words if you're interacting across social divides our with the other guys so to speak you're making significantly less money now this is actually in clear contrast the dominant theory of brokerage that's pervasive and the management organizational and economic sciences which clearly argues that brokerage and particularly this kind of brokerage should have benefits in especially economic benefits yet in sociology there's an emerging theory on the fragile nature of brokerage which captures the idea that brokers essentially have a foot in two social worlds right each with their own expectations of normative behavior and that can actually constrain actors in particular settings and I expect that's actually exactly what's happening in this case so what does all this mean for fisheries management well again first kind of revisiting the results here i found that strong social divides appear to inhibit the flow of information and the diffusion of sustainable behaviors so the management implication might seem pretty simple in this case right why don't we essentially try to find a way to increase cooperation so that way we can bring everyone's by catch rates down now this idea that increasing cooperation can benefit us sounds familiar it's because it is there's heaps of literature all over the place talking about how increased cooperation and collaboration can help us to essentially solve all sorts of environmental problems taking this a step further more recently there's been explicit calls for network interventions where the goal is to actually manipulate or weave stakeholder networks into a structure that is in theory able to promote better outcomes so why don't we just weave Fisher's networks then right that sounds like it might be easier than coming up with really strict management that's going to cost a lot of money to enforce and may be more effective as well than trying to company technologies well again the problem in this case is that i found that interacting across social divides currently entails an economic penalty for individual fishers and what if Fischer's care about profits right in this case this is a commercial fishery so there's a cost to cooperation trying to get these fishermen to interact across social divides is likely going to be pretty problematic now to drive this point home I want to use everyone here as an example there was recently a paper that got published in pnas that identified the fact that long term frequent collaborations particularly between young and old scholars can essentially have a significant positive benefit on scientists careers or it can essentially make them more productive so with this information what if our enlightened center director decided to weave your networks and for all the postdocs assigned you ten grumpy Silverbacks to collaborate with over the next year and for all the distinguished assigns you ten naive budding scholars and don't get too excited they're not there to work for you but rather with you and they've got lots of opinions about how to do things now I'm sure that all of us could identify pretty clearly the costs that would be associated with these sort of forced or manipulated collaborations right in terms of time effort potentially headaches and soak and fissures so although network weaving may sound good in theory and in some cases it may actually be good we need to understand that it people may not always be amenable to these sorts of initiatives and with good reason right because there's a cost to cooperation and essentially if we are going to have to incur that cost we're going to have to realize the fact that what's good for the system is not necessarily always good for the individual and I thank you very much
