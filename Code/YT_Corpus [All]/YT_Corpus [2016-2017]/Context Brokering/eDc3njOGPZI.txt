 all attendees are in listen-only mode good afternoon everybody and thank you for joining us for this webinar this afternoon and we've got a brilliant case study for you today AB from Sharon Mossman Newcastle University he's going to be talking about adapt and adopt making i2o work for you and really to explain what we're about some of the things that they've done they're the IT service at Newcastle University and the way that that's fitted in with other frameworks and other approaches such as SDI as best practice standards and things like that so welcome Sharon thanks for joining us thanks very much so it's great to have you here and then I know that this is something that you've shared in a previous webinar a thing can you've spoken about bit in the past so it would be really really great to have some listeners questions as well so anyone listening if you post your questions throughout sharing them presentation what we'll do is we'll come to those at the end and you can you know get some really specific and hints and tips hopefully on on how you can help to kind of apply some of the things we'll be hearing about today after Sharon will be having a short presentation also from Andy from LANDesk who will be talking a little bit about a continual service improvement so we will introduce him after Joan's presentation so Sharon without further ado I'll hand over to you and as I say we'll come to questions at the end so thanks very much thanks Zoe and hello everyone thanks for joining us today I'm just going to tell you a little bit about our experience in Newcastle University with - I - and the bits that we chose to adapt and adopt and how we integrated that with our roadmap and our plans for improvement and I'll just start with a little bit about me I'm responsible for three teams and Newcastle University it's interested in the role of implementing ITIL processes in that and responsible for the service process team who's responsible for doing that but I'm also a manager of the IT Service Desk and our other frontline customer service T in the cluster and supporting and so I have about 21 22 frontline support staff and a very small team three people in the service process team who do the work on ITER and maintain the system that we use for that where for context Newcastle University are a member of the Russell Group that's an association of the UK's leading research universities and we have get it on for 30,000 internal customers certain students but we also support others customers so for example prospective students their parents students existing students parents we might have people who are called emeritus professors who were previously professors here but who have an IT account after they leave us and their wives and husbands and so we have a very diverse community of customers here in the university our main teaching and research activities on Newcastle but we have campuses in those other places as well and we also have a presence across many other sites for example we have a research shipping vessel we have farms we have their research activities going on so we have IT in many diverse places where a civic University and we have strong links with Newcastle and we work closely with local businesses and with local council and we support those three societal challenge cheap things that have mentioned on that slide and a lot of our research and appends those themes in the university we have this vision and mission and we're very conscious in the IT service that were interested in making sure that we under the university's direction and so are very conscious of the mission critical nature of the IT services that we provide it and were ever conscious of the University's vision and making sure that we work hard to help the university to deliver what it needs to deliver in the IT service itself were around 220 people not very long ago we were disaggregated team we had a central IT team of around 120 people and we had some faculty based teams within the various schools of somewhere between 80 and 100 people in the past two years we've grouped all of our IT people together and we've became a bigger service now and were in the process of integrating those various groups into one team and at the moment we're about more than halfway through that integration piece but it's a long process I first started to work in the university in 2011 and when I came along and had the remit to improve the processes that we currently have in place and to build a roadmap for the other processes that we wanted to introduce and that it was pretty much a blank canvas at that point below the department had already made efforts to put some other processes in place and we did have a simple incident major incident process and we did have a draft for the service catalog the existence service management tour at Earth time had been very much heavily customised and had pretty much painted us into a corner really we weren't able to put into place the changes that we wanted to make to certain processes at that point the incident major incident process it were pretty much ticket loving processes at our time we didn't really manage incidents in the way that I actually suggested that we do with the focus on having the thing fixed very quickly we understood by looking at ikut to not forgetting to do the thing but the urgency was variable I would suggest and we definitely missed opportunities to learn from experience from for example major incident reviews which does help to improve the management of services moving forward at that time the service desk were very much at the bottom of the tree and we didn't get consulted around changes in services we didn't understand or when told about new services coming into play very often we come into work on a Monday mornin and find that being a piece of work done over the weekend that might have caused an outage and we weren't aware that the work was happening so we weren't prepared for it and during that time it was understood that the main process challenge was around control and change but we didn't really have a process in place to do that and so I started with an assessment of where we were and it's the very very often used you know where are we now where do we want to be and how do we get approached we had a system at that time that allowed us to love tickets which was good and we had some rudimentary repulsion which was of some use but we didn't really have much other than that and so a lot of what I had to do in terms of assessment was anecdotal and so we did some work to assess what we had and the maturity of those processes and a lot of it was through consultation talking to analysts talking to some customers and definitely trying to work out the history of how we've evolved to where we are and what's being tried in the past what worked what hasn't worked that sort of thing the Service Catalog which wasn't draft was in a good place and so we just finished off that piece of work integrated it into the system and launched it we wanted to talk about ownership of services at that time and that was a new concept for this organization and so when we did the Service Catalog work we brought in a loss of service owner right from an IT point of view and service leads using a racing model which talks about accountability which is the service owner and responsibilities which are the service leads that was brand-new and so we took a lot of time talking to the people who were to become the service illness in IT about what that really means in terms of their daily workload and what we found was that the responsibilities that hadn't really been defined they were doing it anyway so all this was really doing was right in that town and making that very clear to people in certain expectations and put in a bit of transparency around there that was that took a while a few months to do that and alongside that we wanted to look at an existing process that we knew was in place but wasn't really working very well and so we chose the major incident process because we knew that a number of major incidents will occur in that were off the back of changes and so we wanted to understand how to get that evidence so that would trigger the next step which would be to do something about change management so we brought in and some work for the major incident management process and the key thing that we wanted to do there was improve the way we report it improve the transparency and improve the communications around them and I'll give you a little bit more information about that in a moment another thing that we wanted to do there wasn't very much documentation around the existing processes that we actually did use for example incident and service requests and so we documented that as a start point just to get us ready to start with the improvement to change those things then came the big piece of work we realized very quickly that the existing service management system was not going to be to lend itself to allowing us to grow and move forward in our in our plans and once we understood that we had some very clear choices we could either replace it all together or we could go back to the beginning and do a new implementation of the existent to the problem that we had was that the existing - at that time because it had been so heavily customised it couldn't be upgraded and we were in a situation where we were several versions behind the current version and the version we were on was not supported anymore and so we took a decision to replace it all together and we went to have to tender and been in a university that takes a very long time and because of that it's slowed us down in terms of the work that we wanted to do and we ended up we placed in the system we started the project in 2012 and we managed to get it live by the early part of 2013 and looking back it felt like a long process at the time but now they know a bit more about how universities work it actually was pretty quick so but it was a critical thing for us to be able to realize our ambitions along service management so that came first that's very much against the general trend where people would normally say good practices to get a processes right first and then put the tooling around it but we knew that we were constrained and so we had to do it that way around one of the things that we wanted to do with the service set with the service management system was to introduce self-service which we had in an ad hoc kind of way before through things like web footballs but all of that fed into the system just by emails it didn't really do much and so we introduced the concept of an integrated self-service tool with our new service management system and we took advantage of functionality that was available to us to measure customer satisfaction a bit differently and we publish on our web pages to our customers our scores around customer satisfaction now but the key thing was that once the tool was in place we could then move into our new item processes and in particular we wanted to get in place change management and problem management which is where we went first and so a little bit about the processes themselves major incident management we completely reviewed their first start to finish and we talked about from how do you know what a major incident is which is defined in the Service Catalog under triggers for service outages and so on how do people know that it's a major incident about service you do have this concept of anybody can make the call so while the triggers are there to guide people ultimately sometimes it's a judgment call and anybody can see it we have very specific roles and responsibilities somebody has declared a major incident the service owner then has to decide who's going to lead on that incident and the incidentally then dropped in whoever else they wanted to help them resolve it and the key role in there other than the incident lead is the communications lead which was brand-new for us it took quite a long time for us to embed the concept of communications lead and I think we're a good way there yet there's still some work to do I have to say but it's getting much much better and the important thing around communications is setting expectations really for customers if you can't tell them when it's going to be back the best thing you can tell them is that you will tell them more information in what our length of time you're going to tell them and it helps them to work out what they're going to do with their day and so we thought that was really important so the communications lead Delius is between the incident team who are handling the incident and the Service Desk who then trigger the communications out with customers so they might send emails or post something on our webpage or we use social media Twitter and so on and that all comes from the communications lead so our communications leads are sometimes technical people who give the information to the service desk around what's happening and the Service Desk might interpret that into customer friendly words that we'll be able to to help the customers understand what we're doing and what will working on once the incident is stood down we stand another communication and to tell everybody that were in that position and the next thing we do is set up a major incident review meeting and that was a bit contentious early on because it was always thought that those review meetings ended up uncovering people who were at fault if there was human error in the incident itself and we worked incredibly hard and we still do to make sure that those meetings are completely no blame sessions the idea is to learn lessons what went well what didn't go so well what would we do differently next time and we identify actions and recommendations of the of those meetings the actions are taken by people in the room largely service desk service process people the people involved in the incident including the service owner and these are people who can actually do something about those actions but sometimes we might have a recommendation for a bigger thing that might be for our Directorate to work out whether or not we can afford to do a thing or whether they want to make a policy decision and so we have a function within the process that allows us to push those recommendations up to a senior management team meeting and they have committed to reviewing those recommendations and coming back to the group with a decision about what they want to do all of those actions and recommendations are logged and tracked and they're managed through to conclusion with illness which is masterful from where we were moving on to change management we did a massive amount of work on this and we are constrained a little bit in that currently we don't have any we don't have any commitment to having a change manager or a change management team it's it's something that we're working on but at the moment we don't have that and so we've devolved responsibility and accountability for change management to service owners with the overall process being old within the section that I work in and so within those defined accountability responsibilities that I've mentioned there we've separated the changes out into different sizes and impacts of change and within each of those groups it's a different group responsible for the approvals of those changes so for example a very minor change with very low level impact and risk are approved by the person who's proposing the change in the first place so for example that might be a desktop support person who's been asked to install a low-level piece of software on an individual's laptop which doesn't make sense to have to go through multiple approval levels for that the mid level of significant changes are approved by the service owner and the higher level of major changes both to a virtual change approver board and the change approval board has a service desk representation in that involved me and that means that we make sure that the service desk are prepared for every major change that comes through we try to make the process as low on administration as possible for the analysts who are used in it that's as much about hearts and minds as practicality because we know that introducing something like change management which can be contentious we don't want it to be a reason not to do it because it takes a long time to lock a ticket for example there's too much information required and so we tried to make it as simple as we can but the benefit is that it is auditable we do get reports out of the system around the changes that we put in the failed changes or the changes that are waiting for approval and so on and we have KPIs around that which is a huge step forward from where we went before problem management was Jennifer a completely different reason and that was because we found that we had what we called a big tail on our incident queue and that was because incidents would be in left open for longer than they needed to be because there were remedial actions to be taken later which really is under the remit of problem management and so we wanted to provide a mechanism for people to understand and work with the incident process in the way it's intended to do along the lines of get it fixed quick and get it to a conclusion so that the service is back to where it was before the incident occurred and then close that ticket or review it and then problem management is there to take the longer view so that you can work out on workarounds and no nurse and all that good stuff within problem management separately to the incident management process and that gives us some sense of a major incident triggers that will fire off into problem engines so when we're in a major Institute if you we discuss whether there are remedial chance to take and we've talked about a lot in problem tickets around that it also gives us some decent management information around incidents there because the incidents are actually incidents and the problem records and so we now know about the length of time that incidents take to close which we didn't really have before again we've got defined accountability and responsibilities in there and we have a good process that allows us to put things in around possible causes and we can track around things like what we've tried and tested and hasn't worked and the reasons why it hasn't worked workarounds that do work and the eventual root cause is and you know how we're going to go about fixing it if we are and whether whether we're going to just live with it and that's really helpful and from the Service Desk perspective they can now look up in problem management and see what's going on with any given multiple incident scenario which really just help and again of course we can report on that and so at the moment where we are alongside of that we've done the work with say there was the desk Institute and some of this stuff that we did was around the softer skills with the Service Desk because we could do that then and that was to Elaine not just the intention of getting the nuts and bolts of how we do things correct but kind of our softer approach in terms of what the customer experience and how we want customers to feel about the way we we do things and so we put all of our analysts through service desk analyst training for example and we wanted to spend a lot of time talking about communication about transparency and they've I have been able to to share information with our customers that we previously couldn't the benefits of that sort of dual approach really helps us with transparency around service provision both internally and externally both with customers and the meetings that we might have from a business management perspective but also internally within teams because we were curious say Lord and now there's a whole lot more information around what we're working on who's involved in a specific service and all service leads get together now and talk about services in a more joint of way and so that's much much better change planning and visibility is in the system so everybody can see all the changes that are logged and service transitions are handled in a much more controlled way and the Service Desk is consultative very early on in that process now which makes it much easier for them to plan we are working constantly on building better metrics and reporting but we do have something now that really is miles away from where we were before which was really helpful the key thing for us when we replaced our system was to be able to be self-sufficient it was intended originally that we wanted to build our process capability and that's definitely what we've got out of it but the key thing for us and from a service management point of view is we've got a team of three people and we didn't want to have to be in a position where we leaned on consultants to be able to for example do an upgrade and so as a massive milestone for us in our first year when we upgraded this system completely no not all without any support we were fantastically am sort of overwhelmed by that feeling and it got us to a position where we really thought we could see the possible out of the system and we're we're in it for the long haul so we know that we need to build on that and being able to be self-sufficient was a critical point for us so that was brilliant in terms of common terminology we do speak a toast week but we don't talk about it night or you know what the book says so we talk about incidents we talk about resolutions we talk about services and we talk about change control but it's part of common terminology now everybody talks the same language we've offered rights or foundation courses to the department without pushing it we now have people knocking on the door simply scan a rather than don't make them go we've had over half Department now foundation trained and the remainder the vast majority of them have had a one-day overview in terms of collaboration between the teams across the IT service when we first did the major incident reviews we do the lessons learned bit at the end what went well what didn't go so well and at the very beginning the what went well invariably was well we talked to each other and we worked together and it wasn't that great was a bit of a revelation people didn't really have that as part of their day-to-day landscape right and so a lot more engagement and collaboration is happened in these days and partly I think because of the major incident process and the important thing is that were nowhere near the end of what we want to do we absolutely are committed to improving the way we work and almost daily we come up with an idea of something that we'd like to try we have a wish list which we use on our periodic reviews and that helps us to prioritize the work that we're going to do over the following year and that continuous service improvement can be tracked we can see where was being and we see where we want to go and that's really important to think oh that benefits mainly for me being you know because I've got a vested interest in it given that I managed those teams the service desk and the cluster room support team are very much in the center of all of these processes making sure that they are prepared to be able to deal with any fallout or making sure that they're prepared to handle any challenges that come out of any of the pieces of work that we do included things like change management communications are getting better and that's an ongoing process I don't ever see an end to that because I always think that you can do something to improve communications and as appetites change in terms of things like use of social media whether we use I don't know SMS message you know whatever else we do chat there's always something new that we could be doing and communications will always be at the forefront of what our improvement journey I think we have absolutely improved the quality of service provision to our customers and we know that because we get really good feedback through our mechanisms we've got in place now and where we've gone from either not very much other yard grumble to constantly and consistently good feedback it's it's a fantastic place to be and just last week the customer feedback process comes through me and last week when I reviewed all of the customer feedback for that week without fail every single piece of feedback was positive about our service desk which was the first time and it was fantastic I was delighted by Anna and so we have gone through the service desk institute certification process we were absolutely bowled over by the fact that having gone through all of these pieces of work and continually tried to get better at what we do and the intention was there we thought we were getting better to get that three star award in 2015 2014-15 it was it was amazing and it was still absolutely buoyant as a team about that that's just fantastic and so we decided to finally bite the bullet and go in for the STI Awards in the past term the past conference and we were actually again once again bored over to be finalists in the best large Service Desk Award so that was an absolutely fantastic accolade delighted by that and that was really all I wanted to talk about with regards to our journey and for now I'm open for questions fantastic thanks Sharon thanks so much and there's loads of questions that I could do that I'd like to ask actually but and thinking about sticking to time and what we do is I have got some listener questions here and so we'll get through as many of those as we can so first of all I've got one from Kieran who says that you mentioned pre itíll the service desk focus on fixing issues quickly and post title how did this change and what were the end-users reactions yeah think there are two sort of aspects to that one is about prioritization there was a bit of kind of who who shouts loudest gets them most sort of attention sometimes and I wouldn't say that was uniform and it just needs to be kind of contextualize according to the type of query that it was but in general we didn't do a sort of more objective prioritization process and so part of the incident work that we did was work with the teams to understand about managing their ticket queues and having for example a simple thing like a queue monitor of the day within each of the teams who is responsible for prioritizing and getting back to customers and tone customers setting their expectations or gathering more information if they needed it something as simple as that really has had a big impact from a customer's point of view they do say that our communications are better now and that certain expectations is definitely an important thing for them and so I think that I think that's been the biggest impact ok yeah no because I imagine what hearing perhaps is in part getting at is that whenever it's any kind of change there could be an initial sort of dubiousness I sure say and but we can tell from what you were saying at the end you know all your your feedback customer feedback has improved so you know it's taking a long view as well isn't it's not another name thing no I'm still looking at Wealth's coming in here so we've got one from John he's asking and do you track major incident follow one action tasks in the tool yes not in the tool no we do it out with but it depends what the task is if it's an if it's something that relates specifically to a service then we would log it in a tour and one of the things that didn't say was that everything in we log in the system is tied to a service and so the services are right in the center of everything that we do and so we you know if it was something that was an action that might be I don't know replace a bit of hardware related to a service or make a change within the service and yes that would be loved in the system as per the service request or change process or whatever it related to and we referred to the problem management side of it as well but if it was something like that might be an education piece for a member of staff for example which might be a lesson learned and we wouldn't put that into the system we would just do that separately sure okay fantastic you may at four had chili and had a whole new spate of questions coming in and then a notion when I was talking to you earlier today you're saying that perhaps we could get some of these questions to you after the webinar ring up that would be fantastic and so let's just go for one more quick one and then we'll we'll hand over to Andy and he's been patiently waiting there to get his presentation started in Salem let me just put one more to you then quickly so sue is asking about any tips you've got fur for getting teams to collaborate better and when things change their life easier in the long run it could be that there are different skills or different and perspective same skill in different teams so they might bounce ideas of each other and each will benefit either that or it could be that it would be imagine a mutual interest in a common service but they have different aspects of that service that belong to them in terms of their responsibilities a good example of that for example in this organization is sa P where we've got group of people who are responsible for delivering sa P but we have obviously and service and infrastructure never have to buy a different group and they weren't very close it's there because the the common goal is to name ourselves they were supposed to take our customers and so it's just highlighting why it's a good thing and encourage and facilitate and you know making it happen for them and you know sort of making sure that they can just wanted you don't have to you don't have to mean yeah okay absolutely thank you so much for taking those questions Sharon and and what would you know hand straight over to Andy and I let us introduce introduce yourself and your role and if that's okay and then then go into your into your slides thank you yeah I work as a solutions expert on the ITSM and items side and really knowing what sharon was going to talk about I I thought I'd just throw in a few thoughts on on the piece that really she's alluded to a lot I mean a lot of what she's mentioned is about the initial stages of reviewing what was in place when she came on board and making some major step changes but it's an area which which I - is very strong and what I wanted to do is kind of compare this to something that's a little bit closer to my side of the heart about things that happen in sports so and the aggregation of marginal gains will come but we've all seen this and we've all seen the bits of the middle and it's the bit on the outside that's really important and I think one of the things just as an overriding comment about this is continual service improvement starts the minute you start doing anything it's not something that should happen at the end of a process it should be there as we go along you're always going to introduce significant changes new systems and everything else but CSI has to be in that space for you to make the changes you want to make and go on that let's use the J word the journey of improving your service I mean it's a fairly good statement I always liked the idea that it has CSI as well because to me something of continual services movement is about investigating things that aren't going right and finding the solutions for those and so I wanted introduced to one of my sporting heroes who is national sports from in his own right some of you may recognize this guys Dave Brailsford and he's not that he's no longer involved in that GB cycling he's very much of all the Team Sky but he's been pretty much single-handedly responsible for transforming British Cycling globally and this carted off for quite a while backs of leading up to Olympics and now the annoying for most of the rest of all especially the French the British domination of the Tour de France that he has a very simple approach to what he wanted to do when he was put in post and it's a few cuts thoughts and concepts around that and these are absolutely - any space and what we're talking about I think the first thing you need to do is you need to have a team and you need to have the right team when you need to have that motivation and Chan was talking about the soft skills side of it and an understanding of what you're trying to achieve if you don't have that I think anything you try and do and that's not just what we're talking about today has to we'll struggle that end goal that a belief that you can actually be something good and you actually write the the the feeling of getting into that selection process for best service desk getting an award anyway therefore one of the guys as as the best service that's professional all that type of stuff is really demonstrating that the alignment of the people with the direction if you're not going with that you can have whatever software tool you like it isn't going to make your life any better second one is again maybe really obvious one what do you want to try and do where what are your stated goals these can be big fancy ones they can be very small ones but it really is again that that motivation and the clear your understanding without that clear understanding we're all going off in different directions and we need every heading in the right direction the obvious choice already measure if you don't know where you are now you don't know whether you've got anywhere and and that might be an unpleasant scenario to start with um but it certainly gives you as you stand at the end of the journey looking back you can really get a feel for where they are and the guys have come a long way from what was I wasn't party to early on but certainly the stuff Sharon's very passionate about that but the real significant change in the quality and they know where they are now and more importantly they know where they used to be and that gap is a big big gap in the right direction and then we need to figure out how we want to do that and that's about plans and this is where CSI becomes a real part of that and we're the point for me about continue so this improvement is Dave Brailsford big statement that he made a little while ago and that's the aggregation of marginal gains which is really in simple terms doing it in baby steps what he did and what made them so successful was rather than trying to change one thing in a massive way they went and looked at all the 1% where can I make a 1% change here where can I make a 1% change there and they did it in a meticulous way and the end result was rather than having some massive challenge actually the combination as it says here the aggregation of all these one percents men that will ended up being it now a almost dominant British Cycling setup and this is this is the same thing we apply with with servicedesk you don't have to do this in big steps you can do this in baby steps in actual fact it works a lot better that way and because no one sits there being overwhelmed by the scale of maybe a problem knocking away in it very slowly with the small pieces can make a massive difference quite quickly to know that you need to know your information and you kind of need to have real information and I know and I have a real challenge with people when they want to produce data I have a very simple question is that if you don't if you're not making a decision on the information you are gathering then why are you bothering gathering the information and to understand where you are and where you're getting to you need to understand those changes as you lay out the path you want to go on no matter what the activity is that you're going to carry out to achieve that improvement you've always got to have a standard set of KPI set of reporting metrics whatever they are that you can call a reference and a reliable reference because part of what you might want to do might be investment an investment is a difficult chatter is a difficult question in ITSM return on investment is not an easy thing to do so statistics and information like that make a massive difference a simple and very completely out of context from it was meant for but this is actually a very true statement once you measure something you can change the way the behavior of the thing because you now have total understanding of it so when you know whether your incidents are being managed in the right way when you know how much time it's taking then you can understand what makes it better is that appropriate it really is quite a simple statement but a very powerful one which I think was was kind of really captured about a very complex better physics but in ITSM world it's the same thing we understand what this is we know how we can change it a simple example of a scorecard just something that says I know where I'm getting better or not it's just one of those ideas reporting can be simple it doesn't have to be complicated again the point is I could look on this report scorecard I can know where I need to be concentrating my next steps on it's the red blocks the green blocks mean I'm doing really well red blocks mean I've got to go and do something so it is kind of one of those things where what you've got to try and do is focus in the right places I think finally just as we as I finish off what we also need to recognize is that those ideas can come from everywhere and what we're able to do is provide people with not just your IT organization but the customer base as well and I think consider service improvement shouldn't be just around the result of a major incident route of review for example key that has the spec for doing that but you guaranteed if you went to a service desk set a team and said and asked them the question they'd all have thoughts and ideas on how to make the service desk better so providing them with a mechanism by which they can do that as a parallel process to just the normal responsive mechanisms is also the case now obviously what we want to do there is we want to understand this and part of using service improvement is understanding benefits and everything like that where you can see in a moment it's just this idea of assessment how good is this it's a simple assessment which you can score and then you can you know manage that Q I might have stuff that I do straightaway I might have stuff in the queue that I review but actually I've got this register of what it is and I understand where things who owns then the service owner is a critical part of that you know your everything you log ties back to service but the other source of casino service improvement is your customers why not give your guys out there the people to say I got on the bass in the delivery of the service desk so they feel there's a Buy in their present responsiveness I think that's something that sometimes we can be accused of in in service management is not being very customer focused from something some areas and I know that's that's always a challenge keeping that communication but if you're opening up channels like this where what you're actually saying is you know what guys you can contribute to that improvement process then that I think that's a really powerful thing you can manage it we can control it and we can feedback to those customers and that's a really great thing so those are just a few of my thoughts around how we actually manage that and some of those things I just wanted to kind of finish with these final few thoughts which is you've got to understand where you're going you've got to make sure you can measure what you're doing you've got to have that team around you that's motivated remember that ideas can come from anywhere they could be very left-field ideas but they should all be viewed because you never know what clever idea comes from somewhere which you haven't thought of but actually makes a big difference and that kind of final statement for me it's you know just understanding that really what we're trying to do and the best way to approach this is little pieces of improvement lots of those actually give you a much more tangible feeling of moving forward than trying to sort of you know eat yet one go it's not impossible sometimes but most the time you want to eat a little bites and achieve it that way so it's just a thought some thoughts around continuous service improvement how you might approach it and really that idea of you know it's not just the start point this is really the name is continuous it is all the time and we should be embedding that into whatever system we use or have a business processes we put around managing ITSM so this improvement is what we do we don't survive as service management of service delivery people if we're not moving some of those are big moves some of those can be minor ones but it's a really important part of how we do that service so thanks very much that's my er my little slot up I don't have suppose got any questions for me but back to you thank you fantastic thank you for that and I have got where I've got one sort of myself really I was thinking about when you were talking going back to thinking about the measuring and reporting and I only sort of only only measuring things that you're going to actually use basically as we're thinking how much of that should be led by other areas of the business in terms of what they say they will need or use and how much do you think the Service Desk should keep that kind of control if you like over what they decide to put out so I think I think the answer that goes back that wonderful magical itíll concept of the service if you're really driving that as a proper concept and the business is telling you how they want a service delivered because it's a consultation process and the measurement of how the quality of that service is being delivered is a combination of IT and the business I think there are internal IT things that that will always be useful to them but in the bigger wider concept of the stakeholders who are using the services who are your customers it is being able to track and measure the things that impact back their quality of service so it is a combination of two some are internal but I would always say that that overriding mindset should be what we do should only be there to support the business and every activity we carry out is there to deliver a service to a bit or an entire part of the business that would be how I see okay all right yep so it's definitely that's together approach and thinking about a menu of scene you've seen some of the same things a lots of different organizations and different service desks and is there anything you can put your finger on in terms of the the main barriers if you like to organisations getting this kind of thing right because you know you do hear some some of the same themes if you're like coming up in presentations and training and and blogs and things like that and you know what why is it that it's still so difficult for some people to get these things in place in terms of it you know a separate problem manage reproach yeah I think I think that the difficulty comes from and I think this falls into things like problem as well we find it very easy to execute activities like instant request and change which have a quite high degree of finite time scale to them yes yeah no no we're in it you know if you've got an SLA incident you know when that instance gonna breach therefore you've got time style you have a change which has a changed release date so that requests the same when you hit things like service improvement and problem management it's a softer set of approaches because you you may take time to do that and it's not a time you can accurately quantify yeah and I think a lot of the time that the challenge that a lot of organizations have is can you go away for a week and do this thing we might actually make you do it for two weeks but that doesn't work within the wider scope so I always feel like if you're going to achieve this you do have to look at how the organizational structure of the teams is there you've got to acknowledge that a person or more depending on the benefit of the the work being done needs to come out of maybe the frontline support but again it's that I did being able to quantify it which is the challenge I think in most people it's easy to say have a day out and be back in tomorrow yeah but you could argue in some cases that there's a benefit there's a valid state for saying go away and fix this and don't come back to you do now if they still away in a year's time that's the challenge is structuring it and understanding that slightly was not random but it's a more variable nature of timeframes of these things might have yeah of course and I guess as we were talking about earlier taking the long view you know talking about what the what the eventual benefits are going to be and how much more what a greater fear have as a whole reactive yes and somewhere in that you have to accept that you might have to take a hit you know if you take someone out the front line yes a body you're not employed to do incident management and in the short term there could be a dip but that longer-term view is actually that the work they do will start to reduce the number of incidents you can argue if it's a very significant piece of work they're almost engineering themselves out of needing to be on the frontline anymore because they've reduced the amount of inbound so yeah that thing is that that challenge and that tip initially but it will come back and having faith and trust that it will and I think that brings us back nicely full circle to what Sharon was talking about in terms of you know the eventual payoff and the actual you know having faith in that whole whole process and seeing what where it can lead you in the end and I think that's why it's really important to hear these kind of case studies and how other people have managed it and actually you know had successes and and where it's taken them so and I want to say thank you to both of you again for some really brilliant points today and thanks for taking part and then as I say we'll get these extra listeners questions over to you Sharon first and following up on that afterwards and hopefully get that onto a blog for everyone to have a look back at in the next couple of weeks okay alright so thanks again everyone thanks for listening and there we'll be back later in the in May with them our next webinar which is and all about service brokering so if you haven't signed up for that one yet that should be a good one too so thanks very much and bye guys receipt with speech you seen I
