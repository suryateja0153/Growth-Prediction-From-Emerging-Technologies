 hey guys and girls I want to thank you for sticking with me to learn more about the great business of brokering business loans the sheer fact that you are joining me here on this third video is proof that you're looking for a change in your career and in your life and I'm psyched that you're continuing to explore this great business as an option as men as mentioned many times throughout my videos and website you do not need any finance experience to earn the lucrative fees that this type of business should be able to provide to you and your family if you haven't watched the first or second video I suggest you go back and watch them first in the first video I talked about what type of fees you can expect to earn who the business is ideal for and give you an overview or introduction of what to expect as a business loan broker in the second video I start on the first of three steps you need to accomplish as a business loan broker I show you how I use an annuity approach to my business calling on strategic partners who can send you multiple deals each year now today in this video I want to show you how to show you the second of three steps to running a successful loan brokerage this is how to package a deal for a bank once you find a deal before I get started on how to package a deal for the bank I want to take you to my computer screen and show you something interesting from my last consulting gig with an equipment finance startup that I spent the entire year of 2015 with ok guys I am back I'm here on my computer screen and I just wanted to cut away from the next lesson real quick just to show you some of what we were able to accomplish in just one year's time going after equipment finance deals if you end up going these were for larger deals that was kind of our whole niche that we were going after probably too much to get in here but I wanted to show you just you know some of what you can expect in this business and what I'm doing is pulling up a pipeline report which is basically just an Excel spreadsheet I'm probably gonna blur some of this stuff out because I don't need to show you all what you know all accounts because I'm sure some of these deals are still live deals but okay on the first one I'm going to show you deals on the radar and that's basically deals that were that we found that were real you know the the customer had a real need and that we were trying to vie for their business and get a quote out to them and get a term sheet and get some commitment from them to move forward with us so it's basically the entire pipeline it shows pretty much every opportunity that we have a chance at winning it doesn't mean that we're going to win them all matter of fact there are some ratios that I get into later but but what you see here as you can see and like I said as a new broker you might not be doing deals this big I mean if you have the the financial chops to do it great if you're just starting out and you don't really have any financial background chances are you're going to do small ticket equipment finance or you could do commercial mortgages because they're pretty simple actually as far as pricing and and winning the business but um but what you see here is you got well let's go over here you got eight million dollar building for a construction company you have real plant equipment for an operating lease for five million here you have solar panels for five million you've got IT equipment for million dollars worth of IT equipment and now what what happened was the way we we we actually marketed two ways and I don't really suggest doing it the one way we marketed we had a couple guys who just started in the business that were calling off a SP list that we bought for companies that were doing over 50 million in revenue and that were heavily involved in equipment intensive companies like coal mining companies energy companies aviation we had about five or six vertical markets that we went after that we called direct and like I said my feeling is is that you're better off calling on the guys who sell equipment than calling on the end-users but and I if I wanted to I could probably go through you and show you which ones were referred by vendors and which ones were called on by the end-user but this this gives you some idea of the total a business that you can build doing this so you get on through this you've got 15 million 15 million in tractors and trailers lifts for a million dollars you have tada knows which are cranes for 2 million aircraft refinance for 4 and a half million crane and knuckle boom loader for 2 million 5 million dollars for two cranes and all these crane deals I know our vendor were referred to us by a crane vendor and I think I talked about that in one of my previous videos but how you go through medical equipment for 6 million you have rolling stock which is I believe over the road type equipment for 10 million so these are all the opportunities and this was done this this report is from November of last year November 2015 so we had about just under a year under our belt and these are the opportunities that we were able to find you could see that we found if you look at the total down there 219 million dollars worth of opportunities now term sheets out this is means that we had actually the customer said yeah we want to quote from you and they wanted a term sheet so we we actually quoted on 22 million and keep in mind we closed about I think about 25 million up to this point so we have 22 million dollars in quotes out there that we're still trying to win we still have to place those with a bank working opportunities and these might not be in any order I think these ones are actually ones where the term sheets came back signed term sheets and you can see that there's a lot of big numbers on here deals committed these okay these are the ones that we have 60 million dollars in signed term sheets where people where the customer said yeah we will do the business at this rate with you and on small ticket equipment finance it's a little bit different you're not going to wait for a terms assigned term sheet to come back you're just going to get agreement from the customer typically under seventy-five thousand dollar deal you're gonna get a credit application you're just going to send it off to the banks and you'll get an answer back one way or they're very simple deal so they're a lot less involved in the smaller deals Oh over here you can see some of the fees that we planned on earning from these committed deals so you can see that there's a one-point 1.1 million dollars worth of fees that were if we can place these with a bank that's what our fees would have been for the remaining deals other than the 25 million that we had already placed so that gives you a little flavor of the business now what I want to do is go back to you you found it you went out you did some marketing with these equipment guys or with commercial real estate guys they send you a deal now you need to know what to do with the lead you got to figure out okay the guys interested in doing business with me what do I need to do to get started with them and that's what I want to show you next okay let's say you started your business loan brokering business you have all the office items and housekeeping items in place and you started by marketing your business by going on in setting meetings with various sales people who sell equipment or sell real estate or both you've been out marketing your services for a week or two and you get your first email or phone call with a referral from one of your strategic partners they have a customer as a need to finance some equipment or they have a commercial real estate investor who wants to finance a property you will need to gather the appropriate information from the customer so you can forward it to the appropriate Bank here's how the process will normally go your referral source will call you or email you I suggest you always having a phone call with your referral source so you can learn some preliminary information about the deal this preliminary information will help you once you call the end-user who's being referred now let's break down the information you'll need to gather from your referral source and your common customer based on the type of deal the business is pretty much the same for all deals you find the deals you package the credit you send them to the correct funding sources the credit packages change somewhat for the type of deal you're doing that biz Loan Consultant Starcom we concentrate on the two biggest opportunities for brokering loans equipment finance and commercial real estate loans this is easy stuff folks you need to gather the correct information for the type of deal you're doing and you get a cheat sheet to help you let's start with equipment finance one of the things you'll learn very early when you're doing equipment finance deals is that many funding sources are what they call application only up to $75,000 in equipment costs some we even go to a hundred thousand and a few up to two hundred fifty thousand this is the determinant by the funding source you are going to submit your deal to basically what this means is that many banks or funding sources will only require you for you to gather a credit application to submit the deal and you won't need any additional information from your customer as a business loan broker this makes it easy for you to package the deal because all you need is a one-page credit application from your customer I would always go the extra mile for my funding source and grab an equipment brochure or a quote and submit it with the deal you also need to do a short write-up about the deal that usually will include how you price the deal or how many points you put in for your fee and how the equipment improves their business is it replacement equipment does it make them more productive does it reduce their costs on these smaller equipment deals the package is easy you now just send this off to the equipment funding source you think is most likely to approve the deal at the lowest rate on large deals you'll need to ask your customer for more information keep in mind it is common for businesses to supply this when they apply for credit here's the information you'll need on equipment deals over seventy five thousand dollars a credit application three years personal and business tax returns or audited corporate financials current year interim which is basically their QuickBooks statements or however else they keep their internal financials short explanation of what the equipment is doing for the company replacing old equipment making them more productive and how and reducing their costs etc an equipment brochure and or equipment quote from your equipment vendor an organization chart of the owners of the company a personal financial statement of officers of any closely held businesses you're dealing with an equipment appraisal if it's used equipment and if it's available the beauty of this you can use a cheat sheet or checklist to ask them for this in many cases you'll ask them for these items in an email and you can include your checklist in your email keep in mind it is common for businesses to safale to supply this when they apply for credit once again you will need to do a short write-up about the deal that usually will include how you price a deal or how many points you put in for your fee and how the equipment improves their business is it replacement equipment does it make them more productive does it reduce their costs now just as in smaller deals you take this larger package and now you just send it off to the equipment funding source you think is most likely to approve the deal at the lowest rate now let's look at commercial mortgage credit packages commercial mortgage packages are not done application only the package will require some of the same items as a can equipment deal but will also require some additional information here's the checklist I use for commercial mortgages a credit application three years personal and business tax returns or or audited corporate financials the current year interim or their internal statements which sometimes can be QuickBooks statements a short explanation of the property is it new construction how many units what's the use etc the rent roll with tenant names the lease term how many years they've been in the monthly lease amount the square footage occupied and any other additional information about the property a list of other properties owned and equity positions if available an organization chart of the owners of the company personal financial statements of all the officers of any closely held businesses an old appraised or the property if it is available photos of the property surveys and elevation drawings for any new construction type projects etc a pro forma rent roll a construction budget and zoning also if it's new construction and the total budget including improvements and any down payment or equity provided for the transaction from the investors the deal structure they're looking for and any prepayment objections they might have so basically you want to know how long of a term and so forth just like the equipment deals you will also need to do a write-up about the deal that usually will include the history of the investor a synopsis of the property and the overall deal structure in both the equipment deal in the commercial real estate deal the goal of packaging a deal for your bank is to keep them from asking for additional information in many cases that will ask you for some information that might be specific to their underwriting needs but your goal is to limit how much information they will need in addition to your initial package and give them everything they need to make a solid credit decision up front technology makes it easy for you to share your package with the funding source of your choice keep in mind that in many cases this information will be sent via email to your or from your customer if it is not then you'll need to scan the information so it can be easily transmitted to your funding source sometimes the files will be too large to send in one email as many email servers have a 10 Meg or less threshold for attachments if so you'll need to send to your banks in two emails or use a dropbox.com type of service now you know the basic information you need to request from your customer based on the type of deal you are doing the beauty of this business is how easy the fulfillment is it's not digging ditches once the customer sends you the required information you can usually put it in order do your write-up in less than an hour and then decide who and why you're going to send it the funding sources from the funding sources you have to choose from your ability to have a robust source of funding sources to send the deal to will make it difference in your success in the business and that is what I'm going to talk to you about in my next
