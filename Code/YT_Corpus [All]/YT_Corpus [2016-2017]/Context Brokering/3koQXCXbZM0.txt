 we study billionaires and this is episode 67 of the investors podcast broadcasting from Bel Air Maryland this is the investors podcast they'll read the books and summarize the lessons don't test the waters and tell you what it's cold they'll give you actionable investing strategies your host Preston fish and Stig wrote ursin all right how's everybody doing out there this is Preston fishing I'm your host for the investors podcast and as usual I'm accompanied by my co-host Stig Broder sent out in Denmark today we've got another book for you and the name of the book this week is liars poker by Michael Lewis a couple episodes back we read the book Buffett the making of an American capitalist and in that book there was a lot of description on a lot of talk about his time dealing with Salomon Brothers and the collapse that was almost gonna occur until he stepped in and became the CEO so this book liars poker is all about Salomon Brothers and how that culture that Buffett was dealing with during that time was really cultivated and grown because this book occurred I don't know how many years before Buffett was playing around in Salomon Brothers but it was slightly before I want to say within five years before Buffett had to swoop in and basically save this company this book liars poker was written about the culture and basically growing up in Salomon Brothers this was written by Michael Lewis who you know is just one of the best financial writers out there so Michael Lewis started off working at Salomon Brothers and this book basically outlines his entire experience of working there I want to say he was there for maybe five years is that right Stig yeah something like that yeah I think the book was from 89 so he was really describing all the crazy things that were happening on Wall Street in the 80s and that one thing that comes to mind would be in something like wolf of Wall Street or something like that that's at least what I picture where now I read the stuff yeah and his description of this stuff is just crazy so before we get to the book and we start talking about that a little bit more I want to throw something out there to our audience that Stig and I are very excited about so if you've seen on our forum the Warren Buffett forum calm you might have seen us talking about the new Berkshire shareholders meeting that's coming up at the very end of April 2016 we're getting very close to this because this is being recorded in December just so everyone knows it's December 10th while we're recording this and we want to inform our audience early enough that if you want to go to the Berkshire shareholders meeting and attend it with us we would love for you to join us while we're out there we will put out more information on our forum also send something out on our email list at the bottom we send out the show notes or whatever you guys will get the information if you guys are signed up on any of our lists but if you want to go to the Berkshire shareholder meeting and you want to go meet Stig and I will be out there and so a bunch of the members of our audience and so will a lot of the guests that have been on the show and last time we did this we did this two years ago it was a just a blast to just interact with some of the people that were part of the Buffett's books community and the man we really developed some just great relationships with some folks and it was just so much fun we just had a blast and what's great is you get to go into this auditorium you get to listen the Warren Buffett basically talk about the current market conditions for how long is he due at stake it's it's like an all-day affair oh yeah and humans tell them Oh more they can just go on and on and on that's that's amazing now for us we absolutely love this stuff some other people might like if my wife had to go and sit in the room she'd be like what are these guys talking about and why is this taking so long but it is an awesome event they answer question after question and it's just really neat to see their thought process at that level so if this sounds like something you want to go to we're gonna start building out pages on our site we're gonna start having things available for everyone out there to show you how you can go to this because it's actually a whole lot easier than you might think as far as getting the credentials for the meeting we'll help you through that process if it's something you really want to go to now here's what I'll tell you you have to start making this decision right about now because the tickets to get out to Omaha for that day they get a little bit crazy so you want to get that sooner rather than later you're also gonna want to book your hotel a little sooner than later so if this is something you want to do you're probably gonna have to make the decision pretty soon but we would love to have you there we would love to spend time with you and meet you and and whatnots out if it's something you want to do we'll be putting out all the information for that very shortly so let's go ahead and talk about this book so Michael Lewis this guy he's written liars poker the one that we're gonna be discussing was really his first book that put him on the map and this was a New York Times bestseller it went wowed it was a very popular book and it gave him his start then he wrote the book Moneyball which has been turned into a movie then he's written a couple others that were huge the big short I just saw literally on TV about a week ago that that book is being turned into a movie that one was about the 2008 crash and I highly highly recommend that book it was very good and then obviously we did flash boys already we already talked about that woman about the high frequency stuff that was probably about a year ago so he's written just a ton of stuff really great authors but we'll jump into the book here so liars poker it's all about his time at Salomon Brothers so he starts off the book with this story of two of the Board of Directors playing this game of liars poker and just so people kind of understand the game so what these traders would do and that's what he was he was a trader for Salomon Brothers but what they would do in their meantime whenever they're just playing around you might have a guy that goes up to a group of four other traders and he might pull a $10 bill out of his pocket or a 50 or whatever it might be and he would say there's four sixes and so what they would do is they had bet on the odds that as each person pulls a $10 bill out of their pocket they would look at the serial number and if there was six sixes on the bills and when you added it up then that person would collect the money from the other people if there was less than that or the number was off and the rules would play out I've never played this so I'm probably describing it wrong but what they were really doing the essence of it is they were trying to figure out the probabilities and they were betting on it that's what they were doing so the book starts off with this story with is actually the chairman of their board John got friend he was walking down the aisle and he came across one of the other bond traders in John Meriwether and comes up to Merriweather and he says 1 million dollars liars poker and it said the gentleman replied back he said well if we're gonna play this it's a no tears allowed and just you know telling him that he's gonna bet a million dollars on this silly game and so john gut friend replied back he said well he says I I'm not doing it for 1 million let's just make it 10 million and let's do this let's do this right and the other guy says you're absolutely crazy it just walks away so the whole point of that story upfront in the book is just this show are you lying are you just putting on a front are you a poseur because that's really the whole culture here is just like are you bluffing when you're a traitor are you bluffing are you just trying to trick me are you actually being serious are you truly that crazy and so it's just kind of a unique story and I'll tell you it really grabs your attention as you start to read the book and the rest of the book is just as I don't know exciting or interesting I guess I mean for me whenever I hear this stuff I just think that's just stupid you know that's just absolutely stupid that's my personal opinion you know like I don't live in a culture like that I can promise you that well that's not value investing Preston for sure it's amazing to hear some of these stories and I think some of it we'll just below people's mind and I'll tell you this this is the one thing I want people to take away from this book if you want to go work on Wall Street and you really want to dive in the finance and become a trader I would say this is a mandatory read for people absolutely mandatory read you have to read this before you would dive into that culture because for me if I read this as a college student or whatever there is no way in a million years I would inject myself into that kind of culture there's just no way I have this firm opinion that when you put yourself in a certain culture regardless of how moral or how strong you are as an individual the longer you stay in that culture you will become that culture so I would use that as a word of caution for anything that you're doing not necessarily go in the wall street and I'm not saying on everything on Wall Street's bad I'm just saying that in this particular example of this book it's a really a word of caution to be very mindful of what culture you decide to interject yourself into okay so with that said we're gonna go ahead and kick this over to Stig and he's gonna talk about how Salomon Brothers made money during this time yes so basically I would say there are three different ways that you can make money is that very rare generic so the first one is by being purely a broker so you probably familiar with that whenever you are trading an online platform or using your bank's platform that you might be paying a thing it's the cheapest out there's probably around five or six dollars something that per trade so the broker will collect that money for doing the trade for you but obviously I was not with Salomon Brothers did they were in bonds and they were talking about a lot more money and I just like 10 shares of coca-cola what not so what they were doing was they were bundling like huge amount of bonds and they would typically take something like 1/8 of a percent of the total sum they would take that as a fee so that was the first one the other way that they made money was that they would be broker with two known parties and that is something that happens off-screen so the first one is something that you see on the screen and when I say on the screen is something you can see in the exchange but they were also brokering off the screen so the way this would work was that they would have a client it might be me and I would have say 1 million dollars worth of IBM bonds now I would need to sell them so I would call the Salomon Bros and I would say ok I know someone called Preston they might not even tell me his name they probably wouldn't and then they will take a small cut from that and that by handling the deal basically as a broker does getting their commission from facilitating the meeting between the buyer and seller but they also did and that was the more interesting part was their trading division so whenever you're trading you're either doing that for your own account or you're doing it for a client and Salomon Brothers did both things so what you're doing is that you're basically bidding on whether or not the price will go up and down and since they were in bonds and as you might know by following the courses and by following the the podcast that we had if you see an increase in the interest rate you will see a drop in the price of bonds so they were painting on the direction of the interest rate and that but also the bond prices and by doing so they were either making money or losing money for their client basically this is also the very core of trading I promised or I threatened Preston with a few anecdotes from my own trading career and for instance but we did because I was in power trading is that we would be betting on the price of electricity so the mechanism is very very similar whether or not it stocks or bonds or coffee or even something like electricity so we would be looking at the F weather forecast and if we saw a lot of wind coming in we knew that there would be a higher supply out there which will drive down the price and this was actually the same way that Salomon Brothers and everyone out there is trading they're saying can we predict what will happen in future and then start taking bets based on that so basically if I could just sum up two different ways of making money one is the broker part where they're facilitating buyer and the seller and then the other one is that they're taking position in the market either for themself or for the client and bidding on the prices whatever the asset might be so when we talk about what happened in the book so it goes through the time Lewis was really kind of getting through this introductory course that Salomon Brothers offers he went through that and he's talking about how they brought down these bigwig executives that talked to the class the book is full of explicit of so if you're not if you're riding in your car with your kids you're probably not gonna want to listen to this book through audibles but yeah it's very I don't know graphic I guess if you want to describe it that way so that's just an FYI but it's talking about these executives that are coming down and talking to his class and using explicit 'iv in you know three explicit is in a short sentence and it's just kind of interesting to see that and I'm glad that he did do it that way because I think it represents the culture very well and it's very representative of what the experience would be like to go through this so after his course finished up his introductory course all the guys there are fit for the culture based on the way that he was describing his fellow classmates that were stepping into Salomon Brothers they get into the trading floor and then basically the games begin all the senior guys that are there just basically using these guys as they're setting up new accounts and getting new customers and some senior level guy walks by senior level trader and just totally dupes one of them into basically taking on some of their securities and some of their accounts and they immediately just start getting screwed as what happens and so they're all just fending for themselves and he said the attrition rate I can't remember what it was but I think after a year later it was something like half of the initial guys or one third of the initial guys that started out were still there so the attrition rate was very high for these guys starting out in the firm now it talks about Michael Lewis and how he basically developed this relationship with one of the more senior guys that he could actually trust and this gentleman really kind of helped him out and he just started making these trades and started doing really well for himself and with some of the clients and so within a I would say two years three years Michael Lewis build up to the point where he was basically making 10 million dollars for the company based on the time that he had been at the company he was only able to make I'd say eighty to like a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and back then that's I mean you're talking about a lot of money that's a lot of money today but he was making that back in the 80s as a young kid he was what 24 25 years old at this point Stig he was pretty young yeah he was very oh he was just fresh out of college I as far as I remember yeah so I mean he was making a ton of money but he was also making a ton of money for the firm he's making ten million dollars a year for the firm as that number grew so he started even making more money for the firm I think he was around 27 28 years old when he was describing his time where he was pretty much becoming a middle-level to higher level executive within the company he was you know shooting into the stratosphere and in a quick way within the company and I think he said his salary was four hundred thousand five hundred thousand or something like that he was doing quite well is as high as his band could be for where he was his duration in the company and he got to the point where he just took a step back and he says what value am i adding like what is it that I'm doing you know how am I actually creating value for society and I think that that was his main reason for getting out and just saying I'm doing something different so very interesting stories that's the thing that I really want people to take aways this book will definitely keep you entertained it was one of those books that when I'm driving in my car and I'm listening to this I get to where I'm going and then I continues to sit in the car to listen to the the rest of the chapter or I just get drawn in totally not all the books we read her like that some of them I can't wait to turn it off and get out of the car but for the most part I really like almost all the books we read but this was a pretty interesting one I think you'll enjoy it what other stories you guys think that you want to throw out I know you have quite a few talking points yeah I think that the whole interview process was extremely interesting so if anyone would like doubt this I would say the trading is really tough business and especially the interview was actually dreaded by a lot of people and what Michael Lewis does is that he talks about what is called the stress interview and apparently that's something that's used on Wall Street and and I've never heard about before weekend that he was asked to open a window at the beginning and at the interview and obviously this is a window that is filled shot so he can't open it and then the people just see how that candidate reacts under pressure that's the only intention of that or another thing that the did was that they wouldn't invite someone in there and just give him the silent treatment so they won't speak to him I don't completely ignore him and then see what he did and it's like but why you might be asking but again that's part of the culture and again to test you how do you react under pressure and I think that was I like that so I think it's a horrible story but I think was a really fun story too I kind of liked that part of the book I thought that that was hilarious so the best part I thought was the first story there where they said that they gave them the task of the guy comes in he's sitting there that the interviewee and the interview we're sitting there and the interviewer says open that window over there and it talks about the different how some guys go over they try to open it and they're just like well it's locked then they come back and sit down other guys continue to struggle and just try to muscle it open and they're there forever and they're not gonna sit down until they actually are able to open the window and it said that there was one gentleman that got a chair tried to break open the window with the chair and it's just I found the story hilarious and I think it was kind of neat to see how they were trying to test their personality to see what their endurance and and just personality was this book really put a smile on me because they were talking about the interview and how he was prepping for the interview and what he was saying was that you know you always get that question why do you want to be a traitor or whatever kind of job you might be applying for you will always ask why do you want to do this and he said that the one thing you can never say is that you're doing it because of the money so I just remembered like what I thought whenever I was Priven my first job interview in the trailer world and I remember speaking to my wife about this and I was still here well so Sophie should I be saying that's it's because of the money because trust me guys the money is really good whenever you're a trader as Preston also mentioned and it will go more into the conversation how that works but that was the big reason actually to to do this for me but again it just felt wrong for me to say wow I want to be trading your company and that's because I can make a lot of money I actually don't care about the rest like that would be the most horrible horrible answer you can give and the answer I came up with was it's true but only partially true it's because of the thrill of making its trade is so awesome then I can't help doing it something like that and that is what I said and I actually eventually got the job but the reason why it sounded so much fun whenever I read the book or whenever hurt the book was that Michael Lewis said apparently that is the golden answer you can provide on Wall Street you can never ever say doing the job because of money you have to say are you doing because you just love making good traits even though everyone knows that it's just a lie it's a lie just like liars poker now that's an interesting point I think that's a good highlight as well Stig what else did you have any other ones stick yeah well I think I want to talk about the conversation as well and first of all I should like to ask you a question Preston because one dilemma that he raises is that seulement brothers actually lost a lot of talent because they weren't willing to compensate the employees and compared to other Wall Street companies so he was talking about the best trailer they had he was making like 20 million dollar-plus like both years he were there and like his cut of that was a thing it was something like ninety thousand the first year which was like salary cap and then 175,000 the second year and Lewis was raising the question so how much is it really worth obviously it's not worth 20 million but how much is it worth because it's the company's the risk is company's money so I think I'll ask you Preston how much is someone worth if he can make say 20 million dollars for his company is money so I would think that it would be a function of how hard would it be to replace that person so if I can go off the street and take a trained monkey to basically come up with 20 million dollars just because he's sitting on something that has an enormous flow of cash flowing through the pipes that you can basically suck some of that off of I would think that I'd pay them not nearly as much as what some others would think that you would pay and it would be down where his salary was because there's no competitive advantage for that skill set I think that's really the the discussion here is what's the competitive advantage for that skill set that can sit in that seat and do that job do you really need to have an MBA from a warden or from Harvard in order to sit in that seat and conduct those trades or you just need to be a good bluffer and a good person has good interpersonal skills in order to develop the relationships and sell one thing here and buy it over here and just know the Delta between the Buy and the sell price so I think you need to have a basic introductory course but I don't think that that's something that you need to even go to a four-year college for necessarily I think that you could teach somebody that in a year and then move out so I guess that's where I would look at it first is the skill set and how qualified it is I mean this isn't brain surgery here you know what I mean it's just not it's not something you need to go to school for for 10 years that do affect so that's why I would say because I think a lot of people immediately here this guy made 20 million dollars so if you pay him a million dollars that's only 5% it'd be like a five percent royalty on everything he brings home I don't see it that way at all I see it as how hard would it be for me to replace this guy and pay somebody else to do exactly what he just did and so I think that that number is much lower than a million dollars I say you know a half a million dollars would probably even be a little high now the issue that you run into is let's say that you own that company or that big bank and that's your policy is to keep the prices down at that level and you're gonna have the flight of talent if you will within the community so it within your business so then you got to ask yourself say I make that decision and I push the price down and I hold to my guns and say you know what these people are replaceable and I can find this talent re-emerge somewhere else the thing that you have to ask yourself then is how do you basically retain this talent upfront that this would be the model that I would go to if I was you know one of the CEOs in this industry I would say I'm gonna do the hard work upfront I'm gonna send these people off to Harvard for free I'm gonna send these people to wherever I'm gonna pay for it hey upfront but what I'm gonna get in return is a contract that goes out to five ten years where they have to stay within the business with an automatic price model set now where you're assuming a lot of risk as the CEO and the owner of the businesses you might get a total turd that you're paying for to try to retain and you don't know that model yet so that's where these guys really have a tricky is I'm thinking through the thought process that stick through me on that on the hot seat that's my thought processes I'm going through this because it wasn't something that we had prepared or I knew that he's gonna ask me that so that's my thought process as I'm thinking through this and it's a very hard thing because let's say you brings say you don't want to do that model right off right out of the get-go because you don't know the the personality person and you bring this guy in for the first year and he's already performing and making you ten million dollars in the first year now you got a problem because he's not gonna want to stick around for ten years making 200k he's gonna run somewhere else so I think that's the hard thing is just the competitive nature of the business how many Sieber there opening and Wall Street but I definitely don't think some of these people deserve to be making you know a million dollars a year because they bring in 20 million I just I do not think that at all yeah I completely agree to you and I think it's a tricky discussion because I think when you reach that level like you literally wouldn't be any happier if you made already a hundred seventy-five thousand dollars a year it wouldn't marry if you got a million dollars instead so this is where I get a little frustrating I really apologize if there's people that are in this industry and they're listening to this conversation I apologize if you're offended by what I'm about to say but the thing that I really go back to is what's the value that's being created if I make twenty million dollars for the firm and it's all transactional cost its arbitrage okay so these guys are arbitrary the deal from one asset same asset going from one hand to the other hand what value am I really creating by transferring that from one person let's call person wide a person X what value did I just actually create I wouldn't say really all that much I just helped you know broker the deals all I did so is that worth you know hundreds of thousands of dollars the broker that deal that's kind of crazy if you really think about it is it's not like you're going and and helping them analyze the security the the valuation you're not going out looking at property and saying this is safe is it now you're just basically changing a couple keystrokes on the account so whenever I look at that value it is so lopsided and not really creating if anything it's creating drag for society it's creating dragon there's efficiencies there that need to be gained from a society standpoint in order to make this more effective so whenever I look at the value that's being created it really makes my eyebrow kind of go up like what in the world are we doing and that's where I've really got some major issues as well and I think that you know what I'm of the opinion that the universe will always work things out and it will always find efficiencies and that's gonna be a pretty dramatic thing for some folks and I think that maybe it might be a good thing but I'm curious that here if Stig agrees or you see it differently but the thing is really triggered discussion because when you are are you living in this world called Wall Street or trading whatever you just get other values and it's like things just change because you are really really in a bubble and it's at this upon a time and I think Mac Lewis also addresses that it's not about how much money you making for the sake of money it's more a way of keeping score and how you feel you've been treated then that you really need the money because you can still pay your rent and put food on the table for a family but I just wanna like tell you a brief story about something I experienced myself and I might look at myself today and think that I'm every calm person and I wouldn't fall off all of this and I also watched Wall Street back then and thought hey I could never be consumed by this industry but I actually did so whenever I started and this was just upon graduation I was offered a position as a trainee and I made something like I think they offered me something like sixty thousand dollars in like a base salary and obviously that's a lot of money but not as much money as you might expect in in trading and this is actually a fairly common said whenever you start out I think Michael Lewis he said that he made something like forty two thousand now admittedly this is also like two decades ago or 25 years ago but like you're based I'll read in the very beginning is really not that high and it's definitely not high compared to like the pressure they were under working as a trader but what's happening is that they will test you in the beginning they will test you and see how you handle the pressure like the games all that's going to happen and then they will work out your compensation based on how you perform and so for us there was something like six months after they would call you in and then you will negotiate your bonus structure so you would basically still have a somewhat low base salary but you will get a lot of bonus and company bonus and all of that and I was offered something like a hundred K more so I was again right out of college I were making something like a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year it might be slightly less here now with the dollar so strong but my head is spinning right now because I'm converting anything from Danish kroner and into dollars but and he's even accounting for the currency of devaluation yeah okay so I was making say 160,000 here and I vividly remember I went up to my boss just a month after that saying I want more I'm not satisfied with 160,000 and again why wouldn't I be but it was kind of like I have the feeling that someone got more I felt like I was making all these millions and millions again as Preston said you kind of do but it's for someone else's money and you can properly hire someone else to do it just as good as you but I was kind of feeling since I'm making so much money I should also have more money and so I think I said something like I know it's only been a few months but I would need at least $40,000 more and obviously that was declined because they would not negotiate new compensation packages like every two three six month or whatever and now then the thing about it it really doesn't make any sense why I would do that because my wife she also working as a trader back then we're living in a small 600 square foot apartment no kids so with two trailer salaries you might think hey they got everything they need but I was so unhappy for so long because it didn't get more because it wasn't about money it was about keeping score so whenever I read these stories and I'm thinking oh that you know how can he say I need more and why is it mind so important that he should just be satisfied with what he has I mean it happened to me and I think just as Preston mentioned whenever you are part of a culture that is so strong and you spent so much time there it's just so hard not to be caught in the middle of it and the thing that I got from the story steak and I in you watched Wolf of Wall Street I haven't seen the movie but I've heard different parts of it but the thing that I take away is that it's a reading ground for ego it just seems like the ego and these cultures are just crazy and when you're exposed to that either you develop an ego to combat the other egos or you just get eaten alive now the question I really got for you is who was a better trader you were Sophie that was definitely me she was probably a better trader than me just so everyone knows Stig's wife has a doctorate in economics so she's nobody's dummy when it comes to this stuff she could probably do a lot better job at the podcast than the two of us combined all right well that's all I have for the for the book I don't know if you have anything else you want the highlights thig no I think we pretty much got everything Corey I would highly recommend that I think you might have even said this present but I will highly recommend to all our listeners out there if they're considering a career on Wall Street to pick up this book even though it's old I think the whole thing about culture on Wall Street is something that you should be aware of before you start there and then just remember I would never ever punch fingers because I read all the books and watch all the movies and I still did all the same stupid things as all the other traders so it might not be helpful but I definitely think you should read this book alright guys so this is the point in the show where we're gonna take a question from a member of our audience and this question comes from Julian from Bucharest Romania my question is about US investors who are located in smaller developing countries with emerging markets I wanted to know why learning the lessons would you recommend to study invest in the local markets only also to consider bigger international markets like USA or UK with the risk of not understanding the whole context and culture of these foreign markets thank you guys yeah so I think it's a good question because like Julie and I live in a small country and I'm actually not that much invested in Denmark and there are a few reasons for that the one is that say that I want to invest in an index now biotech is like huge and then mugging because we don't have that many companies you really not that diversified if you like most people start to invest in indexes and I think that's something I don't know the Romanian stock market admittedly but I think it might be something you should also be looking at if you're comparing to S&P 500 in America and thinking well I'm probably diversified if I buy the national index another thing is that the selection of stocks is typically not that tempting for you if you live in a small country say Romania or something when there's not like where it's not a big country it's just like if you want to invest in say all companies they might just be two three four companies and it might be really really hard for you to compare with competitors so one thing is that you might have information that it's accessible for you specifically but it's really hard and it's really not that useful if you can't compare that to an industry and that's why I also typically favor American stocks because the information out there is just so much better now there are a few problems about investing in foreign markets like the US if you if you live in Europe for one thing it's typically more expensive so I would usually pay a fee there is I think three to four times as high whenever I'm buying American stocks I could imagine would be something similar for you Julian another thing is that if you invest in another country you might also be exposed to to currency risk so Julian the way I'm gonna answer this is really kind of to point you towards a book so there's this book called global value and this is by meb Faber and mAb is really good at value investing abroad and investing in international markets around the world so his book I think it's only $2.99 for his Kindle so there's a really cheap book that you can get if you have an e-reader if you want to read it on your computer that's where I would point you and what he's doing is he's basically teaching you how to do value investing in any country around the world and basically capitalize on low market values and also piggybacking on Stig's comment by using indexes in those countries so that's where I would point you or anyone else in the audience that's interested in doing that if you're not familiar with MEB Fabri we've talked about him a couple times on the show I know Toby knows them matt got this idea where why do I limit myself with value investing principles just in the United States why don't I look globally and say which country is offering me the best valuations why am I not funneling some of my capital into those and that's what his book is all about the name of the book is global value how to spot bubbles avoid market crashes and earn big returns in the stock markets the name of it so we'll have a link to that in the show notes if anyone's interested in looking at that book meb has a great talk at Google where he's talking about this approach by implementing value investing techniques internationally so what we'll do is we'll have that video in our show notes so after you're done listening to this if you want to pull up our website and go to the show notes we'll have that in there so you can listen to him talk about I think it's about a 30 minute talk at Google it's a tastic presentation it's you know completely free if you guys want to listen to that and get a glimpse of what he's talking about in this book
