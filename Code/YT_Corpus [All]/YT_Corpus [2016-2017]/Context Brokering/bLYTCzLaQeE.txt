 so I'm not exactly sure what have lovi n' trigger caused the lull but I'll stand up and offer an introduction right now I don't know if you like you know kept talking for another 15 minutes I probably would've waited it is my great pleasure to welcome Brian Phillips here as a part of the lecture series this year I had the privilege of meeting Brian back when I was teaching at Temple University we co-taught a studio third year research intensive studio operating in a way not dissimilar from RIT for this kind of urban scale research intensive studio where some fairly radical propositions came from forth brian is now teaching at Penn where he studied as a graduate student not so many years ago before that he was at Oklahoma studying there Brian is the founding partner within interface studio architects is a Hey there it is is A's work has been featured in 30-60-90 as featured and well architect architectural record his work has been making the rounds in architecture in it and I'm convinced that those of you in the audience will learn much just from his conversation today so I thank you for coming Brian I thank you for sharing your work with us and with great thanks God so Scott and I spend some time in the car today and the whole time we're talking and catching up I realized there were so many other things I wanted to say in other ways I wanted to say things just having been reminded about the way he thinks and learning more about your school and so I hope to be able to make you spontaneously include some of the thinking that I've you know thought about today on that front but one of the things that I wanted to be able to convey today is is this kind of maybe sisterhood between Philadelphia and Detroit and I think that you know I always enjoy being here and and and seeing a slightly different take on some of the same traumas that have sort of sort of characterized Philadelphia and I'm just kind of reminded and learned something about my home city when I'm when I'm here one of the things that and and I think this is kind of an interesting way to sort of start that is you know maybe these are both cities that have a bit of a chip on their shoulder in a way Philadelphia made even more than Detroit because whenever I'm here I realized that there were like spectacular things that happened sort of sometime and are about to happen again Philadelphia you know the city that through you know you know snowballs at Santa Claus and has done all kinds of has wonderful reputations for very current sort of issues this is a billboard that was on i-95 in the 70s and I think kind of characterizes you know a city that you know felt fell from its peak of two million people in nineteen fifty and today stands at about one and a half million people and actually we had our first population increase in the last census which has been sort of sort of major celebration for the city and has become a real Center for sort of young people and you know creative activity and just to give you a sense of the context of our office we kind of came on the scene right where there's that little uptick happening on the on the right hand side of that slide let me try through this position and and I think that we we've kind of sort of characterized our practice around being at the right place at the right time and and looking carefully at our home city and and we think learning from it and now beginning to export some of those ideas to other places so here's that here's that zone we opened in 2005 and so right around that sort of bottoming out is where we where we came onto the scene and Philadelphia during this this is sort of a zoom in here during this frame a lot of things were happening we had the housing bubble we had this profound uptick and young people moving to the city and of course real estate values you know rose and you can see sort of chugging along there a post post bubble but you can see the shift from the turn of the century to the present and this obviously created a lot of work for architects and I think also created a new awareness in the city of you know what it can be accorded a sort of sense of you know optimism about both the president in the future and I think this really was the springboard through which we we launched our our practice when I'm not in Detroit or in New York I like to characterize Philadelphia as a combination of those two cities in a funny way which is that in the hinterlands of the city in north philadelphia where a lot of the population loss occurred and a lot of the post-industrial trauma was felt you you see images like the right but the core of the city sort of particularly the core that's characterized as what's known as the the the like the third busiest downtown in America as far as pedestrian activity and density has moments of feeling like a very big city with a lot of density and and I think it's this combination of forces that that makes Philadelphia quite quite interesting as a lab and the physical form of the city takes this kind of character where on the left you're seeing the very large-scale CBD Comcast corporation is actually their main towers at the very top of that slide it's kind of running off the top they're actually building a second tower next to that designed by Norman Foster which is 72 stories or something and so there's there's quite a bit of sort of high density recent investment but the part of the city that that interests us and really got our start is what I like to call the flats which is this sort of three-story row house fabric what you're seeing on the right something like 450,000 row homes in Philadelphia and the density of those blocks is kind of amazing there's there's there's you know one hundred one hundred unit per acre you know density happening happening in those neighborhoods where the typical lot is sixteen by fifty feet which might be four times the density of the typical I think someone told me today 3500 is the standard lot so I think you can fit for those lots and one to try by so quite a bit quite a bit of density but what we kind of came to and what still characterizes a large portion of the city is this sort of fabric where and as for the Detroiters you can appreciate this that's not all a bunch of parks that's vacant land and so while the fabric still kind of hangs together with the row houses there's a lot there's a lot of open territory for redevelopment and I think right around the fringe I mean a lot of our early work like I can't I can't point to this but the right around the CBD where the three-story fabric meets the city which is kind of the leading edge of development an awful lot of construction has happened there and that's also where the main industrial rain was as well so there was a fair amount of vacant land there so just a couple of thoughts before I jump into the work these are just kind of three unlike the words I'm saying which are little off-the-cuff these are some written precise words about the way we think and I think we've out of the gate partly because we opened our office a few years before the housing bubble which meant that like everybody got laid off in 2008 and one and you know so I think a lot of firms have had to think about how to do things other than buildings and I think that led us to carrying a good deal about buildings but also caring about teaching and caring about you know curation and experiments and special initiatives and I think for us it's about there are many ways to influence the built environment and the cities around us and just making buildings as shortchanging are sort of potential for that influence we're also really interested in systems and infrastructures and prototypes I mean I think we're slightly less interested in very precious singular acts of architecture and more interested in you know you know topologies and designs that we think of as sort of being repeated and we always like to talk about things that if you moved it to a different site which to some architects is horrifying you can never move that to a different site it's for this site we like the idea of thinking about how that idea would adjust itself to that site we also love sharing our logic with our clients and the people around us and we're not really into the alchemy side of the mysterious or the design process but like to share the process and allow sort of stakeholders to become a part of it and we actually find it it kind of radicalizes projects one just once sort of people buy into the reasoning and then finally this idea of urbanism which I think it's at the core of what we're doing and and one of the reasons why I like Detroit in particular is that you come to Detroit and you have to sort of recalibrate your definition of urban there are a lot of areas of the city that may not look like a city but our urban because they have history and infrastructure and the kinds of relationships for us this last sentence Society of brokering complex and contested relationships in different ways relative to different contexts is our way of thinking about if you're doing that you're probably operating in an urban situation so also as a result of my conversation with Scott I added slides at the end which you know it was probably not a great idea and I try not to be one of those lectures that goes on forever so I tend to talk to how so I'm really going to try to respect your time but I'm also going to try to talk about a lot of stuff so so and hopefully well this this is designed that at any point I can kind of I can kind of break off when people start leaving so I'll pay attention to that but these are the five different lenses through which we see our work at this point and we'll go through these in order and infill being cut up back filling the city regeneration being about renovation and Riaan happening on things deployment about light layers of tactical things export is our mission to push these ideas to other cities and reflect gets a bit to this idea of non building experiments and curation as a way to think about our work I know it sounds like a lot so our office is where that pink crosses there plus sign and many of our early projects were actually right in our own backyard and this was the opening slide and this is one of the few early projects I still like to talk about because we're still learning from it and I think is really defined some of the philosophical ideas about our practice it's called Hunter K house and this developer we work for a lot of private developers and because they build cities and we have to figure out a way to influence them and make them do good things work with them to do good things and this person initially was like let's build the biggest greenest houses we can imagine let's make some money we were like okay it was our first year of practice maybe second year of practice and one night he called me and said wait I want to build houses that all these young people moving to Philadelphia can buy so these lots were zoned for three storey 2,000 square foot houses and he came out of the gate saying 100 bucks a square foot LEED Platinum thousand square feet and we said that's a terrible idea we're not gonna do anything for that but it taught us so much about this idea of kind of minimalism and you know simplicity and a kind of pragmatism about how to make a building and so we found ourselves thinking less about how do we make a cool building that we make cheaper and more about how do we fundamentally rethink the way we conceive of a project and so we really obsessed about every little move the initial projects were four corners very flat that's a picture the developer with his family in the first house extremely Spartan IKEA kitchens exposed concrete radiant floor you can see the plywood finishes I think this house was built for a hundred and five thousand dollars which in our terms is very when I came to Detroit the first time people were like that's too expensive to bail here although we do think there's some version of the play ball here and you know we called these urban cabins they this original house had two doors the front door in the bathroom door we were talking a little bit today about the challenges of mortgages and appraisals and one of the funny things about these houses is we've done some subsequently where we actually had to put walls in for closing to show closed bedrooms and then they'd get ripped out which is a whole other conversation but I think it's an interesting subtext to innovation and different layers of other things that affect buildings and so part of our challenge was like what do you do on flat simple walls and so I think all the facades you're seeing here are fiber cement here we silk-screened on these with sort of t-shirt type silkscreen technology we love the idea of house tattoos which we also think play well in Detroit we haven't quite moved mcc's Perriman to get back to you because we like this idea of housing as consumer products that are fun and are more like shopping for other things than then you know houses which tend to be a constraining transaction I think this was a $5,000 add to the project we used one screen we flipped them around extremely sort of simple and you know deployment the original houses were built out of sips panels which are highly insulated you can see you can see the insulation sandwich there between between OSB one of the interesting dynamics that's worth sharing with you is that a lot of our work is not built by custom contractors one of the ways you build a house for hundred dollars a square foot is not your cleverness it's the fact that the contractors willing to even entertain the idea that his profit is is that a different level so these guys the system enols came out and these guys were very confused by what they were doing and so that's a real hurdle and one of the funny things about this project so these two stories sips if you just think this through relies very heavily on the plumbness at the top of the foundation so there's a little bit of at this level of contractor there's always a little bit those panels when they got stacked would reveal some two-inch sort of separations at the top and these are passive house level insulation so that was an interesting sort of struggle to to you know resolve which was like resolved in the field but it's just this issue of like cost and contractor and technology aligning is always a challenge we actually wound up doing and we continue to do this we like the idea of using double stud walls because they're really easy to deal with you can bid them to any contractor in town everybody knows how to build it and the pricing actually has been has been quite quite good and there was also a philosophy with this builder prefab is a whole other conversation but this builder was very this this developer was very interested in building local economies and jobs and so that he'd loved the idea of having guys from Philadelphia out here building the houses and not having them built off-site so this really has gotta come together in a nice way all of these buyers elected to roll $15,000 into their mortgages to put solar panels on the roof and I think this goes back to this idea of what kinds of houses are young people buying and what are their values and what are they willing to spend money on that maybe their parents weren't and so this was an interesting experiment in that so I did mention prefab and this is another kind of formative sort of project for us which was a recession project conceived of just on the back end of the bubble and was a prefab project was you can kind of see this is another sort of infill site a lot larger I think this footprint was was upwards of twenty thousand square feet this was a four-story 72 unit student apartment building near temple and was conceived out of the gate as being prefab modular this developer was really interested in experimenting with that you can see the straightforwardness of the plan and part of our understanding about sort of prefab technology which we embraced is that you want to work as much as they tell you they can do anything you want to work to their system because the moment they start not doing what they're used to doing it gets expensive they don't understand fire separation there's a whole series of things that happen so we really embrace the idea that these boxes are going to be simple there's a shot of the side of the building the building was clad in the field I have some images here of the construction I'll just say something about sorry this is a little random but I just want to say something about it Philadelphia green roofs Philadelphia has a really aggressive stormwater law that requires the first inch of rain to be managed on-site so what's happened is we get what we like to call ugly green roofs which we kind of love which are these they're not they're not there to be you know an amenity as much as they're just there to really be a sponge and so this actually was the largest Stephen green roof in Philly when the project was finished here's how the building was built there's a if you go to our website there's a video where you can see this is being recorded right you can see the ocean law has been violated by the guys some of these boxes that are hanging up there and part of it's just this is a very this technology at this scale at this time in Philly was was a sort of brand new idea and one of the interesting things was you know it happened very very fast the whole building was built in nine months and what was really interesting as you'll kind of see that here the site work was being done on top while the boxes were being built in a factory in the middle row and then they all came together on the bottom there and the 72 units I think everything was was was a modular box the stairs the lounges I think it was 90 boxes and they would set about eight or ten a day so if you do the math the building appeared of nothing in about two weeks which is kind of an extraordinary thing but then what's interesting is all the seams with the boxes coming out with finishes and kitchens and bathrooms in them and then everywhere the box has come together you have to go in and finish so it's a very different idea about building it's a lot of room for innovation there because we're used to building buildings and layers where all the plumbing all the drywall all the tile goes in this was more these sort of chunks that are complete with these seams that kind of need to be need to be unfilled so this is a more recent project which I thought we kind of fun to share this is a this is a very quirky weird site that's 60 at 15 feet wide and 100 feet long and that's an elevated train line and we find ourselves loving these kinds of sites and our idea for this was this is in a zoning class that had some funny requirements and allowed you to go up to 55 feet had this funny requirement for a cornice line at 25 feet and so we kind of we became very interested in these bands of buildings that kind of accumulated over time you can kind of see us sort of drawing these little profile lines there at the bottom and so really we saw the profile of the building as an expression of the of the kind of constraint to the site and so we kind of used that line to sort of develop you know the membrane and what was interesting is those sloped pieces were able to create some terraces and and one of the things we had to convince our client of who was really he of course he bought a cheap piece of land next to a train line and his whole thing was like how do we make it feel like you're not living next to a train and we were like well we're kind of thinking maybe you should just go with it so we had these terraces that are actually like right on the Train and while you hear the train go by it's kind of an exhilarating experience so you can kind of see the left side is the back of the building and the right side is the front that really you can see that cornice basically I mean I want to say it's eight or ten feet from the edge of the line and so it's it's almost done this is an under construction but you know this is the the are world of getting these buildings done is that pickup truck like these guys are building these buildings and one of the things we take some pride in is finding ways of taking very everyday projects where you know this guy came to us with to measure my words in case he watches this he really came to a thinking you know this is this is you know I'm here to make some money and I have this train line and he ended up doing this really fun interesting building that he eventually took real ownership out of and of and and has really been an advocate for making sure that everything gets done the way we asked for and I think that we take great pride in turning it goes back to this getting developers to collaborate on building the city well and I think it's a very exciting pursuit for us so I think this project kind of comes out of the hundred K house DNA we're starting to look at whole blocks now and I actually think it's kind of it's really funny just to talk a little bit about style I mean when we first proposed the cyan paint to our client he was like that's gonna stick out like a sore thumb I mean how are you possibly gonna paint that building and the reason I love this photo is sometimes you look at it and don't quite see the building because South Philadelphia is so bananas with its circus of porches and funny materials and so one of the things we enjoy is really contributing to the sort of fabric of the city and kind of amplifying or over amplifying the context to a point that it feels radical but actually is just very much in keeping with what's going on this is a collection of buildings that are two storey row houses three-story row houses the bottom right corner there is a commercial first floor with two flats above and you know and and you can see we're actually using drivable grass in the middle where cars can park but if everybody decides not to park there they can they can have a party kids can go out and play so there's some flexibility and how that how that space gets used kind of get a sense there of the kind of massing and scale and there you can kind of see the different sort of building types that are happening the sort of row house models on the top and bottom of those plans and then the the condo flats there in the in the in the middle this is a little further along in this at this point but again you get a sense of its metal that's hardiplank that's filled painted a lot of a lot of modesty and the material palette just I think a nice willingness on the part of our clients to let us do our thing and so Rufe yards and access is a big deal in philly particularly for providing off street parking that the sites are small so so these roof experiences become you know significant and what's interesting is you know here you can see so this was a project subject to the stormwater law and so green roofs become a way to meet it and so what's interesting is you know again these are going to get a little a little prettier through time but they can be hard to walk on if you're if you walk on a green roof that green roof suddenly has to get a lot thicker and a lot more robust so this is basically trench grade on some sleepers and so that's a way for us to get some walkable space up there for you know very little investment still keeping the management as opposed to the expensive roof so these are just some of the things that we play with to achieve some of these goals so I'm kind of working up in scale this is currently going through approvals and is a much bigger project which is pretty pretty close to the center it's one of the the bigger pieces of ground left this close to to the city large scale developer dedicated to this being prefab modular which is kind of interesting and I think the the thing worth talking about here is this interesting courtyard condition that we're sort of presented with and the client frankly came to us with the idea that they thought that should be a courtyard and of course we went back to them and said well let us study it and we spent some time and we came back and said yes we think it should be a courtyard - after we couldn't get some other things to make sense but what was interesting about this courtyard is and if you look at the different street sections there the different sides of the courtyard have different very different streets and different kinds of you know building typology x' across across the street and so we had this idea that the courtyard was kind of responsive and even though it has that even though it's sort of Laura I think it's a 70 units a where it sort of stands now we kind of liked the idea of the courtyard presenting a different sort of personality to these to these different frontages and and I think the big victory here for us was you know the starting point of course was the left which is the courtyard needs to be cordoned off and it's going to be parking and it's going to be private and there's a park across the street and I think in our mind this project is big enough that I mean Philadelphia is a city of very delicate urban components with lots of sort of pedestrian amenities and very walkable and so we were able to convince them that not only should this become three different buildings with gaps but we should actually start to perforate the first floor so that people can use this as a sort of cut through and so what we began to think about was the idea that we would remove these boxes sort of a modular system and all the buildings are obeying the 16-foot wide grid and so we can kind of push and pull pieces and go from single family to multifamily pretty easily but the idea would be that you can get some higher pieces on so we're gonna omit some boxes but ultimately we're gonna get the same number of total boxes because we're gonna put them on top we didn't quite do that but we're somewhere in between but they really embrace this idea of the pass-through and so the kind of social life of the project on the Left you're seeing a way through from the street on the right you're seeing one of these quarters that's created within the courtyard that leads you out and then on the right and you're seeing the study of the roof deck which is created when we put boxes on top and create these gaps so the idea that there's a lot of private space in the project but there's a lot of shared space and also just a sort of idea of block making so this is the sort of courtyard that were that we're conceiving of and one of the really interesting things about it too is this whole process of there's certain amenities in Philadelphia that I mean Yards small yards or something that people hold dear and one of the things we had a interesting conversation about with our client is the fact that the site's not going to support Yards the way some sites will so rather than forcing that on a site that doesn't need it let's let's conceive of a more social backyard space where it's really more of a terrace and when people are barbecuing you know they can they can decide to eat together they're gonna see their kids can it's almost like a promenade we're gonna see your neighbors in kind of a classic way and they really sort of embraced that this idea that you kind of make the most of the site presented and we're excited about about that potential and so here you can kind of see this sort of geometry of the modular which is 16-foot divisions which become both single families and multi families and then at these knock will be called knuckles you see one at the bottom you see a couple near the bottom you see one at the top those are actually larger single-family homes some of which could be seven eight nine hundred thousand dollars but what's interesting is in this project of sixty-six units you're gonna have three large expensive houses you're gonna have 40 or thirty more modest houses and then you're gonna have a bunch of 600 square foot flats which might be one hundred thousand dollars right which in Philadelphia is kind of untouchable so the idea here is actually to make a community showing the total bandwidth of the current market and we're excited about that it's kind of an unusual thing to find in a single project and so binding that with this courtyard idea was quite important so here's here's one of the corners of the project you can kind of see some of those fourth floor boxes now they've been placed on top a whole host of different opportunities for sort of outdoor space and balconies this is a corner so the park is across the street and I don't know if you can quite appreciate the narrowness of the street to the right but you know that that cart way might be nine feet wide so it there really and you can kind of see how that frontage doesn't have as many projections and the first floor setback so we had a lot of debate about how continuous the courtyard should be and how much diversity and this is kind of where we've landed with this sort of wall building that wraps wraps the whole block and then you know just looking at how the sixteen foot so the dimension works the top is there's a lot of you know Philadelphia row homes that kind of operate that way and you can kind of see the kitchen there in the back which we anticipate being on that rear we're Terrace area and then access to the roof at the top the multifamily buildings use the same so we kind of fit these buildings into the same sort of dimensional you know component the sixteen feet where we're getting we're getting apartment flats that kind of fit into the space of those single-family homes and what's interesting is the client as they refine their pro forma can kind of mix and match the number of apartments versus the number of single families it just goes back to context and I'm not gonna spend too much time talking about this but we are getting access to some slightly more maybe maybe that's what's kind of different here but this is a different part of the city this is more in town this is kind of the South Street is the is perennial II kind of a hipster area but a like 80s punk rock kind of hipster area not the not the not the kind that are making coffee out in kind of neighborhoods a more classic version and so it's kind of interesting that this block we're doing an apartment building on South Street and then some large homes on the back and the building is kind of conceived which is I'm hoping the proportion of that Israel compress from here but this kind of language of sort of metal cladding and the kind of transparency of the balcony is it's kind of interesting it's got a bit of a Bourbon Street feel where like it's cool to come out but you want to be a little bit protected because you're not quite sure what might be going on there and then this is something we've been this is a little bit like a last project that I kind of showed is we've been really intrigued by projects that got big enough where you're addressing I mean in Philadelphia you might be addressing different neighborhoods on different sides of a block so on south street you've got the terraces and the kind of nightlife promenade and then literally on the back side of the block you have a 15 foot wide neighborhood street and so thinking about how blocks can get completed in that way these are there's some sort of particularly nice units on top that have these access ways to the roof or your the outside this is kind of the ground-level experience at retail this is a retail you know quarter and then the roof experience is up that exterior stair looks like this and you know it's interesting that this building the top two units are actually quite expensive and maybe have people living in it that you wouldn't expect and then there's other kinds of people living in the building and I think that's also relates to that last project of these projects that seem to have some diversity and in that and I just I just I just popped these in because it's getting close to being done there I apologize for the quality of photography but gives you a sense of what what the build is looking like so that's almost done the other scale and the thing I'm gonna talk about here I think is very programmatic is this idea that this was a project that we looked at from the micro housing standpoint and that's a term I'm sure you guys have heard which is really I think coming out of markets like in New York and Boston in San Francisco where things are so expensive that scale becomes a way to get access to certain areas of the city Philadelphia's not that town you can generally go around the corner and find something that's affordable so it was interesting about this project for us was thinking about micro housing as a Philadelphia specific idea and for us it actually became much more about a lifestyle and this idea of shared and flexible we were very interested in this post-college pre family period of life which I would characterize in places like Philadelphia is this incredible number of people between 25 and 35 that are working that are being entrepreneurial that are opening that are looking for a different kind of housing situation and we think that's quite an interesting possibility for buildings like this and so just a couple things to sort of point out as I talk I mean we love these kinds of catalogs of things and we call this the periodic table of micro units the x-axis is width and the y-axis is length and then we would just as we this goes back to client transparency like this is the kind this is a meeting we have with our client where we just basically say as you begin to enlarge and tweak the scale of these units these are the different things that happen and to talk through what's possible and that dotted line area is the sweet spot of they're the size of unit they thought they wanted so then we go from that to being able to kind of say okay let's look at how that works and what's interesting about this site is we had far more allowable height than we had fer which means that we had additional vertical sort of possibility which led to this idea of the mezzanine which is less than one-third of the total area of the unit isn't a floor so that led to this sort of verticality and the units and we experimented a little bit with how those might work and then we were really interested in the the defining characteristic of this building really was this idea of shared spaces and this idea that like the you know the laundry bar the co-working space the commercial kitchen which is where you'd host your dinner party instead of your unit this idea that the lifestyle of the building is you're paying for a bed and a small private space but there are all these shared components of the building but a lot of people to to achieve this sort of lifestyle that you see playing out in the urban fabric of a lot of a lot of big cities at the moment and and a little piece of a little nod to the Philadelphia neighborhood fabric which is this little of this idea of the hallway stoop where you get this little out this little hallway side niche to kind of hang out and these hallways become a little bit more like streets and then that's think that's the context of that project with one at one of the thoughts to you is you know retail on the first floor and then the second floor is this makerspace co-working space that really is also a kind of condenser for both the neighborhood in the city but also the people living there this is I wanted to share this because this is on the boards now and we're super excited about it and really represents the kinds of challenge this goes back to the project next next to the next to the rail line I think and projects on designed by just want to point out the site the site is that is the I don't know my laser pointer here but if you if you see that SUV turning to the right there's a car parked on our site it's 12 feet wide and it's literally like right on the edge of Chinatown and what was amazing is we got a buy-rite zoning permit for this I mean we were all laughing that this could possibly happen that we could meet the zoning code explicitly we did so we're super excited about it and really the thought here was how do you maximize the scale of a 12-foot wide site this is a section investigation and so you know the idea was well we should use the basement we should create by levels we should do the mezzanine track we were talking about before to get more verticality without adding a floor and then there was this idea of in Philadelphia you're able to project off a facade three feet so we kind of were putting all these things together and kind of develop this little little way for building units actually aren't that crazy look at them but so this kind of gives you a sense of the of the scale it's actually like a skyscraper it has the proportion of a very tall building even though it's not that tall we don't think this will all be wood frame sadly but here you get a sense of what the spatial this just kind of goes through the section of the building and you can kind of see ways that we're looking to kind of grab extra space and maybe occupy the site and you know someone expected ways one of which is to make the basement feel like a reasonable place to live and I think I think we're getting there and so yeah so here you kind of get a sense of what the units are like there's a single stair in the center of the building the basement levels at the bottom which actually is turned out to be a pretty reasonable one but the typical units upstairs are that kind of first floor kitchen office with a bathroom and then I sort of mezzanine that you sleep on I think I think these are in the well you can see here 344 square feet it's a fun site I mean we haven't really designed it but this is kind of what its gonna this is the proportion of the building and we're also pretty excited about the fact that from this funkin highway it's going to really be a quite a prominent sort of experience so you know this falls into the category of kind of weird leftover sites that we really enjoy working on and and and I think you know our move about this and it goes back to that other project is if you're able to kind of Matt if you can prove maximum value you can generally get this conversation to go forward and to get and to get good real estate developers to embrace the idea that was the longest category by the way I just so that was you guys are like oh my god I remember there were that was by far the longest category what's my what's my cut time I have my clock and I can do it every time alright so again I just want to start with a sort of formative project and then we'll look at some more recent stuff so the granary which was a firestorm for us for a number of reasons but we also learned so much from this project and this this is very interesting it's it's a it was actually the first example of slip form concrete in the US which is why it's on the Historic Register and was really smack dab in the middle of Philadelphia industry and actually the site where it says industrial works there on the left is where the Barnes Foundation is that was recently built for that collection so now this area of the city is completely transformed but just building remains and it was built in the 1860s out of wood if you didn't know grain is highly explosive it blew up was rebuilt in the 1920s as this concrete building and then when the grain silo when the grain transfer point and infrastructure changed the building went basically into sort of disuse and in the 80s there was a kind of eccentric designer who had his office on the bottom and a legendary party penthouse on top which is often the kind of uses that these buildings fall sort of victim to and you know so we were very interested in how do you put this building back to work and the idea was to build housing on top as you see on the sort of future side and we measured the amount of housing you could put on top by thinking about what the grain probably weighed and said okay so that's the foundation for the building and the cool thing is is that an urban area sometimes people like to get up high and have views and so our foundation was starting at floor nine so the first floor of construction had created views and then what was interesting is these these grain silos that there were 72 of these these crazy vertical storage compartments and the idea really was to reuse those as galleries and for environmental sort of purposes I mean we figured we could we could store stormwater coming off that building and like one in one of those for like the entire year they were so fast we talked to our MEP engineer about the middle cells could almost be like earth ducks because the temperature was so insulated from the outside and there'd be some great thermal transfer and then the idea of galleries and and sort of other things and you know the climbing wall there and the for the for the residents but this really for us was a really important project in thinking about history and an understanding and I think this is very relevant to Detroit in the sense that Philadelphia is a city with like an embarrassment of old buildings that just don't have a life like there's no market to regenerate them and and I think this idea of taking more aggressive clever approaches to them is important like here like the so when this project ultimately died on the back of quote this building is as important as City Hall which we were baffled by from a head-start perspective but our pole position was the building was built to do work and should continue to do work but I think what really set them off was deciding that the penthouse is in that glass box we're kind of living among the ornamental detail the top of the building which you could no longer see from the outside but I think again for us the the thinking was you know how do you how do you really in a in a not in a sort of boutique where or relying on some museum to move in it care of the building in a in a non economic way so to make this work so climbing wall and and mushroom farming was really the final proposal didn't go forward but but I'll say later in the reflect section which isn't as far away as you think talk about how that's spun off a research project and seeing that that relationship between sort of speculation and architecture and that so this is this is a reuse we're doing right now and it's kind of interesting it's there's a six-story existing warehouse in the middle and then we're building houses around it I think you know I'm realizing again this falls into the category of a whole block that transforms itself as it gets different sort of frontages and so one of the things that so our that's the the building with the water tower is the one that we're renovating and then the houses flanking it are the ones that were proposing and one of the things that we did was we really enjoyed this idea of the the warehouse Street wall and so that's actually 25 townhouses and this is kind of a narrow street that has a certain type ology in the wider Street has a bigger one tons of under construction photos just because I wanted to be able to share that with you but this is about where it is it's a little further along than this you know but that's the narrower Street that has these terraces that come out and you can kind of see that the front doors are pushed back this is the busiest tree the facade flattens out the first floor is buffered from the street with some program so this idea of this kind of block transforming this is the existing building that we're working on and really that existing building has really awesome bones and we're just kind of whitewashing the interior and putting some kitchens and bathrooms in and so that combination of existing building and new construction completing the block I think is the story here and very interested in it's funny because we were having this conversation about do you do return Detroit to its existing fabric and I think some like some laugh was like hell no it's why're a lot of people and a lot of but in this particular situation which is a highly gentrifying part of the city returning the fabric that back alley is a horror show right now and our argument to the neighborhood was like we want a front houses on an alley it was obvious that people wanted to put parking back there and we really stood by the idea that we should just complete that holiday because that is part of what makes the neighborhood awesome so it's a exciting project for us as far as its kind of urban fabric this may be my most relevant Detroit project this is a historically registered building at Philadelphia this was like the first parking in Philadelphia it's like every building is the first something and that's a bit frustrating sometimes like the first parking garage associated with a railroad company or something and that's what's that's what and there's the railroad company but literally we found this building without a roof I mean this is that Instagram is the our first sort of site visit and so the proposal is just to build a neighborhood inside this building and leave the roof off the National Park Service battle on this was absolutely because they're trying to get tax credits of course and the idea of like we had to retain the roofline and all kinds of things so the building actually doesn't sort of come above the outer wall but this is getting built in a related form but you know this was kind of the idea that you're basically taking that shell of a building and you're you're using it as a platform for something new and I think this is very much like the granary project where you know here's a bit of history and our solution to it is based on current economics and not aspirations to return to something that doesn't exist anymore and I think on that basis we're extremely excited about this about this model or this sort of system or prototype this is more of a campus kind of thing that we're working on which is an old chemical campus cell basf research campus outside of Philadelphia and the idea here is simply to like return this is a kind of incremental project where it's not about restoring every building to its former glory but it slightly enhancing some kind of components of it and so you can kind of see here with color and annotation and gave in a very subtle way this creating of an urban space where there might not be an urban space and this little alley is super important to us and having that moment of creating you know vibrant creative workspace there's a brewery that we're working with on the left there that there's gonna be that kind of tenant but it's kind of interesting because this is what it looks like now and I think there was this it was difficult for people to understand how this could be urbanized and I think actually it's it's been an interesting sort of experience to think about it and really on this kind of building which you know is doesn't need a whole lot of work the idea here is not to spend tons of money renovating the whole building but to kind of let the existing building sit and just begin to modify some of the some of the components to be able to develop a kind of language around all these buildings so the lobby gets impacted but the back office of these buildings kind of remains this is a related project for Rodale press it's the largest women-owned publishing company in the United States I think a little bit north of where we are it's kind of interesting they're based in New York and here and it's very expensive to do photoshoots and to do some of the work they do in New York cities so they wanted to create a kind of creative hub in this existing warehouse which is pretty unremarkable at the moment but the idea is to kind of they're very interested in food and sort of Test Kitchen stuff and so the proposal really is to kind of remove you can see there's a funny you might be able to equate these images now we're removing the the funny entry chunk to create a courtyard which opens up a new social space and so there's photography and a little overnight accommodation and a Test Kitchen that is gonna create this sort of incubator for I mean you know Maria Rodale talks about Emmaus becoming Portland and I think we're not holding our breath on that but the idea that they see this relatively modest renovation project is something that can become a seed for the transformation of a neighborhood we find we find really interesting and then so that's looking back out from the Test Kitchen to the plaza see that was pretty quick right so I think now so you know the deploy work is this lighter layer which we become pretty interested in and this is a public seating sort of project we did and just goes to like local the budget for this was twenty thousand dollars like done we had to bring the benches out they were expecting to get one we gave them three they were really happy about that but the idea here was simply that you know if you develop a new kind of public seating like you want to to look like a seat like it can't be so different that people don't sit on it but the idea was to be able to create a kind of social comfort among people and so that's this delicate balance between being able to feel like you have your own space but also being sort of proximate enough to other people in a comfortable way to want to engage was was built with local local craftsmen and fabricators and devised in a way they can come apart easily and get and get moved all sort of fits together and sort of three pieces which are geared toward the way that the Union got the maximum laid at Union guy can carry with a friend all these rules we managed to solve that here it is going together this this is the main train station in Philadelphia and I think you know it really so it was kind of here and it was used in a certain way and then this was it in a neighborhood park in Philly and and this was not staged this was just us showing up and people wondering why we were taking their picture but you know really heavily used and actually you know I don't I don't really capture all the crazy things that happened but we had an Instagram feed and we saw things on these benches that you know were unspeakable but was really interesting it was interesting just as a kind of social infrastructure for the city and I think may have I think I think it may have worn out by now I think it was in year three and you when the large dogs were running over top of it and Taichi was happening in strange places on it but I think we really got excited about the kinds of impacts you can have in small ways and then this is maybe a more formalized I think similar idea and we love these assignments where someone has a crazy notion and we test it Philadelphia is full of tactical urbanism and full of beer gardens and it seems like when the weather is good you can sell beer anywhere and so this guy was like I want to take existing surface parking lots and build a platform and put beer gardens on them because a lot of these surface parking lots in town are in these amazing canyons with buildings around them and his idea was we can really monetize this space so really the proposal was this kind of system where the platforms actually off-the-shelf technology from this company in Cleveland I think the bar and the restrooms are in you know containers and it's sort of a strategy for being able to deploy this on a seasonal basis and really again gets this idea of sort of prototypes and thinking about sort of systems of occupation and what was kind of fun was you know speculating a little bit about this added value idea that you know there's a there's a beer garden on top of parking and is there a benefit both ways and so we're thinking about doing a summer you get shaded parking you can charge a little bit more for the parking there might be the risk that you get some beer spilled on your car we'll see how that might go but and and this was our exploration of like the the beer drinking experience on top and the car parking experience on the bottom but I think we're we have a number of really interesting assignments coming up this renovation of an existing pier on the river that's being conceived it as this kind of crazy makers face market and beer garden and another project we're looking at is is doing a large-scale tactical installation that proceeds a large private development which is really fascinating that it's like a billion dollar 10-year build and they're like look the first season we want to get people on the site and make a space a public space for the community and maybe that lives on as the project gets built around it and one of the things we're thinking about there is actually playing around with the ongoing construction as a kind of sort of visual for for the community space we talk a lot about this sort of permanent temporary work which at which I think has it has it has a lot of application here as well and so some of this work and I am gonna show a Detroit idea you're gonna get to that some other cities were working in my new partners in Boston we have some projects going on up there so client from Chicago flew to Philly and said I'd like these hundred K houses let's do some some houses in Chicago and so we've been doing some work out there this is a 31 unit project that is based on the there's not that many attached houses in Chicago actually but we this was kind of this was like a half a block project a little bit like so some version of what we did in Philly and you know I think the comment here I mean beyond it being having a lot of hundred K characteristics and being energy efficient even though it didn't seem to be a priority for him but we said Bob just do a blower door test just let's just let's just pay the hundred bucks for the blower door test and the infiltration rate on these houses is lower than some of our lead gold houses in Philly and it's just partly because Chicago contractors are we bit better I think because it's all you know in the end it's all about the tightness of the envelope and so that was kind of interesting but really this project was just about like how do you know if this thing's getting built for $115 a square foot right that's hardiplank we worked with the contractor to make sure we could get that detail to work we looked at some photos and so you can kind of see some similarities here with the open plan from from some of the filming projects but definitely has a kind of Chicago you know sensibility about it stairs are often places in these buildings where we were able to add a little bit of value this is our riff on the Chicago 3 flat and I think what was interesting about this is we were this kind of goes back to the Chinatown thing a little bit with the finding the basement level I have a somewhere but basically the courtyard that courtyard has excavated so there's windows in the basement level where you walk out from the basement and you can kind of see the units or sort of design with a living side and a side now there you go so there's roof deck there's terraces and there's this sort of sunken courtyard and you can kind of see the the missing sort of triangle site there and there you can get a sense of what that experience is like down in that down in that courtyard which actually makes that basement unit really really terrific interiors a lot of a lot of the same sort of aspirations from our work so in Boston this was a competition to do housing that produces more energy than it uses and this was a mayor's initiative and one of the things that we we learned in Philadelphia with energy efficient housing is that it's all about envelope that you can by insulating a house well an air sealing a house well you can take 80% of the energy out of the house it was funny about this challenge and we've become very skeptical of Net Zero because we feel like if everything was 80% better well I've done so much more than having a few Net Zero projects but because you get into conversations about to go to Net Zero or net energy positive you're gonna need solar panels and we literally had a conversation once with a client about to cut down the trees on the side to make sure that you get the solar exposure to meet the challenge of whatever you and so you get into these wild conversations anyway what was interesting about the project is we kind of took this envelope idea that this is a double stud wall project with lots of insulation I think I think we were approaching like are 65 and these in these reef assemblies and basically it was like how much PV do we need to get over the hump and I think of a diet so you can kind of see the sort of nature of the site here and you can see the solar panels on the roof pretty extensive but at one point we actually thought we'd be wrapping the whole back of the house with PV and we're kind of happy that we were able to keep it on the roof and you can see that that actually revealed the opportunity for terraces in the back which I think you can see here so you know and the the you can kind of get a sense that the sort of geometry of the roof was you know calibrated to the sort of solar angle there's a sort of stack effect ventilation strategy and this is apparently in a pretty challenging neighborhood in Boston we could never really see it but but this was seen as there's a massive affordable housing shortage in Boston and so they're very interested in figuring out how to provide new housing types that both sort of save energy but also hit a certain kind of price plan these are price points beyond what philadelphians and Detroiters know is affordable but it's a different different market but you can see a lot of the same sort of strategies deployed here that we're deploying other places and as much as we want to believe that design is such a big part of high-performance buildings this is where it happens and in a way like making sure that these guys you can see that double stud wall this hadn't this had blown-in insulation what this guy is doing here in the middle picture is incredibly important which is to just button up so the potential areas for there to be an air exchange and these house has ended up you have an image of it here it's kind of cool actually Northeastern University is actually tracking the performance of these houses and the Green Line if you follow the Green Line that shows you where there's net net positive energy being being you know produced and all four of these houses have been doing doing quite well of course the infill houses are doing better because they have less exterior wall and this is a this is our current project in Boston that's going through through review and I'll just I just want to talk about context again because it's something that we're really and and thinking about how to generate opportunities out of the fabric and so really our argument here was this neighborhood has big warehouses and that looked like warehouses and commercial buildings and little houses that have pitched roofs and so our strategy was to create this this hybrid and what was kind of interesting about that and it goes back to this sort of mezzanine level the top of the building where we start playing with this roof shape generates these double-height spaces and these sleeping lofts and incredible views and so again I think it's super interested in how context generates possibilities for something new that's still very much in keeping with with what was there and there's nothing more fulfilling than like a neighborhood meeting where where people actually pick up on what you're doing and and feel like you know I understand like I respect the fact that you're trying to pull that out of of our of our city and I think that just goes back to this idea of kind of sharing logics with stakeholders you can hear get a sense of the retail base and the common roofdeck which actually happens behind that kind of crenelated reform you can kind of see their DIY house so we did have a moment where we were pitching a version of hundred K to Detroit and I'll just share with you what I thought was because I remember coming to Detroit and meeting with Midtown and this whole idea that like a hundred thousand dollar house it's just preposterous like you'd have to be a ten thousand dollar house and we're kind of scratching her head like okay but what was interesting about it is it really got us to think a little bit about how one might adjust thinking and our idea was so at first we were like well you built a small house and you can add to it but then the idea became well if we want to go high-performance envelope the climate here is such that that makes sense gets called to really explore where the certificate of occupancy happens and to try to ratchet back the investment in a house as far as you can the building code I don't think would quite I mean we're being a little bit speculative with this but the idea being that you kind of capitalize on the emerging maker culture of young people in Detroit and saying like well let's let's you don't want people messing with the envelope but you can certainly have people building out the insides of their house through time incrementally and living in them in different ways so that was really the theory of the project was this idea that you you you build you know you build out the envelope but you let the inside of it happen through time so interior partitions painting lighting storage flooring potentially to allow that to become a kind of ongoing activity everybody's house has I mean people work on their houses and constantly after they sort of purchased them so the idea was like can we ratchet that back that's our that was our version of what that might be and we also thought a lot about the incremental urbanism of that kind of idea about the fact that and there was this whole discussion this was four or five years ago or three or four years ago there's this whole discussion about why would you build new things when there's no market forward and I think the idea became well maybe it's this combination of like aspirational and sort of retrofit and that there is a place new things say something about the vitality of the market and and frankly I think you're starting you're starting to see it I mean it's happening now which is which is exciting and I think that's that's important so I did I did add this because Scott and I had this conversation today about evidence-based design which is this whole other topic but I did want to mention this because I think it's interesting and that we've done a number of projects where we collaborated with a health scientist on outcomes based design related to health and this was a project for supportive housing the competition in Syracuse and basically I'm gonna have to talk to this very quickly but the idea was she as a she creates this kind of brief does a literature search it's a way of starting a project like for this population there's known credible literature supporting these conditions and these tendencies and exposure to lie the way people socialize and so the project that we developed was coming out of this and I don't want to present this as a kind of one-to-one relationship but I want to present it as maybe a sort of method or thinking and what was interesting is at the larger scale of thinking about how this filters in I mean one of the conclusions we had about this project was that there were different kinds of social spaces there were social spaces where there were there were reactions to social conditions where people are ensured that they won't encounter people unlike them versus conditions where they might be exposed to the public and so that actually hatched this idea of the two courtyards where the inner courtyard was for sort of residents only and then the outer courtyard was this interface with the street and so that's what sort of generated this this is not a kind of known courtyard and in the beginning of an interaction with the public and also the beginning of a building that starts to make a street wall which this which you know this city doesn't really have at the moment so and there were all kinds of other things going on here about landscape and there were group sort of greenhouses built into the project based on the beginning of skill building and research related to exposure to vegetation and so you can kind of see one of those one of those green houses there the corridor is designed in a way that created a whole variety of different increments of sort of socialization so we have a series of projects it's a whole other talk but I just wanted to mention it because I know that this is something that is on the minds of some of the faculty and the students here we're very intrigued by this idea of evidence and if this question about how to architects react to big data which is only going to be an ongoing sort of condition and how do you parse it and so this is a an example of us beginning to grapple with that and finally I just want to circle back I'm five minutes away here two questions we good excellent so the granary project was kind of imploded at one point was was kind of interested in I mean it didn't literally imply me to the the grain for the wood frame grain version of it actually imploded but the politics of the project fell apart for us but what was interesting is on the back end of that the Pew Center for arts and culture who's been a friend in a number of ways to us said you know Philadelphia just is not thinking big about history we want to really ramp up the discussion historic preservation and gave us a little bit of room to kind of invent they actually funded three different cycles of this project we call gray area which was really about historic preservation tends to be either you keep it or you don't and it goes back to some of these projects I was showing how can we begin to tinker and tool around with that so I think some of the things we argued was this idea that you know traditional preservation tends to be very focused to the left of this which is about buildings and details and like the first slip form concrete building we can't touch it that's important as it kind of as a kind of memory but really beginning to think about neighborhoods and cities and how they're affected by both positive and negative qualities of old construction our first cycle and really this was the challenge of like how do you begin to calibrate preservation to the local conditions of your city which I'm curious about what the conversations are like here they must be fascinating but the first the first iteration was just figuring out if people cared and asking big questions the second iteration was a dinner we had 400 people which I'll just show a picture a couple of a couple pictures of and and and had some conversations and then the third one was really going to the neighborhood level and the first iteration was a book we put together invited a bunch of our friends that we thought were doing interesting things in Philadelphia the first thing was to say actually there are interesting responses to history happening and it's not to say that there aren't and we talked about shells and platforms and voids so you know shells are going in and changing the inside platforms or the granary and the eastern building which I talked about which are literally like sort of plants or objects upon which you can build and then voids much like Detroit Philadelphia there's a lot of there's a lot of vacancy in underutilized area and we wanted to include that as part of the kind of history-making and organized around that we had this wonderful conversation this you know symposium where we were very proud of the fact that the audience was largely without gray hair although I do see a couple of people with gray hair in there and not to say that that's bad but the whole thing was like here's a bunch of young people coming out to talk about historic preservation I think that was really a great thing the second iteration was the dinner for a hundred and apologized all been drinking because this photograph is of embarrassing quality but this really was about getting neighbors and community leaders and city officials and architects and designers into the same room to talk about these issues this is what the invitation looked like we commissioned a short film where we interviewed people in different neighborhoods of Philadelphia talking about history and it was super fascinating to hear people in certain neighborhoods kind of romanticizing old history and thinking about neighborhoods that the people living there kind of crumbling but other people seem charming people out in neighborhoods talking about you know how difficult it can be to live among these buildings and it was a really interesting opening up of the bandwidth of that conversation and then the third iteration which we found most interesting as a design process and I'm happy to report is going to be included in a cooper-hewitt exhibition in the fall is this card deck which really was about getting people to have this conversation on their own in an inclusive way and I can't say too much about this because I don't have all the images here but I do basically it was a kind of self guided conversation deck where the card started with where were you born how do you feel about change very broad questions that got people talking and then eventually presented facts about a building and then allowed people to go on record with values and design ideas and what was fascinating is that there was no real conclusion there was no product outside of the fact that students forty-year neighborhood residents professionals and non-professionals sat at a table and talked in a way that we found what we realized as if we were leading the conversation it would be a very different then the card deck allowing people to talk through some of these issues and so this is a real budding interest of ours and and thinking about sort of methods and mechanisms for for kind of conducting this idea that we think of his influence through through the conversation space and then lastly this is an exhibition that we mounted this past year in Philly and and it was kind of interesting and we we kind of called it like walking into an illustrator file which is exactly how it felt when you walked into the room and this was basically a kind of catalog of row house typology is based on projects that we had designed but I think you can kind of see some of that periodic table of micro units in this diagram where you can see the stair types on the Left switchback rotated linear stacked and you see the width dimensions on the bottom and those little speech bubbles talk about the kinds of opportunities that are hatched at those different dimensional gateways and was really a kind of it was funny because people that came into the exhibition were very interested in just thinking about their own houses and thinking about becoming aware of the dimensional constraints through this diagram and then we also constructed this little what we call the Playhouse which allowed people to take stairs you see the pink stairs those are the four different stare types and different floor plates and different programs and to kind of investigate and play with the sort of space of the house and we're at the moment in the running for a very interesting grant that would allow us to do a much more expansive row house study in Philadelphia so this and there's a number of other things we're doing that we see as a kind of feedback loop for the practice that we're making buildings and we're we take building buildings very seriously but also take the spin off opportunities like the gray area projects and the row house research and you know some other things we're doing to help to help three inform how we're doing that thank you new questions because we were gonna be here till 8:00 Brian you ended up very quickly appreciate that but questions about the about the work or about the approach or about Brian's teaching you didn't talk about that but I'm sure that that's probably a fair game for the questions as well to heed to we build we build models yeah I mean we do although I have to say that it's it's waned a bit we're finding ourselves using three-dimensional software in fast iterative ways that that we think are similar to building models but we also see the we go back and forth it depends on the project but but three-dimensional visualization is super important to us and I think but I will say that the windowing and there was a particular project a very early project where we learned something about the sort of strategy to thinking about facades where we would make these diagrams and maps of possible places where windows could happen and to kind of extract through a series of diagrams to figure out where they go so becoming a less compositional and more sort of performative the question I have a quick one for you it seems that real estate valuation as well as they're gonna vary mathematically defined measures of sustainability all of these things factored into the design I wonder if you could share how you allow that to enter into the process at what point does it enter into the to the process how how does that find its way into the project I guess physically as well I mean I think it's I think that we we take some liberties now because particularly on things like urban housing and energy performance we've we've learned a lot so our first moves are now completely contaminated by the knowledge of what we shouldn't do it all but early on and and it continues to be a trend in areas where we're less familiar it happens it happens immediately consultants data research performance I mean the one thing that we've realized if you're trying to be realistic about the budget and the timeframe in which a project gets realized you you you need to consider that stuff if you want it to really happen and the other thing we've realized is that it leads to credibility that if you can solve those things many of those things aren't that hard to solve and you don't want your design to get in the way of their solutions so you start with those you gain credibility and then you actually get some bandwidth to play after you fold that into the project thank you doubles double stud but I'll say that it didn't necessarily have to do with the what you would it I think the analysis might lead you otherwise the reason why the double stud proved to be affordable was every subcontractor in Philadelphia could bid it and so you're just getting much more competition I think that yeah but I mean we've we've used sips and we you know believe in them and they're obviously just incredible from an insulation standpoint if you if you keep your foundation wall plumb as I was saying but yeah the double stud is you know at the moment winning out give up on the microphone is that alright who's learning people all right just yeah I mean this is a really really difficult business it's a difficult business if you're just trying to make money it's a difficult business if you're just trying to keep only from leaking it's a profoundly difficult business if you're trying to mix research and you know practice I mean I will say that you know I think that everybody on the team believes in the mission and I think we all work hard we all take credit for everything it's one of the really key I mean if you're interested in culture I think this is something that we're really proud of and is the fact that you know not everybody can do everything I mean you know this from startup right like when you're small and nimble like you have to exploit different people's skills but I think you know when there's somebody over in Revit for three months and seeing other people doing research or doing something that's a little bit more speculative I think we're of a scale or 10 people where everybody everybody knows that like they're part of the team that's generating this body of work and I think that there's a mutual respect between figuring out how to build a building and figuring out how to have an idea that may be my best answer cuz honestly like and we're quite we have some big things teed up and we're worried about like growth could inhibit that and you start becoming fashioned with these people do this and these people do that so I think it's just I think it's this this being on the same page with that that really makes it go I'll also say you know I think that I have a lot of students that work in the office a lot of my staff go into studio and do workshops on visualization and you know software you know reviews so there's a tight that's actually easy stuff I mean that's and I think everybody loves it that there's a there's a there's there's a conversation between school and work in a very authentic way I mean most of my time is work but I think there's there's I think sometimes people that work feel like they're in school and students feel like they're working and I think that's maybe a sign of success you know we've talked to a lot of people in fact I'm talking to a guy next week in Philly that wants to Hotel in Portland I mean I worry drew I think we've gotten to a point where Philadelphia can't support I mean any one city can't support all the ambitions of you know practice and the question is like where the projects and it's tough because remote practice is a little I'm learning is a little different than home based practice especially when you're building with the guy in the pickup truck like how do you translate that to other cities right and part of that's the right partners and so I think I mean my answer to that is we're I don't I think we're geography agnostic see the hurdles but for the right project I think we're I think we're I think we're always game but we're not specifically going so right now what actually we're doing it's one of the reasons why we're interested in the city to some degree is we're now looking at the neighborhoods we work in in Chicago and Philly and Boston which are all these kind of just out of the core like it's kind of like if there's if there's vacant land great coffee and a bunch of rock bands practicing it's probably a neighborhood where our work will play well and what we realize is like every city now has this neighborhood in this place and so we're one of the things we're doing is we're looking at those different kinds of places and because I think there's a lot of there's a lot of common ground with people that are working in those areas and that happens in all cities but thinking less about the geography and more about the kind of place in different cities where that where that work can be supported right thanks
