 order questions to the Prime Minister Dr Philippa Whitford mr. speaker the leader of the house [Applause] mr. speaker I've been asked to reply my right honourable friend the Prime Minister is visiting the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in Bahrain mr. speaker this morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others and in addition to my duties in this house I shall have further such meetings later today yesterday signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Houston spaceport and with the rice space Institute brings the reality of a Prestwick spaceport closer with a huge boost that could give to the UK aerospace industry will the UK government join Scottish government in supporting an air show growth deal to literally get this off the ground I can certainly show the Honourable lady that the government is looking very keenly at the opportunities to Scotland indeed the whole of the United Kingdom arising from the potential future development of commercial space operations the airship project that she has described I'm sure will be examined very closely by those my ministerial colleagues who are particularly concerned with this area of policy but we definitely want to see the UK as a pioneer in seizing these new commercial opportunities perhaps thinking of rail passengers trying to get to their jobs these little sticks of tea you see spoke about shafted and abandoned workers while the unites them McCluskey is doing a you kick dance move resigning before trying to return will my rent of a front encourage union and other political leaders to tell the RMT that two hundred and fifty people with guaranteed employment do not during the lives the jobs and the safety of 600,000 southern rail buses at risk mr. speaker I'm sure that my Bible friend will be speaking on behalf of many thousands of rail passengers in his constituency and many others in the South of England and it's deeply disappointing that some unions are threatened to strike over the Christmas period the government is now investing record amounts in improving our railways up to forty billion pounds over the next five years and we need everyone in industry both management and unions to work together to secure the best deal for passengers I have to say that the RMT's action shows coordinated contempt for the traveling public to do nothing except bring about the maximum damage to people's lives mr. speaker there is some heckling from the benches opposite this this party mr. speaker is on the side of rail passengers [Applause] I hope that the party opposite will join me in saying to the rail union leaders sorted out put the traveling public first stop the squabbling and tell your members to get back to work [Applause] Thank You mr. speaker I'm sure the whole house will want to join with me today in commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack where thousands of American servants service personnel and civilians died the next day Winston Churchill summon Parliament to debate the British response and when he did he said this it is indispensable to our system of government the Parliament should play its full part in all important acts of the state these words are a vital reminder that even at a time of crisis in fact especially at a time of national crisis the role of parliament is central and in that same spirit we welcome the government's decision to accept our motion today that they will they will show Parliament their plan for brexit before article 50 is triggered so can I ask the leader of the house one central question about this plan does the government want the UK to remain part of the customs union mr. speaker can I can I first of all joined the Honourable lady opposite in marking the anniversary of Pearl Harbor in remembering all of those who lost their lives at that time but also marking with a sense of some sort of celebration even the fact that Prime Minister our bay is joining President Obama in going to clobber the first Japanese Prime Minister so to do and I think that sign of reconciliation putting ancient conflicts behind is is a welcomed one to do the lady's point about Europe the government has always made it clear that we would seek to give additional clarity about our position at the earliest opportunity but it's been the case as my right of a friend the Prime Minister has said many times but one of our core objectives is going to be to secure the maximum freedom for British companies both to have access to and operate within the single European I think the leader of the house were to answer but I would respectfully say to him that surely on this issue the answer should be straightforward we all know that it would be a disaster for British business if we do not remain part of the customs union himself said in February everything we take for granted trade without customs checks or paperwork at Nationals national frontiers would all be up in the air it is massive what is at risk now on this side of the house we would agree with him we couldn't agree with him more so can he put it beyond doubt right now today tell us does the government want the UK to stay in the customs union the Honourable lady and I she's right mr. Bigley honorable lady and I both argued passionately for the remain cause during the referendum what separates us now is that I am part of a Conservative government which is working together to respect the democratic [Applause] the best possible outcome for the prosperity and security of the entire United Kingdom from those negotiations whereas the Honourable lady even just two months ago was telling us that she wanted to go back to the British people in some way she needs to decide whether she upsets the democratic verdict or not [Applause] of course we accept the Democratic decision of the British yes we do but the difference between our side of the house and that side is that we want to leave the European Union on behalf of a hundred percent on behalf of the whole of this nation now we really need to have a straightforward answer to a straightforward question because leaving the customs union would mean having to check every container coming in at Dover it would mean UK firms having to prove or art their origin tests and whatever that whenever they export to Europe it would mean chaos and it would mean gridlock for cross-border supply chains and as the leader of the house said himself in May about lamb and beef exports I believe they go tariff free they go without any extra checks you cannot cannot guarantee any of that if we are outside now again on this side we agree with what he said six months ago the question is does he still agree with himself [Applause] I thought it understates even the Honourable lady's attention that there had been a rather significant referendum since February that changes the context in which we are now having to operate we face yes a deep very challenging very wide-ranging negotiation and it would be harmful to the national interest for me or other ministers to engage in the sort of detailed exposition of our negotiating position that she is now pressing upon me none of the other 27 governments is doing that nor should we dear oh dear we're not asking for tea [Applause] the negotiations if you cannot give us an answer on the Customs Union as a whole order order both the questions and the answers will be heard so if the juvenile behavior can stop that'd be really helpful to the scrutiny process Emily Thornbury so we don't get an answer on the whole of a customs union so can I ask him a question about one specific point it's since 1993 there have been no customs checks on the land border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic and in May when visiting Northern Ireland the right honourable gentleman says if the UK was not part of a customs union then there would have to be checks custom checks at the border and he said that for anyone to pretend otherwise what would be and I quote flying in the face of reality sir can he confirm that this remains the position and if that is right he really must today make it clear that this is something that the government is determined to avoid the Prime Minister and the North Island secretary have repeatedly made it clear that we as indeed as the Irish government want to see the very long-standing common travel arrangements and the free trade Arrangements across the Irish border continue we are actively engaged in talking both to the Northern Ireland Executive and to the government of the Republic of Ireland about those matters there is goodwill on all those sites to try and reach a solution that works for the people north and south of the border the leader of the house has made the familiar arguments that he can't give answers that it's all to be resolved through negotiations brexit means brexit practice it means breakfast but that is not what the Secretary of State for brexit himself said when he was asked about the customs union in September because he said and I quote we have looked at this matter carefully and that is exactly the sort of decision that we will resolve before we trigger article 50 so if the government is going to decide the position on the issue this issue before March the 31st can the leader of the house confirm that the British people and the British Parliament will be told some answers to my questions before they tell the rest of Europe i mr. mr. speaker the answer sound familiar it may be because we need some constant repetition before the Honorable lady will understand and appreciate the the government is at the moment engaged in a consultation with more than 50 sectors of United Kingdom business to ascertain precisely which aspects of European Union membership work well for them which they see as harmful where the opportunities beyond EU membership lie we will come to a decision and we will go into negotiations on behalf of the full 100 percent of United Kingdom population and all four nations of the United Kingdom the fact is and he knows that we all know it he can consult as much as he likes but the answer will come back we should be part of the customs union it is a hugely disappointing that on a day when the government is committing to greater transparency on its intentions for brexit we're getting the usual stonewalling we have a government that's promising to tell us the plan while refusing to give us answers to the most basic of questions we have a government promising to give Parliament to say when they're spending we don't know how much of taxpayers money across the road in the Supreme Court trying to stop Parliament having a say on this in short we have a government that cannot tell us the plan because they do not have a plan do not have a plan in February in February the leader of the house says when he was hearing about the like what he was hearing about from the leave campaign was confusing contradictory nonsense my final question is this are we hearing are we hearing anything different from this government today Mr Speaker we will publish before article 50 is triggered a statement about our negotiating strategy and objectives as the Prime Minister has said yesterday but the the Honourable lady seems a game to be in a state of utter denial about the consequences that flow from the referendum decision no other EU government is seeking to reverse or question the legitimacy of that vote in the way that she and a number of her colleagues are still trying to do but I'm afraid that just indicates how distant the Labor Party now is from any aspiration back there we watch them in action it's like it's quarreling like mutiny on the bounty as we shot by the carrion team they had no choice I want to hear the words flowing there's no reason why the chair should be denied the hearing of these matters it's very important the leader they are rudderless they are drifting on Europe as on so many other aspects of policy it's little wonder that so many decent working people who for generations look to labour to be their champion have given up in despair returning to this party as the authentic voice of working [Applause] mr. speaker in 1943 a 16 year old girl was forcibly taken to Auschwitz Birkenau where she witnessed the horrors of the death camps or liberation she came to this country with her mother where she raised her family and became a nurse she dedicated her life to the making sure that the people of this country and Beyond know the horrors of the Holocaust last week that lady turned 90 and Kitty Hawk moxon is with us today Prime Minister's question time well my Righton were French [Applause] will my writer normal friend join would be and I think the whole house in wishing Kitty a very happy belated birthday and thanking her for her lifetime of dedication to raising this important issue and also pay tribute to the Holocaust Educational Trust who do everything possible who do everything possible so that we all remember and witness the horrors of the worst part of the 20th century I'm first of all mr. speaker I'm grateful to honorable French for raising this important issue and I'd like to join him in marking achievements of Kitty Hawk Moxon and of the Holocaust Educational Trust I mean I can never forget the impact of discovering as a schoolboy that two of the boys in my class had fathers who had survived Auschwitz it is only a couple of generations ago that Europe was plunged into this unspeakable horror and it is important that not just the Educational Trust but all of us play our part to ensure that the memory of the Holocaust lives on and that the wider lessons of that dark period in our history are learned and I think I would be grateful to all members right across the house and all political parties for their support in working together to ensure this vital work continues some of the most deprived communities in the country are in Glasgow and today we learn apparently that the government plans to close job centers in those very communities in Parkhead in Britain in Easter House in castle milk in line site in Anna's lands in cambers line and Mary Hill is it true that the government is planning to close these important offices and add misery to the many tens of thousands of people in Glasgow who currently use these centres well clearly the Department of Work and Pensions like every government department does look from time to time at its estates at the the number of offices that it has but the Honourable right on gentle makes a perfectly reasonable point on behalf of people in Glasgow I will ask my rifle friend the welfare and pension the worker pension secretary to contact him with the details that he sees Robertson and I'm sorry mr. speaker that's not good enough the department watch there sorry being heckled being heckled when dealing with communities that are does not the whole story members the leader of the house is correct to say the leader of the house is correct to say that the Department of Work and Pensions has plans to cut the estate by 20% well the DWP is planning to do to Glasgow is to cut it by 50% why is this government planning to disproportionately cut vital job centers in some of the most deprived communities in our country why the key element in any such decision that a government department has to make is not the raw number of offices that there should be but about how accessible the offices and the services which they provide continue to be to the people who need to use them and I am absolutely confident that it is that criterion that is at the heart of my right honourable friends thinking in planning for the future of offices in Scotland and everywhere else in the United Kingdom Elena Thank You mr. speaker passengers of the chase line face chaos and utter misery in the autumn and this year it's been worse than ever delayed cancelled and overcrowded trains leave passengers stranded its stations and being late for working school will my write on a for friends outline what measurements measures the government is taking to penalize poor performing train operators I mean first of all can I express my sympathy to my own well friend and her constituted all passengers who come across these problems on the chase I mean it's clearly unacceptable and it's important that the operator works hard to secure a rapid and sustained improvement the government has introduced murals to ensure that rail passengers will soon be able to claim compensation if their train is more than 15 minutes late but as the transport secretary said yesterday more needs to be done and we want to see much closer working right across the railway industry so this kind of problem can be resolved much more Swift much more swiftly than in the past Deirdre Brock does the leader of the House agree with the Honourable member for North East Somerset that brexit offers an opportunity to remove pesky emissions standards in the red white and blue of brexit well his government still commits to continue tough targets to protect our environment or well tackling global warming just become a lot a load of hot air and the the government remains utterly committed to both national and global ambitions and targets when it comes to climate change indeed my right honourable friend the current Home Secretary in our previous job played a key role in brokering the Paris agreement last year the first ever global agreement on climate change the Honourable lady I hope would welcome the fact that we are now going to be ahead of our targets and ambitions in delivering on the proportion of electricity provided by renewables in this country and on continuing to work to get our carbon emissions down need a bone Thank You mr. speaker there has been much talk recently about paying for access to a tariff free single market I think that's a very good idea given that the United Kingdom is the fifth biggest economy in the world and we have a seventy billion pound trade deficit with the EU would the excellent Acting Prime Minister tell the house how much the European Union should pay for tariff free access to the United Kingdom single market well I suppose I should say I should say thank you to my honourable friend for the for the upgrade although III hope that dr. P career limiting compliments I should say I mean he makes a good point in that a a settlement at the end of our negotiation which maintains maximum access to and freedom to operate within the European market for bouquet companies elsewhere in Europe and European companies here is in our mutual interest and I hope that will inspire negotiators on both sides closing Mary hell job center my constituency one of the most deprived parts of the country help my constituents who want to find a job does he accept that travelling further to other centres will mean increased costs are people already on the lowest incomes and an increased risk of sanctions why does this government continue to target the purest and was vulnerable they if the government has been targeting the poorest and most vulnerable it is in getting them back to work in record numbers and it has been in providing a boost to the pay of the people on low pay through the introduction and the increase in the national living wage I wish that the Honorable Judge we were prepared to welcome and celebrate those achievements in Bridgend Thank You mr. speaker as we're about to commence the most important negotiation for decades does my right honourable friend agree that the government being forced to disclose its negotiation strategy at this stage is rather like is rather like sharing your hand at cards to your opponent before a game of poker and coyote to take no advice from the party opposite they only have one card to play on this and it's always the junker [Music] mr. speaker I mean we've also become Ford with some more details about our strategic aims going into the negotiation but it would harm our national interest if we were to go into the kind of detailed explanation of our negotiating position that the opposition urges upon us that is not how any of the other 27 governments are either acting or thinking and we should learn from that example speaker those of either the House agree that tonight's vote on the Prime Minister's amendment which we fully support is a vote of the highest significance and great importance because for the first time honorable and right honourable members of this house full of the opportunity to vote on whether they respect the will of the people of the United Kingdom and whether they will get on and implementing it the people will be bill were able to read an hamster tomorrow who stands by respecting the will of the people of the United Kingdom somebody else two or three nothing more maturing and I'm sure that he will the more red white and blue he makes it the better for us on the unionist ranchers the right honorable gentleman as so often makes a very powerful and important point the vote tonight will be the first opportunity for members of this house to decide whether or not they support the government's timetable of triggering article 50 by the end of March 2017 and any right honourable honourable member who votes against that motion will in my view be seeking to thwart the outcome of the referendum in the most profoundly undemocratic pathway this country's nuclear deterrent is our ultimate defense and it must be maintained at all costs yet hundreds of my constituents who work at the atomic weapons establishment are currently on strike or work to rule in a dispute over pensions these are people who more often than not have devoted their entire working lives to tending our nuclear defense and to whom promises were made during privatisation can I ask that the leader of the house commits to sit down with the prime minister and review this situation to ensure that those promises are being kept well I'll certainly ensure that my rattle when the Prime Minister is informed about this matter and my real friend is absolutely right to raise these concerns on behalf of his constituents my understanding mr. speaker is that the proposed changes to the atomic weapons establishment pension scheme are a matter for the company as the employer but I can assure my honorable friend that by right of a friend the Defense Secretary has been in close contact with awwe throughout the process and has also met the trade unions and he is now carefully considering recent developments to see what else might be done and it's early I know the whole house will join me in sending their heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the family of David Brown from estrin who aged just 18 took his own life the interest into his the inquest into his death has heard that he did so on the day he was due to sign on at the job centre after saying that he felt belittled by staff despite actively looking for work and seeking an apprenticeship shortly before taking his own life he told his mum the way the job tends to treat people it's no surprise people commit suicide well the leader of the house undertake a review into this individual case but will he also undertake to stop take stock of six years of brutal welfare reform and look at the way the DWP treats its most vulnerable mr. speaker can I can I first also express unreserved sympathy for the family of David Brown I mean no parent no family should have to go through that kind of a shocking experience now clearly human beings in any organization sometimes take decisions that get things wrong and I will ask the work and pensions department to have a look at the particular case that she has described but I do have to say to her that I think the principle remains right that while star should always behave with courtesy towards people seeking to claim benefits it is also right that we should expect people who are receiving benefits to be subject to the kind of disciplines that apply to people in work even if they are on low pay there is a principle of fairness here that is what lies behind the approach that DWP takes Raymond THD thank you mr. speaker I applaud the prime minister's vision for a government for all as Sheriff your party Committee on community engagement the footsie 150 has less than 4% of individuals from an ethnic minority on its boards well the government to support a vision to help increase that to 10% by 2021 I think it's very clear that but boardrooms need to do more to reflect the reality of modern Britain and the government certainly supports the principle of increase in the diversity of boards that's why we're supporting the business-led ethnic diversity initiative that's chaired by Sir John Parker and we very much encourage businesses to act on Sir John's recommendations Traci pray been a recent appeals Hospital have placed ambulances destined for their any Department on divert to Jews B Hospital in my constituency 61 times in the past 12 months a hospital scheduled for downgrade next year in light of evidence showing that Pinder fields can't currently cope will the leader of the house pledge urging support from the government to keep Jews free ane open well the NHS is certainly busier than it ever has been in it in its history which is why still it should be a matter of clanks in tribute to hard-working NHS staff but ninety percent of people going to A&E are still being seen within the for our target I mean the point about the configuration of local services in any part of the country is that these need to be driven by local clinicians through cost working together with the CCGs who are the people who actually manage and understand what is needed in each locality the local authority through its Health Committee has the right to call in proposed changes to services and refer them to the Secretary of State if they are uncomfortable with them Greg Williams will share with me the importance of the creative sector through our economy and that in conjunction with the Welsh language makes s4c espidrile based currently mike is it really hugely important to the Welsh and British culture and economy well it can my writeable friend reaffirm this government's commitment to protect the s4c budget well we review the future of the world's language work after we are with fully committed to the future of Welsh language broadcasting and to s4c and I'm pleased to say the license fee settlement that we've agreed has given financial certainty protecting s4 C's funding at more than 74 million a year for the next five years and we are absolutely committed to ensure that the channel continues to make first-class shows and serve well speaking audiences in Marvel friends constituency and for that matter right across the UK nasha of Indian children being massacred and perón into fires over Indian women being raped and houses erased him aground and what representations has this government made to the Burmese authorities all the militaries in this regard yes those those reports from Rohingya are extremely concerning as the Honorable lady knows that there is a long history of discrimination against the Ranger people in Burma both British ministers and the British Embassy and officials in London make our concern very clear at regular intervals to the Burmese authorities receive double Thank You mr. speaker following the revelations in the BBC Panorama programme Clinton house in my constituency is now closed three other care homes run by the MALDI group have now been rated as inadequate by the CQC and two others are currently under inspection concerns have been raised to fight these care homes for many years and it cannot be acceptable that it took the BBC to revoke the action that was desperately needed does the leader of the house accrue to me that it is now time to urgently review the role of the CQC to ensure that in future concerns raised by residents families and staff are properly and promptly addressed I I think that older and vulnerable people deserve the highest quality care possible there's no excuse for services that fall short of expectations in the way that my honourable friend has described now the CQC does have extensive powers in law to ensure that nobody in the chain of responsibility is immune against legal accountability and I would expect the CQC to exercise those powers in full in this case but he has made some criticisms of the CQC and the government has been looking into ways to improve its processes and increase its efficiency and the marital my honourable friend the Minister for community health and care discussed this very issue with the CQC earlier today Brian Davis 6% of methane from fracking is leaked through fugitive emissions given methane is 86 times worse than co2 for global warming over that 20-year time frame will you support the council view europe's call for banning of fracking or at least or at least the minimum of nought for a maximum naught point 1% fugitive emissions at well no no mr. speaker be the government took its decision to give a go-ahead to fracking after extensive consideration of both the economic and the environmental risks and opportunities involved we are confident that fracking can be carried out in a way that is safe in a way that does not harm the environment but which also provides job opportunities for this country and makes this country less dependent upon import of energy I expect my right honourable friend will be astonished if not aghast to learn that a succession of journalists from the BBC have contacted me seeking to create to manufacture stories of backbench rebellions only issue well I would hear about these activities mr. Baker well will he agree with me on these controversial issues the BBC should stick to its charter obligations accuracy and impartiality instead of seeking to create problems for the government mr. speaker I'm I'm sure that my I'm sure that my honourable friend is shocked I'm shocked at the thought anybody could look to him as a source of information about rebellion I hope he'll be able to find some comfort in the fact that the new Royal Charter agreement required the BBC to deliver impartial news the very first time impartiality has been enshrined in the BBC's missionaries having now received a response from the Prime Minister deed with my request for the children's Filner fund I was disturbed to be told that the source of fund can provide and I quote a simple and respectful food rather the answer is both insensitive and totally lacks any understanding of my original request has the leader of the house the authority to facilitate a meeting between myself and the bereaved mothers so that we can explain to the Prime Minister exactly what it is that we're asking for this request is important to us as parents many in this house and from my post Park very very many people and organisations throughout this country I mean burying a child is a must be an incredibly painful experience for any family and I think all of us would want to pay respect to and have enormous sympathy with the Honourable member for swansea east and she speaks on behalf of she says thousands of parents who have to go through that that anguish now as the Prime Minister said there are mechanisms in place for financial support from central government to be available and local authorities are of course free and many of them do waive funeral fees for child burials I will talk to my ministerial colleagues about the Honourable lady's request for a meeting and I'm sure she'll receive response to that Richard Graham mr. speaker good trainings are vital for our constituents to get to work and so it's incredibly frustrating for my constituents the cross country operates 63 services a day between Birmingham and Bristol but only three stop on the way at the city of Gloucester so would my right honourable friend therefore ensure that ministers in extending the train operators franchise do not allow cross country to go on treating Gloucester like a leper to be avoided at all cost and obliged them to deliver a service that every city deserves well I say bound well friend that he is as always speaking up strongly on behalf of his constituents any of us who've been to Gloucester knows that it's a place that you want to be able to visit frequently and easily the government is investing record amounts and improving our railways and as regards his particular case if transport ministers are working with cross country and Great Western to see how the Gloucester service can be improved
