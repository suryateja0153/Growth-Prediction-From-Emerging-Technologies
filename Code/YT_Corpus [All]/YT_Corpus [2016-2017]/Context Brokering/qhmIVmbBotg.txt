 skripsi love you and thank you for uploading the video we 30 fantastic but I realize they all look very serious except one what you say is always just bring it so next i expel all these doing some diet or something okay now I'll be it's fine it's probably one of your first video love to be it up so when you get a lot more chance to do what what you got a lot more chance and if you want you to do video's description stuff I think one of the main things you need to remember is that yeah it's quite serious stuff your dog doing a masters and pour it doesn't mean every kind of fun and wrong and the reason why I included videos and green send stuff like that why should not I see there is a reason for why we're doing that is because I want you to enjoy a lot of time when we go into a study for sure we don't really enjoy some occasion you can enjoy but I want you guys to be engaged and I mean they enjoy but party another reason why I'm using videos is because a lot of people before time but there are some part-time minutes as well as online well we expect more people to join us module so that means that some form of interaction otherwise amania an eerie depends on you sometimes the full time group is small and the online group is large so you won't have a lot of interaction about you which is nice a small group but you will want to be bridge on the experience of some of the people were studying online so put on my people you would also want to think about be breaking on some of the activities that your full time is well campus have but it sort of that interaction is about knowing other people commissions and interact with in other places who knows one day that you might visit a country you're high coming to you can i visit you and you make friends that way I can let me tell you how many times I've made friends online or previous transmissions for from different countries and then when I do visit I do is it everything I tend to go visit them or visit their next well just to find out what if you were living so now so just keep that in mind and that's the reason why are you doing this I know how you will know who i am i don't need to reintroduce myself like just in case my benefit those who haven't been following a sort of past five weeks my name is chilly you can just call me Chewie don't need or any of my tripod it doesn't really matter just means I started really much i'm i'm a more simple and I mean in this computer back sometime I studied in London and then I'm by my met in Singapore to practice I was in the I was in the military so I was a boy soldier as with every student me young horses my country then I'm today i joined the public sector so you exactly usually do that you think you can do as a junior this year will change the ground and then the very last place that i was at which i loved and specialized and wasn't HIV rehabilitation so we remain novia i am into pain management you know hiv/aids three invitation and ping well there are a lot of conditions within foot it'll really know about HIV rehabilitation is that these these people have immuno compromised system and therefore might wanna vote for all sorts of infractions submergence virus is a bacterium attacking your own short system might attack a lot of different system in general and because of those infections there is a lot of people especially it affects the central that's what I'm going interest and therefore because of that that led me to my postgraduate studies I actually came here they offered me a scholarship to my PhD after which they offered me a job so it can offer you your job you don't see them and then that's when I settle your wife and two boys you see one of my voice the other boy tends not to go in the video so that's fine sometimes okay here in the background so let's move on me now in this particular lecture I'm just going to call lecture because I'm going to talk to you a lot and I like to talk okay I like to pop even though I'm gonna be able to in trouble but when i am in my lecture or position i guess all yeah yeah yeah yeah i just can't stop up and you know you have to physically restrain your stop talking so i'm just gonna say this is a lecture and what we're going to do is we go we're going to them look at several things these are all very large estate stuff so things like why are you doing this okay and some of the idioms and learning outcomes well you probably have read them but i'm just going to simplify learning outcome to me personally you reheat learning outcomes in ames goes blah blah blah blah blah blah blah that's exactly what you hear when you read the words in your head is a bit like you know since this dog when when the family is talking on the doctor is blah blah blah football exactly which is why I'm here to simplify the games and anime outcomes for you and I want to give you a better about logistics I mean you've gone through five beads but let me just give you an overview of em come on dude Rob you very long wonder it's going to last until semester 2 and I've also given you some sheets but all I online i'm going to upload this on to the hub so you can download hope you like check as well as the sheet that students career having it outlines every single week what we will be doing including you know everything will be in a weekly folders are still review to you remind you what is supposed to be by if you are Hannah you know if you really enjoyed the book and it's really small book and putting a handbag or putting your back and your own basket but I think you can always just flip it and just have it mean but look talk about the most important thing that we're methods all you which is the assessment oh my god how am I better pass is macho I'm going to tell you okay it's going to be a lot of work you're gonna be hard work I'm not going to kid you that this is going to be hard work by the same time we're going to have some fun and from okay my my philosophy and doing assessments for myself when I was student and for as a lecture that when i get students to work hard i make sure that they have a go get financed off because otherwise is really hard to sustain them in here interesting work with the assessment themselves and I ask any questions are answered so it's not personal you can ask me anything about this module ok so now ain't how I put that ever that between half empty now just watching out for those are good or Airways you should watch it it's very good TV series and now this is the aims of this entire module there are some things that you probably need to take no talk instead because you're doing at a monsters level is that I'm gonna go there are some things he was that you need to take off that's fine just grab a chair I just joined us just be careful that we are actually doing that so Jesus just make sure you don't block them I learned on my students hope you're happy so there are some things and skills that you need employed you may have already harder or you may be still developing them but the main thing is that you need to get these skills up and actually use them sure that you're starting to use these skills the very first day is you need to be able to evaluate and critique okay that is extremely difficult for more students but it's not impossible along the way I mean you've got your online and was that you try to remember copies modulus online learning this or is it prep learning the very first one we came in the very first one who they did the formative for what's it wasn't learning methodology is correct commissioning avoids the name is module late methodology some of these concepts are starting to come as any but evaluation and peeping tom we were losing a lot of that in this module yes you'll be learning about concepts and frameworks and Prince both behind in properties or how commercial in clinical measurements were in order to be able to do that we have to look at the evidence behind them and then be able to criticize when i use chris daughtry sizes not in a negative manner criticize it academic terminology means that we look at the river with a much more detail and look at both the pros and cons to the advantages and disadvantages what it's capable and was not people wolf that's what critique is I know their love in different countries the way student and shoot interactions of are different and the dynamics very different as long I mean from where I come from as well as in the lower countries is in student user interaction such that what a team what introduces students should just follow an odd question but you are at a master's level own what I want you to do is that there is no one there is no secret calm you can't say ok there's no saber company if you don't know what that means mean that you can criticize anything no matter is my work or someone famous that you know what the video is very famous and they published some work there you can criticize it you are in a position so long as you've got skills or you criticize appropriately and you have a good academic debate about it it's fine resided ok there's no saber call you can sleep and then obviously because we are focusing very much on all commercial incident conventions in this module so we need and the final aim is to be able to apply our heating silks our valuation skills to choosing a type of political management that is relevant to our own clinical practice you may have very specialized or you may know and I've specialized it doesn't matter because you are living generics apply across the board it may even change the suppl in at some point but those still stay relevant and that can be good thing about this module no matter where you go this these skills will still be relative okay so that's what we're trying to do to effectively use these chemical measurements but remember why are we doing choosing all these conventional communities the reason for that is because we care for patients and services info go to be more commercial SAE client services or not in a clinical setting for example physios can be working in a community with the scepter charities and services that doesn't usually linked to health care so the quad m service fee this obviously is the main bubble our our some clients come from a still patients so we need to be able to enhance their rehabilitation or when the service that we prepped them and be able to measure whether they've improve stay the same about was and we want them to improve how do we never measure so that can actually convince them that they've improved because a lot of times patients don't believe you that every group despite the fact that they have and you know that they had so being able to measure something like that and able to convince your patients and service uses that yes you have a good look look at a shop this is what happens every week you're approved and if you are a service that requires funding or someone who has a site where your service and you can take those st. charts summarizes look my patients are improving what we're doing is affected that's reason why what is the model for these are all the learning objectives engaged so let me sit down for them but oh poor them all sort of converge into one just told you about Ames so the Ames an overarching aim as we look at the learning objectives whim self broken down into separate categories the first category is the main overarching framework using which is ICF international classification of function we will be using that a lot i'm thinking about that a lot because that's what the developers used internationally okay is a common language that physio is used internationally so we talk about ica we talked about in Hammonds talk about activity limitations or a provocation restrictions or you use terminology impairment disability and handicapped people will still understand you and anything you're able to transcend that national boundaries we will talk to each other physiol should talk to each other because we are one big family in order to say God our interests we need to be able to talk to each other so that what a personality objective is to be able to get you into that mindset using guys here the next learning outcome is being concerned with the concepts that is the most relevant to this module terms or commissions there are three main ones obviously there it can be more than that but mean you are talking about validity reliability and responsiveness whenever we talk about the outcome measure or a clinical measurement these are the three things we think we are concerned about whether is Magic what sales is measuring what if we actually do it multiple times or different doing different people using same things on the same patient all the informations they are green and is it responsive enough to be able to detect change there was really a political change and over a week we will look at the methodologies surrounding all these three main concept and how to actually interpret and be able to use evidence to look at once a very intelligent let's all these are brand all these learning objectives are fantastic but a lot of times because this is a very pragmatic people after learning of our concept we always ask ourselves over here like this this one patient which I'm interested in using it on you always are the question I'm learning that is all right but how does that apply foundation and this learning outcomes will try to apply some of these theories and look at different methodologies to be able to apply general concepts and filter down to individual physician it's actually more difficult than you think it is but one thing to always remember that we may learn the difficult bits but at the end of the day when we do use it we both have to simplify at some point so what you learn is theory the principle behind filtering down or what you actually utilize it it will be much much simpler because the patient that we care about what statistics you use our friend will use all they want to know is are they going to get better when happy going how much okay that's it and that will point that in that direction a lot of times I me I talk about I don't know about you but for me a lot of times when I see my patient over the years I've always felt this immense I'm not doing any good or which is just not including the way I want them to do and when you question yourself like that you think is it because of thermal video 33 nothing for this patient like you or is it because of others other reasons I mean a lotta reasons why patients or not but one of them could be that you have actually been rated one of this potential roadblocks that might prevent you from effectively implementing a particular coefficient 1 i'm not saying it you only one but surrounding that there are a lot of potential barriers and towards the end we will talk about what potential barriers are what some examples of potential areas are so that when you do go out there back in clinic you're able to identify some of these and think about strategies to overcome them there's no point talking about measuring or so collecting data and choosing our curvature when we when we go to call phase of clinical practice you can actually apply them and we cannot overcome the barrier that by then i'm not going to tell you that i am perfect in the way of like the commission's opportunities because i don't i mean lots of mistakes along the way but the main thing is yes you made mistakes but you should learn program doesn't mean any questions so far me know when i do that i just won mine now what are we doing this i talked about having fun okay so i'm not going to that anymore all of us local information is a very much and I really also explain to you why important that but Nate's point is because it's the movement of evidence-based practice you may be with it or you may not be with evidence-based practice but the fact that everyone's using it so you might have such as John the bank run you just jump on the bandwagon because if you don't you'll be left behind and what will happen is that you don't practice or be much more diminished ultimately is not you or something as a patient for supper you don't use their plates behind some of these things and we will teach you over the entire program to be much more evidence-based you think that you have engagement of literature evidence base in your undergraduate days well we prepared they're going to engage one okay now and I think in fashion right now well not quite in fashion over the past five to ten years is this thing about critical reflective practice reflective practice means that you don't just do and just carry on with your everyday practice for what you do is at the other day or perhaps moments in between your on what you're doing you think back and and evaluate yourself and think oh why I done that wasn't reasoning behind this when you are interested in doing things don't think just carry on because sometimes you just first you're busy just want to carry on and just simply drew the things that has worked the previous time and then you realize that all actually should I have done that or even is right why am I done that is it because it saves in time or is it because for some reason click critical reflective practice is very important it's a bit like I don't know I don't know I don't know about you mama was a child I using to the diary command oak and are actually making sure my sister so what I do is I be somebody up in finish today who can take out my journal and it just right and just the battery what has happened that keeps me grounded because as a child I had a lot of emotions going on in my head and things happen I make out step on certain things but when I come back home and you know day I can actually step outside and be slightly object in I'm going for my I was upset about this is John hit me because about Marcus why i said but any and i was standing outside anymore but why did I say that joining the first place was because I didn't like him is it again something you did to me or was it something else and he can actually say oh if that's the case I mean Sophie right I'm just you argue you like the video so for those of you online the reason why I stopped and the video quality would have changed slightly and angle option studies because my phone ran out man sup there you go always prepared short memory okay and because I was trying to video it in 1080i I did anticipate that it would take up so much but let's continue on this slide so we were saying that why are we doing this I was a sort of trying to prepare you not just for this module by trout the entire degree itself that you'll be very much engage of evidence-based practice so it's something that we will be doing it's very very important and I was describing about my own journal for keeping my thoughts and then be able to objectively evaluate why being a certain way the main reason for that is so that i can do do it better next time ok so in that instance actually forgot what i did i mean that person isn't called John and we need mom to protect the comp you died in your person but I actually forgot what I did but most of the time that I think that that may not be a very good friend of mine and therefore I'm interact with them or if someone and value actually make up and then try and see what's what it is so that's why we're doing this oculomotor how with this entire module run there are certain things it should be covering become quite clear as you were going through the first few beads you would have noticed that I put in weekly folders yeah so the weekly folders in other words it they may not do it the same way but this is how we do it is that every single week there will be some you know videos or tasks or reading for you and when the when the wings for is exposed to you usually on Sunday or Monday then you are asked to engage in those tasks for that does that mean i know that some other modules expose it and the week before and you're supposed to engage the week before before you come in to class and engage in some activities but for us I think it's simpler because of the different modes of studying full time part time online it's much easier just to do it for that leap I would talk a little bit about in terms of task how we engage because I don't expect you to engage in touch within that week itself all our link it will be very very very because a lot of time to be able to synthesize it acknowledged try and finds I need to do to any other times before you actually do it so we attend you give you about two week period total about that each one in the future points now we're learning objectives for each utterly we won't we engage with sudden learning object that is good so I have a quick look as to what you're about to do so that you are always focused but you don't have a lot reading but there's a lot of materials and law and new concepts recover if you are confused always go back to the learning objectives for that week and ask yourself what am I supposed to be learning to speak and then go back to your media until you're much much more focused that's one very simple way of doing so okay of course you have a weekly reading by now hopefully you have some and you have to book by redoing some form either online version or even bought a physical copy yourself or you have rented just to say that you're renting and maybe better to buy your book rather than actually rent is getting cheaper by the day and appends away by as well and besides it's so small it's a little it's actually worth the investment because you can bring it the concepts are not new therefore I foresee that is not going out of fashion in the next five to ten years I mean that the life of the book world you go investment will be spread over five to ten years we were actually investing in the book yeah and I've chosen a small book which is nice also it's it's not too expensive idea is it that cheap either so it's one of those things and the reading is okay is not too difficult there are new concepts but overall it's got a style that's beautiful and we all have weekly summary videos that may or may not happen depending on what you have for that week ok sometimes more appropriate summarize what's happening going on occasion is a simple at first readings were just getting you to look at the different youtube videos out there to help you learn about some new technology getting yourself from there potentially what you might be able to use and those don't require marine video now let's going to a weekly test every single week most weeks we have a task this week the task hazard has already been exposed to you if you actually follow after you do the reading there will be as some other of your video so summary video type thing and then the very last section of this week or in the task while asking you do is choose a pen and paper type clinical measure up and outcome measure using the ICF I want you to them map out to see what is actually measuring impairment activity limitations or inspiration restrictions and relate that to see to to to sort of gauge overall that particular thing that popular outcome measure of length measurement what is trying to measure which level okay just give you an idea because a lot of physio tools are measured at in Hammond level we don't really look at a patient restrictions or Africa limitations may be that you may find something else to measure these two broader domains and when you engage those task are open up discussion board for two weeks I will ask you to put up video logs which is videos of yourself explaining the task some me find it easier to do that some you don't and it's fine if you don't then you can use discussion to write out what you found okay we give you two weeks for that even though I said it after two weeks the discussion board or closed officially I don't make it disappear because you might want to come back again and have a look at why the classmates have written or what you have actually written yourself so that you can you can use that as your own learning okay so I the disk argue the monetary of the discussion board and tutors won't look at it after two weeks later but it doesn't mean they can't go back and still get some material so I'll just keep it there for you to this is quite useful workshops and online collaborative projects now country will be doing some of these where if you are online you'll be able to engage as well but for the full time is though there are scheduled classes like this and it will be less likely that the next few classes will be just me getting in your way because you engage in more active sort of doing something or some of it will be geared towards your summative assessment which is your first piece of work and some of it will also be geared towards your last piece of work so you're not doing it for fun or just what I say we're doing it can you use what are you doing in class and then skip back into what you're actually for or assessments now then you are asking how do we organize students and join us in order to be able to engage there will be some data collecting just for within the class to illustrate certain concepts how do you might do some data collecting the data collection or occur around you but online students will be asked given specific instructions on to collect what days to collect as well then you'll be exposed to a data sheet like a spreadsheet that is online and all of you from every different modes of study will come and populate those sheets and then you have this huge collection of sheets so the matter where you are in can actually access it and then you will be you'll be able to then analyze that data collection so as accumulation of everything so that's a bit more collaborative as well which is quite nice okay and you get to see it gives you a sort of taste up or potentially in how these days international collaboration works essentially that's what we do work with different sites we come together we put it everything online we're secured but everyone can see what everyone's going to do any questions are how are we going to run that in terms of really focus is that one case so far yeah it's not too difficult right ooh simplify as much as possible so there you go come to think very much just basic for one step and the spoiler destructions what you were thinking behind when you learn but different steps to reach the materials not too much work okay now how this is it ain't our overview on some of the task as you do are we giving your sheets and honor students will can download it from the hub but what what I've done is I've color coded them the basics comedy green is where you're learning worker a lot of concepts will be imparted to you so occur between weeks five to eleven students week five of them on the arm of the module so from now until we can have a live you learning stuff and then you won't do much just approaching before Christmas while you can something for not learning stuff in terms of engaging in reading and then from starting from next year beginning of next year which is we 20 you will start to engage your lower learning content again but that's only for our three meats what happens in between well I will get you to do start doing the ones that's colorful a blue is where I will get you to start to think about what you want to do for your own assignment assignment for Part one and Part two are linked okay there is another one which is normative formative assignment so if I know you know what Simon is is something that you are engage in very get feedback on how to improve without actually impacting on your final mark all these three are all linked so what you choose for your part 1 well you will then use that and continue to work on and contributes to talk to so yeah building on while you're a dancer that it's not work as waste any something new again why is Ben allocate 0 X 890 25 and 27 36 233 employed is because during those weeks we everything that we do will help you to develop it you know how when you study a lot of times of all of your assignments or assessments I the tutors give it to your images ok go away and do it here for this module no we want you to help you and discuss with you what we want to you regal assigned tutor we will help you know we assigned meets where the tutors will have chatted you as to what you can then discuss what you want to do we let me go tell you it's a good idea oh oh sure sure about that you might want to think about this or maybe that's a good idea but you might want to change it so that it becomes much easier for you to engage okay so that you don't completely go at a different together so that's what why you do it the way we do it on top a little bit about more processes afterwards in later slides now of course all of us will celebrate Christmas doesn't you don't have to celebrate Christmas because our Christian you can send over christmas as well because you're going for shopping very nice thing to do so go enjoy your Christmas during that period of time you can use it to engage in writing of the same if you want to because this the impending it is retweet okay so as a Christmas gift I give you assignment one so you can do what you want that your time can go spend some time but just make sure that you plan a time out and the reason why we tell you ahead of time so you can plan your time if you don't know when we'll be ended in on what's going to happen your comp plan the same thing for part two and your part two headings and week 34 kind of a few remember to date but i'll publish it or you already got a date it's just that don't have it at all my hand okay anything else that we talked about we've already talked about weeks 124 because that happened you're very familiar rising so the technology so we just do it is that now the assessments there are three parts I told you to summative and formative and summative part one is countries or flooding the send so not too much but large enough to motivate you do some work and then we will do a formative where you will build start to build on part two so this is a trial run for part 2 or drove drunk for part two essentially what you'll be doing here 4 comedy ruby is actually what you'll be doing finally for part two but in a slightly easier form or draft form because you don't really know what you're trying to do trying to get some ideas out there which is why it's not marked but what we do is you get peer feedback when PAP back is both classmates online and full-time or part-time as well as it shooters all of it will be shared are on the discussion boards both as a video we talked about what you are to do as well as though sheet of summary of the content that you want to do for part two and then we can I give you feedback because everyone would know what you assignment already will be because I'm like yeah it's holding it to you and then you can say how you can improve that I found really good that not so much and do this do that and then we can then help each other get a better grade or if you're not interesting grades and easy we will improve the way you do and evaluate something or improve the skills as well that's one way to get that sort of them so informative is really important to be able to engage in to get that key back usually when you do a piece or assessment you just talk to you so now you can go much more than yourself we're giving telling you you don't have to take all the ideas about your give me some ideas on how to improve it now obviously need to do this on to part two where the children guide you as you go along and that will take out seventy percent okay so what's the what do you have to do for part 1 hour part 1 is a 2,000 word written assignment so just purely writing ok just purely writing for for now I wanted something slightly more interesting but I to say that she too much too many interesting things is this true don't do Baba students in too much good for something slightly more traditional so I did I went to work two thousand were written assignments not a very long piece of work by deena is a very short it allows you to put in a lot of fun tent but yet not overload you at the same time and the question is this need to select one fill in for measurement tool okay our car measure and then you need to critically appraise it for it see the three main areas its validity its reliability and its responsiveness sort of here is by the time over the next few weeks you know exactly what to look out for and the classes will engage you in having sort of evaluation tools will help you assess somebody's so they know exactly what to acquire what to write in two thousand word and I at some point next we got we got the publish more guidelines on how to engage with this assignment as well so you can get you more guidance so I have a dog I don't have a nice in the process of I've written it out about getting the tutors to feedback on it to improve on and today becomes clearer sorry give me about to announce published and it has to be then applied for patient or what we requested so you have to choose so it's not just that when I go to not just clinical measurement or commercial but it has to be applied to certain population and the reason why is because a sudden to apply to different populations can mean very different things or the way there by change for different groups so we have to specifically state which type occasion or conversely if you are aware that this particle programmed on transcript you can tailor it to your own color go discipline or clinical specialty so I would encourage you to choose a patient brokering anticipate that you want to repeat up that you're currently doing now that you want to specialize in all you would like to specialize in the future too they will continue to most transcript all your MSC degree okay so this is one way to tailor make your own program your degree turn parent you to do that as I said before you are you doing stuff in it during the class that will help you to develop this particular written assignment so during the class will focus on that thirty percent i will skip that bit already said that so how do we do it so from weeks eight to fourteen because ii eight to nineteen actually may I see that in Week eight you will have a video of face-to-face change depending on which notice that you add so with your assigned tutors so you know your sentences are there are going to 30 asset new cap and coming so there were you just email them and have a chat about exploring watch this topic which revision 2 in which patient group you want to engage it then they will give you advice on that so that's what i'm eating doing meet eight-week night you're feeling search strategy forum or chosen to okay you will be given a form that has got all the sociology in it that will guide you can go beyond that if you want but using that here at least guide you as to what you're looking out for fill in that to choose to be able to find is a strategy is a like a little plan how do you search for literature that supports the evidence behind that tool to answer the written for the review liability and responsiveness question after you've done that you're supposed to be relate to your assigned cuter and there's a cuter will then give a feedback by putting comments on your sheet and you may leave at you today you can actually improve what is certain okay so that will have to tell you put after which if you want you can talk to your tutor in week 10 does certain things that you understand what the internment can clarify with the body know about online face-to-face chats it so we support you that and once you are certain what you wanted to do you can then go on and collect data collected literature or to do the searches on the online databases okay oh you if you want these days o scholars the advanced that matter so you can do that as well you want but don't judge you or have a combination the competitive races and then what you do next is a week 11 you bring in all the literature you collected so what she does such you're bringing the future okay and then you will do some activities with this cubby well then help you to teach you how to critically appraise is literature in terms of their properties that's what we do and we talk continue to search for rich literature and then a week 13 you all again discuss how you're doing the tutor again so you can see that the tutors are there to guide you to get from the entire process until you start the assignment writing in week 14 to 19 start right it and then your side you headed which 20 got out to quite a lot bye how many hours is this lecture three hours 30 let's just hope not there's no use to be let's just stick with less than 2 or less than 1 by don't think that'd be less than 1 because already you start going at 10 minutes of your time so why are you so let's let's talk about the second is second assessment second assessment the format is a 20 minutes video presentation and then 1500 words of accompanying notes right okay so just put everything in context this will be handed in in semester to a week 34 so now is what week 5 you got 29 weeks / for seven months okay I mean if you do a certain thing for seven months every single week hopefully you get better right not very confident right now by yeah I'll take it anyway so you got seven months too so basically prepare these skills ok so don't and what a lot of a will help you in here so you'll be fine also ask a question for this question you will be building on what you've done in Power View you read show's first in part one you chosen and clinical measurement to the chosen patient group you read on that you criticize so we won't go there anymore because it's done and dusted we now move on the next bit for part 4 part 2 you're supposed to identify two barriers to now's about more of implementation and application of the conversion tool you're supposed to identify two barriers that may prevent you successfully implementing tool in the patient we're interested in okay so I it's just not it is not simply identifying the two barriers you also have to look at the literature to see for these two barriers while the potential impact on this patient group okay so there will be literature out there to say that these are the problems that we face you're supposed to look for those and SS how I prevent you from successfully implementing that commitment to next when we are the identify barriers we don't just hear that we need to come up with solutions as well so then you have to give a solutions for hot or conference barriers and problems and you also need to then put a little bit evidence behind it to say that whether this will work or not or is SF I mean suggested implied or Mike important okay and will contribute lost seventy percent so what does it mean community video presentation it can be anything can be a powerpoint narrated presentation like what I did this or it could be a person standing in front of a board and just doing that and you take yourself for 20 minutes okay or it could be you video a if you're online or your clinic or you do have you're still working infinity and do the euro things that's happening and put it together video but it has to address all these points the format is a bit more fluid but the main point needs to come through but it question you might be asking hope you die then say what evidence is how other state and slightly evidence that's what you're 1500 notice for is that seven points you'll refer to this particular author and then give your company notes you summarizing that bit of the presentation and Ewing and that's why you put a literature instance by the way the references that's not come come to us or work account so you can give appropriate referencing gotta understand i'll give you more details as what's what's expected of you so again this is how we will support you so we straight to is really about second or third week of semester to it is after christmas it should be about in mid-january towards the end of january where you start to plan the outline of the video sign so remember you're handing in your first assignment in wit twinkie so i'll give you a breather for two weeks and then you start planning for your second second in signing and then you are planning outline you talk to your tutors so you can email or through 19 or face-to-face contact doesn't matter afterwards you write a draft or what you want to put it into your video presentation so the content or you're putting you can in which way through you're supposed to after chatting or two to refine your outline further so that you know exactly what you want to put in and finalizing everything and then start to write a draft content because what you currently doing is only the outline of everything now you put the actual content when you're in the video while you can say okay like how you do a platform for presentation and then in least 25 what I want you to do is make a short five-minute video or what you have very done or you plan to do what you dropped out line because you written that put it online and then each of you would look at each other and give comments okay I haven't decided whether to pair you off or to just that everyone comment on everybody's oh I'll come to that I'll make that decision later go see which is most effective so i will also comment on that so make full use of that after their comments have been given a week 25 will week 36 you start to write key thing the video itself because now you know exactly what to improve on you start writing more content then you can get some support from your tutors you can ask see if you consider question you can ask your tutor weeks 26 327 you're working on your road you can see that the Tudor comes in every two weeks to make sure that you're okay again with 28 use you you have to start about video recording some of your content okay you're not doing it one off and then you can start planning to do bits and pieces and increase them together which is what we do which is why in the first for me I've taught children or what how to actually use some of these video editing software is to help you to do that okay and or the PowerPoint narrator lectures Vienna technical support there is that we can't start over technology the assigned to day is essentially be the only cuter improve that will be helping you in the temporal support so I'm the person who come to but do tell your assigned to different an investor that they know exactly that your know exactly where you're talking to me about 29 continue recording 30 * editing a video if you have not finished recordings continue recording again you get to talk to me if you're going issues for your technical aspects of my own stuff tell you want again continue editing your content 32 and in your content with support from me and finally bye week 33 you should be finalizing your final video it should be the final four that you are mostly happy with and I know that fizzy without a lot of us are perfectionist we want to do it right but the thing is at some point the other hand in your world so you can we just get it as right as you can and then that's for your presentation okay where denotes are we talking about that is a five minute for informative now why is it important to get feedback from each other because we need to help each other out I don't know about when I don't know what you studied so don't know horticulture or the marking scheme or ha ha remark but you know thats a university spot on a curve so which is that every single year they're only a few people in your very good marks ok but in this program at this university we don't if your work is good we meet the criteria for a star in in theory all we can get and restarting and that's the reason why it's good to give you some feedback to help each other achieve that they or a star and sometimes clear compared to the feedback and push you from that saves one grade one more into things pretty ok so it's very important for you to engage in this so it's not just putting in a content for go to PSS but also be able to contribute and advise energy go as well today you learn each other right so any questions no if whatever you are online you've got questions for me what you can do is just simply you know me that's the best way to actually ask me questions I will put up these slides onto the heart as well so you can download your questions thank you very much that's the end of this session
