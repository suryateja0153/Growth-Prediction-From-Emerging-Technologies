 and sorry about the delay figure it out I was a coffee bean first they said that as part of the gender women and sexuality studies and please look out for flyers about the other events I'm very particularly carry Baker from Smith College who's visiting on April 80 which is also a friday at one-thirty p.m. and now I'd like to thank the people who made this event possible firstly any Hill who is co-chairing the colloquium committee with me and secondly I'd like to thank jigna decide which our view is and also obey whether castle miss Jen and Jessie see our administrative staff who made folder nothing boats that this happens for amazing and then I want to thank our co-sponsors so this is co-sponsored and then the venue is made possible by the Institute of Advanced Studies and then also the program in Asian American Studies the race indigeneity gender and sexuality initiative and the department's of cultural studies and comparative literature American Studies and political science co-sponsored today so thank you to them and now it's my great pleasure to welcome nephron Utada our to the University of Minnesota nephron e is the author of things fall away Philippine historical experience and the makings of globalization beyond the frame women of color and visual visual representation coweta vut with Angela Davis and fantasy production sexual economies and other Philippine consequences for the New World Order as well as articles and journals and anthologies that are too numerous to mention here and never do is one of the scholars whose work to make comes from the future or or or comes from a place that that that pushes us and presses against the limits of existing language and concepts to think differently and she brings us along as readers or as Curie's today to also push ourselves to think differently her work shuttles between thinking through the problematics of domestic and intimate relations in particular the gendered and racialized relations that emerged in colonial and medial colonial settings and the vast spatial and temporal logic of contemporary capitalism and globalization and in the process she reimagines the fields of post-colonial theory and transnational them bringing to our attention what is lost chaotic became or understood as wasted and showing how politics and life forms take place in those realms and I was really privileged to get a preview and I think some of the material that you're presenting today a couple of weeks ago and I think you're doing for a real treat so I just like to welcome every first of all thank you for the kind invitation that really kind of introduction it's always a privilege to get two productions that are not during wet so thank you thank you to the chair of the department of gender women and sexuality studies Gina decide and for the institutional hospitality and over Walter for making the arrangements so today I thought I would share some of the work and thinking I've been doing that leads towards a feminist theory of forms of human media as I promised as exemplified by the user actuation of humans as the instruments of other humans will and expressive agency Eric use my thinking about this can undoubtedly be traced to my earliest working overseas for domestic workers in the 1990s and in particular this 90 95 work by philippine artists Imelda cohiba and daya on the Sabah koi iph or my wife is a deep th domestic helper which I thought so movingly encapsulated the treatment of live and migrant domestic workers helpers as kasam kapa at the time they were called domestic helpers kasam coppin which is household utensils or tools the effect of an objectification of subsistence labor or domestic work in and ask the very instruments of subsistence or domestic work such as the bloom iron etc severed from any natural origin or nail belonging she's a technological apparatus and artificial organism a replicant designed to perform the reproductive work otherwise fulfill their real wives mothers and daughters there's more to say about this piece and the political context within which it was made to resonate not use the phouka keep in guys coming this critique of the figure in role of wife I will just mention here the intense national opera are caused by the harrowing media reports and the physical and mental violence with which oversees domestic workers were treated in the homes where they worked in other countries psychological physical torture mutilation sexual assault rape Sarmatian confinement and murder an opera that brought the Philippines state and the nation into a moral political and economic crisis precipitating a whole set of national legal reforms and national agreements resulting in the reformation of the philippines state into one of the most successful labor brokering states in the world overseeing the deployment of between twelve to fifteen percent of its population of more than a hundred million as overseas or migrant labor whose Admiral remittances is last year reaching 29.5 billion dollars he's the third largest in the world following India and China at the time it was the figured reality of slavery gleaned in the conditions of overseas domestic workers in particular what the big papers were already calling then modern-day slavery which you can see as part of the beginnings of current global abolitionist anti trafficking and free the slave campaigns that shaped the way the problem of overseas domestic labor was to be understood my own attempt then was to understand the connections between these conditions of servitude and slavery and to take this problematic seriously the connections I argued and I drew quite a bit on african-american feminist scholarship on today I'm very particularly female the savory but the connections I argued rested on the intersect gender and racial systems of differentiation with the logic of commodity fetishism that it will say the racial izing objectification of national class and gendered social relations of this perception realized through acts of violence inflicted on the bodies of domestic workers acts of violence that inscribe them as less and other than human worthless things without subjectivity in a historical moment of redefinition of humanity through globalization so the acts of violence at work was the acts of inscribing them precisely in this racialized the way they were after all labor commodities in a burgeoning warm body export national economy territorial eyes bodily resources of a developing or third world nation state we spoke residence operating dependent on its management of its feminine body in this way they were objectification of an economic as well as a racial difference between their costs and their employers worth which was translated into appropriate both surplus value I understood the continuities between contemporary servitude and slavery to the sleigh in these gendered and racialized intrinsic to the very structural tendencies of capitalism in a new moment of global expansion hence my reference to these conditions of overseas domestic labor as new industrial slavery because much of it was happening in new industrial nations which I conceived as a process then it conceived as a process of producing a new race without yet no discernable collective identity but existing only as a changing floating full of workers fulfilling class gender nationality and ethnicity specifications today that racialized pool of workers figures most prominently and they are exponentially expanding to mess global domestic care fluid at service work industries that department of contemporary capital production constituted as global servitude by understanding of the role of global servitude emerges out of a view of processes of global urbanization the processes underlying the global fantasy of City everywhere which I write about in an essay by the same name as a place that is also a future fixed to the present the idea provision and destination of present global itineraries the world in the works for a mobile urban humanity these processes which I call uber urbanization depend on modes of value extraction that issue out of servicing circulation itself and by circulation I mean not only the exchange of derivatives currencies good services etc but also the communicative effective and social activities of life activities of the value denizens of City everywhere that is the activities comprising their own social reproduction so this is from the the saem City everywhere parts of it which I believe in such modes of value extraction do not however only depend on the capitalized evil value of life as labor for the entrepreneurial and investor subjects that comprise the ascendant global urban class they also crucially depend on the disposable life types of a worldwide service servants rather whose primary work is to save as well as produce the valuable town of their clients or employers that is to serve as the means of facilitating the latter's value productive movements I'm just showing you a couple of these this is money aliveness the these are this is part of what I had talked about earlier in my earlier work is the fly over network that which is supposed to be the paradigm of an archipelago in urban archipelago with its ability to bypass and to connect connect neighborhoods and to leave a floating population or see them under development alone in the 90s but then that has become a new global forum and we will the Metropolitan platform and expressways would be kind of paradigmatic where connection and content are the same and everything from every for all of the characteristics of these expressways were built to us standards every thing from the thought to the starbucks stops to everything so and I ran and I talked about the whole you know feeling group the groove of the of the experience being the connection and the content together so we'll the urbanization if I said connection is content content as connection we can see the operations defining this metropolitan this enterprise in the business model exemplified by Cooper the mobile app based transportation service connecting drivers drivers and passengers this software as a service business which understand itself as a facilitator of transactions between customers and independent providers rather than as an employer of service workers seas to the efficient allocation of human beings and their possessions through the media to Zane of urban environment and this is by the way Wow even domestic work is paying verified chopping up traditional jobs into discrete tasks that is into detailed piece work assigned to people at particular instantly scheduled just in time work on demand times and setting wages and service prices by then measurement of supply and demand what has been called the uber ization or verification of work at a business model in other spheres means converting people's times of waiting because it's comes up waiting for employment in the case of the underemployed and made of workforce in their item times into the work of waiting on others aiming for frictionless efficiency through the elimination of the inevitable slacking older personal bonded as well as industrial fortis models of service labor including full-time lifetime employment the built-in features of such on-demand mobile services highlight more than the fact that a burgeoning global service economy undergirds the expansion communicative capitalist industries driving in shaping uber organization or the fact that the mediate mediate ization of service industries often entails technologies that facilitate the direct casualisation of labor converting what would be understood as the waste that is unemployed people's life times or the unemployed free time of they partially employed also times of waste into on demand or on-call work detail often combined with other divers on-demand work detail in a frenzied multitasking model of employment meaning productive times aimed at soaking up the liquidity of lifetime's of the urban excess leading mobile app based service in enterprises to do and leading mobile app based service enterprises do something else besides directly contribute to the creation of a growing precariat in the global north these enterprises seek to effectuate a perfect meshing of two orders of social media technological and human that is to say they seek to fuse and incorporate the disaggregated dividual human parts of the enterprise as component media within a total integrated platform to program the function of humans as media for other humans none of this is new in a certain sense one could point to terrorism has an immediate precursor of these presuppositions of new media however internal to the machine 'ok mechanizing and technologies and tendencies of capitalist production from the industrial age on are longer legacies of the institution of slavery and colonialism which continue to inform the dominant protocols codified in the most advanced capitalist media technologies as means of value extraction as well as in social landscapes within which these are embedded here i want to point out only one striking line of lineage which can be gleaned from the striking continuity between on the one hand the function of colonial slaves as we bodily instruments and tools of the sovereign agency of their masters rather than a three workers contracted for the commodity of their labor power and on the other the function are not the function of non subject humans as media in the contemporary moon non subject humans as for the servicing of the demands of full subject humans particularly in the way that such demands are two are met through contemporary software as service enterprises what makes the discontinuity can be gleaned from the similarity highlighted by marks between the slave and the free wage worker as both beams for another place at the disposal of his owner employer with the difference that as a commodity the slave is sold once and for all to his owner while the bearer of the commodity labour power the free worker sells himself piecemeal what makes that the continuity is not simply the commodification of persons their exchange value as the condition of their sales whether wholesale or piecemeal but crucially also the disposition over another's vitality mark suggests that rather than a disjuncture between the two the slave relation is the kernel at the core of the labor relation with a question of time they were are selling a temporary disposition and the provision of legal freedom obtaining as the measures for ensuring their positive separation and difference with the imperial democratization of the masculinist prerogative of modern freedom to sell this disposition over once bodily laboring capacities throughout the post-colonial world it comes as no surprise that the seemingly anachronistic or regressive existential situation of one's whole body lean ones whole lifetime place at the absolute disposal of another figured in the sleigh should find most of its spectacular eyes contemporary examples in feminized forms of flavor paradigmatically in the global sexual and domestic work industries into which migrant female workers are structurally trafficked in the latter context which Nandita Sharma shows to be dependent on contemporary legal mechanisms for the social organization of unfreedom one finds the habitual exercise of the absolute disposition of employers over the domestic workers entire bodily being with an entire time at the beck beck and call of their employers for an indefinite range of tasks live in immigrant domestic workers in particular exemplify the job of certitude which is to put once via the capacities at the thorough despoiled disposal of one's employers what I find important to note in these contexts of contemporary servitude is however less the model of seemingly unproductive may survive labor or civility that palaver known an autonomous sees as the new basis of a universal post or dis exploitation and that in contrast I see as characteristic specifically of those lives that bear investible a cumulative value this is this is a whole discussion about the difference between those who wear there's no distinction between life as labor or those who live their lives as their own form of capital and lives of waste which I talk about and expand else rather what I find instructive for understanding the positive function of humans has media within today's urban platforms is the way live in guest migrant domestic workers act as all-around household appliances and domestic implements whose design or designated purpose is to save their employers valuable lifetimes what is to be observed is precisely their function as machines for other humans valuable life production as Marx right what is characteristic about machinery and here I want to think about machinery as it is discussed in March to talk about this rather than ass labor the means of production because I think it better enables us to understand servitude then in the subject ified forms that we already know um but what mark says is characteristic about machinery employed in production is the saving of necessary labour and the creating a surplus labor like convenience foods and food services servitude in contracting contrast of civility provides besides a measurable social subjective and effective values of well-being comfort and self esteem savings in that none material use value of time instead of being wasted on the chores of life mate needs the extra time saying can then be absorbed into the higher value and valorized both lifetimes of employers sorry I forgot this purification of health platforms without labor um and and the way that the in the urban archipelago an archipelago the way that I see cities as metropolitan for platforms the way that their franchises and the city and something that I call to the ambulance mature cities within cities that are connected by these expressways and all kinds of channels which are not just uh not not just roads but social media all forms of media channels connecting cities within cities as as a form of franchise and there's more to say about this meaning of franchises freedom immunity and privilege helps me to understand that what is being promised is this exception from servitude or subjection and that is the meaning of franchise legally legally installed even under Philippine laws of you the ways that they have figured out the franchise's this has to do with the conversion of military bases into the city ambulance and you will see in the restructuring of these military bases the continuity between the way that the military surplus is populations and the way that the new forms of extraction are being on top of that sir blessing of people and we mopping up off their lifetimes in but that's so serving as the means of other social reproduction apart from their own which takes place in their home countries from which they are exported guest domestic workers have to be viewed in their aspect as I said us household machines the means of life for that life as a neighbor that is the basis post fordyce modes of value extraction from spheres of circulation and reproduction viewed this way that is as instrument and means of laborious life migrant or imported domestic workers on the whole as well as by the peace in their capacity as individual units of life being or lifetime can be seen to function within individual homes as well as within the broader social factory of their most societies as a kind of vital infrastructure I'm kind of behind on my slides here is the difference between civility and servitude survive labors that's about the Unruh me narrated life in the larger social factory servitude is this body vitality place under the another and just mentioning that the last part the buffer zone where global servitude is life support for the desert denizens of globe opolis but you have to help to connect them back to the expendable populations from which they come because they are also like extension remittances the fact that they cycle in and out of that means that their place of reproduction that there are crucial link in extending the lives of what would otherwise be disposable populations alone so this is the difference between servers and servants in the new city everywhere servers of course are those nation states have become servers and that's it there is a distinction that I'm making here between the servers and the servants and servants are integrated into the total mediatic platform that is the cities so by the infrastructure Abdul Malik Simone has in fact importantly proposed it's very notion of people as infrastructure to encapsulate when where and how people's very sales situations and bodies serve as mediums of conveyance and articulation as quote conduits route circuits and pathways through which things reach pass through and affect each other in the former colonial cities of the global South such as Kinshasa which are at survival so Jakarta which substantially lack more formal ready-made and technical forms of infrastructure for people to use the value of an individual exists does not lie on the elaboration of a meaningful and I would add valuable life but instead in an individual's ability to be hooked into different day scenarios dramas networks and affiliations that provide a constant set of alternatives for how to put bread on the table or how to become a person that can be taken seriously that's up to innocent as a carlot of their increasing expend ability people must bring together the particularities of their social relations of family can elicit II affiliation their location and connections with their own personal character edge style and in this way become themselves the intersections where when by which means opportunities and transactions for geeking out some kind of living though never enough for a valuable life might happen in other words as global finance acts as a direct force of urbanization unbundling and interneting infrastructural projects across cities everywhere the local urban poor must create out of their own bodily extensive selves and routines of coordinated action with others the very systems of utility provision water power and networks of connection access and movement that they require and depend on as the infrastructural supports of their urban life Julia Elliot jars similarly argued for understanding the local authority bodily practices and communicative gestures of poor residents in Cairo as unrecognized forms of urban infrastructure these social sunyata embodied practices she argues do not only importantly rep reduce social relation city and hence the basis of formation of political action identity they also provide outcomes of economic value the dialogic actions of gestures are a form of semiotic Commons a collective resource like a public good whose otherwise unrestricted availability for use in the reproduction of communities has been steadily undermined and diminished by the various those very same kinds of forces of urbanisation that I described as the forces of City everywhere in Cairo these would be speculative investments on the part of Islamic companies the Army in the state as well as remittances also from their own migrant workers in the Gulf which fed the rise of a bubble in real estate markets that reshape the look and feel of cotton lhr observes how as environmental destruction public infrastructural neglect gentrification and force addictions and the dispersion of shoddy high readings from central neighborhoods where they were once concentrated effectively emptied out the place of places of shoddy culture the embodied practices through which long-standing forms of belonging and intimacy were generated and replenish that also came unhinged noting the severe told that structural adjustment policies in 290 took on such collective resources of bodily practices she reads the diminishment of the semiotic comments as a form of divestment are we an unplanned in an important if unrecognized form of urban infrastructure both Simone and el EHR highlight the fact that life in cities in the former developing world has long bended on an innumerable innumerable array of life or vital rather than only objectified in organic material forms of infrastructure which are centrally comprised distributed coordinated rhythmic human capacities and social routines quote complex combinations of objects spaces persons and practices that have to be continually generated repeatedly performed endlessly nimesh negotiated and modified in a word improvised and occasionally often periodically or in fact it is this high level of dynamism its provision ality and pro sexual productivity that makes such forms of infrastructure life as a boast of technological hardware while the specificities of the local and national histories of this informal organic development might vary it is a shared global history of clonal relations of power that subtends conditions of post-colonial capitalism now shared across these urban contexts conditions out of which forms of vital infrastructure emerge serving not only as a coherent platform transaction and livelihood that has kept a perennial sinking urban excess population afloat or above water but also as crucial supports of urban life in general that is to say while they are the means of reprimands for so for facilitating the circulation and movement comprising proper that is valued urban life and if you if you don't have an imagination of what these what some of these vital infrastructures are you can think of everything on the streets in the global south in the urban areas where people come in and they they do things for you on the streets everything is moving they think their conveyance that anybody carriers drivers peddlers the whole array of you know people who are there facilitating connections and curb carbine couriers any moment carrying your bags whatever right whether dokument orion communicative bodily practices that can lubricate movement and buffer collision in a seemingly chaotic impossible dense traffic on the streets or makeshift transient social networks in which illicit goods are marketed and transported or services rendered the provisional facilitated channel is created out of social collaboration and routine are the means of survival of a sector of urban humanity whose numbers have been wrapped multiplying in tandem with the aggressive growth of the urbanizing forces of their deception as the forces of financial urbanization erode and diminished these life making collaborations of the poor through the privatizing enclosure of urban spaces and utilities these same horses also ultimately effectuate the swelling of the ranks of admitted and expendable and in this way paradoxically contribute to the growth of the very flexible improvisatory practices and act activities of likelihood comprising people as infrastructure this view of global servitude as consisting of mobile and shifting strata of disposable yet vital means of production reproduction not only of their host societies but as I said also of the very expendable populations and postcolonial states that serve as the conditions of their own reproduction is not however simply an argument about the reproduction of class relations we need to rethink the notion of means of reproduction as a media tory agencies which allows us to see other possibilities such as the way migrant workers as well as the expendable populations from which they are temporary and redeemed a servants are both manipulators of cash as speculators investors and bankers and cash themselves that is they are a form of soft currency that they speculate on invest and gamble to this extent they are vanishing mediators as a global aggregate however their new quiddity about which there's i have lots more to say but i don't have time here today because this is all about the production of liquidity the very basis of the new extraction modes of extraction on your financial capital that this production this liquidity is precisely a medium of capital valorisation and accumulation that is disappeared from the accounts just as the lifetimes of entire populations are made into monetize assets that serve as risk absorbing collateral for the speculative maneuvers and the parts of states and their banks you just have to think about austerity measures when currency depreciation goes down what's being really what what is being depreciated these entire pop futures of populations right as well as presence being cashed in right now so they have become in aggregate form assets for States and violence migrant workers and their transnational networks deploy themselves as collective assets for their own survival relying on a social calculus that is made to converge with but it's also in excess of those financial logics to easily summed up by the word neoliberalism as creative media their forms of social calculus consists for example of dividing and distributing differentiating and allocating but also integrating and coordinating persons and their substances and faculties practices and theories of social action that we miss if we adhere to unintentional between persons and things humans and non-humans subjects and objects that continue to structure our thinking about social reproduction as Marilyn Stratton has argued it is these forms of coordinated capacities that enable their networks the function and I'm talking about the social networks of many of these migrant workers and sometimes there are divisions made between migrant workers and smugglers but so many of them are our part of similar social networks or internet intersecting social networks it is these forms of coordinated capacities that enable these networks that function not only is vital infrastructure but also as vital platforms for their of their own personal life ventures these are elastic flexible dynamic skins of relations with constraints and possibilities that are to some extent reformatted for example through domestic can ship protocols etc but they're also dynamic and changing as a result of being stretched across continental and transnational context and within systems over which communities have little control and in this way through the leverage powers that the global make available might be said to be even in more flux than perhaps in earlier times the difference I draw here between you know vital infrastructure and vital platforms is not a technical distinction as much as a theoretical political vital infrastructure allows us to see when and how people's mediating capacities become the built environment in the way the means of circulation whether their roads communicated media currencies mobile banking enables the movement and possibility of exchange therefore as part of the process of capitalist reproduction by the platform's allows us to see when and how people's mediated capacities becomes a part of the machinery of Industry technologies of production participating in the process of dollarisation as a means of production of capital it is in this latter aspect that oversees migrant workers can be viewed as agents of their own liquid lifetimes processing for an exchange transaction between discrepant Lee valued life currencies between their families their own their employers right they are processing they are processing they're doing foreign exchange basically according to flexible exchange rates that their own significant remittances as the Philippine economy second most important source of foreign exchange earnings effect so they are also holding the Philippine state the complaint that they are sometimes used by their own relatives as ATMs that's always the running joke right as well as their entrepreneurial investments in their home country and you talk to any domestic worker migrant worker and ask them what kind of investments they have they do not only invest in business opportunities but they invest in their children they invest in the production reproduction of the servant class in many this demonstrates their role as both currency and Fang investor and asset like the expendable communities that they are reading from end up a support they act as it wants manipulators of the quiddity and liquid assets themselves that is as I said the vanishing mediators of a plethora of value producing exchanges it comes as no wonder that as a global aggregate their liquidity access precisely a means of capital valorisation and this is what what I want to use as the basis of a claim but it is this powerful role of the Strada of disposable people's that is really a subaltern driver of global organization are supposed to be accounts where they always the effect you know there then they are but I think this is a crucial view of them that's important for us to restore and it is this view of them as a subaltern driver of global urbanization that is critically as well as hegemonic ly by past emails creative strategies of by paths are some of the key forms of disposable people's social survival and striving so I'll just want to conclude on a note on theoretical historical bypass so there's another global the same time fantasy that complements the drive gruber organization in the global space fantasy of City everywhere this fantasy is a history that traces the evolutionary shift away from the liberal humanist subject constructed on the basis of home equilibrium a self assessing self-regulating begin with agency desire or real of its own to the cybernetic cooks tomb constructed on the basis of privileged information / embodiment pattern / presence as a form of a distributed cognition located in disparate parts that may be in only tenuous communication with one another that's Kathryn Hales how we making posts to me I want to suggest that their genealogies that are bypassed in this provincial euro-american account of how information lost its body my whole talk is how it didn't lose its body is bodies in this entire global service goldis Trollope servitude right and how we we became folks human genealogies already implicit in the global history of colonialism and slavery to which I alluded earlier these are genealogies that listen my account feminist ethnographic work on south in south east south asia southeast asian and Melanesian social worlds is enabling us to better understand and explore so for example the work of vanilla canal on the social cultural logics of people who have nothing in equal Philippines provides one alternative genealogical path they were shared but also different global present that is the Information Age which the information age is seen by rapid inhales as following in front of caves in this kind of the purest form of capitalism that body and but she Katherine Hale sees this um this information age as this emerging substrata that a shifting underneath us that's pushing us to the theoretic view of ourselves as posthuman it's her explanation enough for deconstruction for a lot of the theoretical shifts including you know division what sorry you know postcode everything is explained by this emerging substrata right in canals account of spirit possession mediumship faith practices transgender beauty contests and sharecropping among others as bodily instantiations not just idioms but since oriole physical enactments the worlds in which persons are potentially changeable in every interaction with others we're far from the homeostatic conditions of ambiguity we're far from home in static conditions of ambiguity tension and uncertainty characterized all exchanges and their sequels this very high dynamism of interactions and she has a whole account for why this lasts throughout Spanish and American and persons become as it were their own mediatory objects in place in a place that custom to the convertibility and substitutability between persons and things where forms of social personal being which a Western bourgeois property oriented analytical you might want to call identity is largely conducted through the making and remaking of potentially transformative relationships with others particularly is asymmetric relationships with human and supernatural superiors who more over remain resident in plural that's fidelity in such analytical descriptions and she's describing the social logics within which people are in relationships of help where it's very hard to distinguish between help and predatory lending right that that this whole dynamic social logic I read also the very conditions of virtuality understood to have emerged as the cultural effects of the information age such conditions are to be green as well in the analytical attention of other scholars to the way the person's are imagined and behave as dividuals this is a turn on by the way that came from South it's from some South Asian work you know now we all talk about dividual dividual tea and as derivatives of plural social relations terms that have also been used to characterize the posterior canals inhales books were published the same year 1999 one was writing within the category concept of culture the other within that of cultural production both in effect looking for what gayatri spivak calls the chains of value coding underwriting and shaded sites within a broader imperial formulation with the anthropologist canal seeking the value coding of a particular that's national regional area culture cultural formation and then of course the literary theorist seeking the value coding of a general that's its global cultural formation but to me they are both seeking this value coding right now one need not contest that the information age is the age of finance capital nor that this is the material context for the visibility or theoretical apprehensive ility of cold as the forces of production of beings human and non-human social and technological everything from DNA to program the cellular automata right this is the paradigmatic figure for reading this times one can however brought in that context and the implicit timeline of the narrative which I see as the autobiographic the autobiography of capital written by its bearers within which the generalization of writing as in scripted coating can be understood as a material tours this is the theoretic view that that confirms that capital intensive technological development is the course of history is the you know the motor force of evolution so there is this is perhaps who are an inquiry into low capital non-official labor-intensive human media Michael where an archaeology of default informal don't achieve human based but not solely or exclusively human mediatic forms operate undoubtedly my understandings by the platforms and we archaeology and proposed with human media as its focus is a political heuristic intended to bring to the forth the living memories of slavery and colonialism pre-colonial debt bondage and sociology as concomitant with the evolutionary transformation of the liberal humanist subject in the age of freedom into the posthuman subject in the age of computation two inches in the history of Google capital in a more expanded view of human media I've tried to trace an itinerant line away from but also a transitional part of this mediatic history in colonial post-colonial Philippines in the 20th century and this is where I tried to think about what the colonial apparatuses that were installed by us the u.s. colonial government work for making Filipinos from savages and natives into subjects of citizen man as they prepared the Philippines for pendant and this everything from apparatuses of the apparatuses such as the short story taught Filipinos how to write the short story and the institution of mass education where were apparatus to create the social and sensorial basis for the expansion of capital that is free subjects whose integral whole selves are realized in the object of their activities subjects of indivisible single entities and single authors of what they may can do defined against the world of things in contrast you can see the persistence of older practices of social mediation and habitation older cognitive and aesthetic receptions in capacities of humans as media that are denigrated as non-human and there is this is a whole discussion of the way that the natives were denigrated because they were like robots or gramophones and they only had mimetic capacities they had no creativity there was no soul there was no there was nothing there they're all circus they just were surface inscriptions to end Denise de Silva cost is also in her in another context subjects of effect ability rather than the transparent subject but this is an example you can I called down my good Filipino jazz musical performance that are coursing through the Southeast Asia Asia world vital platforms of social technical representative why not do that these were performers you know who could mimic exactly exact reductions voice texture everything of American jazz and latin american jazz right they became kind of the cheap cheap software hardware that was traveling around asia in effect being transmitters of a form of musical modernity in southeast asia but it was these exacting modeling my medical capacities you know that could register perform no tape they could orally absorb and do playback this is why i saw them as analog technologies because they could take in and then do a playback that these were capacities that were denigrated from the side of citizen man from liberal humanist subject and yet they were practically valued and exploited indeed they were effectively treated as technical capacities about analog preparation and so like the camera the phonograph the ground phone there's much more to say about this but you know they were my medically capacious machines which make toxic attest through the regeneration and reef unction of the magnetic faculty in the age of technological reproducibility i would see much more about that but there's a lot there's a longer argument about how this also becomes a point which we have political rupture in the late 80s and 90s with some of the political events that also have to do with radios and cell phones in the Philippines but what I wanted to just point out is this way that they are enacting a form of mobility and facilitating a form of circulation that appear in contrast with their really participating in the mobility and circulation enabled by and representative communicative technologies of an expanding global capitalist internet so I would just end with saying that why are these you know what while what I want you to think about is the way that as they were serving in similar ways to the phonograph and gramophone about how they serviced the media of reproduction and media of circulation of desires and effects in an emergent global communication system what kind of purloined transmissions were were being affected to not see that their transmissions were solely on behalf or or for capital that there are all kinds of transmissions that are lost and also have other kinds of effects and technologies so it is not just the failure but the evasion of colonial disappear from humanist values that extension of humanity through imperial venerable benevolence that that is the result and condition of people's efforts to reinvent and creatively persist in practices of social reproduction deemed obsolescent under changing conditions of life established by the new colonial soon-to-be global regime of us power and capital I need to see you so I really appreciated your respective kind of you know going through your past your past projects and so I mean I as one of your former students I definitely get like your governess announcement geology that you laid out I was wondering though kind of like women ain't feminization and domestic labor and reproduction if there is a space in which to address filipino migrant man and masculinity kind of lived in that the sphere of reproduction and that kind of labor because of the way that you know for example microman or cement also it's like contribute to the reproduction of you know that class that you're talking about and then um so I have some other not so I'm thinking about masculinity and end production and also i was wondering if you thought about like cruise ships as another site in which to think about where feminine bodies and masculine migrant worker kind of me and also the way that that those elite folks from global cities are in the cruise ships where now there are a lot of filipino migrants working in tourism and as of the cabin cleaners and servers go on so there's about one piece and then also thinking about the infrastructure in philippines and what you talked about with regard to the militarization the former basis and so on I don't know if you're aware but like in a long before they also started building a ship building site whereas ship building is normally wet in Korea and so I think it's a hydrogen site that's right there in Subic Bay and so I'm guess I'm kind of wondering if you would be able to address like seafaring and should be as part of the infrastructure of globalization and all the sort of things that you're talking about even as I really appreciate what you've laid out for us in terms of like the funnest genealogy we don't I think I I think from the start I if you notice I don't talk about feminization I talk about global servitude and the fact that i'm not talking about subjects it has to me you know i was motivated precisely by this by this inordinate attention to women you know and I'm really you know this is a this is in the fact that i'm talking about rhythmically coordinated capacities means that i am not talking about gendered subjects I'm talking about the disaggregation and coordination of many capacities so which is all to say that I don't see this through the rubric of feminization of they were serving to me is not feminization of labor I mean you can say feminization of labor if you understand the business and rock women's work it is what's it about what's denigrating a servitude which is not gendered and as women's were in the global in the global arena so all the examples that I gave you if you know people watch your car boys you know this masculine movies all around that's all are the global servitude Australia focus origin that's very important to me it's very important for me to signal you know that what I'm talking about isn't encapsulated by anything like women's work or anything you know so when I was talking about media mediatic capacities in uber these are drivers their men their women so this isn't the level at which I am looking at any of this at the level of subjects so so which is to say that actually I do know about along boy i right about this military basis and the way that they become platforms for investment and there is manufacturing and there's all kinds of investment that's going on infrastructure building who's building these buildings who's building entire you know of condominiums hotels ships whatever they are there's plenty of infrastructure building and it is not compliant to women it's going to bind whole array of workers because but to me that the way to see these is not to see it through the category of labor that's what I said from the outset if we think about it through the category of labor than we think about it through subjects you know I mean at least in that kind of way that we think about labor as being subjects who do work subjects from whom who can alienate their labor power and build things so what I was really looking at is these capacities all kinds of capacities that are displayed and so also not to think about their seafarers there are but seafarers are connected to domestic workers are connected to the people back home who have no jobs it's the elastic skins among all of these different peoples who are kin extended whatever you know their social networks that are interested me and those to me are vital platforms that's why I have moved away from the language flavor to talk about I wasn't trying to say that I didn't see that referring to like drivers and so on and so I appreciate like you allowed very funny but the sea is a very important part of this which I haven't fully developed but it is the relationship between liquidity and these scenes that are Traverse and these islands right this whole paradigm to me is really worthy of expa for other exploration your own work on your own work on masculine up on semen right on see carers I think is an important part of such a project in which we understand the kinds of infrastructure shipping is infrastructure shipping is what brings one thing to another place it's you know when you make when you do shipping you that these are channels for exchanges these are channels for bringing things to one place to another they're very much part of this super organization that goes across the seas but the Seas also where there are no borders there's nothing to hang on to also the site of extreme dispossession and the refugees right now those people who are crossing the Seas this becomes kind of the fate of where people are jettisoned jettisoned because they are not part of this paulina prieto urban world which is about privilege dwelling rather than life subleased to get rich but when you feel you can see ya thank you very much for that very fascinating that a talk and still try to wrap my head around so the concepts you've been using in the pointing and one question that I did want to ask you down most of them hear them near your conclusion when you talk about high pass and SSP reckful concept and a sort of critical intervention into some of the the language of posthumanism that's that certainly they and how that kind of that critical consumption of the posthuman is so underhand by these long you often invisible social networks that are not accounted for in that realization and so my question really gots to I am thinking about what might be I'd taken in accounting for these and often this sort of considerate of other of this critical than the critical rhetoric the posthuman and the nonhuman to some extent and in terms of for instance the way in a lot of Marxist some reporting to dealers on the use of accelerate acceleration is msn as a concept and how that seems to sort of privilege a certain confound notion of Labor in the developed world without the way accounting for them how that's underpinned by these larger global transaction social networks and what might it look like could we think something like the concept of very those molded to their heart categories concept with the multitude when it's not centered on when when you / them went for instance them the model of Hubert ization accounts for them the what that looks like outside and say is the the Imperial center very different unethical I guess what I'm trying to do is not to you know supplement what was excluded I'm not trying to say oh this history posthumanism you know just didn't exclude the rest of the world would you do what you did but but I don't think that that's the point at which I want to stay yeah I want to say that there is a political cost to that there's a political cost in in terms of trying to explain how we got here you know what this here is and what it consists of right and so in thinking about vital platforms what I'm trying to point to is the political importance and X surplus of the surplus that this disposable populations and what becomes fodder for the liquidity that becomes the basis for the accumulation of astronomical value in the current you know I mean on a scale that people just don't even have the mathematical abilities to imagine right that that it is also driven by these intense creativity and intense that dynamism that is which is the means of reproduction of this entire city everywhere right so vital platforms becomes not so much like this excluded thing it included I mean the thing about the thing about goober urbanization is that it doesn't depend on it depends on deep inclusion that all kinds of economic policies are about the deep inclusion of the unbanked and the poor that all of these technologies are about mopping up all the liquid left terms of everybody and no one will be apart from this but when you see it from that side what you're seeing is a technologically driven view of capital as a motor force but you don't see that what has also depended on and what it still depends on is something that it cannot fully contain that there is the potential of antagonism and assault thats everywhere which is why this why were in such a crazy world because you know all these refugees all of the all of these excess of you know the they can't control all of the possibilities of this liquidity which can take an assaulted form at any given moment right but it's not just an assaulted form as a feminist I want to point out both nism but also the possibilities of you know what future life or what life could be like or what life is like now the life that is for survival the life that that people generally precisely so that they can survive that it is that it is inventing ways of living that we should be paying attention to instead of saying lamenting the death of the liberal humanist subject to the death of whatever you know that these have long been a site of creative but it's always denigrated always set to the side and always abandoned and seen as a site of nature and that's how capitalism in the current moment reinvents itself because it doesn't have to pay attention to the social reproduction of any of these populations they just go and you know and they then always of for producing themselves but then it comes in and subsumes that social reproduction you have like vitality it does seem to like produce a very different conception of how we might imagine futurity as it otis to futurity and the standard language of posthuman it- lead us to imagine the present and the past it might need us to be able to think differently about you know this is a perceptual exercise this is an exercise in seeing the world differently now and different from what and the stories we tell about it that have you know that hamper us from figuring a way out does an amazing top incredibly rich I'm curious to hear you say a little bit more directly about liquidity refer to a constellation in the Q&A as well I think I'm learned from Perico dr. young pair of think of liquidity as a capacity of the powerful right they are able to reinvent themselves and we situate themselves and deal with any crisis by being this is liquid and illiquidity is the burden of the less powerful and the less wealthy but you're describing global server genus having a a as having a pretty name so then having being so yeah it's like just a little bit for your weekly to your first of the convertibility of things convertibility into cash that convertibility of assets into cash the speed in which a new so what I'm talking about liquidity I am also talking about the way people are these fast transactions but at the level of petty cash so there is a quitting you know there's a there's about the scale and magnitude is important here I mean the liquidity that Karen how is talking about you know the liquidity the hedge fund managers manage center these are enormous aggregates enormous assets right we're talking you know as I said entire populations so liquidity to me is the mode in which people transact you know on a daily basis to survive often sometimes trading their own lives for a little cash so that they can get another day of life so there are these ways that you are trading in currencies but the currencies aren't all the hard currencies of dollars and national currencies the currencies could be many kinds of things could be your time your body or your you know your sisters whatever your butt right there are many currencies that are being that are being converted constantly or leverage or you know as it said there is something if you look at what the studies of slums you can see all the evidence of the benefit and realization there long before you know any of this financialization of life under neoliberalism it's like that's the way that people live you know the way that they transacted anything was convertible you could you could make lots of conversion so to me liquidity refers to this speed of conversions right that is going on now at the top level a financial level you know you have scale you have speed that that's like of another magnitude as well and you have hard currencies we're talking about you know again they're in be the dollar right these are hard currencies that can store value they are the measure of soft currencies can never hold value they they are liquid precisely to the except that they are never the general equivalents they can't serve as the measure other values they can only they can only result in what Mark scoffs the dead end of exchange the dead end of you know once you pay your cash etc so dead end consumption which is the consumption of your life consumption of your time etc so liquidity to me doesn't belong to straddle it doesn't it's not a characteristic of classes it is a phenomenon which capitalist Valerie depends rather than on the manufacture of things mercy that's still a hard helpful yeah I would have my time nobody else
